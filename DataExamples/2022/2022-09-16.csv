How the skin heals determines how bright and of course how correct the tattoo looks. But worry not: all you need are a few tips and products to ensure a quick complete rebound.

We summoned some advice from Carl Kuo owner of Mission Ink Tattoo and Piercing in San Francisco. He offers ways to build habits that will preserve the ink’s color for years to come.

STEP 1: BANDAGE IT & let it heal

Pang

While each artist has a preferred method of covering fresh ink Kuo says that recovery is fastest with an ointment wrap — specifically Saniderm or 3M’s Tegaderm. “Leave it on for three to five days” he says. “You can shower with it but remove the wrapping if irritation develops at the edges of the wrap.” In addition avoid tight clothes and itching or scratching. If you follow these directions your skin should fully recover in under two weeks.

According to one of the largest global employee surveys one in five workers plan to quit their jobs this year. Asked what motivates them to change jobs being able to choose when and where to work were ranked very important by 50 percent and 47 percent of respondents respectively.

Yet we’re seeing major companies pushing for compulsory office return policies despite 56 percent of employees in Asia-Pacific making it clear that flexible work options even beyond the pandemic is in demand for sustained productivity.

Admittedly I was worried when the pandemic first hit. How were we at 3M going to brainstorm and collaborate on projects if we aren’t in the same room? Was the quality of our work going to suffer? Instead our teams came together like never before. Deadlines were met work goals were achieved and we remained as collaborative as ever.

In fact studies have shown that businesses that embraced virtual work were even more productive. In the Philippines nine out of 10 professionals noted an increased level of productivity while working from home with more than 90 percent of them seeking additional work-from-home arrangements moving forward signaling its growing role in job satisfaction.

The pandemic has demonstrated that employees could be just as productive and successful outside of office confines. It has also taught us to focus on quality of output instead of hours spent in the office. Most importantly it has taught us the need to trust employees to deliver their best work regardless of their way of working and the importance of communicating that trust. This trust will pay off. Research shows that trust builds employee engagement and well-being boosting business and performance outcomes.

Leadership calls for flexibility and adaptability. As such we should find ways to create “moments that matter” regardless of whether our teams are working onsite or remotely.

This means strategically planning valuable personal and professional interactions be it virtually or in-person and this will look different depending on each team’s size work arrangements preferences and personalities. It may include performance reviews celebrating key milestones team building activities and many more. While these moments may not need to be in-person it’s important for those involved to discuss how to recognize them in an effective and meaningful way.

I thus take the time to meet and collaborate in-person with my team in Korea where I’m based. To continue building rapport with the wider Asia-Pacific region which is also within my area of responsibility I hold regular regional town halls and dialogue sessions. Some of us leaders also started regular virtual meetings with different teams. As a result we have had much more face-time with team members we previously would have not met and hearing these different perspectives have in turn helped us lead better.

Many naysayers of flexible and remote work often bring up the difficulty of virtual onboarding for new talent. Helping them pick up your organization’s work software procedures and team culture can be challenging—doing it entirely online adds another layer of complexity. Organizations must figure out effective onboarding procedures to help new employees adapt quickly even if they choose to work remotely. This can be in the form of comprehensive employee guides videos and scheduling both formal and informal meetings with team members.

When managed well allowing employees to choose how they want to work should not affect business continuity. Flexible work should also go beyond shift A or B—employees should have the freedom to decide when to come in. Besides 3M other companies are allowing employees to choose how when and where they work.

Offering trust-based flexible models of working is the way forward. It is how we can continue to retain talent from younger workers to working parents. Juggling work and parenting is notoriously challenging. With 3M’s new working model parents can better plan their work around child care allowing them to enjoy parenthood without sacrificing career development.

Flexible work programs need not stop at the corporate office. Rolling out flexible work arrangements for plant employees is more challenging. While they will have to continue working onsite due to the nature of the work production plant workers at 3M are offered other forms of flexibility such as flexible start and stop times or shift swapping. We’ve seen great results from the launch of our new work model. As many as 90 percent of our employees across our global organization reported feeling supported in a survey conducted recently.

Instead of focusing on getting our employees back in the office let’s find more ways to empower them to work in ways that boost their productivity.

Abbott sends 50 migrants to VP Harris' home,"Abbott also sent two buses of migrants to her residence on Thursday.

Fifty more migrants arrived outside Vice President Kamala Harris's residence in Washington D.C. on Saturday days after two buses carrying asylum seekers arrived at her Naval Observatory home from Texas earlier this week.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's Press Secretary Renae Eze confirms to ABC News 50 migrants were dropped off at the Vice President's Naval Observatory residence Saturday after a long bus ride from Texas.

Abbott said he sent two buses of migrants to Harris's residence on Thursday.

""We're sending migrants to her backyard to call on the Biden Administration to do its job & secure the border"" he tweeted at the time.

Abbott and other Republican leaders from border states have been sending migrants to Democratic-led cities for months calling it a protest of President Joe Biden's immigration policies amid an influx of migrants at the southern border.

Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis escalated the scheme this week by dropping off approximately 100 migrants outside Harris's Washington home and on Martha's Vineyard the island just south of Cape Cod where former President Barack Obama has a residence.

The moves sparked national attention and outrage from the White House and Democrats who said the lawmakers were using migrants as political pawns. Republicans have cheered the move arguing the Biden administration should do more to secure the border.

Some Democratic lawmakers said they received no prior warning the migrants were going to be arriving.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the state has since offered voluntary transportation of the migrants off of Martha's Vineyard to a temporary shelter at Joint Base Cape Cod.

One Venezuelan immigrant Victor told ABC News' Armando Garcia that he was there when someone was asking migrants to sign their name on a list to get a seat on the plane. He did not sign up because the offer sounded too suspicious and because it did not align with his plans to eventually get to New York City.

Victor said he feels for the people that were duped into taking those flights but he understands why they took that risk.

""It's complicated because they tell you you'll have everything you want but when they arrived people were basically lost"" he said.

The White House said FEMA administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate available federal support but have largely dodged questions on how to improve the immigration system -- stating they inherited a broken process from the Trump administration.

President Joe Biden criticized the migrant drop-offs as ""simply wrong.""

""It's un-American it's reckless and we have a process in place to manage migrants at the border"" he said at a gala for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ""We're working on making sure it's safe and orderly and humane. Republican officials should not interfere with that process by waging these political stunts.""

DeSantis on Friday also said more migrant drop-offs were coming.

""I have $12 million for us to use and so we are going to use it and you're gonna see more and more. I'm going to make sure that we exhaust all those funds"" he said at a press conference.

Editor’s Note: A previous version of the story said that the migrant buses came from El Paso. The governor's office later clarified that the migrant buses to the vice president’s residence were sent from Texas but not El Paso.

But Brunson had another idea. “She was just short of [saying] ‘Oh hell no!’” Ralph says. “She said ‘We need a queen for Barbara Howard. And you are that queen!’ And I was just like ‘Baby if you put it that way How do I say no? What else do I need to know about that? I’m going to be the queen. I love it. Yes I’m ready.’”

Janelle James wound up being cast as Ava and landed an Emmy nomination this year for the role. But tapping Ralph to play Barbara the no-nonsense seen-it-all veteran teacher in “Abbott Elementary” also turned out to be the right move. On Monday night Ralph was rewarded with an Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series.

COVER STORY: Quinta Brunson on Winning Emmys With Sheryl Lee Ralph Why ‘Abbott Elementary’ Wasn’t Ready to Be Named Best Comedy Yet and Changing the Stakes in Season 2

“I am on another planet” Ralph tells Variety on Tuesday morning just hours after her win. She’s still in her same hairdo from Emmy night including the sparkling jewels that adorned her head. The reality of the TV honor is just now hitting her.

“I think I’m on the planet 999” she says. “I feel like I’m just still floating up there. Like I’m having an out of body experience. I know something has happened because the glitter has come off of my face. But the response has been crazy. My husband and I were in the hotel and he got up and he turned on the TV. And I opened my eyes. And first of all there was Emmy right by the bedside. But I could hear these reporters talking about me. I could hear myself singing as they were talking. And I was like ‘What happened in the past 12 hours?’ Everything happened.”

Ralph’s acceptance speech was one of the night’s most memorable as the one-time Tony nominee (“Dreamgirls”) opened by singing Dianne Reeves’ “Endangered Species.” Ralph is just the second Black woman to win supporting actress in a comedy series. Jackée Harry was the first in 1987 for her role on “227.”

“Jackée tweeted at me” Ralph says. “I was like ‘Girl you should have just called me!’ Who knew that that role of hers in ‘227’ that the network wanted me. Maybe I just completely forgot all about that. But she was just like ‘No they wanted her for the role but I got it and I won the Emmy. Now she’s got her own.’ That’s right! I got my own. But I’m just feeling like thank you god. Thank you.”

Ralph’s mother is from Jamaica and she spent much time there in her youth. Ralph says she immediately heard about celebrations in the island nation after her win. “Jamaica lost its mind last night” she says. “It was as if for a moment there I was Usain Bolt. It was crazy. The past prime minister was calling me the minister of arts and culture. I couldn’t answer their phone calls. But I did get the texts. I mean it was too crazy. And now when I go back for Heroes Weekend I will be ‘The Honorable Sheryl Lee Ralph Order of Jamaica.’”

Dan Doperalski for Variety

Variety spoke to Ralph and “Abbott Elementary” creator/star Quinta Brunson at the Warner Bros. lot’s commissary executive dining room as they were both still a bit bleary-eyed and hoarse from the Emmy celebration the night before. Not only did both stars win trophies but they immediately took part in a photo shoot for this week’s issue of Variety magazine.

“Sheryl comes in and lights up our set every morning and the people who have their day made by her being so wonderful are going to just feel so happy that she won” Brunson says.

There’s no rest for either however as the cast and crew of “Abbott Elementary” are already back to work with a table read and the start of production on a new episode later that day.

“’Abbott’ takes no tea for the fever” Ralph says. “’Abbott’ was like we don’t care you won an Emmy last night there’s work today! Bring yourself here today for work! There are no days off no time off. Let’s get back to the work of making America’s new favorite TV show.”

Ralph’s Emmy win came following a busy weekend that also included being recognized by the Creative Coalition at its annual Television Humanitarian Awards luncheon. Besides “Dreamgirls” and the resulting Tony nomination the star’s tremendous career includes “Search for Tomorrow” “It’s a Living” “Moesha” and an Independent Spirit Award in 1990 for the film “To Sleep With Anger.”

But now her “Abbott Elementary” role has won her a new generation of fans — and an Emmy.

“[The character of] Barbara Howard has been an incredible gift for me” she says. “And the interesting thing about playing the role is I did not think I would be seen. I thought it would be around me. And I was going to be there to give support. And then when people started to see things I was just like ‘What the hell is happening?’”

Ralph says the best direction she got in playing Barbara was “do nothing.” It’s the silent strength of Barbara — a character who sometimes says everything with just a look — that has made her a key part of the show’s success.

“I was like ‘OK I’m a very accomplished actress I can do stuff.’ It’s the strangest thing [but] it was the absolute perfect direction” Ralph says. “I really try to keep that in mind every time Barbara comes to life. Just bring it down. Just deliver it. And so many teachers oh my god the way they’ve been responding to the character. They say they feel seen. They feel respected.”

The hardest part of playing Barbara? “I’ve had to embrace sweater sets which has been quite a journey” she laughs. “I’ve had to really release the need for hair. She is the second or third character that I’ve played that is in the short hair style. And pearls. She’s a ‘clutching the pearls’ kind of woman. I’m enjoying the gift of Barbara Howard.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcmUtZGVzYW50aXMtYWJib3R0LWJyZWFraW5nLWh1bWFuLXRyYWZmaWNraW5nLWxhd3Mtc2VuZGluZy1taWdyYW50cy1ibHVlLXN0YXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are DeSantis and Abbott Breaking Human Trafficking Laws by Sending Migrants to Blue States?,"Critics are slamming Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott for transporting migrants from their home states to liberal areas in an effort to make a point about the Biden administration's border policies. But as criticism continues to swirl some are suggesting the moves could flout human trafficking laws.

Earlier this week Florida Gov. DeSantis announced he had sent two planes of migrants to Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts. On Thursday Texas Gov. Abbott claimed responsibility for a similar stunt in which two buses of migrants arrived at the US Naval Observatory — Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington D.C. and others arrived in Chicago.

Now some are questioning the tactics used to get the migrants to leave with NPR reporting that the migrants flown to Martha's Vineyard were told they were traveling to Boston and lured into boarding the plane with promises of expedited work papers.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker a Democrat said on Wednesday that state authorities were looking into whether there was any ""criminal liability"" involved in the transport of migrants to Chicago deeming the transport a political ""stunt.""

""I'm not going to mince words here: The governor of Texas is forcing on New York and D.C. and Chicago and potentially other places a needlessly last minute and complex process that is a heartless display of politics over people"" Pritzker said the Chicago-Tribune reports. ""Why not give reasonable notice? Why send these folks only to blue cities or blue states? Why isn't Abbott sending refugees to Mississippi or Oklahoma or Idaho? This is about politics for him.""

While Abbott's office told the Tribune the migrants had signed waivers indicating they were willingly boarding the buses Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she believed ""that they have been misled and the only option for them that they've been presented to by the folks in Texas is a free bus ride because they're not providing any other option.""

Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty

Pritzer echoed those concerns saying ""We are still examining and interviewing the folks who have come to Illinois and listening to their stories about whether or not they willingly got on these buses knew where they were going were given the information"" the Tribune reports.

DeSantis' office told CNN in a statement that he sent the migrants out of Florida because they could be better taken care of elsewhere.

""States like Massachusetts New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as 'sanctuary states' and support for the Biden Administration's open border policies"" the statement read.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9kaWQtZGVzYW50aXMtYWJib3R0LWJyZWFrLWxhdy1taWdyYW50LXN0dW50LWV4cGVydHMtd2VpZ2gtMTc0MzkxMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did DeSantis and Abbott Break Law with Migrant 'Stunt'?

For BMS the layoffs are tied to a recent acquisition.

In separate Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) alerts filed this week AbbVie and BMS let California know they plan to lay off 99 and 261 employees respectively in November.

AbbVie’s workers are being let go from a single facility in Irvine which the city’s chamber of commerce lists as an Allergan manufacturing site. AbbVie bought Allergan for $63 billion back in 2019.

AbbVie did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma’s request for comment on the layoffs.

Moving down the coast BMS’ workforce is shrinking across two separate sites in San Diego County one of which bears the same address as Turning Point Therapeutics’ home base. BMS snapped up cancer specialist Turning Point for $4.1 billion in August.

A BMS spokesperson confirmed over email that the slim-down relates to that deal. All told 261 staffers are being let go in connection with the acquisition.

“We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics to further strengthen our leading oncology franchise” BMS’ spokesperson said. “As part of the integration all incoming employees received retention packages tied to continued service to BMS for a period of time and have been encouraged to apply to long-term roles at BMS after their retention period ends.”

Alongside the biotech industry which has suffered a spate of layoffs and restructurings this year employees at Big Pharmas have been caught in recent job-cut crossfire too.

In July reports surfaced that Biogen employed around 300 fewer people in Massachusetts than it had in September 2021. Biogen telegraphed the job cuts in March when it rolled out plans to “substantially eliminate” the commercial infrastructure for its struggling Alzheimer’s disease drug Aduhelm. Altogether the company has laid out a cost-saving target of $1 billion.

Back out west Teva Pharmaceutical is downsizing in The Golden State too. Last month the Israeli-American generics giant said it would eliminate 305 jobs at its Irvine injectables plant—located in the same city where AbbVie’s workers are set to be dismissed.

A Teva spokesperson ultimately confirmed that the “Irvine facility will not resume production and the company is either transferring or ceasing production of medicines made at the site.”

But the layoffs underway at Novartis easily eclipse all of those other cuts. The company in June unveiled plans to ax 8000 jobs worldwide on a quest to save $1 billion. During a media event in Zurich last month the Swiss pharma added that of the 1400 jobs it plans to cut in its home country up to half will be leadership roles.

Bristol Myers plans to cut up to 261 jobs in two different locations in San Diego according to the filings. A Bristol Myers spokesperson said the job cuts follow the company's $4.1 billion acquisition of drug developer Turning Point Therapeutics which closed in August.

""All incoming employees received retention packages tied to continued service to BMS for a period of time and have been encouraged to apply to long-term roles at BMS after their retention period ends"" the spokesperson said in an email.

Separately AbbVie plans to cut up to 99 jobs in Irvine Calif. the company told the state. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

The job cuts were previously reported by Endpoints News.

Accenture has announced its intention to acquire an Italian center of excellence from automotive giant Stellantis in a move that would bolster its manufacturing and operations practices.

The center of excellence which is known internally as the World Class Manufacturing Training & Consulting business is a unit that for over two decades has advised and supported internal teams within Stellantis (formerly Fiat) on optimising and streamlining their operations.

The center of excellence also has an external focus and has built a track record supporting companies in the aerospace defense automotive consumer goods and heavy industry sectors with their manufacturing endeavours.

On the back of its work the World Class Manufacturing Training & Consulting business has developed an award-winning methodology for production excellence. The approach is based on ten specific areas of the production system – safety cost deployment focused improvement autonomous maintenance and workplace organisation maintenance quality control logistic and customer service early product and equipment management environment and people development.

“This acquisition would allow Accenture to integrate the team and methodology into our manufacturing division” said Mauro Macchi Market Unit Lead for Accenture in Italy.

“We help our manufacturing clients digitally transform business processes to maintain business continuity achieve growth and become more sustainable. Their team will bolster our capabilities in this area by bringing a certified methodology and over 30000 best practices to Accenture that can help our clients achieve tangible benefits faster.”

Completion of the acquisition is still subject to approvals within Stellantis and customary closing conditions.

If green lighted the deal would be Accenture’s first in Italy this year. In 2021 the consulting and technology giant closed two deals: SAP specialist Ethica Consulting Group and ecommerce specialist Openmind.

Formed in 2021 by the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group Stellantis is currently the world’s fifth largest automaker behind Toyota Volkswagen Hyundai and General Motors. The group owns sixteen brands including Alfa Romeo Chrysler Citroën Dodge Fiat Jeep Lancia Maserati Opel Peugeot and Vauxhall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JlZWxpbmUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1leHBlcmllbmNlLWdpdmluZy1leHRlbmRlZC13b3JrZXJzLWZ1bGwtY29udHJvbC1vdmVyLXBlcnNvbmFsLWRhdGEtMzAxNjI2MTAyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beeline Announces New Experience Giving Extended Workers Full Control Over Personal Data,"New experience for contingent talent puts worker privacy front and center and allows companies to better meet DEI goals

JACKSONVILLE Fla. Sept. 16 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Beeline the independent leader in software solutions for sourcing and managing the global extended workforce today announced an upcoming talent experience which will enable contingent workers to create a private account and take full control of how they are represented in the workforce allowing them to self-report and maintain their own PII (personally identifiable information). Beeline will be the first and only Extended Workforce Platform to offer contingent workers a private account with this level of autonomy and privacy control.

""Talent is central to the extended workforce and individual privacy is paramount in the workplace. Our new experience will enable talent to take an active role in the process and trust that their data is protected"" said Colleen Tiner SVP Product Strategy of Beeline. ""Additionally establishing this trusted relationship directly with workers increases the accuracy of data collected which means companies can truly measure and understand diversity in the context of their recruitment process and active workforce.""

Mark Farmer External Talent Lead Accenture said ""The new talent-focused experience addresses the challenges of increased data privacy regulations and gives that control to the rightful owner the talent.""

Historically vendor management systems (VMS) have put the burden of managing talent information on staffing companies as part of the sourcing process. With new privacy regulations underway suppliers and MSPs need a solution that relieves them of the burden and risk of inputting the information while improving the reliability of the data without disrupting the supplier-candidate relationship.

""As the leading provider of workforce solutions AGS applauds Beeline's initiative to build and host the tools needed for talent to opt-in and provide data for safe-keeping thereby removing any risks for us as we continue to help clients deliver on the personal and business imperative of achieving their DEI goals"" said Cory Hansen Regional Vice President North America Allegis Global Solutions (AGS).

""Beeline's new talent experience is a huge step forward in accurately managing diversity metrics. I spent 15 years on the client side using multiple VMS systems and was never able to provide conclusive demographics around our non-employees due to concerns around co-employment"" said Dan Khublall Director Product Strategy Beeline. ""I am excited to see our clients leverage this information to gain transparency and shape hiring manager behavior which ultimately impacts the company's diversity footprint.""

The new experience will continue to be tested with select clients and partners throughout this year leading to an official launch in 2023. Once launched Beeline will introduce the industry's first diversity talent index in partnership with Consciously Unbiased.

According to CIO.com’s State of the CIO 2022 report 35% of IT leaders say that data and business analytics will drive the most IT investment at their organization this year and 58% say their involvement with data analysis will increase over the next year.

While data comes in many forms perhaps the largest pool of untapped data consists of text. Patents product specifications academic publications market research news not to mention social feeds all have text as a primary component and the volume of text is constantly growing. According to Foundry’s Data and Analytics Study 2022 36% of IT leaders consider managing this unstructured data to be one of their biggest challenges. That’s why research firm Lux Research says natural language processing (NLP) technologies and specifically topic modeling is becoming a key tool for unlocking the value of data.

NLP is the branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with training a computer to understand process and generate language. Search engines machine translation services and voice assistants are all powered by NLP. Topic modeling for example is an NLP technique that breaks down an idea into subcategories of commonly occurring concepts defined by groupings of words. According to Lux Research topic modeling enables organizations to associate documents with specific topics and then extract data such as the growth trend of a topic over time. Topic modeling can also be used to establish a “fingerprint” for a given document and then discover other documents with similar fingerprints.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZC5jb20vbW92aWUtdGhlYXRlci1ndWlkZXMvY2hhcmxvdHRlLW1vdmllLXRoZWF0ZXJzLWEtY29tcGxldGUtZ3VpZGUtNjEwMTcxMzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charlotte Movie Theaters: A Complete Guide (2022/09/16)- Tickets to Movies in Theaters Broadway Shows London ...,"It’s time to go to the movies and enjoy all the latest new movie releases out now in theatres!

Charlotte Movie Theaters: AMC Carolina Pavilion 22

Going to the movies can be one of the most relaxing things you can do after a long week at work. This is where the AMC Carolina Pavilion 22 comes into play. Located in South Charlotte after getting finished with your movie you can head on over across the parking lot to get some shopping done at the local Target or directly behind the theater at Carters childrens clothing store. If you think about it this could be the best of both worlds for any family.

AMC Carolina Pavilion 22 is one of the few theaters in Charlotte that offers closed captions. They also offer open cations (subtitles on screen) as an option for those that need them to enjoy their favorite stars on screen. There are sensory friendly film selections and of course their signature MacGuffins bar.

Charlotte Movie Theaters: AMC Northlake 14

AMC started out in the early 20th century when Maurice Edward and Barney Dubinsky purchased the Regent Theatre in Kansas City Mo. Now after over 20 years the company has gone on to open approximately 1000 theaters and 11000 screens across the globe. It’s safe to say that a good number of those are probably attached to a mall. Being attached to a mall is not only good for the mall but especially the theater. It allows guests to go somewhere to relax after a long day of shopping. But don’t get us wrong just because they’re in a mall doesn’t mean you won’t get a state of the art movie going experience complete with IMAX!

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Freddy Flu (@snakedoc142)

As with the previous AMC AMC Northlake 14 offers many of the same features including premium motorized leather reclining seats that offer the guests on a date or out on a family outing one of the best ways to enjoy a show. Just please don’t fall asleep we wouldn’t want you to miss the best parts of the movie.

One of the things AMC does best is their premium selection of concessions. You can enjoy anything from a hot dog to pizza; a hamburger and fries to the traditional nachos. However one of the best things to get is still going to be the big ole bucket of popcorn. There is nothing like going to the cinema buying popcorn a soda and then just sitting back and enjoying all that AMC and Hollywood have to offer.

Charlotte Movie Theaters: AMC Park Terrace 6

Being in the heart of Charlotte NC is one of the best things AMC Park Terrace 6 has to offer but it isn’t the only thing. Throughout the summer having seats that heat up may seem like a silly fad that will never be useful. That is until you get to the fall and winter months. Having heated seats now no longer seems silly but a much welcome gift for your tush!

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Robin Blackburn (@gottarun472)

Theaters in general are always trying to find new ways to draw in the crowds and one of the best ways is by allowing guests to wear costumes with exceptions to their favorite movie premieres. Another way to do this is by hosting cosplayers in full costume doing L.A.R.P. in the lobby or in the auditorium of their favorite movies. This is something that AMC Park Terrace has done in the past to great result during the latest host of Star Wars films.

One of the biggest hurdles for moviegoers isn’t so much the lack of films coming to theaters lately or the events of recent years. No. One big hurdle is the cost of tickets and like most AMC theaters AMC Park Terrace 6 offers their guests discounted matinees as well as discounted tickets for Tuesdays. Along with this you can also rent out an entire auditorium if you want to provide your employees or family and friends a truly unique experience at a reasonable price.

Charlotte Movie Theaters: Regal Starlight – Charlotte

Regal is one of the leading theaters in the business with their RPX technology being one that many consumers keep flocking back to. This technology offers the ultimate in movie theater sight and sound. As a former projection manager for Regal back when the only sound options were Dolby DTS and SDDS we had to rely on turning up the volume when guests wanted a better sound experience. Now with technology here guests get the best experience without inconveniencing because they need it at their preferred volume level.

Regal Starlight – Charlotte offers guests with little ones the option of throwing their precious mini me’s birthday party in their party room before screening one of their favorite movies. Many theaters offer this as a perk at Regal Starlight – Charlotte you can have a party host from the theater help you from start to finish.

Retail sales volumes dropped by 1.6 per cent in monthly terms in August the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said – the biggest fall since December 2021 and worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a 0.5-per-cent fall.

The data are likely to add to worries about the strength of demand in Britain’s economy.

United Kingdom (UK) fashion retailers Primark and ASOS and online supermarket Ocado Retail have all warned about their profits this month.

The pound slid further towards USD1.14 on the back of the data.

“With a difficult winter to come it will come as a worry to retailers that shoppers have already reigned in their spending despite the hot summer” said retail lead at Accenture Lynda Petherick.

All of the main retail sectors – food stores non-food stores non-store retailing and fuel – fell over the month for the first time since July 2021 when COVID-19 restrictions on hospitality were lifted the ONS said.

The period of mourning following the death of Queen Elizabeth poses another challenge to retailers with widespread business closures due on Monday to mark the queen’s funeral.

“The sombre atmosphere in the UK this week and news of slow economic growth will be adding to the sense of concern among retailers as the weather gets colder” Petherick said.

Although inflation dipped below 10 per cent last month households are still grappling with the biggest price increases since the early 1980s caused mostly by surging energy prices in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The ONS said people cut back on furniture purchases last month.

That rivalry ended on Thursday when Adobe announced that it has struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Figma.

The acquisition will allow Adobe to incorporate Figma’s popular design tools into its widely-used portfolio of creative apps. But the acquisition also means that Adobe will once again be taking a major competitor off the market and bringing it under its own umbrella to the dismay of many designers who rely on the tool and are wary of another critical platform joining the company’s Creative Cloud service. And they have a point: with Figma off the market the list of companies capable of challenging Adobe’s empire just got meaningfully smaller.

The Figma team will have “complete autonomy”

Adobe says the current plan is essentially for nothing to change. “I think that acquisitions are only done well when they’re done uniquely based on the company and that you never follow a playbook” Scott Belsky Adobe’s chief product officer and EVP of Creative Cloud said in an interview with The Verge. Belsky says the Figma team will have “complete autonomy.”

Figma’s independence is a point they have been underscoring repeatedly; a LinkedIn post from Belsky and a blog post from Figma CEO Dylan Field both mentioned that the plan is for Figma to continue operating autonomously. “The last thing that anyone wants is to disrupt either one of our roadmaps” Belsky said. That means no plans to bring Figma inside of Creative Cloud and no changes to Figma’s pricing according to Belsky.

If anything the earliest changes might be on Adobe’s side. Adobe has been winding down its investment in Adobe XD its competing design platform for things like apps and websites and XD users could be nudged over to Figma in the future according to Belsky. “It was never because we didn’t think product design and development and this vertically integrated stack was a big opportunity” he said. Right now Adobe has a “tiny team” supporting XD for its existing customers. “Once [the acquisition] closes then we’ll figure out how to serve those customers likely with Figma” he said.

Field knows that they have to earn customers’ trust. “We have to establish that trust for Adobe and for Figma by being really consistent over time around what we do the actions we’re taking and showing up for the community and doing what’s right here.”

Adobe has a history of buying up some of the biggest tools in the creative space acquiring companies like Frame.io a video production collaboration tool and Behance which lets people showcase their creative work. (Belsky first joined Adobe through this acquisition.) The company has bought a lot of companies — even Photoshop was an acquisition. That makes the Figma purchase all the more concerning for designers; one of the few notable challengers to Adobe has been swept up meaning Adobe will continue to consolidate creative app power in one location.

The purchase isn’t necessarily an antitrust concern but it could still fall under scrutiny by regulators. “It certainly looks like Adobe is in a dominant market position and this acquisition would increase that dominance” Matt Kent a competition policy advocate for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen said in an interview. But just because Adobe is big doesn’t necessarily mean that the merger violates the law he said.

“Any developers in that community being acquired by Adobe will likely be stifled”

Competing developers had mixed views on the acquisition. Affinity which offers its own suite of creative software thinks the acquisition could reduce innovation in the creative app space. “Any developers in that community being acquired by Adobe will likely be stifled as their objectives are realigned to what’s good for Adobe. Ultimately that can only reduce the choice available for creatives” Ashley Hewson managing director of Affinity developer Serif said in an emailed statement.

Alludo which makes the Corel suite of tools took a more positive tone. “While we don’t have a specific comment on Adobe’s news this move is definitely validating in terms of what we’ve believed for many years now — collaboration tools are critical in the design world” Prashant Ketkar CTO and CPO of Alludo said in an emailed statement. “We expect this movement will only gain momentum.”

Adobe’s also making this acquisition during a time when the regulatory bodies are getting more serious about cracking down on big tech mergers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed to block Meta’s acquisition of the company behind VR fitness app Supernatural in July for example and sued to block Nvidia’s now-scrapped acquisition of Arm in November. FTC spokesperson Betsy Lordan said the FTC doesn’t comment on proposed transactions and Department of Justice spokesperson Arlen Morales declined to comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L2Fkb2Jlcy0yMC1iaWxsaW9uLWZpZ21hLWJ1eS10by1ib29zdC10b3AtbGluZS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe's $20 Billion Figma Buy To Boost Top Line Growth,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2022/09/16/adobes-20-billion-figma-buy-to-boost-top-line-growth/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L2Fkb2Jlcy0yMC1iaWxsaW9uLWZpZ21hLWJ1eS10by1ib29zdC10b3AtbGluZS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9hZG9iZS1tYWtlcy0yMGItYmV0LW9uLWEtY29sbGFib3JhdGl2ZS1mdXR1cmUtd2l0aC1maWdtYS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe makes $20B bet on a collaborative future with Figma acquisition,"Prior to announcing its intent to buy Figma for $20 billion on Thursday Adobe’s largest deal was its $4.75 billion Marketo acquisition in 2018.

Why go so far outside of its pricing comfort zone and pay twice as much as Figma’s most recent private valuation? The easy answer is that it’s about taking a potential rival off the market. Yes Adobe XD is a similar product but there could be more to this deal than simply playing defense.

It could be that — like IBM buying Red Hat for $34 billion in 2018 or Salesforce acquiring Slack for almost $28 billion in 2020 — Adobe’s executive team saw a company that could fundamentally alter their organization.

For IBM the Red Hat acquisition was about the hybrid cloud. For Salesforce and Slack it was the digital workplace but both saw a shift coming in their markets and made a huge offer for a key company to get ahead of it. Both also kept those pieces independent with the existing CEO in place (more on this later).

Perhaps Adobe saw the Figma deal as its organization-altering moment as it watched the creative market making a key change from one centered on creating assets with tools like Photoshop and Illustrator to one firmly focused on the creators themselves and the collaborative nature of the design process.

The former is where Adobe has built the bulk of its business. The latter is represented by Figma a startup with visionary founders who wanted to change the way people thought about design in a digital context a change so important that the old-guard company was willing to overspend to grab the young upstart and bring the two ways of thinking together.

We spoke to folks from the companies involved Figma investors and industry analysts to get a sense of why this deal went down. The bottom line is that there were lots of reasons but perhaps the best one was that Figma and Adobe think they’ll be better together.

The vision thing

One of the primary reasons that Adobe turned its attention to Figma was because its founders CEO Dylan Field and CTO Evan Wallace had come up with a fresh way of thinking about the design process — and that vision had great value.

John Lilly a venture partner at Greylock met the Figma founders before their seed round circa 2013. He ended up investing in the fledgling startup’s Series A round in 2015 before it even had a product.

He said what stood out in the early meetings was the pair’s design knowledge their intelligence and their vision about where they wanted to take the company especially for guys who were in their early 20s at the time.

“Mostly it was Dylan and Evan their confidence and their love of design” Lilly told TechCrunch. “They were so design-native they could take lessons [about building] community that we’d learned over the last 20 years on the internet. My background is from Mozilla before Greylock and it’s all about community and community growth and Dylan could see that stuff and see those patterns and how to think about those in design.”

He said they began discussing how to take the notion of the developer community built around Github and apply that social coding idea to design. That collaborative and community element turned out to be a real differentiator for Figma.

In fact Gartner analyst Brent Stewart thinks that the platform Figma ultimately created has grown into the most essential design idea out there one that catapults Adobe from the creation tools business into collaborative design.

“With the purchase of Figma Adobe has acquired the single most important design tool on the planet (yes I mean that literally). The overwhelming majority of professionally designed and engineered digital products in the world began life in Figma” Stewart said.

“Prior to this acquisition Adobe’s Creative Cloud had become relegated to creative utility status dominated by age-old stalwart titles such as Photoshop and Illustrator that are capable only of incremental growth. Now after 12 years of fast-follower status in the digital product design platform category Adobe owns the market’s dominant platform as well as an emerging player in the visual collaboration market with FigJam” Figma’s online white-boarding tool.

Forrester analyst Sheila Mahoutchian agreed with Stewart’s assertion that the deal could be a transformative acquisition for Adobe if it handles it right. “The acquisition of Figma by Adobe represents a future-forward strategic move on Adobe’s part to stay adaptive and responsive to designer needs. Figma’s best-in-class collaboration workflow platform has changed the landscape for design tools moving the world of design from individual contributors to collaboration-based team enablement” she said.

Scott Belsky Adobe’s chief product officer and executive vice president for Creative Cloud landed there when his company Behance was acquired a decade ago. He understands the delicate balance Adobe needs to walk here but he also sees two companies that could benefit from coming together.

“Every interactive digital experience that we use every day contains assets — images videos animations — and guess where those are made. Well those are made in tools like the ones we make. And you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to get excited about the idea that the product platform that builds this interactive product design or interactive product experience being connected to the assets and the tools that make the assets can actually unlock a lot of productivity for the product designer” Belsky said.

Maintaining independence

The first rule of the $20 Billion Acquisition Club: Don’t mess up a good thing. Certainly the consensus among designers on social media was at best concern and at worst contempt when they heard about the deal. (After all there is a history of big companies buying smaller firms and then strangling them on purpose or otherwise.)

The companies will have to prove that the purchase won’t change what designers love about Figma or stifle product innovation. CEO Dylan Field believes that he can continue to build the company the way he envisioned it but with more resources from being part of a larger organization.

But he stressed that one of the keys to the deal was staying independent; his title will remain Figma CEO. This follows the playbook that IBM and Salesforce have adhered to keeping independent CEOs in place after being acquired while letting the companies run the way they always have. It appears that Adobe intends to do the same.

“The more I’ve gotten to know the members of the Adobe team through this process the more impressed I’ve become; the more I felt that they will be able to understand the challenges that are ahead of Figma and help us navigate them more gracefully while helping us continue grow as fast as possible but be autonomous and continue to operate that way. So I’m really excited. I think it’s kind of the best of all worlds” Field said.

It will certainly take a light touch for Adobe and Figma to pull that off.

But this is a big deal for Adobe and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen certainly understands this. While some analysts in the call after the announcement were skeptical about the price and time to value Narayen tried to make clear what the value proposition was with this deal.

“When we think about the future of what’s happening with creativity and in a sense what’s going to happen as it relates to multiple people engaging in that with respect to collaboration we just believe that this is going to be an incredible value and a way to attract a whole bunch of new customers to the combined platform” Narayen told analysts.

What he means is that by combining the two companies Adobe can reach a much broader audience. “When you think about Adobe certainly we target knowledge workers we target communicators we target creative professionals. Figma really focuses a lot also on developers; they focus very much on the other stakeholders who are involved in the product design process.”

For Field it comes down to executing now and proving to his core audience that this move is a positive one. As we ended the call he was about to meet with employees to discuss the deal for the first time and he was focused on the future.

“We know that now it’s our job to show up and really build. And so I think that I’m going to tell the company in a few minutes how I think that this is potentially a point where people will look back as an inflection point. We’re going to be moving faster after [the deal closes] than before. And now it’s our job to go do that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tL2Fkb2Jlcy0yMC1iaWxsaW9uLWZpZ21hLWRlYWwtcmFpc2VzLWV5ZWJyb3dzLWFuZC1yaW5ncy0xODQ5NTQ0MDEw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why did Adobe splurge $20 billion on design startup Figma?,"A burgeoning design startup will now be owned by the very giant it was born to rival.

Since Figma debuted in 2016 it’s been touted as an Adobe killer for being more efficient collaborative and affordable. On Sept. 15 Adobe announced it was buying the San Francisco-based firm in a $20 billion half-cash and half-stock deal.

This purchase price is double what Figma was valued at during its last funding round last year.

An anti-Adobe start

When Figma first launched its CEO Dylan Field presented the product as the David to Adobe’s Goliath.

At the time he told TechCrunch that the 40-year-old giant “doesn’t understand collaboration” and that its Creative Cloud offering is “really cloud in name only.”

Figma meanwhile became a hit for being a design-oriented tool focused on seamless collaboration.

Quotable



“Our goal is to be Figma not Adobe” —Field’s tweet from Jan 29 2021

A year and a half later things appear to have changed as Figma is on its way to become “Adobe’s Instagram.”

For Figma the big bucks present a big growth opportunity. The deal comes “with access to Adobe’s technology expertise and resources in the creative space” CEO Dylan Field wrote in a Sept. 15 blogpost.

“For example we will have the opportunity to incorporate their expertise in imaging photography illustration video 3D and font technology to the Figma platform” he elaborated.

Will Adobe kill Figma?

For now Adobe is “deeply committed” to keeping Figma operating autonomously wrote Fields who will continue to serve as CEO.

The company currently has no plan to change Figma’s pricing and the product will remain free for education.

Design Twitter though has its doubts about how long this will last given Adobe’s notorious reputation for being unaffordable and clunky.

The curious case of Adobe

Wall Street wasn’t thrilled with the acquisition announcement. Adobe’s share price plummeted 16% on the news as well on its mixed bag earnings results.

Industry insiders however don’t understand the dumping. The deal appears to add value to the legacy software firm.

“I would argue that Adobe without Figma was a much riskier asset to hold given that Figma would eventually eat large amounts of Adobe revenue” Amal Dorai partner at seed-stage emerging-tech VC firm Anorak Ventures tweeted. “If you would sell it after the acquisition announcement you should have really sold it way before.”

In addition to skepticism from users there’s one glaring caveat for investors: What if antitrust issues come up and the deal doesn’t go through?

“Then the acquisition offer just revealed that adobe themselves do not believe they can compete with Figma” researcher and investor Vaska Atta-Darkua pointed out.

Fun fact



The Adobe-Figma deal marks the biggest ever takeover of a privately-owned software company according to Bloomberg.

The restrictions are a tactical foreign policy and national security move to safeguard the US advantage in the race to develop artificial intelligence technology. How will this regulatory shift affect the AI chip industry in the short term and the long term?

These new restrictions do not completely cut off the flow of AI chips from US companies to China. Rather they focus on advanced products with powerful computing capabilities specifically the Nvidia’s A100 and H100 GPUs. Nvidia addressed the new licensing requirements in its 8-K released on August 26. The company reported that $400 million in potential sales to China could be affected by the new license requirement.

The new restrictions affect AMD’s M1250 chip according to the Reuters report. Both Nvidia and AMD took hits in the stock market following the news of the restrictions.

Nvidia and AMD are not the only US-based companies developing powerful AI chips. “The new limits may have a substantial effect on other tech firms in addition to Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Inc. including Intel Corp. Dell Technologies Inc. Super Micro Computer Inc. Hewlett Packard Enterprise KLA Corp. Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc.” says Emmanuel Ekwedike PhD an AI research scientist and engineer.

The Impact to China

China accounts for one-quarter of the global AI chip market according to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Restricting US companies’ sales to that market will impact their revenue and market share. “In the short term they'll feel some pain because they'll sell less chips. But in the long term it will inhibit China from advancing as quickly to be a prime competitor to those chip companies” Jack Gold president and principal analyst with industry analyst firm J. Gold Associates contends.

Nvidia will be allowed to continue the development of the H100 chip in China and it will be able to continue shipping AI chips out of its Hong Kong facility through September 2023 according to CNBC.

“We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren’t sufficient. The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100 H100 and systems such as DGX that include them” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.

The ultimate goal of these restrictions is to preserve the US’s global competitive advantage in the AI market. Military applications for powerful AI chips are also a consideration. “There is a growing concern that the new highly capable AI chips could be utilized (misused) for military reasons as evidenced by the fact that the new limits only apply to specific chips with specific performance capabilities” Ekwedike says.

Restricting AI chip exports may slow China down in the AI race but they will not put an end to the competition. “We're reducing the speed and ease at which new big models can be developed but customized applications actually don't necessarily depend on these really high performance [chips] like Nvidia’s A100 and H100 type systems” explains Bob Rogers PhD CEO of Oii an AI supply chain management software company. Rogers also cautions that these restrictions could cause China to ramp up efforts to manufacture its own AI chips.

These restrictions seem to herald the beginning of further government scrutiny of the AI chip industry. “A wider export ban is probably on the horizon a wide campaign … limiting the availability of specific advanced chipmaking machinery and specific items that make use of the targeted advanced AI chips” Ekwedike suggests.

Already the US government is planning further AI chip export restrictions which will affect KLA Corp. Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. according to Reuters. The companies will need to obtain licenses from the Commerce Department in order to export chipmaking equipment to China.

Neoverse V2 is said to increase power efficiency.

Chip giant Nvidia Corp’s latest data center processor Grace is built using the Neoverse V2 design.

Over the years processors based on the ARM architecture have gradually made the leap from mobile device to server and data center. Irrespective of that Arm Holdings Ltd have always maintained an open architecture when it comes to manufacturing ARM CPUs. Instead of actually producing its own chip Arm licenses the intellectual property (IP) to other companies like Qualcomm and Apple that want to manufacture their own ARM processors.

That said just this week the British chip technology firm announced its next generation data center chip technology called Neoverse V2 which is made to cater the explosive growth of data from 5G and internet-connected gadgets. To date the Neoverse compute portfolio has enabled its partners to adopt Arm-based solutions at a rapid pace to address ever-changing customer and market needs according to Arm.

“And today we’re sharing new additions to the Neoverse roadmap that are rooted in scalable efficiency and technology leadership while reinforcing our commitment to support our partners to continue their rapid pace of innovation” the company said in a statement. In general Arm’s technology powers most mobile phones but it has been making a big push into data center processors where Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices have long dominated.

THE MALAYSIAN DATA CENTER MARKET IS GROWING FASTER THAN YOU REALIZE

“The demand for data is insatiable from 5G to the cloud to smart cities. To address these demands the cloud infrastructure of tomorrow will need to handle the coming data explosion and the effective processing of evermore complex workloads all while increasing power efficiency and minimizing carbon footprint” Arm noted.

So far Arm said companies like Ampere Amazon Fujitsu and Alibaba already develop processor chips based on Arm technology for their data centers. “We heard from our hyperscale and HPC customers that they needed to further push cloud workload performance without requiring more power and area. Our response is the Neoverse V2 Platform (Demeter) featuring our newest V-series core and the widely deployed Arm CMN-700 mesh interconnect” Arm said.

Essentially Neoverse V2 will deliver market-leading integer performance for cloud and HPC workloads and introduces several Armv9 architectural security enhancements. So far Arm have multiple partners with designs based on Neoverse V2 in progress one of which is Nvidia who is leveraging V2 as the compute foundation for their Grace datacenter CPU. “Grace will combine the power efficiency of V2 with the power efficiency of LPDDR5X memory to deliver 2x performance per watt over servers powered by traditional architectures” Arm said.

In a report by Reuters Arm’s vice president Dermot O’Driscoll at a Q&A session about the new product said “Our partners are taking this and building very efficient solutions to target the problem spaces that they’re going after. So we do expect to see some pretty compelling data points going from V1 to V2.” He also shared that the company’s next generation N-Series product is in development and will be available to partners in 2023.

“This next N-Series CPU will deliver generational increases in both performance and efficiency over the market leading efficiency of N2. With more than 230 billion Arm-based chips shipped by our partners we have the world’s largest computing footprint and a unique understanding of the complete compute spectrum. The next era of computing infrastructure technology relies on the performance and efficiency DNA of Arm and with today’s additions to the Neoverse roadmap we are ready to deliver” he concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JtZXItd2FycmlvcnMtZ3VhcmQtY2hyaXMtY2hpb3p6YS0xNTQwNTY2NTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Warriors guard Chris Chiozza signs with Brooklyn Nets,"In an offseason that saw a flurry of former Golden State Warriors move in free agency another member of the 2022 championship team is on the way to a new team.

The Ebitda margin which is calculated as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization divided by total revenue is a good indicator of a company's financial health as it does not consider the effect of unique decisions and tax laws when appraising the performance of a company. These decisions refer to the recognition of amortization and depreciation which may differ significantly even among companies that operate in the same industry.

The four companies listed below have high Ebitda margins. Wall Street sell-side analysts have also issued positive recommendation ratings for them.

Apple Inc.

The first company that makes the cut is Apple Inc. (AAPL Financial) a Cupertino California-based manufacturer of smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories worldwide.

Apple Inc.’s trailing 12-month Ebitda margin is 34% resulting from Ebitda of $131.69 billion and revenue of $387.54 billion for the 12 months ended June 2022.

The closing share price of $152.37 on Thursday was up 4.32% compared to year-ago levels. The company has a market capitalization of $2.45 trillion and a 52-week range of $129.04 to $182.94.

The stock grants a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 0.59% and a forward dividend yield of 0.60%. The company last paid a quarterly dividend of 23 cents per common share on Aug. 11.

On Wall Street the stock has a median recommendation rating of overweight and an average target price of $142.89 per share.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

The second company that qualifies is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD Financial) a Santa Clara California-based global semiconductors designer.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s trailing 12-month Ebitda margin is 26.54% resulting from Ebitda of $5.72 billion and revenue of $21.57 billion for the 12 months ended in June.

Thursday's closing share price of $76.66 was down 26.20% compared to year-ago levels for a market capitalization of $123.75 billion and a 52-week range of $71.60 to $164.46.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. does not pay dividends.

On Wall Street the stock has a median recommendation rating of overweight and an average target price of $120.33 per share.

Daniel Becerril/Reuters

Hazardous ""forever chemicals"" called PFAS are contaminating drinking water food and air.

It may be impossible to completely avoid PFAS but there are a few simple ways to reduce your exposure.

Eating at home ditching nonstick pans and unnecessary carpets and filtering your water can help.

Hazardous long-lasting ""forever chemicals"" are all over the news lately and they're all over our day-to-day environments too.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS is a class of thousands of man-made substances that are common in everyday objects but research is making it increasingly clear that they may be harmful to human health. Peer-reviewed studies have linked them to some cancers decreased fertility thyroid disease and developmental delays.

That's bad news since PFAS last for decades without breaking down earning them the ""forever chemicals"" nickname. Researchers have found them in drinking water and household dust across the planet in the oceans at both poles and drifting through the atmosphere.

In a paper published last month leading researchers at the University of Stockholm concluded that all the planet's rainwater and probably all of its soil are contaminated with unsafe levels of PFAS. Ian Cousins who spearheaded that research fears it's impossible to avoid the chemicals.

""I don't bother"" Cousins told Insider adding ""It's almost mission impossible. You can't really do it.""

Even if you can't completely dodge PFAS there are a few easy ways to reduce exposure in your daily life.

Eat at home with minimal grease-resistant packaging

PFAS were developed in the 1940s to resist heat grease stains and water. That means they've ended up in a lot of food packaging. That includes pizza boxes microwave popcorn bags some wrappers and grease-resistant paper.

Restaurants and fast-food chains may use such packaging more than grocery stores do. A 2019 study found that people had lower PFAS levels in their blood after eating at home and higher levels after eating fast food or at restaurants.

Throw out scratched nonstick pans

The coating used in nonstick cookware usually contains PFAS and they can easily leach into your food at high heat and once the coating gets scratched.

The Washington Department of Ecology advises against heating nonstick cookware above 400 degrees Fahrenheit and recommends throwing it out once the nonstick coating scratches. Cast-iron pans are a safe alternative.

Ditch your carpet and stain-resistant fabrics

Other household items like carpeting water-resistant clothing and stain-resistant treatments for fabrics can also contain PFAS. Researchers don't think the chemicals can easily absorb into your body through your skin but those fabrics shed fibers that can travel through the house as dust eventually getting ingested or inhaled.

Vacuum dust and open the windows

PFAS accumulate in dust which lingers in the air and allows humans to breathe the chemicals into their lungs. By dusting and vacuuming regularly along with opening windows to allow for airflow and ventilation you can keep dust levels low in your home and reduce the amount of PFAS you inhale.







Test and maybe treat your drinking water

You can test your water for PFAS through a laboratory certified by your state. If the water exceeds guidelines you may want to consider doing something about it especially if you have children.

Even at very low levels exposure to two of the most common PFAS — called PFOA and PFOS — has been linked to decreased vaccine response in children. That research prompted the US Environmental Protection Agency to revise its drinking-water guidelines decreasing the safe levels of those substances by a factor of 17000. In August the agency issued a proposal to classify those two PFAS as hazardous substances.

A few types of water filters can diminish PFAS levels though they may not completely remove the chemicals from the water. State environmental departments recommend filtration systems that use reverse osmosis for tap water. They also recommend filter systems that use granular activated carbon (aka charcoal) which can be installed on faucets house-wide or used in a tabletop pitcher but a 2020 study found mixed results from those systems.

If you get your drinking water from a well the EPA recommends testing it regularly and contacting your state environmental or health agency for certified labs and safety standards.

Check before you buy cosmetics

Last year a group of researchers published the results of testing 231 cosmetic products in the US and Canada for PFAS. More than half the products contained indicators of the chemicals.

The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has a public searchable database of cosmetics and personal-care products highlighting ingredients with potential risks to human health such as PFAS like Teflon. They also maintain a map where you can check if you live near a PFAS contamination site.

The Green Science Policy Institute also keeps a list of PFAS-free products including a guide to cosmetics.

Ultimately Cousins said people don't need to be ""super worried"" about low-level exposure since there's no strong evidence of major health impacts across the population. Still reducing PFAS use in consumer products could keep the problem from getting worse in the future.

""I think we should use this to get a bit angry about what's happened and try and make change so that we don't keep doing this"" Cousins said. ""Maybe we have to use [PFAS] in some cases but only when they're absolutely essential. And then we should also try to innovate to try and replace them in the longer term.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuLm9yZy9lbi9jbGltYXRlY2hhbmdlL3ByZXNlcnZpbmctdGhlLW96b25lLWxheWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Preserving the Ozone Layer | United Nations,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuLm9yZy9lbi9jbGltYXRlY2hhbmdlL3ByZXNlcnZpbmctdGhlLW96b25lLWxheWVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950F9E6E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The attackers began by targeting the victim's primary data center before expanding unexpectedly and hitting six different global locations from Europe to North America.

This isn't the first record-breaking DDoS attack this unidentified Eastern European victim has weathered. In July it was on the receiving end of 14-hour attack that set the previous European packets-per-second record of 659.6 Mpps.

The notable set of attacks is part of an emerging trend toward more complex powerful and persistent DDoS attacks according to Akamai.

""Adversaries are constantly evolving their techniques tactics and procedures to evade detection and maximize disruption as demonstrated by this ongoing attack campaign"" the Akamai report on the European DDoS attack said. ""These events reflect a growing trend in which adversaries are increasingly hitting deep-reconnaissance targets""",,,,,,,,,

Or follow us on Google News

Transportation as a Service (TaaS) is a concept most of us are familiar with — instead of buying your own car you pay for people to transport you to where you want to go. (Uber — we’re talking about Uber.) We’re also all familiar with microgrids. In simple terms they are small electricity grids. But who has heard of Microgrids as a Service?

Microgrids as a Service (MaaS) utilize the same concept of shared ownership as ridesharing. Essentially a utility or service provider continues to own the microgrid (and all its associated technologies like solar PV batteries or generators) while the customer just pays for energy via contract. The benefit from this is that the customer is able to get all the benefits of on-site stable resilient and possibly sustainable power generation without investing in distributed energy technologies themselves. However creating a system like this and an agreement which is amicable to both the provider and the customer can be financially risky.

To help address this issue Xendee has developed a software platform designed to reliably design and optimize microgrids and even help operators create accurate financial projections so they can create contracts with confidence and offer pricing and resiliency benefits that are competitive or better than traditional grid pricing.

For example as with many things a company may have an idea to invest in an onsite microgrid for their facility without doing much research. They end up hiring two consulting firms and a design firm and 6 months later they still don’t have a path forward or any confidence from the board that this is a good investment. Meanwhile $60000 has been spent on research. In contrast- a professional energy provider engineering firm equipment manufacturer or utility could contract with the company instead to directly offer the microgrid services but handle the design implementation and operation themselves. This leaves the organization to do what they do best and the energy provider to focus their resources on delivering results for the customer.

“Design makes up two-thirds of the implementation process” Xendee writes. The editor in me wants to modify that a little bit. Perhaps a more accurate statement would be: “Design makes up two-thirds of a good implementation process.” It is also clear that this process can be easier for firms that specialize in this type of work.

Microgrids require a lot of work a lot of planning and a lot of specialization (just look at the graphic above). That’s where the idea of MaaS (Microgrid as a Service) comes in. If a company has developed an efficient effective way of designing and implementing microgrids it may be more efficient if they simply build more and operate them while others just act as customers. All that is required is a design platform that can make the design process affordable and fast while also being robust enough to capture all the unique challenges each microgrid project faces like local energy prices weather data and historical usage information.

With the project site information gathered Xendee’s design platform can help engineers through all the phases of the microgrid project creating a conceptual design and technical design for a microgrid as well as managing implementation and operation. Additionally the Xendee software platform can be extended by other features like “Discovery” for finding viable sites at scale as well as a power flow and one line diagram tool to ensure the components can function under peak usage.

Xendee describes their software as “an end-to-end solution for designing and operating Microgrid systems that intelligently optimizes design decisions as well as live operation and energy dispatch. This allows XENDEE to create reliable bankable systems that reduce engineering costs energy prices and CO2 emissions while also improving energy security and resilience to power outages.”

The complicated paths forward when trying to get a microgrid off the ground are daunting. Having a guide to optimize the design catch potential mistakes before they happen and create reliable financial projections is a good way of making microgrids seem simple again. And that is essentially what Xendee’s software is here to provide to utilities service providers and ultimately end customers. If you’ve ever struggled to put together a piece of furniture from IKEA well that’s a whole different league from a microgrid. Sometimes it’s easier and more financially efficient to have someone put it together for you.

Fortunately it’s one of the more positive announcements that shareholders can receive.

Of course a stock split doesn’t affect a company’s market capitalization.

However it lowers the value of each individual share providing ease for the stock price to multiply once again and provide investors with sizable gains.

In 2022 we’ve witnessed several titans undergo a stock split including Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.

It raises a valid question which company looks like a better buy post-split? Let’s take a closer look.

Price Action & Quarterly Performance

Year-to-date Amazon and Alphabet shares have both tumbled. However AMZN shares have displayed a higher level of defense declining roughly 27% vs. GOOGL’s decline of nearly 30%.

Upon shortening the timeframe to encompass just the last three months of price action the winner is easy to spot and it’s Amazon.

AMZN shares have tacked on a stellar 15% in value in this timeframe easily crushing GOOGL’s decline of 5%.

Google has consistently reported strong results exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven of its last ten quarters. However the tech titan has posted back-to-back bottom-line misses in its previous two prints.

Amazon also has a respectable earnings track record with six EPS beats over its last ten quarters. Like Alphabet however AMZN has most recently posted back-to-back EPS misses.

While Amazon shares have been stronger year-to-date Google’s seven EPS beats over its last ten prints slightly edge out Amazon’s six bottom-line beats in the same timeframe.

Valuation & Growth Estimates

Pivoting to valuation both Alphabet and Amazon currently carry a Value Style Score of a C. In addition both companies’ forward price-to-sales ratios are well beneath their five-year medians.

Still Amazon’s 2.5X forward P/S ratio is much cheaper than Alphabet’s 5.7X.

Both companies also carry a Growth Style Score of a B.

In FY22 Amazon’s earnings are forecasted to decline by a staggering 93% but revenue is forecasted to climb 11.5%.

Pivoting to Alphabet’s growth profile the tech titan’s earnings are forecasted to drop 7% in FY22 paired with forecasted Y/Y revenue growth of 11.8%.

Amazon shares are currently cheaper but Google looks like it has the upper hand in growth.

Bottom Line

It’s hard to choose between these two titans as they’ve fully established themselves in the market and have provided investors with unbelievable gains over the last several years.

Story continues

Earlier in the year both companies performed a stock split making shares accessible to all investors.

Amazon AMZN has enjoyed a stronger share performance and has cheaper shares. Meanwhile Alphabet GOOGL has a slightly stronger earnings track record and a visibly better growth trajectory.

In addition both companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With the adverse economic situation we currently find ourselves in it looks better for investors to deploy a defense-first approach and wait until one of the two starts seeing favorable earnings estimate revisions.

One user reported seeing 11 ads before their video started. This may force more people towards adblockers and apps like YouTube Vanced.

YouTube the world’s largest video sharing platform which is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc wants more people to join their YouTube Premium programme by paying. And so to facilitate this YouTube is currently testing showing users five unskippable ads before a video starts.

YouTube users who are not subscribed to YouTube Premium will now receive up to 5 advertisements at the beginning of the video. And although YouTube claims that the ads shown in such spots will be bumper ads or basically ads that are about 6 seconds in length the reality is people have seen ads that are longer than 10 seconds.

One user tweeted out saying that they got to see about 11 ads instead of 5.

My buddy has had up to 11 unskippable… pic.twitter.com/xFoGQQHYgy — Austin (@H720Gaming) September 13 2022

Advertisement

The news broke out when several YouTube’s regular or non-premium users started complaining on Twitter and Reddit that they have been receiving 5 ads instead of 2 before they could watch their YouTube video.

Not all regular YouTube viewers are dealing with the “5 ads before your video starts” situation so it seems like YouTube is currently testing out the waters among selected users. As of now most users of YouTube are only receiving up to 2 ads before their video starts but it is not known whether the 5-ad format change will be rolled out to all non-paying YouTube users soon.

This move may lead to regular users towards adblockers and other “cracked” versions of YouTube. YouTube Vanced was one such modified third-party YouTube application for Android that had its own ad blocker.

This puts content creators in a precarious position especially ones who don’t rely on brand deals and sponsorships.

For this health tech company which must compete with so many similarly named companies and drugs the remedy is simple: out with the old and in with the new.

And that new name—in what would be a brilliant Scrabble-scoring word if it were allowed—is Qnovia about as far away from Respira as you can get. That ends the four-year history of the health tech company as it officially rebrands with an accompanying new website and corporate refresh.

The rebrand comes as the California-based company looks to become the first prescription inhalable smoking cessation therapy which Qnovia sees as an upgrade to nicotine replacement therapies. It’s all still early-stage but the company is nearing an FDA submission to start clinical trials and is going about seeking new cash to support those trials.

There are simply “too many Respiras including at least two other health tech companies as well as an air-purifying garden and a carbon credit company” a Qnovia spokesperson told Fierce Pharma Marketing

He said the rebranding became necessary “to avoid confusion” especially as Qnovia moves from that quiet preclinical period and into the more public clinical trial stage.

This is also a big branding move from Brian Quigley who stepped up as the new CEO of the company just last month. Quigley was previously the chief operating officer and before that an executive at Altria Group. He took over from founder and former chief Mario Danek who moved down to become its CTO.

“This rebranding will further differentiate the company’s technology and products from others in the biotechnology space” the company said in a press release.

In severe droughts when the forest loses more water to evaporation than it receives from rain the trees begin to die. For every three trees that die due to drought in the Amazon rainforest a fourth tree even if not directly affected by drought will also die according to a new study.

As trees are lost and the forest dries up parts of the Amazon will rapidly approach a tipping point where they will transition into a degraded savanna-like ecosystem with few to no trees.

The southern and southeastern Amazon are the most vulnerable regions to tipping. Here deforestation and fires are at their most extreme driven largely by cattle ranching and soy farming.

The world’s largest rainforest makes its own weather. Up to half of all the rainfall in the Amazon comes from the forest itself as moisture is recycled from the trees to the atmosphere and back again. So what happens as droughts grow more severe and less rain enters the system?

For every three trees that die due to drought in the Amazon rainforest a fourth tree even if it’s not directly affected by drought will also die according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Every part of the forest is interlinked meaning damage in one area can affect neighboring areas increasing negative effects by one-third.

“We’re investigating what would actually happen to the Amazon rainforest if droughts become more frequent in the future and that is indeed what is hypothesized with climate change” Nico Wunderling study co-author and researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research told Mongabay.

Scientists predict that if we continue burning fossil fuels on a business-as-usual trajectory the Amazon will experience major drought nine out of every 10 years by the year 2060.

As the forest dries up experts say parts of it are rapidly approaching a tipping point where they will transition into a degraded savanna-like ecosystem with few to no trees. But rather than thinking of the Amazon rainforest as “one big tipping element that will vanish from Earth past a certain threshold” Wunderling said it’s helpful to note that some regions are much more vulnerable to tipping than other regions.

Wunderling and colleagues found that the southern Amazon is the most vulnerable region the southeast in particular. Here deforestation is at its most extreme along the infamous “arc of deforestation” driven largely by cattle ranching and soy farming.

They also found that the severity of droughts matter. “Droughts that become too severe result in tipping” Wunderling said. In severe drought the forest loses more water to evaporation than it receives from rain and the trees begin to die.

Not all trees have the same effect on the forest. When trees die or are cut down in the east this can have a greater cascading effect on the weather.

It all starts as most natural systems do with the sun which warms the surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean and causes vapor to rise and form clouds. These clouds then carry rain to the eastern Amazon. The forest absorbs the rain and then releases water vapor back into the atmosphere through transpiration from the lush vegetation. Known as the Amazon’s “flying rivers” this mass of water vapor is carried by winds to the west contributing up to 50% of rain in the region.

With fewer trees in the east to recycle moisture due to drought and deforestation the rest of the Amazon also becomes drier. “The lack of moisture recycling in some parts of the forest can be propagated downwind … resulting in approximately one-third of all tipping events” the paper says.

To arrive at these conclusions the team used a technique called network analysis dividing a map of the rainforest into 600 sections to see how drought conditions in one area would affect others.

They looked at past measurements such as rainfall and transpiration rates for each section and assumed the trees there would be adapted to these local conditions. For instance the central Amazon rainforest is adapted to more rain while southern regions have adapted to drier conditions with deeper-rooted trees and more drought-resilient species.

Yet despite these adaptations southern forests are not equipped to handle long periods without water. “So we find that even the dry season adapted parts of the Amazon forest won’t necessarily survive a new climate normal and the risk of tipping into savannah or no trees at all is high” study co-author Boris Sakschewski also from the Potsdam Institute said in a statement.

“The consequences for biodiversity would be disastrous but the same goes for the local regional and global climate” he added.

Carlos Nobre one of Brazil’s top climate scientists and a researcher at the University of São Paulo who was not involved in the study said this research is “a good way of showing the sensitivity of the Southern and South Eastern Amazon which are very vulnerable” and that these findings are in line with other research.

Not only is the dry season getting longer Nobre said it’s also getting drier. “Drought like we saw in 2005 and 2010 could become the norm” he said. “The risk of the tipping point is very real.”

He noted the study doesn’t consider forest degradation fires or land-use change all of which are “happening tremendously over all the southern Amazon … With these included the risks [of reaching a tipping point] become even greater.”

The first signs of more permanent drying in the rainforest are already showing scientists warn. Species adapted to wet conditions are starting to die and satellite images show a decrease in water vapor over remote parts of the rainforest far from the arc of deforestation.

“[W]hile we’ve investigated the impact of drought that rule also holds for deforestation” Wunderling said in a statement. “It means essentially when you chop down one acre of forest what you actually are destroying is 1.3 acres.”

Since 2019 under the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro an area of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest larger than Belgium has been destroyed. This year alone rainforest clearing detected in the Brazilian Amazon has surpassed 7135 square kilometers (2755 square miles) — the highest on record since 2008 — according to the Brazilian space agency’s deforestation alert system.

Droughts in the Amazon are symptoms of deforestation and climate change. That means we not only need to end deforestation but we have to meet the Paris Agreement targets Nobre said. That calls for countries to reduce carbon emissions to limit warming to well below 2° Celsius (3.6° Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2030. A recent study estimates a 0.1% chance that nations will reach the Paris Agreement goals barring swift and dramatic action.

“Unless we reduce emissions” Nobre said “even if we get to zero deforestation most of the forest will disappear.”

Zendesk is a CRM tool that makes it easy for customers and businesses to keep in sync. Zendesk captures a wealth of customer data such as support tickets created and updated by customers and service agents community discussions and helpful guides. With such a wealth of complex data simple keyword searches don’t suffice when it comes to discovering meaningful accurate customer information.

Now you can use the Amazon Kendra Zendesk connector to index your Zendesk service tickets help guides and community posts and perform intelligent search powered by machine learning (ML). Amazon Kendra smartly and efficiently answers natural language-based queries using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It can learn effectively from your Zendesk data extracting meaning and context.

This post shows how to configure the Amazon Kendra Zendesk connector to index your Zendesk domain and take advantage of Amazon Kendra intelligent search. We use an example of an illustrative Zendesk domain to discuss technical topics related to AWS services.

Overview of solution

Amazon Kendra was built for intelligent search using NLP. You can use Amazon Kendra to ask factoid questions descriptive questions and perform keyword searches. You can use the Amazon Kendra connector for Zendesk to crawl your Zendesk domain and index service tickets guides and community posts to discover answers for your questions faster.

In this post we show how to use the Amazon Kendra connector for Zendesk to index data from your Zendesk domain for intelligent search.

Prerequisites

For this walkthrough you should have the following prerequisites:

An AWS account

Administrator level access to your Zendesk domain

Privileges to create an Amazon Kendra index AWS resources and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies

Basic knowledge of AWS services and working knowledge of Zendesk

Configure your Zendesk domain

Your Zendesk domain has a domain owner or administrator service group administrators and a customer. Sample service tickets community posts and guides have been created for the purpose of this walkthrough. A Zendesk API client with the unique identifier amazon_kendra is registered to create an OAuth token for accessing your Zendesk domain from Amazon Kendra for crawling and indexing. The following screenshot shows the details of the OAuth configuration for the Zendesk API client.

Configure the data source using the Amazon Kendra connector for Zendesk

You can add the Zendesk connector data source to an existing Amazon Kendra index or create a new index. Then complete the following steps to configure the Zendesk connector:

On the Amazon Kendra console open the index and choose Data sources in the navigation pane. Under Zendesk choose Add connector. Choose Add connector.

In the Specify data source details section enter the name and description of your data source and choose Next. In the Define access and security section for Zendesk URL enter the URL to your Zendesk domain. Use the URL format https://<domain>.zendesk.com/ . Under Authentication you can either choose Create to add a new secret using the user OAuth token created for the amazon_kendra  or use an existing AWS Secrets Manager secret that has the user OAuth token for the Zendesk domain that you want the connector to access. Optionally configure a new AWS secret for Zendesk API access.

For IAM role you can choose Create a new role or choose an existing IAM role configured with appropriate IAM policies to access the Secrets Manager secret Amazon Kendra index and data source. Choose Next.

In the Configure sync settings section provide information regarding your sync scope and run schedule. Choose Next.

In the Set field mappings section you can optionally configure the field mappings or how the Zendesk field names are mapped to Amazon Kendra attributes or facets. Choose Next. Review your settings and confirm to add the data source. After the data source is created select the data source and choose Sync Now. Choose Facet definition in the navigation pane. Select the check box in the Facetable column for the facet _category .



Run queries with the Amazon Kendra search console

Now that the data is synced we can run a few search queries on the Amazon Kendra search console by navigating to the Search indexed content page.

For the first query we ask Amazon Kendra a general question related to AWS service durability. The following screenshot shows the response. The suggested answer provides the correct answer to the query by applying natural language comprehension.

For our second query let’s query Amazon Kendra to search for product issues from Zendesk service tickets. The following screenshot shows the response for the search along with facets showing various categories of documents included in the result.

Notice the search result includes the URL to the source document as well. Choosing the URL takes us directly to the Zendesk service ticket page as shown in the following screenshot.

Clean up

To avoid incurring future charges clean up any resources created as part of this solution. Delete the Zendesk connector data source so any data indexed from the source is removed from the index. If you created a new Amazon Kendra index delete the index as well.

Conclusion

In this post we discussed how to configure the Amazon Kendra connector for Zendesk to crawl and index service tickets community posts and help guides. We showed how Amazon Kendra ML-based search enables your business leaders and agents to discover insights from your Zendesk content quicker and respond to customer needs faster.

So far neither the government nor private plaintiffs have prevailed in cases arguing that Amazon's tactics are illegal. A similar case brought by Washington DC's attorney general was dismissed in May. However this time just might be different antitrust lawyers and economists say. Amazon is coercing sellers into a price war that only the e-commerce giant can win the California case argues.

“There’s certainly an anticompetitive story to be told but to me there’s also a compelling free rider defense for Amazon” said Penn State Law professor John Lopatka who's referring to Amazon's concern that sellers will use Amazon's platform to generate interest in their products then sell them elsewhere.

Bonta's suit is distinct from other antitrust cases that have targeted Amazon's seller terms as it alleges violations under California law narrows the so-called ""relevant market"" and focuses on the company's alleged punishment of seller behavior.

But the case is still one that's difficult to prove Lopatka said. That's in part because Amazon's seller agreements technically permit sellers to set their own prices and in part because of Amazon's push to feature the lowest possible price — both tend to appear as policies that foster competition.

In reality the complaint alleges Amazon artificially inflates prices on rival retail websites — such as Walmart.com (WMT) Target.com (TGT) and eBay.com (EBAY) — and even on sellers' own websites by coercing its third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers to lower prices for goods sold online.

'It's a nightmare'

According to the claims Amazon penalizes sellers for failing to get the price right by demoting products in search results and disqualifying products from the “Buy Box” feature which allows shoppers to add their products into a checkout cart the lawsuit claims. For wholesalers Amazon’s agreements require sellers to refund the company for price gaps in the event that their product is offered for less on a competing website.

""It’s a nightmare"" said Lesley Hensell co-founder of Riverbend Consulting a firm that helps third-party Amazon sellers reactivate their suspended accounts. She says accounts are suspended when Amazon identifies certain sellers as failing to meet its pricing expectations citing what's known as a ""high pricing error."" Without warning Amazon's systems automatically deactivate the seller's product listing she said.

""No-one can deal with that kind of uncertainty in their business"" Hensell said. ""I can tell you that sometimes the high pricing errors are completely inaccurate. To remedy the problem sellers must adjust prices downward until they are low enough to reactivate the product listing."" Sellers often struggle to sell at a profit under those demands Hensell said especially as their own manufacturing supply and shipping costs escalate.

Heller said that while she's never known Amazon to retaliate against sellers who are targeted by the company for raising their prices she also knows sellers are reluctant to criticize Amazon for their troubles.

""For some of these people it is their personal income or their revenue fuels a business with a lot of employees they care about"" Heller said. ""When challenging things happen in their account even if they think it's unfair they're often afraid to speak up publicly or even to escalate the issue within Amazon. They fear it will put a target on their back.""

Amazon's succeeded in winning antitrust fights so far

One reason for Amazon's past success disputing antitrust claims is its argument that its low price edicts promote more not less competition driving down prices for goods sold online.

“This is a common misconception” Yale University economics professor Florian Ederer told Yahoo Finance. “It sounds like it would be pro-competitive but it is actually anti-competitive.”

In March 2022 a judge dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine. Racine argued that Amazon violated the district’s Antitrust Act because its contracts prevented sellers from offering lower prices for their products on competing websites. Given the requirement Racine alleged that Amazon's approximate 40% commission on sales further drove up online prices.

Another antitrust case against Amazon is still playing out in Seattle where a class of consumers lost part of Amazon's request to dismiss federal antitrust claims yet convinced a judge to maintain part of their case. According to the judge Amazon's requirement that sellers add Amazon fees to the cost of their products — even those sold elsewhere — could potentially run afoul of federal anti-competition law.

Amazon has maintained its position that its policies promote competition in a statement to Yahoo Finance saying: ""Like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively. The relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law.”

In 2019 under the threat of investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and regulators in Germany Amazon dropped a provision from its seller contracts commonly referred to as a “most favored nation” (MFN) clause. The provision required sellers to offer items for sale on Amazon on the most favorable terms when compared to other online retail platforms.

The California complaint alleges that Amazon's seller penalties are much like the ones that Hensell describes and achieve the same force as its prior MFN provisions.

“Absent these agreements a greater selection and total output of lower-priced products would be available across online stores” the complaint states.

Ederer explains that true price floors are only exposed without Amazon’s restrictions on sellers. Sellers who offer the same products on their own platforms he explains would tend to sell at a slightly lower price than on Amazon or on other online retail sites because outside retailers take a cut of their sales revenue in exchange for carrying the product and exposing it to their consumer base.

As a seller Ederer says “I could completely give up on Amazon but then I'm going to lose all of that revenue and not be able to sell on Amazon. Instead what I do is because Amazon is punishing me for charging a higher price on my own platform I raise the price on my own platform.”

Lopatka explains that the effect California’s trying to prove — that Amazon is responsible for higher prices on other websites — is also difficult to isolate.

Ederer agrees. “Amazon essentially makes that very very difficult by these implicit MFNs” he said. “That’s going to require a fair amount of evidence…That’s the type of evidence that the judge felt wasn’t really there in the DC case.” He questions whether sellers can provide enough evidence that they are being downgraded in search results or deprived of the Buy Box to prevail in the California case.

New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox views California's case as one with potentially compelling legal arguments though she expects it to play out on ideological rather than legal terms.

“A conservative judge is more likely to dismiss the case” she said. “The conservative philosophy presumes that markets work well and are self-correcting and are reluctant to apply antitrust.”

Fox adds that she expects scenarios like this one to play out across more states.

""States are very much on top of the Big Tech issues"" she said.

Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in Moss Landing California U.S. on Tuesday April 20 2021. The facility is the world's largest battery energy storage system.

When the temperature soars so does the use of air conditioners—and demand for the electricity that powers them. Unusually high electricity use can strain power grids sometimes forcing grid operators to implement rolling blackouts to avoid a system-wide collapse. Blackouts are not only unpleasant but also potentially life-threatening in extreme heat. The possibility of outages was a major concern during a record-breaking heat wave that smothered California the most populous U.S. state earlier this month.

A milder heat wave in August 2020 had caused California’s electricity demand to outstrip supply and the state’s grid operator resorted to scheduled blackouts. About 800000 homes and business had their power cut off for anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours. Just before California’s heat wave struck this September temperatures and power demand were both projected to be higher than they were two years ago.

But impressively California’s grid weathered the heat wave. Scientific American spoke with Michael Wara policy director of the Sustainability Accelerator at Stanford University about the strategic improvements and unconventional tactics that helped the grid hold up and how power systems can decarbonize and still stand up to climate extremes.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

What happened in California during this heat wave?

All-time records were set all over the state. Demand for electricity that is needed to run air conditioners was going to be extremely high. Around 2 2:30 P.M. the grid operator CAISO (California Independent System Operator) said a level-three emergency would begin at 5:30 P.M. Level three means possible load shedding—it means [the potential for] rotating blackouts so that the grid itself doesn’t break.

What would it mean for the grid to break?

The thing to avoid is what happened in Texas in February of last year where there was kind of a runaway grid failure. As the demand exceeds supply there’ll be a voltage drop and the power plants get out of sync with the grid. Turbines can go spinning out of sync [causing damage]. Power plants will disconnect [to protect themselves and prevent this]. Demand and supply diverge even further and then more power plants disconnect et cetera et cetera. And then you end up with a total blackout of the bulk power system which can take days or weeks to fix. It’s something to avoid at all costs.

What happened after CAISO announced that a level-three emergency would go into effect?

We were all kind of bracing for these rotating outages to start. The expectation was they’d start around 6 P.M. which is when the sun starts to get lower on the horizon this time of year and so the solar power plants start to produce less energy.

Instead what happened is that—in contrast to 2020—we had several thousand megawatts of battery storage that started providing energy and helped stabilize the situation. And then the grid operator called all of its demand response resources [large-scale consumers that the operator pays to reduce electricity usage] and reduced demand even further. It took about 1000 megawatts or so off the demand at around 5 or 5:30 P.M.

And then something really interesting happened: CAISO sent a text to people in California and they said look you need to reduce your demand right now or we’re going to have to start rotating outages. And basically at the moment that that text was sent demand fell in California by something like [3000 megawatts.] It’s not totally clear yet if that was a result of that text. But it’s interesting to note that simultaneous with the text there was this large decrease in demand—and that allowed the system to ride out the evening hours.

Let’s assume for a moment that the drop in demand was a result of that text. A grassroots effort to save the grid is inspiring and impressive but asking individuals to turn up their thermostats and turn off their lights is probably not a sustainable way to run the system right?

We should not be leaving this to people. What if they’re not home? What if they don’t get the text? These heat waves are going to become more and more common. That is the future. Volunteerism is not going to work. If you ask people do this one time they’re going to do it. But if you ask them to do it five times a summer every summer? It’s not something you want to bank on.

What changed between the 2020 heat wave which did result in rolling blackouts and this heat wave which did not?

The government really engaged in a thoughtful exercise in trying to figure out what the errors were and we’ve seen substantial change since then. And boy did that change pay off because if we had been where we were in August 2020 we wouldn’t have had just a blackout [on one day]—we’d have had a blackout all weekend. We had system problems at 45 gigawatts peak demand in 2020. [On September 6 and 7] the grid was at something like 51 gigawatts and change. That’s more than a 10 percent increase in demand in two years. And we met that challenge and kept the lights on.

I think the real reason is that everyone in the California energy regulatory space and the companies were willing to have an honest conversation about what went wrong—and then fix it. And we were able to fix it because the clean technologies are so much less controversial to site than the dirty ones. The reality is: no one really cares if you site a utility-scale battery facility somewhere and they love it if you’re pulling out a dirty power plant and replacing that with batteries. That’s what we have been doing for the past two years. I think there were 40 to 50 megawatts of batteries running in 2020. And [onSeptember 6] we had close to 3000 megawatts.

There was also a renewed push to get more demand response to be available during a crisis. Demand response is just programs that pay people [primarily large industrial and commercial consumers] during moments when the grid is stressed to stop consuming power. The last thing that they did—and this was controversial—was create a program during the summer months to basically waive environmental regulations during grid emergencies for large commercial diesel generators. Buildings can shift onto their diesel generators during a grid emergency and that’s another way to reduce demand.

Burning fossil fuels was important for weathering this heat wave. How could a fully decarbonized grid respond to an event like this?

Those kinds of things are going to be less and less necessary if we maintain our current rate of battery deployment. If we can keep that up it’s not going to be very many years until this is just a rearview mirror thing. And that’s going to be challenging because the batteries are getting a little bit more expensive because of supply chain issues and because of the growth in electric vehicles. But even if we only deploy 1000 megawatts a year for five to six years we’re well out of the woods and on our way to a very clean grid that relies on solar and wind.

How has California paved the way for renewables in the rest of the country?

I think the battery storage industry that California has created is going to make life much easier for everybody else as they walk down this path. It’s going to make it cheaper more reliable simpler to manage. I think California is doing what it should do with respect to climate change. We’re kind of like a 40-million-person pilot-scale experiment in how to be a prosperous energy-abundant place. We’re charting that path. It’s not always easy. It’s not always without some bumps in the road. But I think that because we’re going first it’s going to be easier for other states and countries to follow."

StratCap Wireless has completed the acquisition of 20 towers for a fee of $20.3 million.

Of the towers acquired it includes 23 existing tenant leases with US telcos Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile who make up 100 percent of rental revenues. It is expected that these tenants will likely upgrade the existing sites to 5G with towers boasting a significant capacity for new tenants to modify these towers.

“These assets serve as mission-critical infrastructure for our tenants helping them to deliver wireless coverage to a significant customer base in the Oklahoma metro region"" said StratCap managing partner Jim Condon.

The company adds that the acquisition will provide 'long-term predictable rental revenues from premier tenants'.

Data Center push

StratCap formerly Strategic Capital has been acquisitive of late with the company acquiring a data center leased to Expedient outside Milwaukee Wisconsin last month through its data center real estate division StratCap Data Centers.

StratCap Data Centers completed the acquisition of a 28500 square foot (2650 sqm) data center that is fully leased on a triple-net basis located outside Milwaukee in Franklin. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Before this acquisition StratCap scooped a data center in Jacksonville Florida in July. The 25600 square foot (2400 sqm) facility is fully leased to a 'major telecommunications carrier' that is likely T-Mobile and serves as one of the company’s wireless communications switching centers and includes a cell tower.

Last year StratCap set up a new $1.5 billion data center investment platform called Strategic Datasphere LLC to invest in data centers.

The investment is focused on the acquisition development and management of data center facilities across the US and Europe including through sale-leaseback transactions with ‘technology communications cloud enterprise and public sector tenants.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Y3BvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaS10ZWFtL2hlcmVzLXdoeS1jYXJldy10b3dlcnMtbmV3LW93bmVyLWZpbGVkLWEtNS0xbS1saWVuLWFnYWluc3QtY2luY2lubmF0aS1uZXRoZXJsYW5kLWhvdGVsLXByb3BlcnR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carew Tower's new owner filed liens against himself,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Y3BvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaS10ZWFtL2hlcmVzLXdoeS1jYXJldy10b3dlcnMtbmV3LW93bmVyLWZpbGVkLWEtNS0xbS1saWVuLWFnYWluc3QtY2luY2lubmF0aS1uZXRoZXJsYW5kLWhvdGVsLXByb3BlcnR50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952C5B130>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

More than 750 fifth-graders enjoyed the festival coordinated by the Kaua’i County Department of Water with the help of more than 175 volunteers.

“Together we can lead the way towards improving our water future through the education of our students” said Joe Tait the Department of Water’s Manager and Chief Engineer.

The WET in Project WET stands for Water Education Today. The festival featured activity stations that included a lecture and interactive component. This year’s water topics included groundwater drinking water services environmental and source water protection watershed management the water cycle water properties natural ecosystems native species protection marine animal rescue and understanding water droplets. New this year was an activity on reclaimed water.

“Water education continues to be a high priority for our outreach programs and the festival serves as the perfect opportunity to engage in discussions and offer direct lessons that teach students about a wide range of water topics that we encounter every day” said Jonell Kaohelauli’i the water department’s information and education specialist and coordinator of the festival.

“This is the first year the festival is featuring an activity about wastewater proving that we have not yet reached the boundaries of this event” she added.

But some hardware startups are taking a throwback approach for AI computing to counter the more-is-better approach. Companies including Innatera Rain Neuromorphics and others are creating silicon brains with analog circuitry to mimic brain functionality.

The brain is inherently analog taking in raw sensory data and these chipmakers are trying to recreate the way the brain’s neurons and synapses work in traditional analog circuitry.

Analog chips can be very good low-power sensing devices especially for some sound and vision applications said Kevin Krewell an analyst at Tirias Research.

“Analog is a closer representation of how the brain acts using distributed memory cells to hold neuron weights or some other way to hold an analog weight” Krewell said.

AI and machine learning rely mostly on digital chips on the edge or in data centers. But there is a place for analog chips on the edge like in smartphones or cars which need instant intelligence without sending data to the cloud which is used to deliver AI services.

“We don’t aim to replace the complete AI pipeline” said Sumeet Kumar CEO of Innatera Nanosystems BV which is based in Rijkswijk Netherlands.

Innatera’s third-generation AI chip has 256 neurons and 65000 synapses and runs inference at under 1 milliwatt which doesn’t sound like a lot compared to the human brain which has 86 billion neurons and operates at around 20 watts. But Kumar said it is possible to create a fully connected recurrent network on top and the chip can operate on coin cell batteries.

The chip is being used by customers to run radar and audio applications with performance that is competitive to other chips in the same class. The goal of the chip is to incorporate low levels of learning and inference on the device which is considered a big challenge for AI among participants at the show.

“What we’re trying to do is what we recognize is that when data is moving from a sensor into the cloud it actually gets transformed at multiple stages by different kinds of AI. And what we very often see is customers doing low level sensor data handling in the cloud which is completely unnecessary” Kumar said.

The Innatera chip takes information coming in from a sensor which is converted into spikes and the content of the input is encoded into exactly when these spikes occur.

“That’s exactly how it happens in your brain. When you hear something there are … tiny hair [cells] in your ear which actually detects every frequency band and what is the energy within that band. And those hair [cells] will vibrate produce spikes which then go into the rest of your auditory cortex. Essentially we’re following that exact same principle” Kumar said.

Underlying that principle inside of the neurons of brains there are calcium ions and low sodium ions and those concentrations change over time. Innatera’s chip replicates that same sort of behavior using currents.

“We scale how much current is going into the neuron and coming out of the neuron. That’s how we are mimicking the brain” Kumar said.

The idea isn’t to disrupt the current AI flow into the cloud but to replace the current crop of AI chips on the edge that aren’t capable of making on-device decisions. The chip also reduces the process of converting analog signals to digital.

“You can’t really translate an analog signal over a long distance because then you actually have degradation. We avoid that by converting that analog signal into a spike” Kumar said.

The foundation of AI today is based on simulating the action of the brain’s neurons using digital chips and techniques which has been very successful. Based on the progress in Moore’s law those digital circuits and networks have gotten larger and faster.

But analog has its problems. For example it is harder to gain consistency across the analog chips with calibration issues like drift

“Analog circuits and memory cells don’t scale like digital circuits. And most times analog eventually has to be converted to digital to interact with the rest of the system” Krewell said.

To be sure the concept of neuromorphic chips isn’t new. Companies like Intel and IBM have been developing brain-inspired chips and universities are developing their own versions with analog circuitry. Intel and others have raised awareness of the difference between neuromorphic chips and conventional AI but the startups felt the need to push out their products as AI compute requirements and power efficiency are growing at an unsustainable pace.

Another AI chip company Rain Neuromorphics said its brain-mimicking chip would be used in particle accelerators at Argonne National Laboratory.

In a presentation at the AI Hardware Summit the company didn’t provide much detail on how the chip would be used but the company’s CEO Gordon Wilson said that the chip will act like silicon brains that would help the research lab study and draw conclusions on particle collisions.

The silicon brain will provide on-device intelligence to protect against sensor drift which can cause faulty data to be fed to AI systems. The concept of sensor drift is similar to model drift in AI in which bad data fed into a learning model can throw the AI system off course.

Wilson claimed the chip’s on-device capabilities are more power efficient compared to AI in the cloud.

“You need the ability to learn on the fly. You need the ability to train and fine tune against that sensor drift to maintain the performance of this system” Wilson said.

The first iteration of the Rain chip “will essentially not look radically different from … other analog or mixing of chips” Wilson said. But it will have the capacity to learn which will unlock more value.

Wilson pointed to possibly different types of memory like memristor circuits providing the ability to learn. Memristors have been under development since the 1960s and pursued by HP (which later became HPE) to use in a mega-computer called The Machine but the technology still remains a novelty.

“Memristor serves as a memory resistor. It’s a resistor that can adjust its resistance. It’s used as an artificial synapse” Wilson said. In a brain synapses are not required to be perfect and the requirements will be different for Rain’s memristors.

Forgot to link last timeList of SNES games that use special chips for those pondering things though it appears to be less of an issue here.I have not seen them yet though if it were to be done today it would probably be quite expensive.The usual cycle (and while I hesitate to use the word usual with FPGA stuff it has been enough years now) is we will see something done on a high end dev board by someone working with them an enthusiastic hacker (few thousand on a FPGA dev kit is within the realms of enthusiasts particularly if you can actually program one in anger) or someone in a university that is using them for a project. Somewhere in there someone will probably decap a CPU (and for the n64 probably the RDP as well https://www.retroreversing.com/n64rdp ) but it is not strictly necessary though can accelerate things. After that then we might see one repurposed from something elseYou may also recognise the name from various hacking scenes. https://debugmo.de/2008/03/thank-you-datel/ or one made for not so portable devices (making it all battery powered is a project in and of itself though this could change as some do also change). Only then would I expect portables to get a look in. Somewhere in the mix will also be fixes for certain problem chips modchips of notable scope and ability (in this case probably bypass some graphics concerns) some in hardware debugging expansion replication (don't know if we will see a N64DD a la https://gbatemp.net/threads/the-upc...h-cart-with-onboard-megacd-recreation.542791/ but it is the sort of thing I would be looking out for).The FPGA market is quite odd and subject to all sorts of oddities. Bitcoin changed things for a minute but then everything went for ASICs* low latency/high frequency wall street trading types bought them and were taught to program them (silliness ensued) when it became apparent they were very good for that (and then sold them on when they were done for next to nothing compared to what they were) they are quite often found in consumer devices that get recycled which changes things for some hackers. Similarly the makers of such things made things a bit easier in recent years as well as dropping the power draw somewhat.I do however have to also note the N64 is more a niche device than many others tackled -- it was a failure at the time and while some enthusiasts have sprung up in the years since then... yeah. Of course said enthusiasts have driven the prices sky high which is a thing to consider in this.*which could be an option here as well -- there are firms that for a not unreasonable amount of money will turn your FPGA code into silicon. Given the original N64 CPU was 350nm then quite reasonable to expect something even better for this (custom firms won't do modern Intel/Nvidia/AMD sort of levels but rather smaller than that).Others playing along at home then this video illustrates some of the trials and tribulations of making a N64 mini many of which will bleed over into the development of this though others get dodgedOthers still more of the ""what is an FPGA?"" persuasion wanting a bit more depth than it is a programmable chip then eevblog is good stuff",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhbmtvZGVzaWduLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3RoaXMtbmFwLXRpbWVyLWNvbmNlcHQtbWFycmllcy1zaW1wbGUtYW5hbG9nLWNvbnRyb2xzLXdpdGgtYS1kaWdpdGFsLWRpc3BsYXkv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueWFua29kZXNpZ24uY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvdGhpcy1uYXAtdGltZXItY29uY2VwdC1tYXJyaWVzLXNpbXBsZS1hbmFsb2ctY29udHJvbHMtd2l0aC1hLWRpZ2l0YWwtZGlzcGxheS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This nap timer concept marries simple analog controls with a digital display,"Most of us probably like taking naps during the day. Some people might even find it necessary to get through a tiring workday. There are studies suggesting that even a 20 to 30-minute “power nap” can be beneficial to productivity though the problem is getting that amount of time right without undercutting or overspending. We have alarm clocks for that of course including the ones that can be found on our smartphones. Despite the proliferation of these general-purpose utilities there’s still something to be said for a specialized tool dedicated solely to counting down the minutes until you wake up. Especially when said tool is a beautiful throwback to the past with some modern conveniences thrown in as well.

We have plenty of timers and clocks around our house or at the very least in our pockets. Most probably use their smartphones for anything that needs counting down or up while some might have a separate alarm clock beside their bed set to ring on one or a few specific times in a day. A dedicated nap timer however offers simplicity and ease of use. There are no other functions to worry about or other timers you might get confused with. Simply set the timer when you want to take a nap and that’s it.

It doesn’t get simpler than what the Spot 2 concept brings. It has one purpose and one purpose only to ring an alarm after a specified period of time. Its controls are dead simple too. There’s one large dial to set how long the timer goes and a smaller one for controlling the volume. These are presented as analog controls so there’s absolutely no ambiguity in how they work.

This mix of analog with digital has both aesthetic and psychological aspects. The latter brings back familiar physical controls putting the power back under our fingertips. At the same time the nap timer looks interesting and attractive especially with the ongoing trend to create retro-looking products. It isn’t all old-school of course with a monochrome display that prominently shows the timer as well as other details like the date time and even the temperature.

The Spot 2 nap timer concept is simple yet effective in conveying its purpose in an interesting yet easy-to-use manner. The dials leave little to the imagination in how to control the device while the digital display distills information down to only the most essential parts. After all when you’re body’s craving a short nap the last thing you want to do is fiddle with your phone or alarm clock and have your brain too distracted or too engaged to sleep.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoYXRoaWZpLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9pcy1ibHVldG9vdGgtaG9sZGluZy1iYWNrLWFwcGxlcy1haXJwb2RzLXdlLWFza2VkLXRoZS1tYW4td2hvLW1hZGUtdGhlbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the AirPods 3 were made – and how Apple plans to make them even better,"While there's every chance that you're not familiar with Gary Geaves millions of people across the world are familiar with his work. That's because he's the VP of Acoustics at Apple and he leads the team that's largely responsible for all of Apple's audio products – and for that matter the audio components in products such as iPhones and iPads.

It's always a pleasure to speak to the fabulously enthusiastic Geaves so I jumped at the opportunity to take a deep dive into the development of the AirPods 3 with him and Eric Treski from the Product Marketing Team.

It quickly became clear that much of the work in designing the new AirPods 3 revolved around trying to solve problems inherent in the brief to come up with a true-wireless in-ear headphone that crams into its tiny form next-gen technology such as Spatial Audio and ups the sound quality ante without resorting to a burrowing or noise-isolating design.

As you'll discover from this long chat Geaves and his team went to great lengths to overcome the obstacles presented but there's one problem that still persists and that we got to towards the end of our conversation. But first...

AirPods Pro 2 vs AirPods 3: what are the differences?

Who is Gary Geaves?

It may be slightly surprising to learn that the man leading the team behind such a tiny envelope-pushing device as the AirPods has a background in the British hi-fi industry most notably at Bowers & WIlkins but before that Geaves studied computational acoustics. He joined Apple about ten years ago to as he puts it “get more focus on audio”.

I’ve actually met Geaves before when I was given the opportunity to tour his team’s labs in Cupertino right around the launch of the first (now sadly discontinued) HomePod in 2018. I got a clear sense of the obsessive nature of Apple’s Acoustics Team during that visit. It’s of course no surprise that Apple has loads of money to throw around but the people I met and the facilities I saw suggested a serious appetite for acoustic problem-solving. That’s a very good thing considering the problems presented by the AirPods 3.

The challenges of non-burrowing earphones

Now I’m going to be upfront and say that I love an open non-isolating headphone. There are plenty of scenarios that call for noise isolation and/or cancellation most obviously those that involve planes trains buses children or chit-chatting colleagues but I do much of my listening while walking or jogging and at those times I actually want some background noise to reach my ears.

The so-called 'Transparency' modes of the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max are very impressive (as are many similar features offered by rival noise-cancelling headphones) but they can never sound as natural as a true open design. What’s more an in-ear headphone that sits outside the ear canal is always going to be more comfortable than one that’s wedged into it. Personally speaking I'm therefore glad that Apple has stuck with the non-burrowing design for the AirPods 3 even though doing so presented lots of challenges for Geaves and his team.

“We started with looking very closely at the strengths of the original AirPods” Geaves explains “and we know many people really like the effortless open fit that doesn’t stick into your ear canal and rests comfortably on your ear. That doesn’t create a seal which is what people like but it creates challenges for the audio team”.

The biggest challenge says Geaves is that “no two ears are alike – each person’s are a unique fit and what that means is the sound that people experience will be significantly different especially the bass”.

This is where Adaptive EQ which was first introduced with the AirPods Pro comes in: “we’ve added an inward-facing microphone” says Geaves “which continuously monitors what’s being played by the speaker and tunes the bass and to some extent midrange frequencies as well to deliver a really consistent frequency response regardless of the level of fit that each person gets”. The idea is that everyone hears the music the same way and the way the artist intended.

The intersection between liberal arts and technology

(Image credit: Apple)

That raises the question of course of how Apple gets to the point of thinking it knows what the artist intended. Geaves explains that the approach “is to really try and navigate the intersection between liberal arts and technology”.

The technology part “starts with a strong analytic foundation” as he puts it. “Over the years we’ve conducted really extensive measurements and we’ve done deep statistical research in order to inform a kind of internal acoustic analytic target response and we use that to design hardware around”.

One suspects that many companies would stop there particularly as Apple’s data is likely to be far more advanced than that available to the average headphones manufacturer but Apple is determined to not rely on analytics alone.

“We really understand that listening to music is an emotional experience which people connect with on a very deep level” Geaves says “so from the analytic tuning we work closely with an expert team of critical listeners and tuners. Many of these are folks from the pro audio industry and really what they try to do is intentionally refine the sound signature for each product AirPods in this case so that it’s accurate but it’s also exciting and moving”.

I imagine that someone with a background in computational acoustics someone clearly so data-driven would find it hard to hand a device built by science over to subjective human beings but I get the sense that Geaves is genuinely appreciative of this part of the design process: “we respect music and the emotional impact that it can make and we want to deliver this natural experience”.

The added complications of Spatial Audio

(Image credit: Apple)

The task of delivering the sound as intended apparently becomes much harder when a technology such as Spatial Audio is added into the mix but Geaves explains that Apple leverages its position in the industry to get opinions from the people creating the music: “we have whole teams of people who deal with the kind of interaction between engineering and artistic folks – they don’t let me near artistic folks because I’m too much of a fan to be honest with you – but we do take feedback from people delivering the content”.

Eric Treski jumps in here to explain how “full circle” this process is encompassing not only the Acoustics Team but also the Apple Music Team and the team behind GarageBand and Logic who have access to music producers and artists and from whom they take feedback.

But the differences between listeners are also even more of a factor with Spatial Audio than with stereo. “The shape of your ears the width of your head to some extent the placement of features on your face the shape of your head even mean that everybody hears sound differently” says Geaves.

“These differences can be mathematically categorised by something that’s called head related transfer function. You’ll see this referred to as HRTF frequently. In developing this feature we captured thousands of HRTFs on different people. And these are quite complex difficult measurements to do – we’re measuring the sound the response or your ear to a speaker in multiple different directions – and we really did that so that we could come up with the best HRTF that works for everyone which is again very easy to say and not easy to do. It’s not just creating an average it’s creating the HRTF that’s kind of closest to everybody’s perceptual response”.

The approach taken to tuning Spatial Audio specifically for music is complex too. As Geaves puts it “it’s very easy to come up with a convincing demo that’s very whizzbang but it’s not quite so easy to develop a feature that works across multiple people and multiple different products and multiple genres.

“We could really turn all of these nobs up to 11 and it would sound “oh well that’s big” and then after about a minute you go “you know what this is weird I don’t like this”.

The aim is for Spatial Audio to sound natural and convincing but that apparently isn’t straightforward. Given free three-dimensional rein “you have to take into account the position of your virtual speakers in space so how far are they are from you and the angle that they are in space things like reverberation time – so you need to choose whether you want your thing to sound like a cathedral or a very small room with lots of carpet and curtains in and things like that. You need to think about decay times of the sound channel gains and so on. And that’s a really artistic choice”.

Something I hadn’t realised is that Spatial Audio is tuned differently depending on the source device: “when watching a movie on Apple TV the virtual speakers are placed further away from you than when you’re watching on an iPhone” Geaves says. Apparently it would just sound weird to combine a fairly small screen that’s quite close to you with virtual speakers that seem a long way away.

The Bluetooth problem

The AirPods 3 were essentially built from the ground up using custom-made components. “Nothing’s off the shelf” as Geaves puts it. That includes the “very low distortion” loudspeaker which is integrated into “quite a complicated acoustic system” that regulates the movement of the speaker minimises pressure in the ear canal and features a “carefully tuned bass port”. The AirPods 3 also feature a “brand new custom amplifier” that apparently combines high dynamic range with very low latency (which is particularly crucial for head-tracked Spatial Audio) and serious power-efficiency.

Everything points to Apple taking sound quality very seriously with the AirPods 3 and all of its modern-day audio products for that matter and the recent launches of Lossless Hi-Res Lossless and (in a slightly different way) Spatial Audio point to a real push towards higher audio quality. But there’s a catch as far as I can see it – a bottle-neck that’s been preventing real qualitative leaps in the sound of wireless headphones essentially since wireless headphones came into being. I’m talking about Bluetooth of course which almost all wireless headphones including AirPods rely upon and which doesn’t have the data rate for hi-res or even lossless audio. I ask Geaves whether the use of Bluetooth is holding back his hardware and stifling sound quality.

“Obviously the wireless technology is critical for the content delivery that you talk about” he says “but also things like the amount of latency you get when you move your head and if that’s too long between you moving your head and the sound changing or remaining static it will make you feel quite ill so we have to concentrate very hard on squeezing the most that we can out of the Bluetooth technology and there’s a number of tricks we can play to maximise or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth. But it’s fair to say that we would like more bandwidth and… I’ll stop right there. We would like more bandwidth” he smiles.

Reading between the lines I reckon Apple has a plan for overcoming Bluetooth’s current limitations. That could be as simple as switching to Qualcomm’s recently announced aptX Lossless format but I wonder if Apple might have its own alternative to Bluetooth up its sleeve.

While it's clear that Geaves would love to go deeper into this topic right now it's obvious that he's not allowed to do so. It seems that we'll just have to wait for the next generation of AirPods to find out whether he and his team have managed to solve the Bluetooth problem and develop a pair of genuinely hi-res wireless headphones.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

School Board approves raise for teachers,"BATH CO. Ky. (WKYT) - At last months meeting Bath County School Board members approved a 2% raise for teachers. After some backlash the board reconvened and approved a larger 5% raise this time.

“The districts that have the funds are raising their teachers salaries. We are in a position where we don’t have the economic advantages the other districts have. So if we don’t at least try to compete at least to a 3% on the yearly rate we fall farther and farther behind” said Superintendent Steven Evans.

Superintendent Evans said he’s pushed for a 5% raise because many teachers are looking at positions in other districts or have already left. And he said he can’t blame them.

“Eventually it doesn’t make sense to become a teacher in this county when you can drive down the road and make $10000 more dollars.”

It’s these teachers who filled the board meeting and applauded after learning they’d receive the larger raise.

“This opportunity to give 5 our finance director says she can never remember doing a 5%. So it’s not a game changer but it’s a good boost in the arm for them. And they deserve it.”

All classified personnel will receive a $1 per hour raise as well. Many classified personnel make under $20 per hour and wouldn’t have been eligible for the percentage raise otherwise.

The board previously approved a $1000 stipend with the 2% raise. The stipend was removed with the larger raise tonight.

For BMS the layoffs are tied to a recent acquisition.

In separate Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) alerts filed this week AbbVie and BMS let California know they plan to lay off 99 and 261 employees respectively in November.

AbbVie’s workers are being let go from a single facility in Irvine which the city’s chamber of commerce lists as an Allergan manufacturing site. AbbVie bought Allergan for $63 billion back in 2019.

AbbVie did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma’s request for comment on the layoffs.

Moving down the coast BMS’ workforce is shrinking across two separate sites in San Diego County one of which bears the same address as Turning Point Therapeutics’ home base. BMS snapped up cancer specialist Turning Point for $4.1 billion in August.

A BMS spokesperson confirmed over email that the slim-down relates to that deal. All told 261 staffers are being let go in connection with the acquisition.

“We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics to further strengthen our leading oncology franchise” BMS’ spokesperson said. “As part of the integration all incoming employees received retention packages tied to continued service to BMS for a period of time and have been encouraged to apply to long-term roles at BMS after their retention period ends.”

Alongside the biotech industry which has suffered a spate of layoffs and restructurings this year employees at Big Pharmas have been caught in recent job-cut crossfire too.

In July reports surfaced that Biogen employed around 300 fewer people in Massachusetts than it had in September 2021. Biogen telegraphed the job cuts in March when it rolled out plans to “substantially eliminate” the commercial infrastructure for its struggling Alzheimer’s disease drug Aduhelm. Altogether the company has laid out a cost-saving target of $1 billion.

Back out west Teva Pharmaceutical is downsizing in The Golden State too. Last month the Israeli-American generics giant said it would eliminate 305 jobs at its Irvine injectables plant—located in the same city where AbbVie’s workers are set to be dismissed.

A Teva spokesperson ultimately confirmed that the “Irvine facility will not resume production and the company is either transferring or ceasing production of medicines made at the site.”

But the layoffs underway at Novartis easily eclipse all of those other cuts. The company in June unveiled plans to ax 8000 jobs worldwide on a quest to save $1 billion. During a media event in Zurich last month the Swiss pharma added that of the 1400 jobs it plans to cut in its home country up to half will be leadership roles.

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar. And Wall Street firms have started up hundreds of brand-new E.S.G. dedicated funds — seeking to cash in on growing investor demand for such investments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUvMjYwMjQ5L2V4ZXJjaXNlX2NhcnR3aGVlbF90YWN0aWNhbF9jb21iYXRfY2FzdWFsdHlfY2FyZV90cmFpbmluZ9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUtYW1wLzI2MDI0OS9leGVyY2lzZV9jYXJ0d2hlZWxfdGFjdGljYWxfY29tYmF0X2Nhc3VhbHR5X2NhcmVfdHJhaW5pbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exercise Cartwheel Tactical Combat Casualty Care Training,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUvMjYwMjQ5L2V4ZXJjaXNlX2NhcnR3aGVlbF90YWN0aWNhbF9jb21iYXRfY2FzdWFsdHlfY2FyZV90cmFpbmluZ9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXkubWlsL2FydGljbGUtYW1wLzI2MDI0OS9leGVyY2lzZV9jYXJ0d2hlZWxfdGFjdGljYWxfY29tYmF0X2Nhc3VhbHR5X2NhcmVfdHJhaW5pbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951231360>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning did not specify what the sanctions would be against Gregory Hayes chairman and CEO of Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Ted Colbert president and CEO of Boeing Defense Space and Security.

It wasn’t immediately clear what impact they would have on the executives or their companies but such sanctions are often mainly symbolic in nature.

The U.S. announced a $1.09 billion arms sale to Taiwan last week including $355 million for Boeing’s Harpoon missiles and $85 million for Raytheon’s Sidewinder missiles.

“We once again urge the U.S. government and relevant parties to ... stop arms sales to Taiwan and military contact with Taiwan and stop creating new factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait” Mao said at a daily briefing.

China claims Taiwan a self-governing island of 23 million people off its east coast as its territory and says it must eventually come under its control. Taiwan and China split in 1949 during a civil war that brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing.

The U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan under its one-China policy but is the island’s main supplier of military equipment and is bound by its own laws to ensure Taiwan can defend itself.

Mao also expressed China’s opposition to an upcoming Taiwan trip by Czech lawmakers. A 14-member delegation is to arrive Sunday for a six-day visit according to Taiwan media reports.

“China is firmly opposed to any form of official contact between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic relations with China” Mao said.

She called on the Czech lawmakers “to refrain from sending the wrong signals to the separatist forces of Taiwan independence and to stop undermining ... bilateral relations.”

In February China announced sanctions on Raytheon and Lockheed Martin over a $100 million deal for maintenance of Taiwan’s missile defense systems by the two companies.

China also protested a bill that was approved by a U.S. Senate committee this week that could significantly increase American military support for Taiwan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzkvMTYvY2hpbmEtc2FuY3Rpb25zLWNlb3Mtb2YtYm9laW5nLWRlZmVuc2UtcmF5dGhlb24tb3Zlci10YWl3YW4tYXJtc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMi85LzE2L2NoaW5hLXNhbmN0aW9ucy1jZW9zLW9mLWJvZWluZy1kZWZlbnNlLXJheXRoZW9uLW92ZXItdGFpd2FuLWFybXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China sanctions CEOs of Boeing Defense Raytheon over Taiwan arms,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzkvMTYvY2hpbmEtc2FuY3Rpb25zLWNlb3Mtb2YtYm9laW5nLWRlZmVuc2UtcmF5dGhlb24tb3Zlci10YWl3YW4tYXJtc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMi85LzE2L2NoaW5hLXNhbmN0aW9ucy1jZW9zLW9mLWJvZWluZy1kZWZlbnNlLXJheXRoZW9uLW92ZXItdGFpd2FuLWFybXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239529A38B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

For BMS the layoffs are tied to a recent acquisition.

In separate Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) alerts filed this week AbbVie and BMS let California know they plan to lay off 99 and 261 employees respectively in November.

AbbVie’s workers are being let go from a single facility in Irvine which the city’s chamber of commerce lists as an Allergan manufacturing site. AbbVie bought Allergan for $63 billion back in 2019.

AbbVie did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma’s request for comment on the layoffs.

Moving down the coast BMS’ workforce is shrinking across two separate sites in San Diego County one of which bears the same address as Turning Point Therapeutics’ home base. BMS snapped up cancer specialist Turning Point for $4.1 billion in August.

A BMS spokesperson confirmed over email that the slim-down relates to that deal. All told 261 staffers are being let go in connection with the acquisition.

“We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics to further strengthen our leading oncology franchise” BMS’ spokesperson said. “As part of the integration all incoming employees received retention packages tied to continued service to BMS for a period of time and have been encouraged to apply to long-term roles at BMS after their retention period ends.”

Alongside the biotech industry which has suffered a spate of layoffs and restructurings this year employees at Big Pharmas have been caught in recent job-cut crossfire too.

In July reports surfaced that Biogen employed around 300 fewer people in Massachusetts than it had in September 2021. Biogen telegraphed the job cuts in March when it rolled out plans to “substantially eliminate” the commercial infrastructure for its struggling Alzheimer’s disease drug Aduhelm. Altogether the company has laid out a cost-saving target of $1 billion.

Back out west Teva Pharmaceutical is downsizing in The Golden State too. Last month the Israeli-American generics giant said it would eliminate 305 jobs at its Irvine injectables plant—located in the same city where AbbVie’s workers are set to be dismissed.

A Teva spokesperson ultimately confirmed that the “Irvine facility will not resume production and the company is either transferring or ceasing production of medicines made at the site.”

But the layoffs underway at Novartis easily eclipse all of those other cuts. The company in June unveiled plans to ax 8000 jobs worldwide on a quest to save $1 billion. During a media event in Zurich last month the Swiss pharma added that of the 1400 jobs it plans to cut in its home country up to half will be leadership roles.

Two drugmakers told California officials that they plan to cut up to 360 jobs in the state in unrelated moves according to public notices filed and made public earlier this week.

Bristol Myers Squibb plans to cut up to 261 jobs in San Diego according to the filings. A company spokesperson said the job cuts follow the company’s $4.1 billion acquisition of drug developer Turning Point Therapeutics headquartered in Torrey Pines.

The deal closed in August.

The conglomerate’s local location near Torrey Pines joins its other California sites in San Francisco Brisbane and Redwood City. In a Bristol Myers Squibb fact sheet about its California operations the company said it employed 681 people in the state as of December 2020.

“All incoming employees received retention packages tied to continued service to BMS for a period of time and have been encouraged to apply to long-term roles at BMS after their retention period ends” the spokesperson said in an email.

Separately AbbVie Inc. plans to cut up to 99 jobs in Irvine the company told the state. The firm did not respond to a request for comment.

The job cuts were previously reported by Endpoints News.

The creative software company on Sept. 15 reported mixed quarterly results and announced the $20 billion acquisition of Figma Inc. a small private company operating in the same segment.

Adobe will pay an eye-popping premium for the target at about 50x Figma's expected 2022 annual recurring revenue and 2x its most recent pre-money valuation. Such high valuations may have been less surprising during the record technology M&A run in late 2020 and through 2021 but it is less congruent with the increasingly cautious market of 2022.

On earnings Adobe posted modest profit beats and a slight miss on revenue compared to analyst forecasts according to S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates. But those metrics also underscored a dramatically decelerating business for the company with revenue growth decelerating by 58% compared to the prior year.

Ultimately investors were displeased selling off 16.8% of Adobe's stock in a day.

Adobe's public pummeling comes after a tough nine months for many IT equities. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index has lost 26.2% for the year through Sept. 15.

Traders seem particularly skeptical of mature software-as-a-service or SaaS companies. For example Salesforce Inc. is one of Adobe's most comparable peers by market capitalization and financial performance. Year-to-date through Sept. 15 Salesforce shares are down 39.1%. Adobe's shares have dipped 45.5% over the same period including the drop after the Figma deal announcement.

The bearish turn for SaaS equities comes despite generally upbeat analyst commentary about the low-expense high-margin business. For example average analyst ratings for both Adobe and Salesforce are in the ""buy"" and ""outperform"" range according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Figma runs gross margins in the 90% range Adobe CFO Daniel Durn said during a Sept. 15 earnings call. Adobe itself holds more cash and short-term investments than it does debt making it one of the few publicly traded technology companies with negative net debt according to Market Intelligence data. The company will pay Figma's gold-plated price tag with cash stock and possibly a short-term term loan so even its largest acquisition to date will not stir Adobe's serene balance sheet.

While investors may have turned negative on high-profile SaaS stocks M&A buyers have seen considerable value.

Deal volumes and values for SaaS vendors have been climbing steadily over the years and 2022 is keeping pace with records set in 2021. For M&A transactions targeting an SaaS company deal volumes grew to 2007 transactions in 2021 from 849 in 2017. Deal values skyrocketed to $335.48 billion from just $43.72 billion over the same period up over 7x. Year-to-date SaaS deal volumes reached 1824 transactions and aggregate values were at $247.06 billion according to 451 Research.

SaaS companies also command a premium over other technology models. Buyers valued the average SaaS enterprise at 4.8x trailing-12-month revenue year-to-date down from a 2021 peak of 6.7x. Across all technology and telecommunications targets valuations averaged just 3.1x year-to-date and 4.3x in 2021 according to 451.

Illustrating the exploding investment interest on the part of corporate buyers the 10 largest strategic SaaS transactions over the past 20 years have been announced since 2019 and only two carried trailing revenue multiples under 10x. The Figma acquisition is the sixth-largest SaaS deal and Adobe is paying its premium at a time when other corporate buyers are putting their M&A strategy on ice. The average price-to-revenue multiple for technology transactions involving a strategic buyer dropped to 1.8x in July and early August according to 451.

One of the highest SaaS M&A valuations came from Salesforce which bid 36.4x trailing revenue for Slack Technologies in 2020. The largest SaaS transaction of all time Broadcom Inc.'s $61.00 billion bid for VMware Inc. carried a trailing revenue multiple of 5.3x.

Adobe did not provide specific trailing-revenue metrics for Figma in its acquisition announcements but the buyer did indicate that Figma will cross $400 million in annual recurring revenue in 2022 after adding $200 million since 2021. That puts the price tag at about 50x 2022 annual recurring revenue and 100x 2021 annual recurring revenue.

That implies an easy frontrunner for the highest trailing-revenue valuation among the top 10 SaaS transactions since 2002.

On Counsell’s watch the Milwaukee Brewers developed All-Star pitchers without drafting them at the top of the first round or fast-tracking them into the major-league rotation. Brown’s curiosity and studious approach to the game led him down this path.

“I had gone into a deep Corbin Burnes dive last year when I was struggling” Brown said. “This was right in the middle of it. This was me struggling in Triple A and then getting hurt. I can tell you about a lot of guys who had bounce-back years.”

Brown laughed and continued: “I did the same thing when I had Tommy John. I can probably rattle off every dude who had TJ in all of North America.”

Brown’s Tommy John surgery cost him most of the 2019 season but he popped up as a prospect in the summer of 2022 when the Philadelphia Phillies traded him for veteran reliever David Robertson. By this time last year Brown had already earned a promotion from Double-A Tennessee and submitted two lights-out starts for the Iowa Cubs. The phone call every player dreams about did not happen.

Opening Day rolled around this season and Brown was still waiting. And then Justin Steele dropped to the ground with a strained left hamstring in the fifth inning of Game 1 making Brown the next man up. Brown 24 struggled in his major-league debut before quickly settling into a hybrid role that took him off the roster bubble.

Brown’s value could be seen in Friday’s 7-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates as he replaced starter Javier Assad and threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings that featured six strikeouts against one walk. Managing Brown’s workload — he threw fewer than 100 innings last year — is a bigger issue than determining whether he belongs.

Brown’s future could be in the rotation — the 6-foot-6 210-pound right-hander certainly looks the part — and the Cubs will keep open that possibility. His heavy fastball/curveball combination has also led reporters to ask Counsell whether Brown could emerge as the team’s closer.

“Ben’s best asset right now is he throws really hard” Counsell said. “Without being too analytical it’s just the hitters’ reaction. He’s beating hitters with the fastball. That’s not easy to do in the big leagues. No matter what your velocity is it’s just not easy to do. He’s beating hitters with the fastball and that makes you cheat. And that makes his off-speed very good. That’s kind of his formula.”

Counsell’s formula for small-market success included more than just Burnes and Woodruff. They were never regarded as generational pitching prospects like Paul Skenes the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft who debuted Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park. Woodruff was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs seven times between July 2017 and July 2018 an example of the roster management that showed Counsell’s dexterity during Milwaukee’s rise.

“He has an excellent track record” Brown said mentioning Josh Hader Devin Williams and Freddy Peralta by name. “There are some really good arms that Craig really helped develop.”

As a rookie in 2018 Burnes went 7-0 with a 2.61 ERA in 30 appearances out of the bullpen a midseason boost that helped the Brewers force a Game 163 at Wrigley Field and take away a division title from the Cubs. Burnes split the next season between the majors (8.82 ERA) and Triple-A San Antonio (8.46 ERA). His name then appeared in the Cy Young Award voting in each of the next four years and he won the award in 2021.

Progress as Cubs executives like to say isn’t always linear. Brown spent a month-plus on the injured list with a strained left oblique and finished last season working out of Iowa’s bullpen. He needed those reminders when his development stalled.

“Corbin Burnes went through that one funky year before he ended (up) going off for a Cy Young ride” Brown said. “Woodruff was a little bit of a late bloomer as well. There’s the (Jacob) deGroms of the world who didn’t debut until he was (almost) 26. Last year with my frustration I was like ‘Hey there’s still hope for me to be a good baseball player one day.’”

Brown’s self-awareness and dedication to his craft should help him continue to make adjustments. He has a 2.84 ERA in four starts and four multi-inning appearances as a reliever. His fastball velocity (96.5 mph) is elite. His strikeout rate (25.8 percent) is above average on a staff that doesn’t have that much classic swing-and-miss stuff.

Brown’s personality traits will also likely keep him in Counsell’s circle of trust. It’s not like the Cubs are going to suddenly get healthy. Before Saturday’s game in Pittsburgh the team placed reliever Yency Almonte on the 15-day injured list with a strained right shoulder and recalled right-hander José Cuas from Iowa. Whatever Counsell needs Brown will be available.

“It’s all good” Brown said. “Put in the time. Put in the work. And try not to worry too much about going down or whatever. It’s been awesome.”

Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control. For information about donating or volunteering visit the International Bird Rescue website."

Under the deal all seven of Mush Media’s podcasts — including Iacono’s Against All Odds and Extra Points shows — will live under Omaha’s lineup of original audio shows. Omaha will produce video versions of the podcasts to be published on ESPN’s YouTube channel and ESPN will retain the distribution and ad sales rights to the Mush podcasts similarly to other shows in the Omaha Audio Network.

Jimmy Kimmel Iacono’s cousin and frequent collaborator will also partner with Omaha and Mush to write and produce original videos for Omaha’s social channels.

“Cousin Sal has been making sports fans laugh for two decades. He’s built a great reputation by delivering fans content in a fun and authentic way” Manning the founder of Omaha Productions said in a statement. “Having the opportunity to team up with him and Jimmy to create original audio and video is an exciting next step as we continue to build Omaha.”

“I’m very excited to join the Omaha family. Over the years I’ve won so much money betting on Peyton and Eli I feel like I should be paying them. But since the contract is already signed I think we’re good” Iacono added.

Earlier this summer Omaha struck a content deal with Caesars Entertainment and the digital betting firm Caesars Sportsbook that included the launch of a formal podcast business for Omaha. Podcast hosts in the Omaha Audio Network include Vince Carter Cameron Heyward Greg McElroy Katie Mox Kyle Brandt and Mina Kimes."

But over a hundred and twenty years ago on that location on Prospect Avenue as Hollywood Boulevard was then known was the Hotel Hollywood a gracious building erected in December 1902 by the “Father of Hollywood” real estate developer H.J. Whitley. (The name would be changed to the Hollywood Hotel in 1910.) The famous “Balloon Route” of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad would drop guests off at its front door.

Prospect Avenue at the turn of the century was a quiet country road in the middle of lemon orchards and vegetable fields populated by the occasional deer and flights of quail and doves. Once the area was zoned for business the Bank of Hollywood was set up on the northeast corner of Prospect and Highland in 1901 with George W. Hoover a business partner of Whitley’s as its president.

Whitley had bought 480 acres of land and contracted Hoover to build his hotel. His purpose was to establish a residential area north of Prospect called the Ocean View Tract along with a business neighborhood around the intersection of Prospect and Highland and sell the parcels of land. He set about attracting the pioneers of the fledgling film industry to his town. The move West made sense – there were acres of land to build studios and the sun always shone. So Louis B. Mayer Carl Laemmle Harry Warner Irving Thalberg and Jesse Lasky all came to Hollywood and moved into the Hollywood Hotel.

The hotel was built in the Mission Revival style. It was made of wood but the facades were stucco. Verandas wrapped around the structure overlooked the pepper and lemon trees that surrounded it.

“The Story of Hollywood” by Gregory Paul Williams tells of how the first wing of the hotel opened in 1903 with 33 rooms and two baths. It had its own power station and an ice plant. Whitley brought prospective home buyers to tour the area and held a banquet for them at the hotel. A hundred guests were feted on its official opening day.

According to Hadley Meares writing on KCET.org “The hotel quickly became the country club of early Hollywood society. There were art exhibitions of still life paintings by genteel ladies social dances with music by the Wetzel Orchestra and banquets featuring menus of ‘fastidious taste.’ At one large banquet celebrating the 1905 expansion of the hotel 300 guests in full evening dress sat at tables covered in jonquils while the Venetian Ladies orchestra provided music.”

The 1905 expansion included an addition to the structure bringing the number of guest rooms to 144 and including a ballroom and chapel and a new entrance. The hotel now stretched to Orchid Avenue to the west.

The renovations so impressed lumber heiress Almira Hershey that she bought the hotel and leased it to Margaret J. Anderson a widow with two children who also managed the property. Anderson had expanded the hotel’s rooms to 250 by the time she left in 1911 after a falling out with Hershey. The two sued each other and the lawsuits dragged out for two years. Anderson left to open the Beverly Hills Hotel after the Rodeo Land and Water Company made her an offer to own the new hotel. After she resigned she took a lot of the Hollywood Hotel’s staff and guests with her.

However by 1911 15 movie companies had moved to Hollywood and the Hollywood Hotel was still popular especially with actors. Afternoon tea was served every day. Thursday night dances were popular and so were the Sunday evening concerts. The hotel’s dining room served five-course meals. As a precursor to the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame the dining room of the hotel had stars with the names of its famous guests on its ceiling including Charlie Chaplin Douglas Fairbanks Alla Nazimova Greta Garbo and Buster Keaton. The Thursday night dances brought out stars like Gloria Swanson Mabel Normand John Gilbert and Wallace Reid.

“The Story of Hollywood” recounts how the puritanical Hershey kept a strict eye on the celebrities acting being considered a low profession at the time. She counted the courses they were served so they wouldn’t grab extra food and made sure that the actresses were alone in their rooms by tapping on their doors nightly. She monitored the ballroom and made sure the dancing didn’t get too amorous. But she couldn’t control the alcohol that guests smuggled into the hotel.

Actor Ben Lyon told the Los Angeles Times “What a thrill it was to be living under the same roof that had housed Valentino Thomas Meighan Charlie Farrell Gilbert Roland and many other great stars! However there was one catch which we all were aware of and that was the Thursday night dance in the lobby. The…elderly charming and buxom… [Miss] Hershey…adored dancing to the three-piece orchestra. But she was not a Leslie Caron…we young male guests had to line up and take turns dancing her around the lobby or chance being asked to give up our rooms. Needless to say we danced with her.”

Rudolf Valentino the famous silent movie star who started his career as a dancer would dance the tango in the hotel’s ballroom. One of his partners was screenwriter June Mathis who cast him in Metro’s Four Horseman of the Apocalypse which made him a star and led to his movie The Sheik which will forever be associated with his stardom. It was in the lobby of the Hollywood Hotel that he met his first wife actress Jean Acker. The two married in 1919 and spent their honeymoon night there where she locked him out of their room Room 264. (She was a lesbian reportedly dating movie star Alla Nazimova; the marriage was never consummated and an “interlocutory” divorce was granted them only in 1922.) Apparently hordes of tourists requested Valentino’s room and the hotel was not slow in designating every room as his.

There is also the story of actress Mae Murray a resident of the hotel in 1916 according to a census document who moved into the hotel with one of her four husbands – the record is unclear about which one – on their wedding night and then was kicked down the stairs by him two hours later. She fled the hotel.

Actress Virginia Rappe also lived in the Hollywood Hotel. She was the starlet who caused the downfall of star Fatty Arbuckle when she was found raped and dead at a party they attended. It is likely that she met him at the hotel where he was a frequent attendee of the Thursday night dances.

In 1934 powerful Hearst syndicate gossip columnist Louella Parsons started her radio show “Hollywood Hotel” ostensibly from the hotel but actually recorded in a studio. Hers was the first radio show to originate from the West coast and was even distributed in Canada and Australia. It was a sort of variety show with songs film gossip an interview with a movie star and a 20-minute dramatized adaptation of an upcoming movie the first episode featuring Claudette Colbert who was appearing in Imitation of Life. The actors were not paid to appear but received a case of soup from the program’s sponsor Campbell’s Soup Company.

A 1937 movie musical called Hollywood Hotel was based on the radio show and starred Parsons in a small role Warner Bros’ biggest musical star Dick Powell and an uncredited Ronald Reagan. It is best known for its striking number “Hooray for Hollywood” a visual extravaganza choreographed by Busby Berkeley with dancers dressed in calla lily-covered gowns dancing through a montage of neon signs of Hollywood’s best-known landmarks – the Brown Derby Trocadero the Ambassador Hotel Grauman’s Chinese Theater and Hollywood Boulevard. Warner Bros. made the movie without getting permission to use the name and was sued by both the Campbell Soup Company and the Hollywood Hotel. Some exteriors of the hotel appear in the film.

Hershey died in 1930 and her heirs sold the hotel in 1947. By now it was seedy and run down its residents mostly elderly sitting on the porch in their rocking chairs. In 1956 the hotel was razed to make way for the First Federal Savings and Loan of Hollywood building which in turn gave way to the Hollywood and Highland mall in 1998.

The hotel’s guest ledger is now in the Smithsonian.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWFydGNvbXBhbnkuY29tLmF1L2ZpbmFuY2UvbWVyZ2Vycy1hbmQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2ZvdXJuLXR3ZW50eS1waWVzLWljb25pYy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWJyYW5kcy1zb2xkLW9mZi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four'N Twenty ownership heads overseas joining other iconic labels,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.smartcompany.com.au', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /finance/mergers-and-acquisitions/fourn-twenty-pies-iconic-australian-brands-sold-off-internationally/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951B00160>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWFydGNvbXBhbnkuY29tLmF1L2ZpbmFuY2UvbWVyZ2Vycy1hbmQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2ZvdXJuLXR3ZW50eS1waWVzLWljb25pYy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWJyYW5kcy1zb2xkLW9mZi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki is also on the show as a sideline reporter breaking down key numbers behind the matchups.

The three students — Levi Showalter Emma Foley and Ryan Zhang — will take on students from Syracuse in the final qualifying round tonight September 16.

Showalter is a junior from Millmont Pennsylvania majoring in plant sciences. His favorite trivia categories are biology and religion. Foley is a freshman from Wilmington Delaware majoring in wildlife & fisheries science. Her favorite trivia categories include history literature and pop culture. Finally Zhang is a junior from Lancaster Pennsylvania majoring in physics and mathematics. His specialties include physics math mythology and classical music.

If the trio were to win the competition they would win the “Capital One College Bowl” trophy as well as “life-changing scholarship money.” In order to win that however they have to beat the team from Syracuse first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdG9kYXkudW1kLmVkdS9zdGFkaXVtLXRvLWJlLXJlbmFtZWQtaW4tbmV3LXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtc2VjddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stadium to Be Renamed in New Partnership With SECU,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='today.umd.edu', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /stadium-to-be-renamed-in-new-partnership-with-secu (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239507BF430>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdG9kYXkudW1kLmVkdS9zdGFkaXVtLXRvLWJlLXJlbmFtZWQtaW4tbmV3LXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtc2VjddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

A good guess is anyone who initially put a creaky trailer or unassuming cottage on one of those first steep and rocky waterside lots back in the mid-1960s would hardly recognize those 32 liquid square miles and hardwood-speckled shores now.

The trailers and small houses are still around but now increasingly crowded by waterfront properties valued at seven figures and up.

After the inevitable series of ups and downs in the real estate market since the lake attained its first 795-foot surface level (the engineers’ term is “full pond”) in 1966 signs point to what could be another period of sustained growth.

So just how big is the Smith Mountain Lake community? That depends on how you measure it. There are no formal legal boundaries but census data and computer mapping can provide some numbers. Within about two miles of the water there are 19073 people according to mapping done by Matt Miller of the Roanoke Regional Partnership. Within about five miles of the water there are 67090 people according to mapping done by Eric Schmidt the GIS coordinator for Franklin County. For comparison purposes that latter figure is in the neighborhood of Lynchburg which is home to 79009 people. Even the former is just slightly smaller than Waynesboro. Also for the wider geography shown below the median age is 47.9 further evidence that the lake area is more than a retirement community.

With this wider geography there are 67.090 people. Courtesy of Eric Schmidt GIS coordinator Franklin County.

There’s more.

To put a finer piece of detail on the picture Andy Bruns executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce posited that what’s going on here is so big many cannot grasp what they’re seeing when they take in the entire lake area contained in its three home counties of Franklin Bedford and Pittsylvania.

“The reason people don’t realize the wealth that is accumulated around this lake is because we are carved up into three counties” he said. “If just the shoreline was its own little county it would be the richest county per capita in the state.”

To put numbers on the current splendor meet real estate broker Deborah F. Beran of Deb Beran Properties.

The Realtor has kept track of average single family waterfront property prices forever and published them since 2004.

Beran has lived at the lake for 35 years with nearly three decades in real estate sales. Her July figures for sales covering the entire lake establish an average $1.05 million price for houses averaging 3357 square feet.

Compare that to 2004 averages: $534303 for 2720 square feet.

“The last couple of years the whole world has changed” she said. “I’ve seen the lake really grow up to become a mature township of its own. When the pandemic and quarantines came and people were allowed to work from home they arrived here in droves.

“They not only came from the big cities; we’ve seen an influx from the West Coast and even from Europe. People have said if I’m going to be quarantined I want to be in a safe haven.”

A port in the pandemic storm if you will.

Chamber director Bruns is convinced by demographic data he studies as well as anecdotal evidence that the new arrivals are younger with some possibly having the buying power of the previous generation of homeowners.

The difference was the typical lakefront buyer then was older and looking for an investment property or retirement home.

Is this the mother of all SML demographic shifts in progress? Bruns a former newspaper executive whose last stop was Roanoke is among those who hope – indeed believe – so.

“The anecdotal evidence I hear is it is changing dramatically” he said. “It’s getting younger with more people year-round.”

Should any part of that be true as it seems to be Bruns sees dramatic implications.

“If it is starting to change and that’s what I’m hoping and if the lake is getting younger and it’s growing in population with people living here year-round that’s a game-changer not just for the lake but the entire region.”

On the be careful what you wish for front Franklin County economic development director Beth Simms offers a word of caution about such apparently thrilling tidings.

“Everything is not as it seems” she said. “Yes it’s great having people moving in with disposable income. But that also means we are going to have to have more [emergency medical technicians] to serve those people. If they have kids we may need more schoolteachers. They may want more parks and recreation amenities.

“When you have such increases it also adds a stress on our services.”

Not to be forgotten she said was the local composite index the formula the state uses to fund local education. A key component ties real estate values to the state’s educational contribution. Increasing real estate values indicate a corresponding drop in state education funding to the locality.

Bruns tended to agree with her point.

“Those new people with disposable income are going to want services. And they’re going to need people working in those restaurants. And those people must live somewhere which means a need for affordable housing.”

Things are not always as they seem.

“It’s great we have million-dollar home after million-dollar home” Bruns said “but those people are not going to want to continue to live here if they have to drive 45 minutes to do anything.”

For one indication of what he’s talking about consider publicity information for the snazzy Union Hall development and amphitheater-included (musical entertainment twangs and toots all over the lake these days) The Coves at its website. On a list of frequently asked questions one reads: “How far is the nearest full-service grocery store?”

Answer: “Within 25 minutes drive there are Kroger stores at both the east end of Rocky Mount (on state highway 40) and at the Westlake Shopping Mall in Hardy (on Booker T Washington Highway).”

Perhaps it is coincidence that nugget was the last on a list of 16 FAQs.

For additional information about growth patterns at the lake the chamber contracted with a company called Datafy that specializes in tourist traffic analysis for specific locations. The latest report arrived in July and tracks not tourists but new full-time lake residents since 2020. The chamber has similar figures going back to February 2018.

The latest report from this summer used methodology that followed cellphone data to reach its conclusions.

First the phone must come from 20 miles or more from the lake for its owner to be considered a “move.” Those who remained at the lake throughout the study period up to at least 60 days prior to June of this year indicate the owner is a permanent resident.

Bruns and his wife who have lived all over the country moved into their Moneta home – their No. 2 buy at the lake since discovering the place a while back – in 2020. That’s how he knows the Datafy numbers work. One glance down the list and his phone turned up right where it should be.

Through what is called “geo-location data collection” originating home zip codes may be determined. After a typical waiting period of 60 to 90 days at the same location following a move the zip code is “reassigned” and considered permanent.

Note that one phone counts as one individual not a full household. So for example four phones with origins in Timbuktu may be under one roof after the move is established.

The figures cover Franklin Bedford and Pittsylvania counties as well as specifics for Rocky Mount and Moneta.

Let’s look at Franklin County for an idea of what the stats show.

Off the bat 61 percent of the arrivals are coming from elsewhere in Virginia a hunk from Northern Virginia. Next up is North Carolina (9 percent) Florida (4) an undefined “Other Midwest” (3) and Pennsylvania Maryland South Carolina and West Virginia (2 each).

Notable 1 percenters include California Utah and New York..

Across the lake in Bedford with 1339 tracked 51 percent arrived from in-state followed by “Other Southeast” (10); North Carolina (9); “Other Midwest” (6); West Virginia (5); and Missouri (4).

“North Central/South Central” and “Other Mid-Atlantic “ (4) and Maryland (3) round out the major pie chart categories.

What does all this mean? For one the chamber now has a better idea where to target its marketing.

Bruns may be playing an educated hunch when it comes to comparing his fanciful three-county lake community to the richest counties in the state but there is no question a substantial number of newcomers arrive bearing impressive balance sheets.

Which brings us to the StClairs a family of four who were at home in Prince William County when a SML flyer fluttered unexpectedly into their mailbox.

Shortly thereafter the StClairs became part of the new wave of year-round residents the chamber has been looking for. Jack and Jacqueline are native Roanokers who moved from Northern Virginia in 2020.

After years of establishing a successful 200-employee Home Instead elder care franchise serving the wealthy counties of Loudoun Prince William Fauquier and parts of Fairfax the StClairs who are in their early 40s relied on their deep faith to know when to pull the trigger on a move.

“God was literally going to have to come out of the sky and tell us to move” Jack StClair recalled with a twinkle in his eye while quickly adding for context his undying love for the family’s former well-appointed pad.

To condense said divine intervention a zippy series of portents ended with the arrival of the aforementioned SML promotional literature. That was the sign. Now here they are.

Jack went to Roanoke’s William Fleming High she to Cave Spring. They met in youth group at First Baptist were engaged when he was 19 and married a year later. They both were well familiar with the lake. Jacqueline’s family had a condo back during the 1980s boom when visionary builders such as Ron Willard put jet skis on development.

All that is not to say there was an easy decision for the StClairs to make about leaving a fashionable 10000-square-foot residence with an expansive back yard and pool not to mention all those years’ worth of personal and business relationships.

Map by Robert Lunsford.

Interesting empirical evidence reported recently by Cardinal News may support the idea that at least some of the well-to-do newcomers are part of a broader more startling trend.

According to the most recent Internal Revenue Service figures documenting those who are moving in and out of particular Virginia localities most of the counties outside of the population and wealth centers of Northern Virginia the 757 area code and Richmond are gaining more newcomers than there are departees. The reporting numbers are from 2020.

Furthermore and quite surprisingly as a whole those folks who are coming in are significantly more wealthy than those who are leaving. One happy result for these new home localities is net gains in both population and buying power.

Five counties show the most extravagant spreads between the wealth moving in and that moving out. Franklin and Bedford are two of that quintet all of which have in common a long shoreline (in the case of the other three on the list Northumberland Lancaster and Mathews the water that laps their shores is salt).

To be exact the income disparity of newcomers moving into Franklin County balanced against those who are leaving indicated the average income level of the arrivals was $101861 a whopping $43.488 more than that of the outgoing crowd. For Bedford the average newcomer earned $102485 $37777 clear of the average earnings of their departing brethren.

Economic development chief Simms cringed when she heard that.

“People are going to think the county is loaded.”

As an aside down-lake Pittsylvania County is home to the mammoth American Electrical Power dam and by far the least amount of lake frontage of the trio of counties. For Pittsylvania too recent arrivals are richer than those who are leaving but the spread is a more modest $1675.

To be sure not all those newcomers to all three counties are moving to the lake.

“Most of the new growth occurs in the Forest and New London area of the county” Bedford County administrator Robert Hiss pointed out in an email. “This is intentional per the County’s comprehensive plan and already built utility systems.”

New money is spread around in Franklin too. The evidence of such is also both data- and anecdotally driven.

For instance according to building permits from 2020 through June of this year shared by Simms of 553 permits 446 went to the lakeside magisterial districts of Gills Creek (234) Union Hall (149) and Blackwater (63).

“We’re also seeing significant houses with high real estate values going in Boones Mill probably because it’s closest to Roanoke and even in and around Rocky Mount” Simms said. “Then you have people building these mega-mansions by themselves on the side of the mountain in Callaway.”

In general public officials in all three lake counties would likely be inclined to agree with sentiments voiced by Pittsylvania supervisor Darrell Dalton whose Gretna-Callands district includes the lake.

“Residential population growth and increased tourism in the Smith Mountain Lake area are major boosts to our local economy and the overall growth of Pittsylvania County” he said in an email shared by county public relations manager Caleb Ayers.

* * *

As for tourism nobody’s forgetting that lucrative aspect of lake life especially those such as Dewayne Lamb who has a lovely view of the scene.

Lamb’s Captain’s Quarters bait and tackle shop boat rental guide service and wise advice source has been stationed in commanding location at the intersection of the south end of Halesford Bridge and the shoreline for nearly a quarter-century.

There too the balance sheet is solid.

“Every aspect of our business has continued to grow” he said one recent weekday in between selling a stout striper rod to a big fellow who broke his and discussing a boat rental with two casually dressed older gentlemen who arrived with an air of prosperity.

“We’ve seen a growth in our fishng – COVID has helped the outdoor world in general – fishing hunting anything outdoors” Lamb continued. “The fishing tackle business continues to grow. We’re up to 25 boat rentals when we started with three back in 1998.”

Growth of the broader community has of course been an important contributor.

“Housing developments around here continue to grow. There’s always someone building houses or docks. The whole area’s still growing.”

He’s seeing the same demographic move in permanently that has always been attracted to the lake.

“The folks who are retiring up north are coming down here where their dollar will go farther their taxes are not as bad. They can get a house that’s more for their money down south. I’m seeing a lot of people from New Jersey and New York.”

As for the short-timers he makes haste not to overlook them.

“Even though it’s a great area to retire it’s still a resort. The summertime the lake brings in the vacationers who don’t want the beach. Some are just staying local and are from the neighboring counties.”

Increasing numbers of renters are “at an all-time high right now” from neighboring states such as Pennsylvania West Virginia and North Carolina.

Tough times for the economy? What tough times?

“This lake is just about recession-proof” he said. “Several years ago back in 2008 when we got up to $5 per gallon [marine fuel] I was worried. We survived and didn’t miss a beat. A high of $6.30 this year at Captain’s Quarters – and some places even higher – it didn’t slow things up for one second.

“That truck has to roll in here every five days to fill us up.”

Optimism abounds elsewhere as well. Andie Gibson who swapped a newspaper career for a couple of decades of various brands of writing editing and publicity work involving the lake is also bullish about what she sees.

She and her business partner control two previously established lake-related websites. That’s their bet on the future. Find Smith Mountain Lake Insiders Guide at https://smith-mountain-lake.com/ and LakeLubbers at http://lakelubbers.com/.

LakeLubbers has listings and profiles for Smith Mountain as well as 2151 United States lakes.

“LakeLubbers was our biggest project so far” Gibson said. “We got that off the ground last year. We are having a fun time with that.”

Not to mention making a few dollars.

The StClair’s Prince William house sold in six days.

The new digs are on a deeply forested cul-de-sac off Scruggs Road that backs up against one of the lake’s six golf courses. The lot came with a boat slip now filled. They bought the house sight unseen.

The StClairs and their two children 13-year-old Jonathan and 11-year-old Mary Anna play no golf. Nor are they particularly interested in the pursuit of either striped or largemouth bass pleasure boating being more to their taste.

Correspondingly the new house is a sweet one. A Willard project from the 1980s it is a place where nowadays a nearby deer gazes placidly from the woods at an arriving guest before making haste with a snort to other appointments.

The house at the lake is a downsize. The StClairs love it just the same. That is until economic conditions may develop to prompt them to build a bigger one.

You may already have deduced COVID-19 had something to do with the accelerated chain of events that brought the family south. An important turning point came with an epiphany for Jack.

“I went to my office in Manassas one day in March then realized seven months later I hadn’t been back. Then I knew if f I can work from home in Northern Virginia why can’t I work from home somewhere else?”

Confidence in the choice to do so three hours from the base of operations was bolstered by prior experience. During the pandemic their company managers were allowed to work from home along with some of the junior staff.

Schedules were organized on a rotation that assured at least one manager would be in the office during business hours. Owners managers employees: All happy.

So it was a proven concept.

For those who expect bounteous new lake growth it is a fervent hope that there are others on the way who have arrived at the same remote work conclusion.

On the cultural angle back to that amphitheater at The Coves.

Coves impresario Gary Jackson has years’ worth of national music contacts from a list long as a slide on a St. Paul & the Broken Bones trombone. For a sampling of Coves fare Jackson has already welcomed bluegrass royalty Ricky Scaggs and had hall of fame swingers Asleep at the Wheel on the September schedule.

In August were Boyz II Men maestro Stuart Wiley and Roanoke Symphony Orchestra and the 50th-anniversary Marshall Tucker tour.

As for the aforementioned St. Paul the Birmingham Ala. blasters are scheduled to join the Steeldrivers Sept. 17-18 at the Smith Mountain Lake Wine Festival.

In any event it’s not just the big-timers who provide regular musical accompaniment to the suds and scenery. To plagiarize the Grateful Dead the music never stops at the lake and that’s been so a long time.

Years ago the late Haight-Ashbury iconoclast Dan Hicks and his band of gypsy jazz Oklahoma swing masters played a private lakeside soiree.

“Is this not the coolest party you’ve ever been to?” the host asked nobody in particular.

Looks like the only problem they’ll have at The Coves is getting people cleared out after the tunes stop. Patrons will still be sitting transfixed while gazing at the glitteringly glorious tree-framed vista of the lake that forms the stage’s backdrop.

Pandemic-fueled remote work at the lake doubtless was already well underway before the StClairs’ arrival.

“People started coming in May 2020 – right after the lockdown started” Bruns said. “Then in ’21 when kids were still learning remotely people moved down here and stayed down here because the kids were still online for school.”

For some of these parents as well as others from the remote workforce these weren’t just quick-hitter weekend stays.

“They were staying in homes they already owned where they were staying months at a time now” Bruns said.

Of course remote workforces as well as diligent students must be digitally connected. After years of delay in broadband development in Franklin County and elsewhere federal state and local stimulus money combined with private funding has jump-started broadband delivery to the previously unconnected.

Franklin County’s Board of Supervisors and broadband authority announced in July the deployment of $17.7 million in state grant money in addition to $24 million in private and additional grant sources combined with $7.7 million from the county’s share of federal American Rescue Plan funds in order to pay for a 24- to 36-month project to extend high speed internet.

Public-private partnerships in the effort are slated to provide 3500 new hook-ups across the county. A similar team effort is planned to deliver high speed connections in 2000 more homes and businesses in the “hardest to reach areas in eastern and southwestern portions” of the county.

Deep broadband penetration goals speak to another longstanding local project that one to bring a community center to the lake. A major feature being touted will be onsite public broadband service.

The effort for the center has been ramrodded for years by Vickie Gardner the retired lake chamber director who survived ghastly gunshot wounds during the on-air 2015 double murder of WDBJ (Channel 7) journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward. Since then Gardner underwent 10 surgeries in five years but never gave up the vision of a community center at the lake.

It’s close now.

“This center is so long overdue in this community and it is going to happen” she said. “The first wave of this was 20-some years ago. We had a great plan then the recession hit.”

Admirers and friends from the volunteer group that she leads had started calling it “Vickie’s Vision” in the wake of the shooting.

Recently the group announced a 14-person board of directors. Additionally a news release heralded fundraising 70 percent along in efforts to buy and renovate the vacant 40000-square-foot Grand Home Furnishings building at Westlake Center on Va. 122.

Putting a dollar figure on it they’re still more than $600000 short of their goal.

“Our push is to tell people this is a community effort” she said during a recent telephone conversation. “In fact I’m sitting here right now writing thank-you letters to donors. We’ve had donations as large as $250000.”

Performing arts; health and wellness; lifelong learning; career/workforce development; tourist services; and social gatherings are some of the potential uses promoted for the facility.

The need is acute Gibson said.

“There’s no place to meet there’s no place to hold a business expo. I mean we’ve had our business expo in a parking lot in downtown Moneta and on the tennis courts at the Y.”

Despite the accelerating pace of broadband development they believe proposed service at the community center will continue to draw substantial traffic.

Broadband was obviously a critical necessity for the StClairs too. That wasn’t all. The availability of quality Christian education for the two youngsters was a must.

After due diligence the parents decided that K-12 (along with preschool and daycare) Smith Mountain Lake Christian Academy was just the sort of school they had been looking for. Comfortably situated now on the way to the 2022-23 school year the younger members of the family agree the choice of the school is a fit.

“I feel like in Northern Virginia I didn’t like my teachers” said rising 7th-grader Jonathan of his previous Christian education school. “My teachers here are much nicer and at the middle school at least all of the teachers are pretty cool.”

Curriculum here stays close to conservative Christian doctrine including antipathy to alleged but unproven public school instruction in “critical race theory.” The K-12 program uses materials from Bob Jones University Press whose stated mission is to “produce Christian educational materials with academic excellence from a biblical worldview.”

Certainly the school which came under the administrative wing of EastLake Community Church in 2015 has enjoyed robust growth. From 88 students K-12 five years ago it has grown according to its website to 420 at last count.

“And they have a waiting list” said Aaron Wetherald the church administrative pastor as he ushered a guest on a tour of the church and grounds.

The school was cited in 2021 by Ruth Graham of the New York Times as representative of a boom for conservative Christian schools. Nationwide growth of such schools Graham wrote has been driven by factors including “pandemic frustrations and rising parental anxieties around how schools handle education on issues including race and the rights of transgender students.”

Meanwhile Smith Mountain Lake Christian’s high school – the Ospreys as its multiple sports teams are called – will be following the main church from quarters in a converted Hendrick Store Road strip mall down the road to a 163-acre plot with a breathtaking 180-degree view of the mountains in the distance.

A coffee shop open to the public has a pot brewing in the lobby.

On this pastoral property the congregation from the nondenominational church not long ago moved into a newly built 55000-square-foot facility that includes the 800-seat worship area (services are also streamed live) designed with expansion in mind; church offices and meeting areas; and a multi-purpose multi-court gym that is the Ospreys’ basketball and volleyball home.

“That church is phenomenal” Gibson said. “If you had told me 20 years ago there’d be a place like that at Smith Mountain Lake I would have told you you were nuts. State of the art – it’s crazy.”

More is on the way. Out back steel girders for a three-story building intended to house the new high school are in place and construction underway. Elsewhere on the property a state-of-the-art retreat center is planned for conferences and the like.

Weekends the high school building will be used for educational and meeting purposes by the church.

“That will allow us to go up to 350 students for the high school and 800 for the school as a whole” Wetherald said.

Asked if he was confident in the target number for school enrollment he answered “Definitely. As we’ve seen people are moving here to the lake in crazy numbers.”

Compared to declining enrollment in some public schools in both Bedford and Franklin Counties the growth of Smith Mountain Lake Christian is notable.

Bedford administrator Hiss uses school enrollment patterns along with 2020 redistricting figures as basis for an understanding of recent county growth being centered on Forest more than at the lake (Bedford County occupies the entire north shore).

“Generally speaking what we see around the lake are newcomers with second (or third) homes and retirees” he wrote in an email. “That is supported by the fact that the elementary schools and the middle school near SML are under capacity and have historically experienced declining enrollment. Contrast that with New London and Forest where the exact opposite occurs.”

The New York Times piece noted that Franklin County public school enrollment had dropped from 7270 in 2017-18 to 6125 in 2021-22. During the same pandemic-ridden period the home school population “almost doubled” to 1010.

The decline prompted one school district administrator to concede county schools “are losing students to private Christian schools.”

Yet another indicator of the growth at the lake is demonstrated by expansion at EastLake Community Church itself.

The church grew from modest beginnings in a decrepit Bedford County church with a precipitously declining and elderly congregation. The church had been donated in apparent desperation to a strong Roanoke church Parkway Church on the Mountain whose goal was to establish a presence at the lake.

EastLake started in 2006 with 65 congregants on loan from the parent church.

Charged with “planting a church” EastLake founder Troy Keaton whose brother Jeff was then senior pastor at the Roanoke church went to work.

The effort he led was wildly successful. Counting those who now worship online the congregation has expanded to “near 1500” Wetherald estimated citing fluid worship numbers among in-person attendees and streamers.

Troy Keaton a past regional chamber president himself continues to preach Sundays but has been in and out of church this summer dealing with a family health crisis. Keaton’s evangelical and church-building skills speak for themselves.

“Super charismatic” Gibson said “The nicest guy – if I wasn’t Catholic I’d consider going to that church just to hear him talk.”

* * *

As for the StClairs led to the church after finding the school and attendees for the past year and half they’ve been happy with their new religious home because it meets what they had been looking for. Especially appealing to them are its energy array of programs and opportunities to serve and be part of the local community.

Similarly encouraging they’re seeing an increasing preponderance of growing families such as theirs.

Two aspects of EastLake life disappoint Jacqueline. A graduate degree holder in Christian social work from Baylor University she expressed sadness at the lack of senior female leadership at EastLake with no movement toward change in sight. Not wanting to preach herself she assumes its appeal for other piously ambitious women.

“I believe women have a place in the ministry.”

In the end she reflected on her Baptist upbringing to say she’s seen it all before.

One other point troubles her.

“I love seeing all ages at church. What I miss is seeing different colors at church” referring to the church’s generally homogenous racial makeup a profile she contrasted to the diversity at the family’s previous nondenominational church in Haymarket along with more of the same in their upscale residential neighborhood.

“It bothers us” Jack said as she nodded in agreement “but we can look to so many good things that outweigh it.”

In any event they’ve been pied pipers of a type for friends from the D.C. suburbs to join them at the lake as well as church. Two families so far have answered the call.

One the Scotts arrived with five children to enroll in school and were met at church by Troy Keaton who in character greeted them ceremoniously as if they were part of a high-ranking dignitarial entourage.

Many are the prayers that more such growing families are on the way to the region.

Fowler joined the Navy eight years ago. Today Fowler serves as an aviation electronics technician.

“I joined the Navy to follow a family tradition” said Fowler. “My great uncles were all in the Army Marine Corps and Airforce. My father was in the Navy for 20 years aboard submarines. When it came time for me to serve the Navy seemed like the right fit.”

Growing up in Fredericktown Fowler attended Highland High School and graduated in 2014. Today Fowler relies upon skills and values similar to those found in Fredericktown to succeed in the military.

“I remember being at the county fair in Fredericktown” said Fowler. “A gentleman I’d never seen before or spoken to before knew who I was. That taught me that your legacy and character can go a long way. Someone could always be watching so carry yourself with that knowledge and you can always be proud of the life you lead.”

These lessons have helped Fowler while serving with the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Oceana.

Naval Air Station Oceana serves as the Navy’s East Coast Master Jet Base. The flight line Apollo Soucek Field is home to 17 aviation squadrons and hosts the F/A-18 Super Hornet.

The Super Hornet is one of the most advanced aircraft in the world according to Navy officials. The aircraft takes off from and lands on Navy aircraft carriers at sea and is capable of conducting air-to-air combat as well as striking targets on land.

Navy aircraft carriers are designed for a 50-year service life. When the air wing is embarked the ship carries more than 70 attack fighter jets helicopters and other aircraft all of which take off from and land aboard the carrier at sea. With more than 5000 sailors serving aboard the aircraft carrier is a self-contained mobile airport.

Aircraft carriers are often the first response to a global crisis because of their ability to operate freely in international waters anywhere on the world’s oceans.

Since USS Langley’s commissioning 100 years ago the nation’s aircraft carriers and embarked carrier air wings have projected power sustained sea control bolstered deterrence provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and maintained enduring commitments worldwide.

“The aircraft carrier is our U.S. Navy’s centerpiece our flagship and a constant reminder to the rest of the world of our enduring maritime presence and influence” said Rear Adm. James P. Downey USN Program Executive Officer (PEO) Aircraft Carriers. “These ships touch every part of our Navy’s mission to project power ensure sea control and deter our adversaries.”

Serving in the Navy means Fowler is part of a team that is taking on new importance in America’s focus on strengthening alliances modernizing capabilities increasing capacities and maintaining military readiness in support of the National Defense Strategy.

“The Navy contributes to the National Defense Strategy in many ways” said Fowler. “The Navy consistently provides services around the world. We provide maritime interception operations. If a country needs assistance we can always be there to help. We also provide freedom of navigation of the seas even in contested waters.”

With more than 90 percent of all trade traveling by sea and 95 percent of the world’s international phone and internet traffic carried through fiber optic cables lying on the ocean floor Navy officials continue to emphasize the importance of accelerating America’s advantage at sea.

“Maintaining the world’s best Navy is an investment in the security and prosperity of the United States as well as the stability of our world” said Adm. Mike Gilday Chief of Naval Operations. “The U.S. Navy—forward deployed and integrated with all elements of national power—deters conflict strengthens our alliances and partnerships and guarantees free and open access to the world’s oceans. As the United States responds to the security environment through integrated deterrence our Navy must continue to deploy forward and campaign with a ready capable combat-credible fleet.”

Fowler and the sailors they serve with have many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during their military service.

“My proudest Navy accomplishment is my final checker afloat” said Fowler. “That’s when you get to go up on the flight deck and launch jets. That was the qualification my grandma really wanted me to get before she passed so it’s very important to me.”

As Fowler and other sailors continue to train and perform missions they take pride in serving their country in the United States Navy.

“As a Navy sailor you can be an ambassador for America when overseas” added Fowler. “When other countries think of America they remember the good work done by the Navy. That’s why I feel a lot of pride when I put on my uniform and serve.”

These come without a physical SIM slot and a user will have to rely on an eSIM in order to access mobile networks. eSIMs are not something new they have been around for a while. Nor is Apple the first company to remove the physical SIM slot from its phones. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip series do not have a physical SIM slot including the units sold in India and require only an eSIM in order to work. Apple has supported eSIMs for a while (since iPhone XS and above) though dual eSIM support started with the iPhone 12 series. Till now users in the US had the option of using a regular SIM and an eSIM but now they will have to stick to an eSIM. But what does it mean for users and is it a bad idea to get an iPhone 14 from the US where the prices are much lower? Well Apple has answered some of the questions in a detailed FAQ page. Here’s a quick look at what the company is saying.

Apple eSIM: How does it work?

Apple notes that an “eSIM is an industry-standard digital SIM supported by carriers”. It also goes on to add that eSIM will offer more benefits especially when travelling abroad because if your iPhone is stolen. That’s because the thieves cannot remove the SIM and access that especially if your iPhone is locked. Apple also notes on another page that for models bought in the US the iPhone activates with an eSIM."

CAMP HUMPHREYS South Korea – The Army Community Services hosted the 4th annual Baby Shower Sept. 15 at the Morning Calm Center on Camp Humphreys.

The baby shower was organized to celebrate parenthood and to teach the new and expectant parents about the resources offered to them both on and off-post.

“There are families that may be new to Korea and don’t know what’s available to them” said Olivia Bourke Family Advocacy Program specialist. “We wanted today to be like a one-stop shop for folks to

know what’s available to them and to support a strong resilient family.""

On the second floor of the Morning Calm Center ACS volunteers and representatives greeted the participants to their “Hungry Caterpillar” themed baby shower. Photos booths decorated with green

arched balloons where set-up along the entry for new parents and parents-to-be to take pictures with their families and colleagues. A nursing mothers’ area was set in the corner and at the registration table

smiling faces handed out BINGO cards.

Bourke said games were a “must” at a baby shower so they wanted to mirror this sentiment. Each BINGO card spelled hungry on the back with vegetables under each letter. The vegetables represented

on-post and off-post resources which the hungry caterpillar would snack on as the card was stamped.

To receive the stamps attendees would have to go around to the booths and get information on the resources offered to them and their families. Seventeen resources providers came out to support the event and the parents-to-be to include Exceptional Family Member Program Women Infants and Children Parent Central Services New Parent Support-Osan and New Parent Support Program.

A fully stamped card would ensure the participant would receive a diaper bag full of baby products and a completed exit survey of the event would guarantee they would walk away with a tea set.

This will see the company from 2024 using a fleet of 140-tonne Cat 785 next generation mining trucks equipped with Command for hauling.

That fleet is expected to expand “significantly” in 2028 says ioneer.

All support equipment will feature the latest MineStar technology with its high-precision GPS and real-time analytics which ioneer says will maximise efficiency and accuracy in material loading.

First North American greenfield mine to use new haulage system

ioneer owns the Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project located in Nevada US which is the only known lithium-boron deposit in North America and one of only two known such deposits in the world.

The company has said previously it is expecting to be the lowest cost lithium producer in the world once its Nevada lithium-boron project in Nevada gets into production.

Rhyolite Ridge will be the first greenfield operation in North America to use Caterpillar’s autonomous haulage system. This agreement follows a memorandum of understanding between ioneer and Caterpillar concluded in February.

Deal worth around US$100m

The agreement covering equipment technology and services for the first five years of operation is valued at about US$100 million (A$149 million).

Cat autonomous mining trucks have so far hauled 5 billion tonnes of material worldwide more than a total 177 million kilometres without any lost-time injuries.

ioneer has lithium offtake agreements with Ford Motor and battery makers PPES (a Toyota-Panasonic joint venture) and South Korea’s EcoPro.

The company earlier commissioned French-owned Veolia Water Technologies for major engineering design and equipment.

ioneer expects not only to be the world’s lowest cost lithium producer but also to become one of the first of the operating ‘major’ lithium suppliers in the US — and located close to emerging battery megafactories.

The mine is expected to come onstream in 2025."

He expected a slam dunk financing deal. After all Rosenberg isn’t betting on any office market but on the it office market: South Florida.

The ballyhoo over corporate newcomers to the tri-county region has reached a near-deafening pitch. Elliott Management. CI Financial. Founders Fund. Atomic. OpenStore. Vibrant Capital Partners. And of course Ken Griffin’s Citadel. They are among the high-profile companies making splashy expansions or relocations to South Florida over the past two years.

As the U.S. office market’s vibrancy remains in question amid patchy returns to cubicles South Florida has emerged as an unexpected outlier nabbing tenants fleeing high-tax states. Rents at glitzy towers have reached a new local high of over $100 per square foot and formerly off-the-radar areas have gained national recognition. Case in point: Downtown West Palm Beach is recast as the “Wall Street of the South.”

By all means what lender wouldn’t want to bet on South Florida offices?

As Rosenberg learned the leasing frenzy is not enough to offset high borrowing costs precipitated by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. And many financiers now have stepped back from office lending altogether. No exceptions. Not even for South Florida.

“You do have a situation where a lot of institutional capital just makes a macro decision” said Rosenberg co-founder of Boca Raton-based Pebb Capital. “And they throw the baby out with the bathwater.”

In the ensuing quandary owners and potential buyers have been unable to see eye-to-eye on pricing. It has led to a slowdown in sales and prompted sellers to take properties off the market according to brokers. While sellers expect plump payment for their buildings due to tenant demand buyers who have to borrow at high interest rates can’t meet the prices.

“The last few months” said Dominic Montazemi of Cushman & Wakefield “have been particularly tough for sales.”

In the first half of this year Miami-Dade County office investment sales reached $740.6 million largely bolstered by Citadel’s $286.5 million purchase of 1221 Brickell. That represented just 39 percent of last year’s total deal volume according to Avison Young.

From the first quarter to the second quarter Broward County investment sales dropped 74 percent to $320 million and Palm Beach County’s dropped 55 percent to $632 million Avison’s reports show.

Properties were put on the market early this year only to be taken off over the past four months once the bid-ask gap became evident. Among them: the 110 Tower near downtown Fort Lauderdale according to sources. IP Capital Partners a co-owner of the tower declined comment.

Fort Lauderdale however is not the epicenter of the new-to-market company influx. Many firms are opting instead for West Palm Beach and Miami.

Wynwood is now portrayed as the “Silicon Valley of the South” and Brickell is essentially becoming not only a financial mecca but also Griffin and Citadel’s domain. So investment sales there surely won’t feel the sting of high borrowing costs right?

Not so.

The Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell was taken off the market this year sources said. This even though the tower reaped its own bonanza from the influx of Northeast firms. Billionaire Israel Englander’s New York-based hedge fund Millennium Management took 74000 square feet. KKR which co-owns the building declined to comment.

In Wynwood brokers consistently boast about quick office lease-ups and bemoan the lack of available space due to incessant demand. Yet The Gateway at Wynwood building was put on the market in the second quarter and taken off mid-summer.

“The value was not appreciated in today’s market” said Shelby Rosenberg of R&B Realty Group which developed Gateway.

His strategy reflects that of many others who opted to take their buildings off the market: Keep leasing and bet that the high costs of materials and labor as well as of construction financing will preempt office development keeping supply tight. Then test the sales market again.

“We felt that there is not going to be an oversupply in the coming months and that bodes well for an asset that is complete and [located] where the demand is still high” Rosenberg said. “There’s better value tomorrow.”

Bridging the gap

Exactly when this “tomorrow” of higher valuations and closing of the bid-ask chasm will come remains unclear. Some brokers are betting on a pickup in sales in the fourth quarter and others expect it early next year.

As the Fed signals more interest rate hikes this year trade activity will depend on whether higher rents will be enough to balance buyers’ borrowing costs.

Across Miami-Dade County asking rents climbed 8.7 percent year-over-year to $47.65 a square foot in the second quarter according to Colliers. In the first half of the year almost 3 million square feet of office space was leased.

That is the “tip of the iceberg” said Chris Lee of CBRE as more tenants are on tap.

“We are coming to a point where the rise in rents is offsetting the rise of interest rates” he said.

But J.C. De Ona president of Centennial Bank’s Southeast Florida division isn’t seeing it yet. Plus “not every property is going to see some of these record-breaking [rent] numbers we have seen in Brickell and West Palm Beach” he said.

South Florida commercial real estate in general remains a hedge against inflation which bodes well for an uptick in office sales said Charles Foschini of Berkadia. Buyers who can purchase with cash have nothing stopping them.

As for Rosenberg his Pebb Capital isn’t giving up on its planned office building purchase.

Pebb which negotiated down the original price that was set prior to the summer is looking at putting in more equity to reduce the level of debt Rosenberg said.

During his early September trip to New York it became evident that higher borrowing costs aren’t as much of an issue as lenders’ blanket decision to recede from office lending even when Rosenberg explained South Florida is an anomaly market.

“So the individual person I am speaking with gets it” Rosenberg said. “But it’s out of their hands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2lsbGlub2lzL2pvbGlldC9wcmljZWQtc2VsbC1lc3BvcnRhLWZpdG5lc3MtcHJvcGVydHktcm91dGUtNTktYXZhaWxhYmxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priced To Sell?

Eight years and nearly $90 million later the firm had amassed a total of 52.6 acres of the neighborhood’s land.

It wasn’t until 1997 that the true financier of the land purchases was revealed: Harvard University Allston’s neighbor across the Charles River.

A University spokesperson at the time called the move “fiscally prudent” in a comment to the New York Times. The Boston Globe called it “a stealthy land grab.”

Brighton resident Justin L. Brown said Harvard’s secret acquisition of land “sowed a lot of distrust between the residents of Allston-Brighton and Harvard.”

Today Harvard is the largest landholder in Allston with 360 acres — roughly one-third of the neighborhood.

These land holdings include campus cornerstones — the Harvard Athletics Complex the Harvard Business School the $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex — as well as the development of hundreds of residential units at 180 Western Ave. and 176 Lincoln St. The Harvard Ed Portal has garnered significant praise from residents who utilize its educational resources.

Harvard’s future plans also include the proposed Enterprise Research Campus a 900000-square-foot mixed-use development including residential lab hotel and restaurant space.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow says the proposed development will be for Allston residents.

“Our vision for an Enterprise Research Campus emerged from deep engagement with the Allston community the city of Boston and many more stakeholders over many years and our work together will be stronger for it” Bacow said in July. “The ERC will be for everyone.”

But with Harvard’s forays into commercial development Brown said the University no longer feels like an “institutional neighbor.”

“Now Harvard is this enormously influential and powerful institution that’s not talking about residence halls or science labs for its students but talking about hotels and commercial lab space” Brown said.

University spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote in a statement that Harvard’s long involvement in Allston has been characterized by deep engagement.

“We are proud to be part of this vibrant exciting neighborhood and benefit immensely from collaborative work with residents organizations businesses elected officials and others through programs partnerships public spaces and other shared activities and priorities” she wrote.

The University’s 10-year timeline for its 2013 Institutional Master Plan is set to expire next year raising the question of how Harvard will define the next chapter of its relationship with Allston residents.

A Tale of Two Cities

The ties between Harvard and Allston date back to the neighborhood’s origins.

For more than 160 years the land now dubbed Allston and Brighton was once part of Cambridge. Following disputes with the Cambridge city government in 1807 the town known as “Little Cambridge” opted to secede.

The east side of the land officially became its own entity in the late 1860s and was named Allston in honor of Washington Allston — an 1800 Harvard alum.

Between 1875 and 1925 the population of Allston-Brighton grew by over 40000 people and became a prestigious and developing neighborhood. Around that time Harvard made its initial expansions into the town when it established Harvard Stadium in 1903 and the Harvard Business School in 1927.

By the second half of the century the neighborhood began to experience strains still felt today: resident exodus to outer suburbs a housing crisis and traffic congestion.

Harvard’s eight-year anonymous property buyup marked a turning point in the University’s positioning in Allston-Brighton. Then-Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino called the acquisitions the “highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.”

But Harvard’s move to purchase land through Beal Companies wasn’t unheard of. Bruce A. Beal co-founder of Beal Companies told the New York Times in 1997 that he worked with the Boston Public Libraries in the 1960s to purchase land for them in a strategy similar to Harvard’s.

Lifelong Allston resident John A. Bruno called the purchase a “somewhat disingenuous” — but a “prudent” business move for Harvard.

Harvard’s future Allston purchases were made in its own name. In 2000 the University bought a 48-acre parcel of land followed up by another 91-acre purchase in 2003.

The University’s vision for its holdings across the river began to crystallize.

In a 2003 open letter to Harvard affiliates then-University President Lawrence H. Summers unveiled the first public vision surrounding the Allston purchases: a 21st-century expansion of Harvard’s campus. By that point Harvard had amassed over 200 acres of Allston land.

“The choices we make in the coming years about this extraordinary opportunity will do much to shape Harvard for decades to come” Summers wrote in the letter.

The campus could include new science and technology facilities artistic and cultural centers and new student housing Summers said.

But Summers’ vision appeared to enter dire straits under new University President Drew G. Faust. The Boston Globe reported in a December 2007 story titled “Harvard Rethinks Allston” that Faust was reconsidering major tenets of Summers’ proposed Allston expansion including the construction of four new undergraduate dorms and the relocation of the School of Public Health and Graduate School of Education.

Still Faust maintained the University was moving full steam ahead disputing the Globe’s portrayal in a phone call to The Crimson.

“It’s not a reversal. It’s not a slowing down” Faust said. “It’s moving to the next stage of a plan.”

But in the two years that followed Harvard’s endowment plunged by nearly 30 percent amid the Great Recession. The school was forced to halt its expansion plans for the time being.

A decade before the construction of Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex a Harvard history professor predicted a high-tech Allston campus empty by nightfall.

“You have no problem I am sure imagining a science campus that by 6:30 p.m. is abandoned at least from the outside” wrote professor Peter L. Galison ’77 in a 2007 Crimson Op-Ed. “The only sounds are those of wind windshield wipers a few quiet conversations by the shuttle bus stop and the rumble of air conditioning systems.”

Galison wrote the piece entitled “Allston Dreams” mere months after Harvard released a 74-page master plan in 2007 for a vision of Allston that would soon become derailed by the Great Recession.

Since Galison’s piece the long-awaited 544000-square-foot Science and Engineering Complex has opened its doors in fall 2021 to great acclaim from students and some residents.

“It brings beauty practicality and sustainability into harmony a symbol of the University’s commitment to making the world better as we undertake our best work” Bacow said in a press release months before the facility opened.

Some Allston residents have commended the building’s aesthetic and surrounding greenspace. Others said the SEC’s grandeur felt exclusionary. Residents also linked the SEC to rising housing costs.

The SEC was a major attraction of the University’s 2013 Institutional Master Plan which was unanimously approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority in October 2013. The IMP contains nine projects totaling nearly 1.4 million square feet including the construction of a new executive education facility at the Harvard Business School and additions to the Harvard Stadium. The plan also detailed a mixed-use development at Barry’s Corner.

But prior to the plan’s approval Allston residents raised an array of concerns. The development at Barry’s Corner would cause congestion some said. Residents also took issue with a lack of specificity surrounding Harvard’s plans for affordable housing and sustainability.

Harvard has taken a number of initiatives to address resident anxieties.

Since 2000 the University has sponsored the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative intended to bolster the supply of low-cost housing in Cambridge and Boston. In 2019 the University renewed the collaborative which has invested more than $40 million in the Greater Boston area according to its website. Harvard also helped establish Allston-Brighton’s “All Bright Homeownership Program” in 2015 which seeks to improve access to homeownership for the neighborhood's residents as outside investors and developers buy up property in the area.

Further the SEC has been certified LEED Platinum by the U.S. Green Building Council — a certification measuring the building’s sustainability.

Despite such efforts Harry E. Mattison an Allston resident said he believes Galison’s “Allston Dreams” have become a reality.

“If what you were thinking is hey we're going to build a new neighborhood or we're going to build a new Main Street and we're going to create vitality and we're going to create Boston's next great new neighborhood then they've completely failed” Mattison said.

Harvard’s upcoming projects — particularly the much-anticipated Enterprise Research Campus — continue to be a source of concern for some Allston residents.

Plans for the ERC first debuted in 2011 with the BPDA approving a framework for expansion in 2018. The proposed ERC would include a hotel and conference center office and laboratory space and residential retail and restaurant developments.

In its pitch to residents the University touted nearly three acres of publicly accessible open space centering on a public “greenway” plaza and lawn that will connect Raymond V. Mellone Park — named in honor of a former Harvard Allston Task Force chair — to the Charles River.

Bacow said the “vision for an Enterprise Research Campus emerged from a deep engagement with the Allston community” and that the ERC will resultantly “be for everyone”.

Some union representatives from Local 26 — representing Boston hospitality workers — voiced support for the proposal due to its affordable housing stipulations and potential to create jobs. Other residents felt the proposal insufficiently addressed their concerns.

During the approval process for Phase A of the ERC development continuing resident concerns culminated in the formation of the Coalition for a Just Allston and Brighton last August. The advocacy group aims to demand accountability from Harvard regarding resident outreach affordable housing plans and sustainability efforts.

Earlier this year Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 received a pair of letters — one from CJAB and one from former University Vice President Katherine N. Lapp — which characterized the University’s expansion into Allston in starkly different terms.

In its 19-page letter CJAB members raised concerns about a future in Allston-Brighton defined by unaffordable housing barriers to small businesses traffic congestion and climate change. Lapp’s letter meanwhile expressed Harvard’s desire to turn its purchased properties in Allston into “vibrant equitable and welcoming” spaces.

Kevin M. Carragee a Brighton resident and member of CJAB said the University is not upholding its “social justice mission.”

To quell affordability concerns amid Allston’s housing crisis Harvard entered a landmark agreement with Allston leaders this past July. Under the agreement brokered by the Wu administration the University committed to 25 percent residential units to be affordable within Phase A of the ERC. Harvard also agreed to donate $25 million to establish the Allston-Brighton Affordable Housing Fund and to donate a 0.9-acre tract of land at 65-79 Seattle St. to an affordable housing developer.

The University has also made commitments to expand transportation including a 2018 pledge of $50 million to the neighborhood’s planned West Station MBTA extension — currently set for construction in 2040. The station is part of Allston’s larger I-90 Multimodal Project for which Harvard has promised hundreds of millions of dollars of support.

Residents and elected officials from the area have also voiced concern over what they deem insufficient communication from the University.

Kamosa the University spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “committed to ongoing engagement with the community to advance shared goals and to ensuring our spaces and places are lively welcoming and inclusive and that they maintain and enhance the unique creative culture of the neighborhood.”

Still Brown said opportunities to engage with the University are not accessible to certain residents.

“Attending lots of meetings and understanding how the development and planning processes works creates obstacles for people who don't have the time or the background and these are members of our community who are often most impacted by development: immigrants low-income renters people of color” Brown wrote in an email.

The Next Chapter

This coming year the University could offer a new Institutional Master Plan detailing its current developments in Allston and presenting its next decade-long agenda.

Kamosa wrote that the University wants to contribute to a “thriving innovative ecosystem” that will change the neighborhood in “profound ways.”

Whether the upcoming IMP will meet the neighborhood’s needs remains to be seen. But Bruno the Allston resident is optimistic.

“I see the history and I see the potential” Bruno said. “They know everything whether it’s medicine or engineering or education financing — they’re the best. Why would we be reluctant to partner with the best?”

Meanwhile Brown said the future of Harvard-Allston relations relies on the “energized and activated” residents.

“[Harvard] understands that it has an enormous amount of power and it will use that power” Brown said. “So what we need to do is build our own power and make sure that we’re taking collective action and speaking with one voice making demands that Harvard has to listen to.”

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON Texas -Soldiers and leaders assigned to the 232d Medical Battalion 32d Medical Brigade signed an Adopt-A-School charter with Veteran’s Memorial High School (VMHS) at a public ceremony during the school’s Red White and Blue Patriot Day Commemoration Football Game at D.W. Rutledge Stadium September 9 2022.

VMHS Principal Dr. Sue Arredondo and 232d Medical Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Genna Speed alongside her Command Sergeant Major Command Sgt. Maj. Lori Ingram officially signed the charter on the 50-yard line in front of the hundreds of soldiers students and family members in attendance.

232d is the largest medical training battalion within the 32d Medical Brigade the singular training brigade within the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence (MEDCoE). Together they train over 4000 combat medics annually.

Each of the MEDCoE’s training battalions have participated in the JBSA-Fort Sam Houston Adopt-A-School Program mainly in support elementary schools for nearly a decade. Beginning in March of this year MEDCoE the Army’s medical training and education institution began adopting local high schools greatly expanding their reach across San Antonio.

Through the Adopt-A-School program MEDCoE Soldiers aim to demonstrate what it means to live a life of serving others through shared Army values while getting meaningful interactions with students. Through the program Soldiers volunteer their time during various activities to include mentorship school beautification and school supply fundraisers.

“It is with great excitement that the 232d Medical Battalion joins with Veteran’s Memorial High School as partners in developing the leaders of tomorrow” said Speed. “At some point in all our lives there has been a trusted advisor mentor or guide to help each of us reach our fullest potential. It is truly an honor for the 232d to be a part of that process for the students of Veteran’s Memorial.”

In her remarks Speed also thanked several people for their support of the Adopt-A-School initiative to include Dr. Jeanette Ball Judson Independent School District Superintendent Col. Marc Welde the 32d Medical Brigade Commander Retired Army Lt.Col. John Baker VMHS JROTC Senior Military Instructor and Nita Ford-Hightower JBSA-Fort Sam Houston School Liaison.

“This event would not have been possible without you” said Speed. “We are thrilled to continue working together!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxhZGVscGhpYXVuaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdy10by13YXRjaC1hdGx2cGhpLTA5MTcyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Watch | #ATLvPHI,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxhZGVscGhpYXVuaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdy10by13YXRjaC1hdGx2cGhpLTA5MTcyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394F8C5BD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Hydrogen fuel could revolutionize the nation’s energy sector using the most abundant element in the universe — and oil and gas companies are lead supporters.

Top energy companies including Shell and Duke Energy spent collectively $16.5 million lobbying Congress during the first six months of 2022 on a range of bills including a push for hydrogen production Senate lobbying disclosures show.

The five companies most of which are surviving companies of the “Seven Sisters” that dominated the global petroleum industry until the mid-1970s have lobbied for tax credits and research on hydrogen.

They aren’t alone in their interest in hydrogen fuel which has an advantage in that it can be produced and stored without certain geographic needs that other energies like solar and wind power require.

“Because it’s a liquid fuel you can store it” Gregory Wetstone president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit American Council on Renewable Energy told OpenSecrets. Wetstone said it resolves “problems such as the need to have energy during time periods when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing.”

The nonprofit has spent $80000 lobbying so far this year and has donated to a slate of Democratic members of Congress including Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).

But unlike other renewable energies hydrogen still relies on natural gas to be converted into a liquid fuel — creating a paradox in which the fuel that could be key to decarbonizing the U.S. power grid is itself a carbon emitter.

Today about 95% of hydrogen fuel is “gray hydrogen” made from natural gas via a steam methane reformation process that produces more carbon dioxide than burning an equivalent amount of gasoline.

For fossil fuel companies this presents an opportunity to use existing infrastructure for a new technology.

Legislators like Manchin who has received large checks to his 2024 reelection campaign from the oil and gas industry have argued for the continued use of natural gas processes as hydrogen is further developed in the U.S.

President Joe Biden has kept his eye more so on “clean hydrogen” that uses renewable energies. Processes like electrolysis which separates hydrogen atoms from water molecules to create “green hydrogen” emit zero greenhouse gas emissions but have high price tags.

Amid a global energy crisis furthered by Russia’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine oil and gas companies have pumped more funds into lobbying efforts as federal lawmakers grapple with U.S. energy insecurity and foreign dependence.

Chevron leads the pack with over $4 million spent lobbying Capitol Hill from January through June of this year. Over $2 million of these expenses come during the second quarter an increase from the $1.6 million spent by Chevron from that same period in 2021.

“Energy policy is a critical public policy issue” Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne Jr. told OpenSecrets in a statement. “When Chevron lobbies we do so on behalf of our employees and shareholders in support of our ambition to deliver affordable reliable and ever-cleaner energy to a growing world.”

The American multinational energy corporation announced in June that it plans to spend about $2.5 billion by 2028 developing both “green hydrogen” and “blue hydrogen.” Blue hydrogen similarly uses natural gas like “gray hydrogen” but resulting carbon dioxide emissions are captured using technology.

Turenne told OpenSecrets that Chevron seeks to grow green blue and gray hydrogen production to 150000 tons per year by 2030 to supply industrial power and heavy-duty transport customers.

This year Chevron has disclosed lobbying for all provisions of the Clean Hydrogen Production and Investment Tax Credit of 2021 Act which would provide tax credits to companies that produce “green” and “blue” hydrogen in order to encourage clean fuel production.

While this particular bill has not seen any movement since it was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means last September hydrogen production tax credits — also lobbied for by Shell BP America and Duke Energy — are a prominent component of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Signed into law by Biden in August the act has a tax credit that scales depending on how clean the fuel’s production is. Maximum credit or $3 per kilogram of hydrogen is given to facilities where hydrogen fuel is made without carbon dioxide emissions.

BP spent nearly $2.2 million on lobbying through June 30 on issues including electric vehicles and solar projects as well as legislation such as Build Back Better the slimmed down version of which now makes up the Inflation Reduction Act.

The British oil and gas corporation is a board member of the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition which aims at “promoting clean hydrogen as a critical pathway to achieve global decarbonization objectives.” Chevron and other energy companies are also members of the coalition.

BP’s affiliate BP America indicated lobbying the Department of Energy on “issues related to hydrogen” in its second quarter disclosure.

The department which states that commercially-viable hydrogen fuel made from natural gas is a “bridge technology” to more sustainable production recently funneled money into clean hydrogen projects.

The DOE launched three initiatives of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in February: $8 billion toward regional hubs producing clean hydrogen $1 billion toward improving electrolysis’ cost-effectiveness and $500 million toward manufacturing clean hydrogen equipment.

“Clean hydrogen is key to cleaning up American manufacturing and slashing equipment from carbon-intensive materials like steel and cement while creating good-paying jobs for American workers” U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.

Experts project that “green hydrogen” made with electrolysis will be cost-competitive with “gray hydrogen” in certain places around the globe by 2030. Rising gas prices have already made “green hydrogen” more appealing.

Looking ahead Wetstone said that it’s critically important to build out the country’s transmission infrastructure to deliver hydrogen to consumers.

“We need to have a 21st century grid that is able to accommodate the high penetration levels of renewable power that we’re talking about” Wetstone told OpenSecrets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9mZWRleC13YXJuaW5nL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSATlodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L2J1c2luZXNzL2ZlZGV4LXdhcm5pbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx warns of a global recession cutting sales forecast by half a billion dollars,"New York CNN Business —

FedEx warned that a global recession could be coming as demand for packages around the world tumbles.

Shares of FedEx (FDX) plunged 21% Friday — the biggest one-day drop in its history — after the company warned late Thursday that a slowing economy will cause it to fall $500 million short of its revenue target.

The weakening global economy particularly in Asia and Europe has hurt FedEx’s express delivery business. The company said demand for packages weakened considerably in the final weeks of the quarter.

What’s more FedEx said it expects business conditions to further weaken in the current second quarter which runs through November. While global revenue this quarter is likely to be flat compared to a year earlier FedEx’s earnings are expected to plunge more than 40%. Analysts had been forecasting a gain in profit.

During an interview Thursday on CNBC FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam was asked if he believes the slowdown in his business is a sign of the start of a global recession.

“I think so” he responded. “These numbers they don’t portend very well.”

He said FedEx is seeing a decline in the volume of freight it is handling in every region around the world. While he said US consumers are somewhat protected by the strength of the dollar which is increasing their purchasing power but he said FedEx is seeing a slowdown in Americans’ spending as well.

The warning sparked a broad sell-off in US stocks. Additionally the Dow Transportation Index fell 5% while shares of FedEx rival UPS (UPS) closed about 5% lower.

The 21% single-day loss for FedEx shares easily tops their 16% plunge the day of the 1987 stock market crash and a 15% drop during the stocks sell-off in March 2020 in the early days of the pandemic. Shares of FedEx are now down 38% so far this year.

The company said it is responding by reducing flights and temporarily parking aircraft trimming hours for its staff delaying some hiring plans and closing 90 FedEx Office locations as well as five corporate offices. It is also cutting $500 million from its capital expenditure budget for its fiscal year which runs through May of 2023 trimming that spending to $6.3 billion.

“We’re going fully into cost-management mode” he told CNBC.

FedEx (FDX) said its adjusted earnings for the quarter that ended August 31 will be down $260 million or 17% from a year earlier. Revenue rose $1.2 billion or 5% despite missing the company’s earlier target.

While it gave the sharply lowered guidance for the current quarter FedEx said it was withdrawing its full-year guidance issued in June due to the “continued volatile operating environment.

FedEx Ground service which is the primary way the company handles deliveries of online purchases made by US consumers missed its sales target by $300 million.

The company uses independent contractors not employees to make deliveries and many of those contractors are complaining that rising costs for fuel labor and new vehicles has made their business unprofitable. Some are threatening to halt operations on Black Friday just at the start of the holiday shopping season unless FedEx agrees to change their compensation.

FedEx insists it will work with contractors who are having problems. It has sued the former contractor who has been the most vocal critic of the company.

“We recognize that current economic conditions are posing new challenges” FedEx Ground said in a statement last month. “We remain committed to working with service provider businesses individually to address the challenges specific to their situation. Our goal is to enable success for both FedEx Ground and service providers.”

About 1000 of the 6000 contractors who work for FedEx have joined a trade association to lobby the company for better compensation.

A survey conducted by the association released this week found 54% saying their business with FedEx was losing money 35% saying it was breaking even and only 11% saying it was profitable. The association said the survey reached 1200 contractors working for the company or who left the company within the last 12 months.",,,,,,

Commercial Crime Insurance Overview

Commercial crime insurance is necessary to protect businesses of any size and scope from employee-related and third-party crimes. A crime perpetrated by a trusted employee or outside individual can cause lasting financial physical and emotional loss. To understand the scope of employee crime or occupational fraud risk consider these statistics from a recent Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) report: organizations lose an estimated 5% of revenue to fraud each year with an average loss per fraud case of more than $1.5 million.

Further a study from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University found that a majority of fraud and theft threats against organizations stemmed from officially-employed insiders. While theft or property damage committed by a third-party is always a threat employee-related incidents tend to be more common.

Any instance of employee dishonesty can be devastating but many kinds of crimes can also undermine your business’s reputation forcing operations off track and throwing a wrench into your revenue. Along with other insurance policies for business owners commercial crime insurance is recommended as a basic protection against these types of events.

What Is Commercial Crime Insurance?

Commercial crime insurance protects business owners from financial loss caused by criminal activity. This can include crimes perpetrated by either employees or non-employees and can include crimes such as theft property damage forgery and fraudulent bank transfers among others. Various forms of crime insurance include employee dishonesty insurance third-party crime coverage fidelity bonds business services bonds and ERISA bonds. Because commercial property insurance excludes a wide range of criminal activity commercial crime insurance adds a necessary layer of protection to your business.

When comparing policies most are organized around the type of person committing the crime (an employee or outside party) and who the crime was perpetrated against (the business itself or one of the business’s customers). Depending on your insurance policy it will either include first-party coverage third-party coverage or a combination of both which is the most secure. Costs covered under first-party coverage include claim expenses and direct financial losses sustained by your company including the loss of physical property. Some policies may also cover proof of loss costs or costs incurred as a result of needing to provide evidence of a crime against your business. This entails hiring forensic experts and investigators that can compile a proof of loss portfolio to present along with your claim.

If you’ve heard the phrase “fidelity bond” used interchangeably with “crime insurance” you might be questioning whether there is any difference between the two. Fidelity bonds constitute a specific type of crime insurance that addresses crimes stemming from employee actions. Employee dishonesty bonds business services bonds and ERISA bonds are the three main categories of fidelity bonds and each protects businesses from a specific set of crimes which will be outlined later in this guide. It’s important to note that a business services bond can strengthen your commercial crime insurance by covering the reimbursement of losses sustained by your customers as a result of your employees’ actions.

Individual fidelity bonds are an effective way to shield your business from the effects on employee crime but they don’t provide as much coverage as a broad crime insurance policy. As mentioned before commercial crime policies usually cover not only employee-related crimes but also those crimes carried out by third parties.

How Does Crime Insurance Work?

A crime insurance policy is often added to an existing BOP (business owners policy) or general liability insurance policy. Commercial crime coverage functions like many other common forms of business insurance: in exchange for a monthly or annual premium paid by the policyholder the insurance provider assumes financial risk in the event of a covered claim. Covered claims generally fall under two broad coverage categories. First-party coverage protects your business from direct losses resulting from criminal activity perpetrated against your business usually by an employee. Although this coverage can be extended to cover criminal activity committed by an outside party. Third-party coverage on the other hand protects your business in the event that another entity-such as a client or business-claims your business (or employee of your business) committed a criminal act against them. This type of coverage is common for businesses whose employees work at a client’s property.

Most commercial crime insurance policies operate on a “named perils” basis meaning that in order for a loss to be covered the loss and crime that caused it must be specifically named in the policy. If a loss or crime type is not specifically named in the policy it will not be covered. For example a policy might state that the insurer will compensate the insured for direct losses sustained as a result of impersonation fraud meaning instances of that specific kind of fraud would be covered.

Another type of policy which is far less common in the U.S. is an “all-risks” crime policy. Unlike named perils policies all-risks policies include broad language that cover a wide range of incidents. With all-risks policies all losses and types of crimes are covered as long as they are not specifically excluded from the policy.

In addition to whether the policy is written as a named perils or all-risks policy how coverage is triggered is also an important component to consider. Commercial crime policies make use of either a “loss-discovered” or a “loss-sustained” trigger.

Policies that use a “loss-discovered” trigger will cover any losses incurred by your business that are discovered within the policy period. The loss will be covered even if the actual crime took place weeks months or even years before. This is usually preferred as it gives business owners more time to discover and then claim a loss.

Unlike discovery triggers “loss-sustained” triggers require that the loss is both sustained and discovered during the policy period in order to qualify for coverage. Under these terms losses that go undiscovered for some time may not be covered. Similarly losses that are discovered during the policy period but occurred prior will also not be covered. Because of these limitations this type of trigger is considered less desirable especially if your business is at risk of electronic crime-instances of transferred funds or tampering with a computer system may not be immediately obvious.

Policy rules vary but generally the insuring company must be notified of a discovered loss in writing as soon as possible. Proof of the losses incurred must be provided as well within a few months of the initial discovery. Proof of loss may not be immediately obvious or easy to gather and present so be sure to familiarize yourself with your policy’s terms– some companies may cover the cost of hiring specialists to help you compile the necessary body of evidence.

The last component of commercial crime insurance that must be considered is the policy limit. While some insurance policies have aggregate limits that define the maximum cost your insurer will cover throughout a single policy period commercial crime insurance does not. Instead the limit of a crime policy defines the maximum cost an insurer will cover per occurrence or per claim regardless of how many claims are filed during the policy period.

What Does Crime Insurance Cover?

Crime insurance covers a range of crimes committed against a business both on the part of employees and third parties or outside perpetrators. This includes theft forgery and other acts of fraud as well as computer-based crimes which have been on the rise over the past decade. Direct costs covered include reimbursement of financial and property losses. The following sections provide an overview of the most common types of criminal acts usually covered by crime insurance.

Employee Dishonesty & Theft

Employee dishonesty and theft should be on any business owner’s radar even within a company based on trust and communication. Petty theft shoplifting and property damage perpetrated at your business are among covered circumstances. If off-premises coverage is specified as part of your policy theft committed in transit will also be covered-in a situation where money or property is being physically moved between locations for example.

This also applies to thefts committed by an employee at a work site. Consider the example of a carpentry business owner who receives complaints from a number of clients who notice valuables missing from their homes. They may suspect that an employee who worked in each of the homes may be at fault. If that is found to be true the cost of the clients’ property will be covered by the business owner’s combined first- and third-party commercial crime insurance policy. Policies that specifically target employee-related theft are often referred to as employee dishonesty insurance.

Third-Party Theft

Theft committed by a third outside party not employed by your business is also covered by commercial crime insurance as long as your policy includes both types of coverage. This includes theft of property theft of money and destruction of money or securities.

Computer Fraud

Computer to computer hacking is a kind of computer fraud that is covered under commercial crime insurance. This would enable a hacker to transfer funds and/or information to an outside source causing financial loss. False transfer requests are another form of electronic fraud in which the perpetrator instructs a bank to transfer funds under the insured’s name.

Social Engineering Fraud

Also called impersonation fraud social engineering fraud encompasses a number of manipulative actions a criminal may undertake to convince you or an employee to transfer money. This kind of fraud often includes phone or email contact and requests to wire money or change a vendor’s account details. Perpetrators may target an individual after doing research on the business they work for to make sure the scenario they are proposing seems believable.

Many will operate on a purported basis of trust after learning enough about their target to impersonate a vendor or a party otherwise affiliated with your business. As the consequences of social engineering fraud may not become obvious until it is too late to regain lost revenue this is where a loss-discovered form would prove safer than a loss-sustained form.

Forgery

Forgery can take various forms but fraudulent check signatures are a common instance of employee crime. Crime insurance coverage can protect you from forgery under your name as well as alterations. Alterations include any unauthorized changes to checks or other documents under your name. Forgery alteration and embezzlement are examples of other crimes that are often committed internally and may not be immediately noticeable.

Counterfeit Currency

If your business receives counterfeit currency from a payment transaction your financial losses incurred as a result will also be covered by commercial crime insurance. This also includes instances of counterfeit money orders. Counterfeit payments may not be immediately noticeable and they are often discovered after the transaction has been made.

Crime Insurance Exclusions

While most of the crimes included under a commercial crime insurance policy may seem straightforward it’s important to note some exceptions. Like most insurance policies crime insurance has specific exclusions that you’ll want to keep in mind.

As a reminder most commercial crime policies are written on a named perils basis meaning that only the incidents and types of costs specifically listed on the policy will ultimately qualify for coverage. In general crime policies cover direct losses incurred as a result of criminal activity committed by employees or outside parties. Crimes committed by business owners indirect losses legal fees and losses resulting from non-criminal activity are usually excluded from standard policies. For more details on what’s not covered by crime insurance continue reading below.

Legal Fees

Unlike many other commercial insurance policies commercial crime insurance won’t cover any legal fees incurred by your business. While some insurers may cover the cost of hiring specialists to help you gather proof of loss the cost of hiring a legal defense team will not be covered in most scenarios. When it comes to assistance with gathering proof of loss coverage is not guaranteed and varies from policy to policy.

Employees With Criminal Records

If you as the insured become aware of a crime or crimes committed by a particular employee any further losses caused by that employee will not be covered. The first instance of you becoming aware of crimes perpetrated by that employee triggers the “discovery of loss.” For example if you witness an employee stealing money from the cash register but wait until it happens again to address the crime and open a claim the second instance of theft may not be covered. Also if you as the insured are aware of an employee’s criminal history further crimes committed by that employee may not be covered under a commercial crime policy.

Theft Committed by Owners or Partners

Crimes committed by business owners business shareholders or senior partners will not be covered by commercial crime insurance.

Data Losses

Data losses or breaches include the loss of information such as client lists sensitive customer information business plans and intellectual property. While such incidents usually result in indirect financial losses in the form of third-party lawsuits legal fees restitution and data recovery they don’t cause direct financial losses which is what crime insurance is designed to cover. Because of this the indirect losses caused by cyber attacks and data breaches are not covered by crime insurance and are instead addressed with a cyber liability policy.

Computing & Accounting Mistakes

Computer or accounting mistakes of a non-criminal nature will not be covered under commercial crime insurance either. For example say one of your employees in the accounting department makes a mistake in their work that results in the business having to pay a sizable penalty to the IRS. This would not be covered by crime insurance. Similarly say one of your website developers makes an error that causes your company’s website to go down for hours which results in lost sales and revenue. Again this would not be caused by crime insurance since the nature of the incidents stemmed from mistakes rather than criminal activity.

As a side note in both of the examples above a mistake by an employee resulted in a loss for the business they are employed by. Had their mistakes resulted in a loss for one of your business’s clients a professional liability insurance policy would provide coverage.

Inventory Discrepancies

Since reasons behind inventory discrepancies can vary between criminal and non-criminal intent inventory discrepancies without evidence of theft will not be covered under commercial crime insurance. Some examples of evidence of criminal activity include video tapes witness statements and transaction records that indicate an employee was unlawfully taking and/or selling company products for their own gain.

Indirect Losses

If a criminal act against your business leads to indirect losses like loss of income or interruption of regular business practices those will not be covered under commercial crime insurance. Direct business losses stem from acts like property theft theft of money and securities and unauthorized transfer of funds between accounts. Criminal acts that result in indirect losses for your business can be covered under a business interruption policy.

Who Needs Crime Insurance?

There are a number of telling factors that put certain businesses at higher risk of crime than others. While internal protocols and risk-management solutions can prevent certain risks including crime the following businesses would benefit most from commercial crime protection.

Businesses with a significant part-time workforce will benefit from crime insurance. The more part-time employees there are to keep track of the greater the risk of missing internal employee theft. The same goes for businesses with large product inventories. The more inventory a business has to manage the harder it is to track employee theft or inventory discrepancies.

According to Embroker’s statistics American businesses lose up to $50 billion a year on employee theft. As most businesses rely on cash transactions or digital data-including digital transactions customer financial records and company financial records-they are at risk of both internal and external theft. Any business that deals with direct payments digital information and financial records is susceptible to having sensitive information and funds stolen or transferred without authorization.

Commercial Crime Insurance Requirements

While most commercial crime insurance policies are not mandated by federal law there are certain scenarios in which a crime insurance policy may be a contractual requirement or otherwise required for conducting business with another party.

For example certain clients may require you to secure fidelity bonds before finalizing a contract. Fidelity bonds are sub-categories of commercial crime insurance that address specific circumstances which will be outlined in detail in the next sections. Businesses that provide employee benefit plans are also required to purchase fidelity bonds under the ERISA or Employee Retirement Income Security Act as a way to protect participating employees’ assets.

Rules regarding specific fidelity bonds also vary by state. For example California requires every HOA or homeowner’s association in the state to secure an HOA fidelity bond. The same goes for Florida unless the requirement is unanimously waived.

Small Businesses

While crime insurance is often recommended for businesses with large workforces and inventories small businesses will also benefit from the protections it offers. Small businesses that rely on both card and digital payment transactions will benefit from commercial crime protections especially in instances of an employee mishandling inventory or funds. Though this may surprise you 90% of large theft-related losses are estimated to stem from employee dishonesty. Small businesses that regularly handle product or customer property may be more prone to internal theft as well.

Financial Institutions

Since banks and other financial institutions regularly work with money transfers sensitive customer information and high-value transactions they may be more prone to employee dishonesty forgery and fraud. This makes banks credit unions and brokerage companies prime candidates for comprehensive crime insurance plans. While actual bank robberies are relatively rare employee-related crimes are considered to be one of the largest risks banks and other financial institutions face.

Homeowners Associations (HOAs)

Homeowners associations or HOAs are another type of business that is vulnerable to crimes like embezzlement theft and fraud. HOAs often use multiple accounts to store funds in anticipation of large purchases. The amount of money stored in these accounts has a tendency to grow quickly thanks to regular member payments. Since HOAs are often managed by a small group of employees or supervisors the money in their accounts may not be kept track of regularly. This can make HOA accounts easier to target.

If for example an HOA has set up a long-term account in anticipation of full roof replacement and an internal employee begins siphoning a small amount of money monthly the discrepancy may go unnoticed for a long period of time. This is especially true if the money in the account grows regularly because of monthly payments and there’s not enough officials overseeing the numbers each month. Commercial crime coverage would provide protection in these types of scenarios.

Commercial Crime Coverage Compared to Other Policies

Commercial crime coverage may seem straightforward but it’s actually fairly nuanced and often confused with other policies that address similar incidents. Two such policies are fidelity bonds and cyber insurance which are discussed in more detail below.

Crime Insurance vs. Fidelity Bonds

While fidelity bonds fall under the umbrella of crime insurance the two are not identical. You can think of fidelity bonds as a kind of crime insurance product with a different set of protections than a broader commercial crime insurance policy.

Fidelity bonds usually come in the form of employee dishonesty bonds business services bonds and ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) bonds each of which serve a different purpose.

As their name suggests employee dishonesty bonds will cover securities money and property theft perpetrated against your business by an employee. This coverage is necessary because other standard commercial insurance policies-like commercial property and general liability-won’t cover losses caused by internal employee theft. Examples of employee dishonesty range from physical theft of inventory to embezzlement of funds and the misuse of business or client credit card information.

Business services bonds are a type of fidelity bond that focus on protecting your customers as opposed to you and your business. If one of your employees commits a crime that results in a customer or client’s property or financial loss business services bonds will cover the cost of replacing their loss. Business services bonds are also a reputation booster as they communicate to your clients that their property and financial assets will be secure.

Resulting from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 an ERISA bond is a fidelity bond that a business owner is mandated to take out to cover employee benefit plans including pensions and 401k plans. This kind of bond has to cover at least 10% of the plan’s assets and is meant to protect employees from dishonest activities that may affect their benefit funds. In most cases ERISA requirements state that individuals who manage such benefit plans must secure a bond to cover losses from embezzlement forgery theft or misuse of funds.

Crime Insurance vs. Cyber Insurance

As discussed above commercial crime insurance focuses narrowly on direct tangible monetary or property losses that result from crimes committed against your business (by an employee or third party) as well as crimes committed against your customers by an employee of your business. The types of crimes covered could be perpetrated electronically or involve the physical theft of property. The most important thing to note is that in general for crime insurance to cover an incident money or property must have been stolen.

Cyber insurance also known as cyber liability insurance covers indirect losses that result specifically from some form of electronic crime perpetrated against your business such as a data breach or cyber attack. These indirect losses include those incurred by your business in responding to the incident-for example legal expenses data recovery lost income public relations fines and customer notification. Indirect losses also include those incurred should a third party bring a lawsuit against your business following the incident.

As a business owner it can sometimes be difficult to determine which policy would apply to a given incident. To help consider the following:

If the incident resulted in a tangible loss of money or property crime insurance will usually be the applicable policy

If the incident resulted in an intangible loss-such as the theft of sensitive customer information account numbers etc.-cyber insurance will apply

When it comes to what costs the policies will actually pay for keep in mind:

Crime insurance reimburses for direct losses based on the value of what was actually stolen. Crime policies don’t cover legal fees public relations costs loss of income etc.

Cyber insurance on the other hand reimburses for indirect losses incurred while effectively responding to the incident. This does include legal fees lost income PR etc.

Commercial Crime Insurance Costs & Premiums

As with other forms of commercial insurance premiums for commercial crime coverage vary widely based on a variety of factors. In addition to the premium businesses should also consider the deductible which will impact the total amount paid before any money is actually received from the insurer in the event of a claim.

How Much Does Commercial Crime Insurance Cost?

For most small businesses commercial crime insurance is an affordable policy that is a smart choice to have. Policies for small businesses typically range in price from less than $1000 to a few thousand dollars annually. Another way to think about the cost of crime insurance or fidelity bonds is as a percentage of the total coverage amount. Depending on a variety of factors related to your business and the policy limit business owners can expect to pay between 0.1%–3% for their policies.

Factors That Affect the Price of Crime Insurance

As with any insurance policy there are a number of factors that can affect your final premium.

Coverage limit and deductible: Generally speaking the higher your coverage limit the higher your annual cost will be. According to Insureon a fidelity bond with a coverage limit of $1000000 may total about $100 in annual costs while a policy with a limit of $2 million may amount to about $1750 yearly. Deductibles or the amount that is paid out of pocket before a claim is covered can usually be chosen by the insured. Generally speaking the higher the deductible the lower the premium and vice versa.

Deductibles or the amount that is paid out of pocket before a claim is covered can usually be chosen by the insured. Generally speaking the higher the deductible the lower the premium and vice versa. Industry: Your business’s industry will affect the cost of your commercial crime insurance premium. High-risk industries will incur larger costs than industries deemed low-risk. High-risk industries typically include high-traffic retail tech and financial institutions.

Comparing Commercial Crime Insurance

As with any kind of insurance you’ll want to compare and contrast commercial crime policies to find the best fit for your business. The following factors should all be considered when weighing your options.

Coverage Options & Policy Limits

When considering your coverage options be aware of whether a policy utilizes a “loss-discovered” or “loss-sustained” trigger. Similar to an occurrence-based liability policy a loss-sustained policy will only cover losses that both took place and were discovered while the policy was active. Policies written on a discovery basis on the other hand will automatically cover losses that were discovered within the active policy period no matter when they took place.

You’ll find that most commercial crime insurance policies operate on a “named perils” opposed to an “all-risks” basis meaning that losses claimed must be within the categories outlined in the actual policy. You’ll want to read through your policy carefully to be aware of the specific losses that it names and covers.

Claims expenses are another aspect of your commercial crime insurance policy you’ll want to pay attention to as claim expenses coverage limits may vary. Your claim expenses are separate from the cost of reimbursing stolen goods and assets-claim expenses encompass the costs of the claim itself. When it comes to submitting crime claims the cost may be even higher since forensic experts may be needed to provide evidence along with a team of attorneys. A higher claims expense limit will mean a higher premium but may save you money in the event of an expensive claim you submit on behalf of your business.

Your policy limit is the maximum amount your insurer will pay out for a claim covered by your policy. Most insurers offer a range of limits to choose from and higher limits usually mean higher premiums. Keep in mind that when it comes to commercial crime insurance the limit won’t be aggregated meaning it will apply individually to each loss incurred.

Premiums & Deductibles

As is the case with most insurance policies your premium or annual cost of insurance depends on a number of factors including the size and scope of your business your coverage limit and your claims history. However business owners can look for reduced limits higher deductibles and policies with less flexibility to save money on annual costs.

Financial Strength

Financial strength is an important factor to consider when looking for a commercial crime insurance provider. Financial strength ratings are subject to change so you’ll want to check rating agencies like AM Best Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s for the latest scores. By rating insurance companies on a number of factors including how effective they are in meeting their financial obligations when it comes to claim coverage these agencies can help you choose the most reliable provider.

Company Reputation

Along with financial strength a company’s reputation with its customers is crucial to choosing the right insurer. Sources like the Better Business Bureau and J.D. Power analyze companies’ customer ratings and reputation allowing you to access information that may not be readily available otherwise. Similarly the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also provides comprehensive data on insurance companies incorporating a complaint index that compares performance across insurers. Obtained by dividing the company’s complaints by its share of premiums the index is a reliable indicator of an insurer’s reputation.

The Best Commercial Crime Insurance Companies Overall

Chubb (Best Commercial Crime Insurance Overall)

Chubb Best Crime Insurance Overall

Known as a leading underwriter Chubb is a sound choice for large and mid-sized businesses that need a reliable comprehensive commercial crime insurance policy. The company goes above and beyond in providing detailed information for customers about its crime insurance offerings generally as well as for specific policies.

Pros Offers a loss-discovered policy which is preferable to loss-sustained

Offers an all-risks insuring clause

Covers the costs of customer notification in the event of a data breach Cons Chubb’s policies are usually more expensive than those offered by competitors

Along with providing a transparent guide to all of its commercial crime insurance services on its website Chubb specifies important highlights of its crime policy right away. The company’s commercial crime insurance operates on a loss-discovered basis meaning it covers losses that are discovered within the policy period no matter when the actual crime occurred. This is highly preferable to the alternate loss-sustained policy form which limits coverage to losses that take place during the policy period. Chubb’s loss-discovered policy takes into account crimes that may not be immediately obvious and are only realized after a long period of time.

The company is similarly transparent regarding its all-risks insurance clause. As opposed to a conventional named perils policy an all-risks policy is not limited to only covering the specific risks outlined in the insuring agreement. This results in broader coverage and less risk assumed by the customer.

Another benefit of Chubb’s commercial crime coverage is the company’s commitment to covering costs like customer notification in case of a data breach. Notifying customers when their information has been put at risk can be a highly expensive task and Chubb’s ability to cover these costs can relieve you of an additional financial burden in an already difficult situation. This along with the services listed above ensures your peace of mind in case an electronic or physical crime is committed against your business.

The company’s NAIC complaint index is listed as 0.43 putting it far below the expected market index of 1.00 when it comes to complaints. This is a positive sign as it is indicative of the company’s low frequency of complaints when compared to other insurers.

Chubb’s extensive list of services and policy benefits mean that the company’s insurance packages tend to be more expensive than those of its competitors. This is part of the reason why Chubb’s coverage is often recommended for larger and mid-sized businesses with greater financial resources. However with Chubb you do get what you pay for. And even despite its more expensive policies we still recommend Chubb as offering the Best Commercial Crime Insurance Overall.

Hiscox’s definition of an employee includes temporary and leased employees including former workers in consulting positions. Guest students interns uncompensated officers trustees volunteers and employees on medical leave also fall under its broad policy language. This makes Hiscox’s commercial crime coverage more flexible than that offered by many of its competitors.

While Hiscox is known for its focus on small businesses it may not be the best choice for larger organizations with more complex needs.

That said in 2019 Hiscox had a complaint index that was about 30% below average so we don’t consider this to be much of a concern.

After a strong performance against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' unique rushing attack in their Week 1 loss the Jets are preparing for another challenging matchup in the trenches in Week 2.

New York travels to Cleveland set to face the two-headed monster of Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt.

Last season the Browns were fourth in the NFL averaging 145.4 rushing yards per game. They flexed that dominance on the ground in their Week 1 win over the Panthers rushing for 217 yards (second-most yards in the league to open the 2022 season).

Against Carolina Chubb racked up 141 rushing yards on 22 carries. Hunt added 46 rushing yards on 11 touches with a touchdown.

""They have arguably the best one-two punch at running back between Chubb and Hunt"" Jets head coach Robert Saleh told reporters on Friday. ""[Offensive line coach] Bill Callahan and [head coach Kevin] Stefanski they do as good of a job as anyone with regards to creating issues in the run game. So they’re very talented there.""

Star defensive end Carl Lawson—who has plenty of experience against the Browns from his time in the AFC North with the Bengals—also praised Cleveland's rushing attack calling Hunt and Chubb two of the top-10 backs in the league.

Cleveland's rushing attack is much more traditional. While the Ravens use a mobile quarterback as the focal point of their ground game with plenty of misdirection and deception the Browns will pound the rock all afternoon even when you know it's coming.

""This one’s different in the sense that you pretty much know where they’re running how they’re going to do it and they don’t care. It’s a different mentality which you appreciate as a football coach"" Saleh added. ""They are running the ball they still have good pass game and all that stuff too they’ve got great play action pass system. Now this one is more direct but at the same time they get you running they move gaps and it’s a really cool scheme.""

Jets defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich explained that similar to Week 1 if New York is unable to stop the run it'll be a long game for their defense. The mindset remains the same entering this matchup—setting the edge and bringing all 11 hats to the football—but the type of runners they're facing will be a little bit different.



""They’re both powerful they’re both strong they’re both extremely fast"" Ulbrich told reporters on Thursday. ""They’ve got the ability to do the dirty work inside and push the pile and do the hard ball running. But they also have the ability to finish runs because they both have explosiveness top end speed.""

In Week 1 the Jets limited Baltimore to 63 rushing yards. Only two other teams had fewer rushing yards to begin the campaign. They still couldn't stop the explosive plays through the air as the game developed though. That's what led to a blowout victory for the Ravens.

If New York can keep the Browns in third-and-long situations forcing them to throw the football (with quarterback Jacoby Brissett) they'll be in a good spot on that side of the ball. To put it bluntly containing those two backs and setting an edge early on is one of the Jets' only paths to victory.

""It’s rare in this modern-day NFL that you get back-to-back games like this where they’re a run first team so it’s a great challenge for us"" Ulbrich said.

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

Instead of a relatively unobstructed view of Cedar and Rattlesnake mountains overlooking the city now anyone looking that way will see a large yellow crane. It’s waiting in eager anticipation to help build a controversial Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple that a group of local residents are trying to stop in Park County District court.

Later this month a final hearing will be held in the lawsuit that was filed by neighbors of the proposed temple site and others trying to block its construction.

The decision made by Johnson County Judge John R. Perry coming out of the May 23 hearing will likely determine if construction of the temple can begin.

In the meantime the church seems ready to start as soon as it’s able with a host of large shipping containers with components of the temple being moved to the temple site off Skyline Drive.

Outrage

Many in Cody expressed outrage on social media this week that not only had the crane been moved to the proposed site but so have modular units for the proposed Cody LDS temple. These storage units contain materials for the 101-foot-tall temple’s construction.

The church announced in a press release this week that because the previous spot the containers were stored is no longer available it had to move them to a site adjacent to where the temple will be built.

As first reported by Cowboy State Daily in 2023 these items were being stored at Y-Tex Corp. a business owned by a member of the church who had donated the land for the temple.

“This new storage location will avoid future crossings of public roads with these modular units during the temple construction” said Jimmie Edwards second counselor for the LDS Cody Wyoming Stake in a press release. “The church is not yet commencing construction of the temple.”

The church owns the temple property and is fully allowed to use the site to keep the containers there.

But many locals say the optics look bad and that it serves as evidence that construction of the temple is inevitable.

Others defend the project saying it’s hypocritical that critics aren’t similarly outraged about two historic buildings that were torn down in the city earlier this year.

Not So?

The nearly 10000-square-foot temple sparked controversy mainly because of the size of the building and its steeple on an almost 5-acre piece of land overlooking Cody. Some living in the neighborhood say the steeple will destroy their viewshed and the temple will have other negative impacts like ruining the night sky and creating more traffic.

The temple dispute is a topic that has dragged on for more than a year in Cody. The issue has riled up the community causing a clear divide between those who support and oppose the project.

Cody resident Dylan Wood who runs youth ministries in town said he’s very disappointed with how some people have been speaking about the temple online particularly those he knows to be of the Christian faith using scripture in what he sees as a distrustful and hateful manner.

“There’s been some really hateful stuff from people who are ‘Christians’ and it really hurts my heart” he said.

Wood said people need to remember the Ten Commandments which state that “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

Although he’s under no illusion that Cody is perfect Wood said many people seem to prefer being upset about something rather than appreciating the positivity in the community around them. Five years down the road after the temple is finished Wood believes the community will have already forgotten about it.

Carla Egelhoff an organizer with Protect Our Cody Neighborhoods (POCN) a group fighting the church in court hasn’t forgotten about the temple yet. Egelhoff said she isn’t personally bothered by the materials being moved to the temple site but has no idea if the church is telling the truth about why it is moving them.

Optimism

Egelhoff said she believes her group’s case is strong. POCN is challenging the decision made by the Cody Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) to allow construction of the temple last August.

“POCN has entered compelling legal arguments based on the Wyoming State Statutes and Cody city ordinances in support of a decision to reverse the PZB decisions and remand the conditional use permit and the site plan back to the City of Cody” Egelhoff said.

If the judge doesn’t rule in POCN’s favor Egelhoff said the group will consider filing an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Egelhoff also mentioned how the Cody City Council approved a number of changes as a result of how the temple approval process played out. Most notably this includes more deference to the city’s master plan and notification to landowners in a larger range around a proposed project for a conditional use permit (CUP).

According to the Cody Enterprise  under the new code if 20% or more of the property owners object to a project the PZB can only make a recommendation to the city council which then gets the final decision. In the past only Planning and Zoning Board members had a final say on CUPs.

“The change of number of neighbor notifications and handling of nearby affected property owners input is welcomed at this time” Eglehoff said. “Significant opposition to requests that are outside of current zoning ordinances ought to be addressed by elected officials. More opportunities for citizen participation will be positive for Cody into the future.”

Also when a site plan is under consideration there now must be approval from the majority of the board not just the members present at a meeting which aligns with Wyoming law. This had been a major source of contention at a meeting last summer where a majority of the board members present at a meeting rejected its site plan not the board as a whole.

The condition is a complex one that presents differently in each patient many of whom are drug-resistant. These challenges make OCD difficult to treat. Many patients suffering from the condition do not respond well to traditional treatment options such as cognitive behavioral therapy and medication.

BrainsWay an Israeli company that provides noninvasive neurostimulation treatments for mental health disorders is working to solve this problem through its deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device. On Thursday Cigna announced that it is revising its TMS medical coverage policy to extend coverage for BrainsWay’s deep TMS device to patients ages 18 and older who are diagnosed with OCD.

With its policy change Cigna now joins several other major insurers that cover the device including Centene Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Tricare and Palmetto GBA. More than 86 million adults can now access BrainsWay’s deep TMS treatment for OCD said CEO Christopher von Jako.

TMS is a noninvasive treatment that activates brain structures through directed electromagnetic fields that generate the excitation of neurons. BrainsWay specializes in deep TMS treatment an advancement of traditional TMS. Deep TMS uses flexible H-Coils embedded in a patient and operator-friendly helmet. These noninvasively activate targeted brain structures that can address a range of mental health conditions.

The H-Coil design in BrainsWay’s device enables deeper and broader stimulation than traditional TMS coils according to von Jako. This results in greater neuron activation and a lesser likelihood of targeting errors.

There are companies that provide traditional TMS solutions — such as Neuronetics and MagVenture which also have approved devices to treat OCD in the U.S. But von Jako contends that BrainsWay is the only company to offer deep TMS.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Patients who use BrainWay’s deep TMS device to treat OCD use it daily anywhere from 3 to 20 minutes. They use it for at least four weeks with the option to later integrate it into their day-to-day schedule according to von Jako. Since its introduction in 2019 the response rate for BrainsWay’s device in real clinical practice settings is nearly 60% with an average durability of about 2 years he shared.

Under Cigna’s updated coverage policy an initial deep TMS treatment session regimen will be classified as medically necessary if the patient meets the following two criteria: two or more failed medication trials and a trial of evidence-based psychotherapy without significant improvement in symptoms. This treatment regimen involves 30-36 sessions.

The policy also stipulates that patients who experience a 30% or greater improvement in their scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale — the most common OCD rating scale — maintained for at least two months are candidates for an additional regimen of 30-36 more sessions.

Cigna is one of the biggest health plans in the U.S — it provides commercial health coverage to about 17 million members in 13 states and has Medicare Advantage plans in 16 states. Cigna also participates in the Health Insurance Marketplace online exchange. Earning a positive coverage policy is a huge step for BrainsWay von Jako said.

“If I was speaking with you about one year ago I would have told you we had zero coverage for deep TMS treatment for OCD patients” he said. “With Cigna’s positive coverage policy we have increased the coverage to over 85 million lives in the U.S. We still have a lot of work to do and plan to keep blazing a trail towards even more positive coverage to increase patient access for this life-saving treatment.”

That premise is now law of the land since the federal No Surprises Act took effect Jan. 1. It protects patients from receiving surprise medical bills resulting from unexpected out-of-network coverage for emergency services anesthesiology radiology and other medical care.

The landmark consumer law is already creating huge waves. In recent weeks emergency physicians in Indiana and elsewhere have sounded the alarm that since the measure went into effect large insurers—including Cigna and UnitedHealthcare—have threatened to terminate emergency service contracts if ER doctors don’t agree to pay cuts of up to 50% of the current in-network rates.

The doctors say the threatened rate cuts could compromise the quality of emergency rooms and could lead to long waits to see a doctor.

Emergency physicians who are notoriously independent are increasingly turning up the heat over insurance reimbursements. They say insurers have refused for years to reimburse them at rates they consider fair resulting in many ER groups remaining out of network.

“We’ve struggled over the years” said Dr. John McGoff a retired emergency physician at Community Health Network and past president of the Indiana State Medical Association. “We set a price [for various medical procedures] and if the insurers didn’t agree we would walk away. … Sometimes it was a bit of a cat-and-mouse game.”

As a result a growing number of Americans treated at hospitals that are part of their insurance networks were getting billed for out-of-network care for at least part of the bill. The proportion of emergency room visits to in-network hospitals that result in out-of-network bills surged from 32% to 42% from 2010 to 2016 according to a 2019 report in JAMA Internal Medicine.

“At some point emergency physician groups will not be able to adequately staff emergency departments” said the Emergency Department Practice Management Association a trade group based in McLean Virginia in an Aug. 1 statement. “This will lead to holes in the health care safety net which could lead to longer waits for emergency care or the inability to staff emergency departments.”

Out of network

A health insurance network is a group of doctors and medical care providers who have a contract to provide services to members of a health insurance plan usually at rates that are lower than the sticker prices for patients without insurance.

For years emergency physicians and insurers would often come to loggerheads over rates resulting in many doctors remaining out of insurance networks.

With the ER doctors out of so many networks patients who visited an emergency room at a hospital that was in their health network could get a huge unpleasant surprise in the form of a large bill often thousands of dollars from the doctor.

Since the doctor was out of network the insurer would pay only a small amount and the doctor would charge the balance to the patient.

But since the No Surprises Act went into effect out-of-network physician groups can no longer bill in-network patients for the balance of the bill that insurers refused to pay a practice known as “balanced billing.”

Instead they must work out the difference with insurers through a negotiation process—or if that fails through an independent dispute-resolution process set up by the federal government. Either way the patient is taken out of the equation and no longer receives a surprise bill.

Some experts in health care law say the No Surprises Act is providing much-needed protection for American consumers.

“I think this is a great thing for patients in general” said Matthew Reed an attorney with Hall Render Killian Heath & Lyman in Indianapolis. “… If you’re going to an emergency room in an in-network facility you shouldn’t be scared that you’re all of a sudden going to receive a crazy bill.”

Consumer protection

The federal law builds on laws enacted in 33 states including Indiana that extended a certain level of protections to consumers against surprise out-of-network bills.

Many hospitals and even emergency doctors say they supported the No Surprises Act chiefly for the protection it gives patients although they say it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.

“Taking patients out of the middle in these situations was imperative” said Brian Tabor president of the Indiana Hospital Association. “Patients would understandably be frustrated with the hospital even though the disputes were between independent physicians and insurers. But given the extremely low rates that Hoosier physicians are reimbursed by commercial insurers the solution has to be a balanced one that doesn’t further disadvantage providers.”

Some emergency physician groups seeking more leverage have joined forces with larger companies. In April St. Vincent Emergency Physicians Inc. was acquired by Vituity a physician-owned company based in Chicago.

The acquisition means doctors in Ascension St. Vincent emergency rooms at 21 hospitals across Indiana now work for Vituity a national group with more than 5000 physicians.

“We needed to partner with a larger national group that had a bigger scale and better leverage to negotiate with insurers” said Dr. Bart Brown an emergency physician at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital on West 86th Street and a board member of the Indiana chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians.

He added that the situation between small independent groups of emergency physicians and the huge national insurers such as Minneapolis-based UnitedHealthcare and Indianapolis-based Elevance Health Inc. (formerly Anthem Inc.) has been “pretty toxic.”

The small medical groups “don’t have the negotiating power or the time to dispute every bill” he said.

Insurers for their part say they support the No Surprises Act because it provides important consumer protection for patients. They point fingers at medical providers for the high out-of-network bills that used to get sent to patients.

The nation’s largest health insurance trade group AHIP (formerly known as America’s Health Insurance Plans) released a survey in May that found that in the first two months of 2022 the law prevented more than 2 million potential surprise medical bills across all commercially insured patients.

“No American should ever face a surprise medical bill that can lead to financial ruin” the Washington D.C.-based group said in a statement.

Indianapolis-based Elevance Health did not respond to emails from IBJ seeking comment on the No Surprises Act or the company’s relationship with out-of-network physicians.

Negotiating tool

But some insurers are using the federal ban on surprise out-of-network bills as a negotiating tactic with in-network providers according to Modern Healthcare an industry newspaper.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield North Carolina referred to the No Surprises Act in letters sent to providers in March and November 2021 writing that it would end contracts with anesthesiologists radiologists emergency physicians and others unless they agreed to payment reductions of up to 30% the report said.

UnitedHealthcare requested a 40% decrease in payments according to a letter the American College of Emergency Physicians sent to the North Carolina congressional delegation in March the paper said.

In response UnitedHealthcare said some out-of-network doctors were billing at more than 1000% of Medicare rates. “The No Surprises Act is bringing greater price transparency to the healthcare system and finally putting an end to the financially crippling surprise bills that consumers have struggled with for years” the insurer told Modern Healthcare.

The issue is even playing out in court to an extent. In July a startup that specializes in buying written-off medical accounts sued UnitedHealthcare for $15.1 million claiming it failed to fully pay St. Vincent Emergency Physicians for services it provided to its members.

Ecure Corp. said the cases in dispute involved medical visits where UnitedHealthcare did not have contracts with St. Vincent Emergency Physicians and thus were considered out of network. Ecure whose principal office is in suburban San Diego said the insurer usually paid part of each claim but typically less than the full amount.

Eliot Listman CEO of Ecure’s operating group Allia Group said the potential amount of underpaid claims to emergency physicians across the United States could run as high as $43 billion. “These emergency physicians of all sorts are victimized” he said.

His group has partnered with several medical coding and billing companies including Indianapolis-based Ciproms Inc. to analyze claims and go after insurers he said have underpaid emergency physicians.

“They give us access to both data and these provider groups and our interests are very much aligned” Listman said.

Ciproms for its part said unpaid and underpaid claim reimbursements from big insurers is a “perpetual problem.”

“I think it is important to note that generally emergency physicians do not want to be out-of-network” Andrea Halpern Bryan Ciproms’ president and CEO wrote in an email to the IBJ. “Emergency physicians were in support of the No Surprises Act and were active in advocating for a law that protected their patients.”

In another spat UnitedHealthcare and Nashville-based Envision Healthcare this month each filed a lawsuit against the other in a Tennessee federal court over a disagreement about payments for emergency care.

The two organizations have been out of network with each other since Dec. 31 2020 after the two parties were unable to reach an agreement over reimbursement rates according to Becker’s Hospital Review.

Envision Healthcare a physician services company sued UnitedHealthcare Sept. 8 for allegedly engaging in an unlawful scheme after the split to “enrich its overflowing coffers” by denying emergency room claims for its highest-acuity patients. UnitedHealthcare for its part sued Envision Sept. 9 claiming the company “deliberately upcoded thousands of claims” and deceived the payer into overpaying by millions of dollars for emergency care starting Jan. 1 2021.

At the root

Part of the problem is that the law did not address the underlying issues in how people get emergency care some observers say. In emergencies patients often have no idea in advance whether the ER doctors are in network. Nor can they choose a certain hospital when they are having a medical emergency.

“The root market failure that created the surprise billing problem is that patients lack meaningful choice of provider for certain services” according to a white paper published last year by the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy “In emergencies patients can unavoidably end up at an out of network facility or being treated by out-of-network physicians.”•

But while all schools faced unprecedented challenges some adapted quickly using technology to help children not just cope but thrive.

One such success story was the Canutillo Independent School District in Texas. It was accomplished under the leadership of Dr. Oscar Rico the district’s executive director of technology — and through a strong partnership with Cisco. Along the way some stark challenges had to be faced including income inequality lack of internet access and the anxiety that such conditions caused in children.

“It’s a terrible feeling for any educator to say because of your socioeconomic status you don’t have the right to this” Rico said.

Rico has strong ideas when comes it to choosing a technology partner. “I need somebody who’s going to be adventurous” he said “and who’s going to tackle the status quo.”

Cisco fit the bill. And tech solutions like the Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul and Cisco Meraki access points helped shore up connectivity gaps which in turn empowered families beyond their children’s education.

The results speak for themselves. Many schools saw a drop in standardized test scores since the pandemic but as Rico explained that was not the case in Canutillo.

“Our kids not only did not see those dips” Rico said “but saw progression. To us that was huge.”

To learn more join us in the video above as we speak to Oscar Rico about the learnings from the lockdown and how these are helping the school continue to thrive in the hybrid education era.

“So through this program produce and other shelf-stable items are delivered to 37 schools once a month including the school we’re at today St. Martin De Porres High School that food is available to students their families staff and neighbors in the community” she said.

She said that she and many of her coworkers are passionate about this project.

“At Citizens we believe that when our communities prosper we all thrive” she said.

Feeding America said that one in six Ohio children face hunger so the goal with this program is to be more than just a temporary fix. O’Connor explained the future plans for the School Market Program.

“The School Market Program is very popular and the Greater Cleveland Food Bank has been so innovative in addressing hunger but also working to address the underlying causes of hunger and ending poverty” she said.

Last year they helped over 32000 households and they are hoping to top that this school year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L2FybWVkLW1hbi1kZXRhaW5lZC1hZnRlci1ob2xkaW5nLXVwLXNvdXRoLWxlYmFub24tYmFuay1hY2Nlc3Mtb3duLXNhdmluZ3MtMjAyMi0wOS0xNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank holdups snowball in Lebanon as depositors demand their own money,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.reuters.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /world/middle-east/armed-man-detained-after-holding-up-south-lebanon-bank-access-own-savings-2022-09-16/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C0160>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL21pZGRsZS1lYXN0L2FybWVkLW1hbi1kZXRhaW5lZC1hZnRlci1ob2xkaW5nLXVwLXNvdXRoLWxlYmFub24tYmFuay1hY2Nlc3Mtb3duLXNhdmluZ3MtMjAyMi0wOS0xNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNwZWFrLW91dC1vbi1jcmF6eS1pZGVhLW9mLW1vcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50cy1vbi1yb2xsaW5nLWFjcmVzLXJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residents speak out on 'crazy' idea of more apartments on Rolling Acres Road,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNwZWFrLW91dC1vbi1jcmF6eS1pZGVhLW9mLW1vcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50cy1vbi1yb2xsaW5nLWFjcmVzLXJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C0E80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Guidonia Montecelio Italy — Rory McIlroy and U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick are getting quite comfortable on next year’s Ryder Cup course.

Europe captain Luke Donald meanwhile made a novice’s error after hitting into the thick rough at the Marco Simone club outside Rome and then hitting the wrong ball earning himself a two-stroke penalty.

McIlroy (66) produced an eagle for the second consecutive day and Fitzpatrick (69) had five straight birdies in the second round Friday as they stood 1-2 respectively near the midpoint of the Italian Open. The round was suspended because of darkness for the second straight day.

McIlroy — playing in Italy for the first time as a pro specifically to gain familiarity with the Ryder Cup course — was at 9-under 133 overall with Fitzpatrick one stroke behind.

“Fitz has had an unbelievable year first major championship and he’s obviously matured into one of the best players in the world” McIlroy said. “Looking forward to going up against him over the weekend.”

After McIlroy took a share of the overnight clubhouse lead with an opening 67 before play was cut short Thursday Fitzpatrick had a strong finish early Friday to take the lead after the first round with a 65.

Later in the day it was McIlroy who surged ahead as he sank an eagle putt on the par-5 12th and celebrated with a slight wave — unlike his arms-above-the-head reaction when he holed out an approach shot for an eagle on the par-4 third a day earlier.

Fitzpatrick who claimed his first major title at The Country Club in Brookline Massachusetts in June also tied for fifth at the PGA Championship. At 28 he’s a veteran of the European tour and this is the seventh time he’s playing the Italian Open with a best finish of second in 2019.

“I love Italy” Fitzpatrick said adding that he’s a big soccer fan. “I came in December to watch Roma.”

Donald struggled to a triple bogey on the driveable par-4 16th when he hit his tee shot into the rough and then played the wrong ball.

“A first for me” Donald wrote on Twitter. “Poor drive in deep rough spotter goes straight to ball play the shot and then realize I’ve played the wrong ball. Same red Titleist 4 just not my markings on the ball.”

Donald however recovered by making birdies on five of the next eight holes to finish in contention at 5 under.

Afterward Donald suggested that the rough will be “pretty high” for the 2023 Ryder Cup — when Marco Simone will become the third venue in continental Europe to host golf’s biggest team event after Valderrama in Spain (1997) and Le Golf National in France (2018).

“We want to put a premium on hitting the fairways” Donald said. “The rough here it’s a different type of grass. It’s kind of a thick blade so it doesn’t need to be too too heavy to make it tough. … We obviously want to play similar conditions to what we played in this year.”

Defending champion Nicolai Højgaard (70) also remained in contention at 5 under with 10th-ranked Viktor Hovland (68) a stroke further back. Tom Lewis was third at 7 under and Victor Perez stood fourth at 6 under.

Local player Filippo Celli continued to impress in his pro debut after a sterling amateur career scoring an eagle with a wedge shot on No. 12 to finish at 1 under and make the cut.

Julien Quesne made a hole-in-one on the 187-yard fourth.

LPGA

Portland Ore. (AP— Esther Henseleit feels as though she has been spinning her wheels the last six months on the LPGA Tour. That made Friday at the AmazingCre Portland Classic feel as though she were absolutely soaring.

Henseleit rolled in 10 birdie putts on her way to an 8-under 64 giving the 23-year-old German a share of the lead with Lilia Vu going into the weekend.

Columbia Edgewater is tight and tree-lined with firm greens that roll true. Henseleit kept the ball in play and let her putter do the rest of the work.

“I had some easy putts and hit the line and they went in so that went well today"" Henseleit said. “I had many chances but they were not gimmes. I didn't have a tap-in birdie at all.”

Vu a former No. 1 amateur player when she was at UCLA had four birdies and an eagle on her opening seven holes and then played steadily on the back nine for a 66.

Vu and Henseleit were at 10-under 134.

They were one shot ahead of Carlota Ciganda of Spain who had a 66. The large group at 8-under 136 included another former No. 1 amateur Andrea Lee and one of the hottest players on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in Maja Stark of Sweden.

Stark who played at Oklahoma State has won four times on the Ladies European Tour including the ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland which was co-sanctioned by the LPGA Tour.

She is up to No. 47 in the women's world ranking and at No. 54 in the Race to CME Globe is trying to secure of the 60 spots in the season finale in Florida in November.

Lee started her season on the developmental Epson Tour and then started to break out of a slump with a good finish in Hawaii.

She reached the semifinals of the Bank of Hope LPGA Match Play in Las Vegas had a tie for 15th in the U.S. Women's Open (she replaced Inbee Park as an alternate) and now she is set for the top 60 to get to the CME Group Tour Championship.

Nelly Korda who needs a victory to return to No. 1 in the world never got much going and dropped a shot on the final hole for a 72 that left her five shots behind with 18 players ahead of her going into the weekend.

Henseleit opened with a 63 in Thailand in March and wound up in a tie for 12th. That was the highlight of her year. She began missing cuts and spending too much time on Friday wondering if she would be going home early.

“I had some pretty rough bumps since Thailand and it’s great to see something coming your way. I just will try to enjoy it and make the best of it and just give myself chances” Henseleit said.

“It just felt like nothing really came together” she said. “I’ve been working really hard and felt like every part of my game has been improving but couldn’t really get the scores together. So yeah just good that today kind of happened and I didn’t have to fight too hard for it.”

Now she faces a traffic jam over the next 36 holes. Eighteen players were separated by four shots with several players trying to win for the first time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtndy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi9wb3J0bGFuZC1jbGFzc2ljLWxwZ2EtaGVuc2VsZWl0LWxpbGlhdnUvMjgzLTcwODIwY2M0LWRkZGMtNDg3MS1hMTNkLTI1ZWIyZDNjNTQ0YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Henseleit Lilia Vu share lead at Portland Classic on LPGA,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtndy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi9wb3J0bGFuZC1jbGFzc2ljLWxwZ2EtaGVuc2VsZWl0LWxpbGlhdnUvMjgzLTcwODIwY2M0LWRkZGMtNDg3MS1hMTNkLTI1ZWIyZDNjNTQ0YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FA4B100>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

CPSE ETF is among the best performing mutual funds in the last one year. The outstanding performance is attributed to the rally in PSU stocks recently. The CPSE ETF has offered 35% returns in the last one year 16% in 6-months and 11.54% returns in three months. Mutual fund analysts say that this performance may continue for some more time.The entire basket of funds betting on PSU stocks has seen a big uptick. The category has offered 21.54% returns in one year and 17.52% in the last three months. The schemes have offered returns in the range of 14-35% with CPSE ETF topping the charts. The stellar performance of the fund is also attributed to the recent upward rally seen in the commodity and energy prices.For those who don’t know CPSE ETF was created to help the Government of India in its initiative to dis-invest some of its stake in selected CPSEs through the ETF route. The ETF is based on Nifty CPSE index and includes 11 listed Central Public Sector Enterprises and is managed by Nippon India Mutual Fund. At the moment the ETF has a majority allocation to the energy sector. Here’s the current holding of the scheme:Source: Value ResearchMutual Fund analysts believe that the CPSE stocks are seeing a strong earnings growth. They believe that this kind of growth is seen once in a decade. However they believe that the rally might not be sustainable in the long term.“PSU stocks are seeing a strong earnings tailwind. These stocks were very cheap till last year. Stocks in sectors like thermal power coal and PSU banks were trading at a very attractive valuation. Recently the value theme has also come back to the spotlight. That has also benefited these stocks. All the companies in the CPSE ETFs give high dividends and are available at a cheap value. So the entire segment saw a turnaround especially the CPSE ETF” says Ashutosh Bhargava Fund Manager and Head Equity Research Nippon India Mutual Fund.Analysts say that the PSU segment suffered from the mainstreaming of the ESG theme globally in the last couple of years. Recently after the war in Ukraine supply shortage and energy demands have become bigger and hence globally ESG has been set aside for some time. This has helped some of the PSU companies in India.“Many PSU stocks that make a part of the CPSE ETF portfolio also had suffered due to strict ESG mandates. These companies fare low on environmental scores and a lot of times on social governance also. There is also an underownership in these companies. Even though the fundamentals are strong for the short term the rally is not sustainable for a longer term because of the innate issues” says Ashutosh BhargavaMutual fund advisors believe that the CPSE ETF is as risky as a sectoral fund. The ETF has 83% of the portfolio concentrated towards the energy and commodity sector PSEs. Advisors say that PSUs and PSEs have a governance structure that becomes a problem a lot of times. Hence tactical play into these schemes is not a good idea for retail investors.“The Nifty CPSE TRI has failed to beat the Nifty 50 TRI in terms of returns and consistency over the long term. Investing in PSEs is a cyclical play and has to be taken as a tactical bet in ones portfolio. PSEs can be more vulnerable than private entities at times. Apart from the earnings of the companies macro economic factors and government policies can have a strong impact on the business which may not be in favor of the company's growth and its shareholders.

And yet the concert at JVPD grounds Juhu of Umang 2022 that began on September 15 is definitely one of his favourites!With the heavy Mumbai monsoons and sorry traffic situation in the city the concert that was supposed to begin at 6.30 pm actually began around two hours later but nothing could dampen the spirits of the massive crowd of college students who hung around at the ground set up for the 23rd edition of Asia's Fastest Growing Youth Festival - Umang.The loudest of cheers and applause greeted Arjun as he came on stage saying “Let me hear it for Umang!”. The energy of the crowd was palpable as the singer began his performance. With rains pouring down consistently in sheets of white the well-lit arena packed with crowds soaked to skin already reverberated as they sang along with Arjun.In the midst of it he threw off his cap among the audience and was greeted with shouts of glee! “Baarish mein bheeg rahe ho aap sab? Chalo main bhi bheeg leta hoon” he announced and there was a deafening chorus of ‘yay’. Arjun climbed off the stage and went amidst the crowd of collegians as he sang.While he began the show with his own songs Aaya Na Tu Waada Hai Ilzaam Woh Baarishein Barsaat he also sang some popular all-time favorites like Zara Zara Behekta Hai Ranjha Tujhe Kitna Chahne Lage Hum The Humma Song Ghungroo Song Agar Tum Saath Ho Maula Mere Maula Tamma Tamma Dum Maro Dum Saturday Saturday Afghan Jalebi Pyar Ki Pungi Taare Gin Gin Bhaag DK Bose and others.Recent hits like Ali Sethi-Shae Gill’s ‘Pasoori’ The Kid Laroi-Justin Bieber’s ‘Stay’ The Weeknd’s ‘Blinding Lights’ Diljit Dosanjh’s ‘Lover’ had the entire crowd in a frenzy as they sang along and danced. He held on to the attention of the young audience as he belted out songs one after the other including his popular track ‘Nikke Nikke Shots’ with no breaks in between. For the last number just before the 10 pm deadline he pulled his newly wed wife Carla Dennis into an impromptu dance on stage as the audience clapped and wowed.“It’s always great to perform in Mumbai and this year I’ve already performed in this city five times and will be performing three more times this year. It is awesome that we are coming to a place post covid where Bombay is really opening up. Here we have three months of rain and monsoon so there have been no outdoor concerts happening as such. Even when I took my tour it was all indoors and now my outdoor tours begin with Umang. It is really exciting to do outdoor concerts once more!” said Arjun speaking exclusively to Bombay Times.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvd29ybGQtbmV3cy9tb2RpLWFuZC1yYWlzaS1kaXNjdXNzLWVuZXJneS1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTQyNTU3ODUuY21z0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvd29ybGQtbmV3cy9tb2RpLWFuZC1yYWlzaS1kaXNjdXNzLWVuZXJneS1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHkvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0MjU1Nzg1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modi and Raisi discuss energy & connectivity,"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held his maiden summit with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) Summit in Samarkand and the two leaders have discussed energy ties besides optimum use of Chabahar Port and INSTC.“Held wide-ranging discussions with President Ebrahim Raisi. We talked about the growing India-Iran friendship and the scope to boost ties in sectors like energy commerce and connectivity” Modi tweeted after his meeting with Raisi. India is keen to revive energy imports from Iran.Interestingly Modi also met the Turkish President amid the role Turkey is playing in the current Ukraine crisis. “Met President @RTErdogan and reviewed the full range of bilateral relations between India and Turkey including ways to deepen economic linkages for the benefit of our people. @trpresidency” Modi tweeted. The two discussed bilateral trade (10 bn usd) and Economic linkages.“Had a great meeting with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Thanked him for hosting the SCO Summit . Discussed ways to deepen connectivity trade and cultural cooperation between India and Uzbekistan” Modi tweeted after holding bilateral meeting with the Uzbek President.Foreign Secretary Vinay Kawatra on Friday said PM’s bilateral meetings in Samarkand occurred as per schedule and based on requests thereby making it clear that neither a meeting was scheduled with Chinese President nor it was requested notwithstanding disengagement at PP-15. This also clears doubt on any meeting with Pak PM that was being speculated in Samarkand.Iran’s entry into SCO will boost India’s Eurasian outreach ensuring seamless coordination between India and Iran and Eurasian states besides Russia sources said. India also maintains that entry of Iranian oil in the market will address global energy security to some extent.Ahead of the SCO Summit there has been a flurry of engagements between New Delhi and Tehran with focus on strengthening connectivity mechanisms especially INSTC & Chabahar Port.Iran is central to India’s plan to increase engagement with Russia and Central Asia besides remaining part of Eurasia. ET has learnt that Russia-Iran-Azerbaizan are entering into a trilateral arrangement to smoothen functioning of the INSTC.The value of Iran’s exports to India increased by 35% in the first seven months of 2022 from the same period of time in 2021. Iran exported commodities worth $361 million to India in the seven-month period of this year while the figure was $267 million in the same time span of the past year. Bulk of this was food items.During January-July of the present year India’s export to Iran has also risen 54% to stand at $1.243 billion while the figure was $807 million in the first seven months of 2021.In late May the then Iranian ambassador to India said that Iran and India are trying to diversify the channels of payments to expand bilateral trade.India is expanding its maritime partnership with Iran alongside the recent moves to boosting infrastructure in the strategically located Chabahar Port. The two sides last month signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Mutual Recognition of Seafarer’s Code of Conduct for Unlimited Voyages coinciding with a visit of ports shipping and waterways and Ayush minister Sarbananda Sonowal to Iran. This will result in training exercises of Iranian seafarers in India.The MoU will open new vistas of cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as both India and Iran are IOR states said people aware of the matter. India is eyeing a trilateral maritime cooperation involving Oman and Iran in the long run.The Iranian government is also ready to conclude a long-term contract with India prioritising the development of transit of goods through the Chabahar port. This contract will also aim at ramping up activities of the INSTC.Sonowal had visited the Shahid Beheshti terminal at the Chabahar Port to hand over six mobile harbour cranes to the Indian Ports Global Chabahar Free Trade Zone at the port. During the visit the two countries decided to form a joint technical committee for the smooth functioning of the port.The Chabahar Port is likely to act as a catalyst for unlocking the huge trade potential in the region. India has pitched to link the port with the INSTC for optimum use by the Central Asian states and other Eurasian states. The corridors are expected to provide an option parallel to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. There are also plans to link the INSTC with the Northern Sea Route via the resource-rich Russian Arctic. India is also pitching to connect Chabahar Port with Southeast Asia and East Asia."

The products are still affected by UCDSU’s mandate to ban the sale of sugary drinks which will be up for renewal at the next Student Union council meeting.

Coke and its associated products have been absent from the shelves since 2003 when a campus wide referendum banned the sale of Coca-Cola products 57 votes deciding the outcome out of 3199 unspoiled ballots. Following this ban the entirety of UCD campus entered into an exclusivity deal with soft drink supply company Britvic who represent and distribute drinks such as Pepsi Mountain Dew and Nestea Iced Tea. The contract with Britvic was due to come to an end during 2020 but was extended until Thursday September 8th due to the pandemic. The Student Union’s own ban lapsed in 2011.

When speaking to the University Observer about the decision to reintroduce Coca-Cola products UCDSU President Molly Greenough said “It's something that throughout my time in the union people have frequently asked if we were allowed to sell Coca Cola products so I do think many students are excited about that.”

The original banning of Coca-Cola was a controversial move at the time. The referendum was brought forward due to the alleged threatening attack on and murders of trade union members who worked in a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Columbia. Sintrainal the union who brought forward the suit alleged that the bottling companies who worked to produce Coca-Cola products hired members of a local far-right militia to intimidate and disempower workers at the Columbian plant. This action was taken as part of a global move towards a Coca-Cola boycott by multiple trade unions. However local Irish unions such as SIPTU criticised the move by UCDSU to boycott the products due to the risk it posed to jobs in the Irish bottling plants.

The referendum itself was also a cause for criticism with complaints of voter suppression at the ballot boxes with the “No” campaign claiming that hundreds of voters may have been refused the opportunity to vote on the day. Less than 48 hours later an appeal of the vote was approved after the confirmation that approximately 4000 voters had been disenfranchised due to an issue with the register of electors used on the day. The second referendum took place the following month and upheld the original ban.

When asked about the ethical concerns students may have about the reintroduction of Coca-Cola products on campus Greenough said “We would welcome any student’s concerns on that as [...] while we have introduced Coca Cola we are super open to taking it out again if that’s what students decide. So I would really welcome conversation with any student concerned about the Coca Cola or the introduction of Coca Cola products and would encourage them to approach a sabbatical officer or potentially their college officer and we can have a discussion about bringing forward a motion to council.”

If students are interested in bringing forward the issue to the Student Union the first council of the year is due to take place on the 10th of October.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyZXRoaW9waWEuY29tLzI2Mzg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building A Sustainable Shared Better Future,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyZXRoaW9waWEuY29tLzI2Mzg2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395168B6A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Date 17.09.2022 Read time 5 Min The F1 Esports Pro Championship is back and the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team got off to a great start securing double figures in the constructors' standings.

In the first of four events Simon Weigang and teammate Manuel Biancolilla raced around the Bahrain International Circuit Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari and Silverstone Circuit.

Race One: Bahrain

Starting strong in qualifying Simon flew all the way to Q3 securing his seventh-place starting position on the grid whilst Manuel endured some PC issues and therefore started in 20th.

Pushing from the back Manuel fought all the way to 16th by lap four. Making the Hard tyres last he was able to jump another position to 15th as he emerged from the pits on lap 21.

For the last seven laps he was able to push on the Soft tyres climbing to 12th place but battled continuously with Nicolas Longuet for 11th. He crossed the line in 12th but dropped to 16th after penalties were applied for causing avoidable contact.

Simon maintained his position for the first half of the race unable to move up as he was stuck in the DRS train. Jumping Dani Moreno in the pits he came out in sixth and pushed on his fresh Medium tyres.

He crossed the finish line in fifth after Thomas Roonhar picked up some damage and dropped down the pack. After Frederik Rasmussen’s penalty for dangerous re-entry was applied Simon finished in fourth place.

Race Two: Imola

As they lined up for the second race of the year Simon sat in 11th after just missing out on Q3 in qualifying whilst Manuel had troubles getting out of Q1 starting 20th on the grid.

A lap-one crash saw Simon forced to go wide to avoid colliding with any cars picking up an in-game penalty for doing so. After having to slow down to give the position back he fell down the ranks and sat in 14th at the end of the first lap.

By the end of lap seven Simon had climbed to 11th while Manuel sat in 18th place.

Pitting on lap 16 and swapping the Hard tyres for a set of Mediums Simon emerged 13th and was able to rise into the top ten undercutting several drivers.

He crossed the line in ninth and had his penalty rescinded meaning more points for the team. Manuel crossed the line in 16th.

Race Three: Silverstone

Struggling for pace at the British circuit Manuel qualified in 19th whilst Simon had his lap time deleted due to track limits so started in 20th﻿.

There was a scrap for positions on the opening lap and Simon made the most of this pushing up to 17th before getting stuck in a DRS train﻿ which hampered his ability to overtake.

Manuel was involved in a lap one incident ending with him off the track and forcing him to retire early in the race.

Going longer on the Hard tyres Simon swapped to the Medium compound and emerged in 18th with seven laps to go. Crossing the line in P18 the team unfortunately took no points home from Silverstone.

Simon Weigang Driver Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team: ""I have mixed emotions after the end of event one. Although I started strong in Bahrain I didn't finish where I wanted for Imola or Silverstone.

""The pace of the car is competitive but it is a shame we had problems in qualifying that we couldn't make up for in the race. Overall we have seen what we can do as a team and know where to improve ready for the next event.""

Manuel Biancolilla Driver Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team: ""Event one definitely didn't go as I had planned. The practice routine I had used up to event one is something we'll need to review.

""Hardware issues have influenced my consistency and hopefully next event they won't be there. The pace is definitely there but there's a lot to improve in one-shot laps race craft and set-ups.

""I'll get a weekend break from all of it and then head straight into practice for event two to come back way stronger.""

Miguel Faisca Team Manager Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team: ""Having a new driver line-up for this year comes with some challenges and this first event was important to understand our drivers and to know we can help them performs in future races.

""Event one is that time where teams can see how good their preparation was. We went in with no big expectations but came out with an idea of what we need to improve on to become stronger for event two.""﻿

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Downtown Chicago's streets were packed with traffic Thursday night into Friday morning with people driving around to celebrate Mexican Independence Day.

Crowds on Michigan Avenue caused gridlock on some downtown streets overnight. Chicago police said there were no arrests and there will be extra patrols this weekend.

City officials are encouraging people celebrate the holiday peacefully but said they're prepared to close streets if necessary.

Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Communication sent an alert that said: ""We ask that everyone be cognizant of your neighbors and respectful of others while celebrating and realizing there are critical functions that exist for the well-being of all.""

WATCH: 26th Street Mexican Independence Day Parade broadcast from Little Village

These celebrations have appeared to grow in recent years making their way from the neighborhoods into the Loop.

Mexican Independence Day is an annual event that takes place on Sept. 16 celebrating Mexico's declaration of independence from Spain in 1810.

Local residents said it's important for young people to understand the history and meaning in our modern world.

""Fight for a good cause do it safely respectfully with honor and pride"" Liz Crothers said.

The special atmosphere could be felt in Little Village later Friday morning as people continued to celebrate.

More cars were driving around with flags and some individuals set up different stands to sell food and decorations.

""They really celebrate because they are happy with the independence. It's just for fun"" Little Village resident Luigi Gutierrez said.

The celebration has been ongoing since last weekend.

Police said they'll have patrols throughout the entire city to manage the influx of traffic saying they'll implement street closures as necessary.

""We will try to accommodate most everything that will take place as far as a peaceful celebration but when it comes to total impeding of the liberties of others if we have to take action we will"" said Eric Carter first deputy superintendent of police.

Celebrations are expected to last through the weekend like previous years and will include people heading to the 10th annual Pilsen Fest Saturday along with the Mexican Patriotic Parade Sunday near 87th Street.

During Pilsen Fest La Casa Del Pueblo Taqueria will feature tamales from Northern Mexico and other specialties to represent other parts of the Mexico.

""Right now we need to embrace it the same type of people I don't care if you are Black brown white"" said George Haro at La Casa Del Pueblo. ""This is a holiday. Let's celebrate.""

The outdoor festival is free and celebrates the neighborhood's rich past and present.

""We wanted to make it accessible"" Pilsen Fest founder Esmirna Garcia said. ""There's a lot of talent that exists in our community.""

He was surrounded by his wife Rachel and family. A memorial service is planned for Saturday September 24 2022 at 11 am at The Episcopal Church of St. John the Baptist followed by interment at Pine Grove Cemetery in Wausau WI. Richard was born in Wausau Wisconsin to Helen Margaret Lemke and Arthur E. A. Mueller founder of North Central Airlines on April 10 1938. He is survived by his wife of 44 years Rachel; his only daughter Tara Mueller; and a sister Anne Ehle (Fredric); a sister-in-law Sandy Mueller (A. James); five nephews Robert Mueller (Christine) Frederick Ehle (Kim Noles) John Ehle (Vicki) James Gaylord (Dawn) Robert Baranowski (Laura); five nieces Julie Davis Ginger Keleher (Joe) Bitsy Wedin (Bob)  Torie Bashara (Terry) and Heather Gaylord; and sixteen grand nieces and nephews. A brother Arthur James Mueller and a sister Kathryn Gaylord predeceased him. Growing up in Wausau Richard attended Zion Lutheran School and Wausau High School Class of 1956. He then went on to the University of Wisconsin earning a BS degree and pledging the Sigma Phi Fraternity. Further education included an MBA from the Harvard Business School a MA in writing from the University of San Francisco and a MFA in writing from Saint Mary’s College in Moraga California. He served his country in the U.S. Army being honorably discharged in 1965 as a First Lieutenant. Summers in Wisconsin were always spent on the lakes of the Northwoods where his family had a second home. Richard never tired of the water sports. At fifteen he and a friend taught themselves how to water ski on their feet creating somewhat of a sensation to the delight of his father who would bring business associates to watch. One shouldn’t be surprised that Richard still a kid at heart took up wakeboarding in his seventies and was still jumping the wake at age 79 —the same year he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Richard had a distinguished career in business over thirty years working with many companies including Colgate Palmolive General Mills Friends of the Earth The Fields Investment Group Mrs. Fields Cookies The Famous Chocolate Chip Cookie Unibase Cambridge Plan International Forward Films Intercraft Industries Sterling Casting The Jones Dairy Farm The West Bend Company and William Ernest Brown of Beverly Hills. His titles went from product manager to president and everything in between but his favorite was “author.” In his own words “I dabbled in business building a company here bankrupting one there a sometimes pleasant sometimes dreadful but by and large rewarding way to pass the time.” And along the way he built owned and ran a restaurant called Baraka in Waterloo Iowa until he came to his senses and sold it. In 1991 he discovered he had cancer. Again in his words “I had an epiphany of sorts and I decided to stop screwing up the economy and return to my true calling which is the systematic annihilation of the written word.” For the next thirty years he wrote and wrote completing five novels and numerous short stories including becoming famous for his annual Christmas letter. Then in a moment of reflection he remembered how much fun he had had in high school participating in the class plays; so he went back to school again this time to Monterey Peninsula College and signed up for all the theater classes. Nothing made him happier than appearing on stage in local productions; admittedly at first mostly in the roles of old dead or soon to be dead men but eventually in starring roles including in August: Osage County Death of a Salesman and Old Ringers the comedy that cast him wearing a Speedo silver shoes and black garters a leather motorcycle jacket mirror sunglasses and a white hard-hat all while belting out “YMCA.” Richard never completely abandoned his business background. Using the skills which came to him so easily he helped many a friend with analyzing a new venture or business problem treating each situation as if it were his own investment. And as an avocation he chaired the Finance Committee for the Diocese of El Camino Real for thirty years working with three consecutive bishops. Memorial gifts in honor of Richard may be made to The Master’s Writing Program St. Mary’s College 1928 Saint Mary’s Road Moraga CA 94575 or The Michael J. Fox Foundation P.O.

ASTORIA QUEENS — The owner of a fossil-fuel-powered Astoria energy plant wants to sell the facility to an offshore wind developer following months of controversy over the future of the site.

NRG Energy filed forms with the state on Thursday seeking regulators' approval to sell its peaker plant north of 20th Avenue to Beacon Wind Land LLC the developer of a huge wind energy project being built in the Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles east of Montauk.

The potential sale first reported by POLITICO comes after the state last October rejected NRG's proposal to replace its aging 50-year-old turbine with a natural gas-fired generator.

Advocates and elected officials had long argued that the plant should instead be replaced with a renewable energy source — a demand that the sale would apparently meet.

NRG has always planned to retire its plant by May 2023 to comply with state energy laws. Now under the proposed sale NRG would continue leasing the plant for six months after its closure to help decommission and demolish it before ceding all control to Beacon Wind Land on Oct. 31 2023.

Beacon said it would use the Astoria site as an interconnection between its offshore wind projects and the city's Con Edison grid. NRG has owned the Astoria plant since 1999 when it purchased it from Con Edison according to the company's website.

Some of those who had opposed NRG's prior plan for the Astoria site celebrated news of the potential sale. ""This multi-year long campaign was seen through by an array of ecosocialist organizers"" the Queens chapter of the Democratic Socialists in America said in a tweet. ""Canvasses marches education sessions & more our neighborhood grew this greener future.""",,,,,,,,,

Imperial-based Alford Distributing and Milpitas-based Bottomley Distributing Co.

“Though this was a difficult decision it is necessary for both the long-term and short-term needs of our business” a Sierra Nevada spokesperson told Brewbound. The company “remain[s] grateful for their partnership over the years.”

Those territories will transfer to Reyes Beer Division subsidiaries effective October 15 a spokesperson told Brewbound. The Chico California-headquartered craft brewery does not anticipate any service disruptions.

The three terminated wholesalers are Anheuser-Busch InBev houses. Bottomley’s territory includes Silicon Valley and the southern part of the Bay Area including the cities of San Jose Los Gatos Milpitas Morgan Hill Gilroy Campbell San Martin Santa Clara and Coyote. Markstein’s territory includes Contra Costa and Alameda counties in the western Bay Area. Alford’s territory includes Imperial County in Southern California.

The Reyes Beer Division’s six California subsidiaries — Harbor Distributing (servicing Malibu to San Clemente) Gate City Beverage (Riverside and San Bernardino counties) Crest Beverage (Southern California) Allied Beverages (Hollywood San Fernando Valley Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo) Golden Brands (Northern California) and High Desert Distributing (seven counties in the High Desert region) — each list Sierra Nevada’s portfolio among their respective online product catalogs.

Independent California wholesalers have been on the receiving end of so-called “black roses” from Constellation Brands (purveyor of popular Mexican imports Modelo and Corona two of the best-selling beers in California) New Belgium Athletic Brewing and Diageo Beer Company in favor of Reyes for several years.

Constellation terminated Markstein in early 2022 in a move that also included the termination of Visalia-based Bueno Beverage.

In recent years Constellation has terminated several wholesalers in California including San Diego-based Markstein (a separate entity from Markstein in Antioch) Santa Fe Springs-based Triangle Beverage and Compton-based Beauchamp Distributing and Los Angeles-based Ace Beverage.

These terminations have been concurrent with heightened acquisitive behavior by the Reyes Beer Division the country’s largest beer wholesaler.

Sierra Nevada has been shaking up its wholesaler network in California as well. In July 2021 the Chico-headquartered craft brewery terminated South San Francisco-based Matagrano Inc. A lawsuit and counter suit between the companies followed with Sierra Nevada alleging that Matagrano “promptly embarked upon a pattern of retaliation” against it.

Year-to-date through September 4 dollar sales of Sierra Nevada have declined -1% to $220 million at off-premise retailers tracked by market research firm IRI. The company’s dollar share of the beer category remained flat compared to the same period last year at 0.71%.

Last year Sierra Nevada’s volume declined -1% to 1.103 million barrels of beer according to the Brewers Association (BA). Its volume share of BA-defined craft beer declined -0.42% to 4.45%. It is the third-largest craft brewery in the country by volume behind D.G. Yuengling & Son. and Boston Beer Company according to the BA.

Following the Sierra Nevada terminations Markstein’s remaining portfolio includes Boneyard Beer Brooklyn Brewery Deschutes Firestone Walker Fort Point HenHouse and Stone.

Alford sells offerings from Ballast Point BeatBox Coronado Firestone Walker Karl Strauss Modern Times Stone and Societe.

Bottomley carries the Heineken portfolio and Gordon Biersch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2dvdi1ob2NodWwtZ2F2ZS1lbGl0ZS1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLXJlc3VsdHMtdG8tY2FtcGFpZ24tZG9ub3JzLWVtYWlscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Hochul gave elite access —and results — to campaign donors: emails,"Top aides to Gov. Hochul offered boutique access and customer service to elite deep-pocketed donors keen on furthering their business interests in the state a review of emails shows.

The 161 pages of emails show a vibrant buyer’s market for those willing to pony up for the governor’s reelection campaign. So far Hochul has hauled in $34 million for her campaign and is on pace to snag tens of millions more by election day.

In December 2021 Robert Trobe a former deputy commissioner for the city’s Department of Family and Adult Services was in deep discussions with Team Hochul about a campaign fundraiser he was organizing among non-profit organizations. Trobe now serves as vice president at Alliant Insurance Services.

“If we fix the minimum contribution at $250 and get an average per participant contribution of $300 I think we should be able to raise $30000 to $50000” Trobe emailed Mackenzie Wasilick finance chief of staff for Hochul’s campaign committee.

The trove of emails whose content was first reported by the Albany Times Union was obtained by The Post.

But Trobe wanted something in return: Hochul to come out in favor of a cost-of-living increase for state-contracted human services workers who assist New Yorkers combating various forms of addiction.

“What is critical in the run-up to the primary is the Governor’s support for inclusion of COLA in the next budget. … We had a productive initial meeting with [Director of State Operations] Kathryn Garcia” Trobe wrote. “If the COLA commitment from the Governor can be secured it will be extremely helpful in promoting this [fundraiser].”

In her $216 billion budget released in January Hochul made good pledging $500 million for human services cost-of-living adjustments — something Gov. Cuomo had refused to do for every year of his tenure The Albany Times Union reported.

Both Trobe and Garcia did not respond to requests for comment.

In February Trobe personally donated $1000 to Hochul’s campaign. A virtual fundraiser with non-profit community leaders took place on April 18.

“The governor came for a few minutes and spoke to us. It was a 10-15 minutes thing. Took a couple of questions and left” Lilliam Barrios-Paoli a former deputy mayor for health and human services who attended the fundraiser told The Post.

The revelations come as Hochul faces controversy for allegedly helping a contributor tied to $300000 in campaign donations get a $637 million contract from the state for rapid coronavirus tests — charging New Yorkers twice the price other vendors charged.

3 Wayne Chaplin wanted legislation that would require alcohol to be imported to “a licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a premises or warehouse operated by a wholesaler for a period of 24 hours.” John Parra

“In New York State bribery is basically legal. Donors make big contributions to candidates because they want something in return. And these emails show donors are getting special access special treatment and special help from the governor’s staff” said John Kaehny executive director of Reinvent Albany a watchdog group. “It’s probably legal and how Albany works but it’s definitely unethical and wrong. The governor is supposed to serve the public interest not the donor’s interests.”

Wayne Chaplin who attended a different Hochul fundraiser near Rochester in October 2021 was similarly blunt about his needs.

The event was hosted by Rob Sands chief executive officer of Constellation Brands an alcoholic beverages producer and marketer and the largest beer importer in the United States.

The Brooklyn-born CEO of Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirit was angling to find support for a bill that would “require alcoholic beverages imported into New York be first delivered to a licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a premises or warehouse operated by a wholesaler for a period of 24 hours.”

Southern Glazer the nation’s largest wine and spirits distributor would stand to make a killing while critics say the law would make it more prohibitive for smaller distributors and raise costs on consumers.

“See below information that was discussed with the Governor in Rochester” Chaplin wrote to Micah Lasher Hochul’s director of policy in a Dec. 7 2021 email. “I wanted to direct the attached to you as a follow up to that discussion as the Governor asked us to follow up with staff.” He sent along a two page explainer pumping the proposed law.

On the day of the fundraiser five different LLCs — all of which shared the same address with Southern Glazer’s corporate offices in Miami — donated a total of $25000. Campaign laws forbid any single company from donating more than $5000 total in a year.

So far Hochul has not taken a public position on the booze issue. But in the background is her husband William J. Hochul who serves as general counsel and senior vice president to Delaware North a Buffalo-based gambling and hospitality giant with wide interests in the alcohol trade as well.

Southern Glazer’s bill is currently bottled up in the Investigations and Government Operations Committee by its chairman State Sen. James Skoufis (D-Orange County).

“It’s a terrible bill. It’s bad public policy. What other product that consumers enjoy has to first make a pit stop before it gets to retail? The answer is none” Skoufis told The Post. “Southern Glazer they like to cajole they like to try and bribe they like to try and bully … It’s a very self-interested bill.”

Both Sands and Chaplin did not respond to requests for comment.

People close to former Gov. Cuomo said they were surprised by the blatant pay-to-play.

“That’s certainly not how we did fundraising or raised money” said a former top aide. “It wasn’t appropriate to talk state business and that was strongly strongly discouraged.”

Reps for Gov. Hochul denied any implication of impropriety.

“As public servants government staff receive communications from a wide range of New Yorkers on a daily basis. We welcome the views of different advocacy groups on policy issues but every decision is made by the Governor and her team based on what is best for New Yorkers. No donation has any influence on any government decisions and we strongly reject any implication otherwise” said spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays.",,,,,,

Power outages and ""brownouts"" can be both frustrating and inconvenient to wait out. In 2019 Americans nationwide were without power for a cumulative average of 4.7 hours; this according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's annual survey and report (via Cummins). During those outages exactly how many of us went and unplugged our electronics while waiting for the power to return? You may have heard some guidance somewhere at some time advising you to do so during a power outage but the question is is this really necessary and if so why?

It might feel bothersome to run around the house or office disconnecting and unplugging all the devices but it's actually a smart thing to do says Constellation Energy because wavering voltages and surges can damage electronics and appliances rendering them useless even upon full restoration of electricity. Power outages brownouts and surges occur for several reasons including storms grid failure and electromagnetic pulses (EMTs) according to Penny Electric.

With any electric issue always check whether the problem is exclusive to your home or is widespread. As for unplugging your electronics and appliances here's more on that and why doing so is recommended — even if you've been fortunate enough not to experience any damage from past power outages yourself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzE1NzYxOC9odWJibGUtc2Vlcy1hLXNwaXJhbC1nYWxheHktd2l0aC1hLXN1cGVybWFzc2l2ZS1ibGFjay1ob2xlLWZlYXN0aW5nLWF0LWl0cy1jZW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hubble Sees a Spiral Galaxy With a Supermassive Black Hole Feasting at its Center,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzE1NzYxOC9odWJibGUtc2Vlcy1hLXNwaXJhbC1nYWxheHktd2l0aC1hLXN1cGVybWFzc2l2ZS1ibGFjay1ob2xlLWZlYXN0aW5nLWF0LWl0cy1jZW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950D7B580>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The funeral which takes place on Monday will be one of the largest ever gathering of royals prime ministers presidents and leaders from around the world.

The queen who had reigned since 1952 died on 8 September at Balmoral Castle in Scotland at the age of 96.

Her coffin was moved last Wednesday to Westminster Hall in London where it lay in state for four days allowing thousands of people to bid her farewell before the official funeral.

The coffin will then be moved from the medieval hall which has room for around 2200 people to Westminster Abbey for the state funeral.

The UK has asked leaders to travel on commercial flights to London from where they will be transported by buses to Westminster Abbey.

Almost 500 foreign dignitaries will attend the event but the UK's Foreign Office said that officials from six countries were not invited to the funeral namely Syria Russia Belarus Myanmar Afghanistan and Venezuela.

An invitation at the level of ambassadorship was sent to the Islamic Republic of Iran although Tehran has no ambassador in the UK. However Iran's ambassador in the UAE Seyed Mohammad Hosseini is reportedly attending the funeral pending official confirmation.

Saudi crown prince will not attend funeral

Members of royal families from the Middle East expected to attend include Jordan's King Abdullah II Crown Prince of Morocco Moulay Hassan Crown Prince of Kuwait Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani Sultan of Oman Haitham bin Tariq Al Said and Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.

Middle East political leaders set to attend the funeral include Lebanon's interim Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Palestine's Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh.

Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is set to attend rather than Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who had initially said he would be there “if the schedule allows”.

Israel's President Isaac Herzog will be at the funeral while the country's Prime Minister Yair Lapid will not attend.

Saudi Arabia's de-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is no longer expected to attend the funeral on Monday a British foreign office source said on Sunday contrary to Britain's earlier expectations that he would.

Saudi Arabia would be represented instead by Prince Turki bin Mohammed Al Saud the source said. Prince Turki is a minister of state and has been a member of the cabinet since 2018

The crown prince's trip to London would have been the first since the killing in October 2018 of Middle East Eye and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents at the consulate in Istanbul.

On Friday Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz said: “The crown prince should not be allowed to be part of this mourning and not be allowed to stain [the Queen's] memory and use this time mourning to seek legitimacy and normalisation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20veW91L3JveWFscy90aGVxdWVlbi9zd2Fucy1zaG9wcGluZy1zcGFjZS1hbi1hdG0tdGhlLWFtYXppbmctdGhpbmdzLXF1ZWVuLWVsaXphYmV0aC1vd25lZC0yMDIyMDkxNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swans shopping space & an ATM: the amazing things Queen Elizabeth owned | You,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20veW91L3JveWFscy90aGVxdWVlbi9zd2Fucy1zaG9wcGluZy1zcGFjZS1hbi1hdG0tdGhlLWFtYXppbmctdGhpbmdzLXF1ZWVuLWVsaXphYmV0aC1vd25lZC0yMDIyMDkxNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C15D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

US News & World Report released its annual list of the best liberal arts colleges in America and Bowdoin College found itself in the Top 10.

The Brunswick private university came in with a ranking of 6th in the nation. It actually shares the 6th distinction with Carleton College in Minnesota.

It's quite an honor for the school known as one of the ""Little Ivy's."" Bowdoin is no stranger to high honors but always looks pretty good ranked high when stacked up against your peers.

One main reason for Bowdoin's high ranking is its wealth of student activities and options. US News & World Report highlights many of them.

The Bowdoin Polar Bears compete in 30 varsity sports in the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference. Bowdoin has more than 100 student organizations. One of the largest and most active groups is the Outing Club which offers around 150 excursions each year. Peucinian Society founded in 1805 is one of the oldest literary and intellectual societies in the country with alumni including poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Bowdoin also cleaned up in others categories including Top 15 rankings in Best Undergraduate Teaching (ranked 3rd) Best Value Schools (7th) First-Year Experiences (15). The school's complete rankings are listed on the institution's profile found on the US News & World Report's college database.

While Bowdoin was the only Maine school to make the Top 10 in the liberal arts category the state's two other ""Little Ivy's"" weren't too far down the list. Colby College came in at the 25th spot with Bates College just behind it at 26.

These are tremendous rankings for the three schools and a masterclass of education that only Connecticut could dream about.

If we can have a National Talk Like A Pirate Day and a National Lima Bean Respect Day we surely can pay homage to something like a cheeseburger.

And at least this comes with plenty of deals you can save some money with.

Here are some you can grab in Jersey.

Speaking of the Garden State we have plenty of great burgers at places like Barnacle Bill’s in Rumson and Krug’s Tavern in Newark. But what about chains? What are the most popular burger chains in New Jersey?

Our top 3 are…

1. McDonald’s

2. Smashburger

3. Five Guys

Now you can argue amongst yourself if this is because they’re truly the best chain burgers as opposed to just selling the most because of their proliferation in the marketplace. I’ll stay out of that fray.

Home Made Hamburger Orgrimmar loading...

But it’s interesting to note that our neighbor to the north New York prefers Shake Shake and our neighbor to the west Pennsylvania prefers Smashburger. Our neighbor to the south Delaware likes Possumburger. (Sorry Delaware I couldn’t resist. It’s Steak n’ Shake.)

All this according to topagency.com. They also report burger popularity is for some reason suddenly exploding in the United States with an increase in visits to burger chains of 10.6% in one year. And the most burgers craved in a single month belongs to May.

Now how you take your burger is a point of personal debate. My broadcast partner believes “salad doesn’t belong on a burger” so his doctrine is no lettuce and no tomatoes ever. (He’s wrong by the way.) Then there’s Bruce Springsteen’s ideal burger who once said “A thin little patty squirted with ketchup and that's the only type of burger.”

However you take it happy Cheeseburger Day New Jersey.

At least on those matters that are true problems ...

If your cup isn’t already overfilled on right to repair (R2R) after this week’s events in Washington D.C. you can read the September 4 blog on legislating solutions here.

Interestingly our company is increasingly found throughout the ongoing media onslaught again in this week's testimonies. Because our company publishes Ag Equipment Intelligence's annual Big Dealer Report (jointly with the Machinery Advisors Consortium) and also curates Dealers on the MoveTM (acquisitions news) and the Farm Equipment Dealer 100TM List Farm Equipment and Ag Equipment Intelligence continue to show up myriad places on the R2R front often cited in attorney-for-hire advocacy pieces penned by some who may not understand the very data they’re looking at.

If each of the Big Dealer Report citations in legal documents and advocacy pieces represented an actual sale ($299) we might actually be able to afford to pay for “some” of the new programs that our administration is swiftly writing checks for.

Back to Right to Repair. R2R crusaders like U.S. PIRG and Vice have reported on several occasions that John Deere dealers refused to acknowledge requests from the public for the Customer Service Advisor program. I recall an article that cited a dozen or so dealers across multiple states were called with anonymous requests to purchase the $2400 software. The response was crickets it was reported or worse included lies about who was permitted to access the software.

While I suspect some information was conveniently left out of these position pieces it didn't sound like the dealer audience I've come to know. And while I didn't have the endless labor hours to throw at an investigation like the think-tanks and lobbyists (perhaps that's why journalism is facing a labor shortage these days) I was willing to make an inquiry of my own — in an experiment of 1.

I went to the John Deere site and completed the online request form for Customer Service Advisor. I identified myself only as “MJ” (and not part of the farm equipment media) and asked for information about the software. A few days later I got the friendly email below from Erich Bartos service manager at the nearest John Deere dealer Proven Power in Waukesha Wis.

I placed a call to the store and learned Erich was out but another service department colleague followed up to see if he could help so it didn’t appear that there'd be stonewalling going on here with an inquirer about Deere's diagnostic software. After ""normal"" phone tag Erich and I connected.

Bartos was friendly and congenial with someone who’d never spent a nickel at his store and patiently answered my questions. I learned that if I bought the system the benefits would include access to up to 4 computers at our location would provide me thousands of pages of operator manuals in one place and allow me to check codes. I wouldn’t be able to clear the codes of course but I’d be able to pull them up and determine what they mean. I’d be able to learn some quick tips to help a maintenance or troubleshooting situation such as locating test points and which specific sensors or solenoids should be checked. I did eventually let on that I was part of the Farm Equipment magazine (a business-to-business magazine for machinery dealers).

Interestingly he said that my inquiry was the first inquiry that his store location received. From other reports one might think dealer phones would be ringing off the hook.

Bartos expects some farm customers to buy the software for the diagnostics and troubleshooting benefits. And he also expects demand from the municipalities and airports Proven Power also serves. And for the record and contrary to some public perception Bartos isn’t kicking and screaming about making the software available to his customers. He realizes it can be helpful on both ends. That’s not a dealership that views its customer base as nothing more than a purveyors of a stack of bills something commonly portrayed by anti-commerce writers.

“I think this could actually make things easier” he says of the software licensing. “The owners can diagnose some of their own problems and if they have further questions can call the dealer.”

So I’ll ask again do we want legislation? Or cooperation?

OKLAHOMA CITY (JR) – Devon Energy Corp. announced Friday that the company’s board of directors expects to appoint Barbara Baumann to succeed Dave Hager as chair.

Hager announced plans to retire from the board in January.

“It has been a great joy and a privilege to spend the past 15 years with this great company and I am very proud of what our high-quality team has accomplished during this time to position Devon for the success it is having today” Hager said. “I have high confidence in the strategic direction of Devon and I know that the company is in good hands with Rick and Barbara’s leadership to continue to deliver strong results for all stakeholders.”

The transition aligns with its continuing focus on strong corporate values governance principles and strategic vision the Oklahoma City-based energy company said in a release.

“Devon has been very fortunate to have Dave as part of our leadership” President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Muncrief said. “We have all benefited from his track record of strategic thinking and tireless work through the years to help transform the company into the premier U.S. energy company we are today.”

Baumann has served as a member of the Devon board since 2014 and currently chairs the board’s governance environmental and public policy committee while also serving on the board’s audit committee. With more than 40 years of business experience she has served in a range of critical roles including in finance and operations during an 18-year career with Amoco (later BP Amoco) and currently serves as a director at National Fuel Gas Company and as an independent trustee of the Putnam Mutual Funds. She is also a senior advisor to First Reserve Corporation. Baumann is president of Cross Creek Energy Corp. an energy advisory firm with investments in domestic oil and natural gas. She has a master’s in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and earned a bachelor’s degree from Mount Holyoke College.

“Devon is continuing its governance tradition of separating the chair and CEO roles” Muncrief said. “I am confident Barbara is the ideal person to lead the board at this exciting time in the energy business. She is an accomplished leader with extensive experience in the energy business a broad understanding of financial markets and a keen interest in Devon’s ESG-related initiatives.”

Hager joined Devon’s executive leadership team in 2009 when he was named the company’s executive vice president of exploration and production. He was Devon’s president and chief executive officer from 2015 until 2021. He first served on Devon’s board from 2007-2009 then re-joined the board in 2016. He was appointed executive chairman in January 2021 following the company’s merger with WPX Energy.

During Hager’s tenure he oversaw the company’s repositioning into a focused U.S. onshore producer and helped guide deployment of the company’s fixed-plus-variable dividend strategy a first of its kind in the energy sector.

According to the release Hager will continue to serve as a special advisor to the company until his retirement as an employee later in the first quarter of 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS90aGluZ3MtdG8tZG8vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9va2Mtc2Npc3NvcnRhaWwtcGFyay1jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1vcGVuaW5nLW9mLXBhcmtzLWxvd2VyLWhhbGYvNjk0OTQ0NDgwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OKC Scissortail Park celebrating opening of park's lower half,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5va2xhaG9tYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS90aGluZ3MtdG8tZG8vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9va2Mtc2Npc3NvcnRhaWwtcGFyay1jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1vcGVuaW5nLW9mLXBhcmtzLWxvd2VyLWhhbGYvNjk0OTQ0NDgwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951AFB4F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Paloma Kemak a native Arizonan uses social media to put a spotlight on continuous glucose monitors tiny medical devices that have revolutionized diabetic health care.

She fills her Instagram feed with the floral backdrops travel photos wide-brimmed hats and pet portraits that have become the mainstay of the modern influencer. And every so often she posts images in which she poses with the back of her arm facing the camera to show off a less common accessory — the small white sensor that monitors her blood glucose levels.

Kemak who has Type 1 diabetes (her handle is @glitterglucose) says she created her online presence to fill a gap she saw in the real world: positive representation of diabetics like her.

“I just like to show my life and how great and fun and cool it is” she said.

She says she has often felt misunderstood and frustrated by non-diabetics who don’t understand why she had a piece of technology attached to her arm. When Kemak happens to see someone else wearing a CGM out in public she says that’s often a sign that she’s “going to make a new friend.”

In 2019 Kemak saw a stranger at Starbucks wearing the same CGM as she was and approached him to strike up a conversation. Instead of the usual diabetes-related bonding though he gave her an unexpected response.

“He was like ‘Oh I don’t have diabetes…you should just eat better’” Kemak said. “I was so shocked.”

For many diabetics CGMs are a crucial tool mechanical devices that repeatedly measure the levels of sugar in a person’s blood. A small patch affixes to the skin on areas such as the arm or stomach and the CGM transmits its readings to a sensor or phone where the user can read real-time measurements.

But diabetics aren't the only ones who can use CGMs.

Though Kemak’s experience might have been an anomaly for her more and more non-diabetics are starting to use CGMs. And like Kemak they post about it.

They film themselves attaching the sensor to their biceps triceps or stomach. In some posts a CGM appears tiny alongside cross-country skis giant barbells outdoor vistas and plates of perfectly-portioned food. Recipes abound as do workout regimens.

Charismatic and often clad in matching workout gear CGM influencers promise what so many other wellness and fitness accounts on social media promote: better health better sleep a more “optimized” body. They peddle a range of diets from carnivore to vegan with varying amounts of scientific evidence to back up their claims.

The wide range of available evidence hasn’t stopped startups and investors from marketing the technology anyway. Levels a “metabolic health” company that connects patients with physicians who can write prescriptions for CGMs and sells proprietary data tracking software to users received $12 million in seed funding in the fall of 2020.

Other CGM startups abound: Online health news website Healthline estimates that at least 39 companies are devoting attention to the technology in one form or another. And rumors abound that popular wearables like the Apple Watch or Fitbit may include glucose monitoring in forthcoming models.

But some companies sponsoring glucose monitoring influencers do not have control over the content associated with their brands if it’s not on their platform. That means that though they can monitor social media for claims being made about CGMs it’s not necessarily within their purview to prevent the spread of misinformation or untested health claims.

“We don't prescribe (any) specific diets” said Dan Zavorotny chief operating officer of NutriSense a health and wellness company that helps clients to get a CGM prescription. They do that by connecting them to a network of doctors in their state who can write a prescription for the technology. NutriSense also provides subscribers with health data software and access to a licensed dietitian through their app.

“We've had folks who follow the ketogenic diet we've had folks who follow the vegan diet and our ambition isn't to tell them like ‘hey switch from ketogenic to vegan’ or vice versa. It's about improving what they are currently doing” Zavorotny said.

Heather Walker associate director of qualitative research at the University of Utah Health who has studied social elements of diabetes thinks those kinds of life improvements don’t fall under the purview of CGMs which were designed with diabetics in mind. “You're making a game out of a life circumstance that's actually really challenging” she said of companies that market CGMs to non-diabetics.

But the line between gamification and medical necessity is still not firmly established especially as the scientific community waits for formal studies on CGM outcomes for other conditions.

Kevin Jubbal a physician entrepreneur and public-facing CGM user associated with startup company Levels described how he decided to use a CGM to help manage his Crohn’s disease.

When he was a freshman in college Jubbal had his first “flare.” People with Crohn’s disease a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) sometimes experience serious GI symptoms such as diarrhea and even other problems like fever and joint inflammation. Jubbal says when he had that first flare he was hospitalized for four days and lost over 30 pounds.

“It was a scary time and that's when I started really prioritizing health” he said. “It puts into perspective that nothing else matters.”

After experimenting with his diet for years he started to figure out what made his symptoms better and worse. Keto made things worse. He tried a plant-based diet and noticed that reducing dairy helped with his symptoms. He tried minimizing nuts and avoided sweets.

In 2019 he tried his first CGM. He watched his blood sugar spiking “all the time” and was able to see how those spikes coincided with other factors besides diet including sleep stress exercise and more.

“I remember thinking that I have a lot of room for improvement” he said.

He didn’t wear a CGM at all times after that but now he’s been wearing one for the past several months. He says it helps him stay on track with the best practices that help him avoid flares.

“I think the main lessons are very similar to the main lessons I learned from the first two or three months. But what I see now is I'm getting more continuous feedback that holds me accountable” Jubbal said. “I have noticed for sure that when I wear the CGM I eat better than when I don't because I hate seeing that spike.”

Jubbal thinks that scientifically speaking CGMs could be useful for managing other conditions beyond diabetes an idea he’s tested out firsthand.

“Me having these processed sugars is worsening my inflammation and that inflammation is tied to my IBD … I think it's based on what we know of the human body and how it works (and) it totally makes sense” he said. “But we need more evidence to support it … to prove it through studies to then make the decisions to cause the insurance companies to change their decisions about what they want to cover.”

As the technology improves he thinks it might become more popular. But for now he’s doing what many diabetics do out of necessity for a condition that he could probably manage without a CGM.

That’s not something everyone will necessarily appreciate or condone. “You have to be a certain kind of weird to enjoy doing this kind of stuff” Jubbal said. “Because it does take more work.”

It’s a choice that doesn’t necessarily make sense to David Grigsby a patient at the El Rio health clinic in Tucson who before his experience with his practitioner Lisa Beckett didn’t think CGMs would ever be for him.

“If I didn't have diabetes I'd be like ‘Well would I want to have this thing stuck on me and having to do this stuff? I wouldn’t’” he said.

“If it wasn't for the insurance companies I wouldn't be able to afford it” Grigsby said. “Why would people want to spend that kind of money and they really don't need it? I would think that's just a waste.”

Grassroots networks and the future of CGMs

Brandon Lopez says when he was younger using a CGM was a dream.

Now he's running a grassroots effort to help others fulfill that dream one that big CGM companies say is aligned with their mission but that some patients say still isn't reaching them.

Lopez was diagnosed with diabetes at age 7. While he was living with his parents he had an insulin pump — until he went on a hike the pump broke and he had to switch to multiple daily insulin injections.

“I thought (a CGM) was something I'd never be able to afford” Lopez said. “Something that only rich people can afford. That was a fantasy for me.”

In 2019 he got a job that had better health insurance and that dream of being able to use a CGM became a reality.

“It’s life-changing” he said.

But he didn’t stop there. In 2017 he had started to raise awareness about the need for unused diabetic supplies and every so often he would get a donated package from someone offering up insulin a CGM or other medical equipment for people who needed it.

During the pandemic things started to pick up. More packages started coming in and the Embrace Foundation was born.

Now every Wednesday Lopez and other volunteers visit a dimly-lit storage facility in Chandler to organize label and distribute donated diabetic supplies. On the wall behind them Lopez has taped dozens of letters from donors. Scrawled on notebook paper in Sharpie or carefully printed and typed many thank him for his work and offer up catalogs of supplies including insulin pens sterile syringe needles medications and — occasionally but less frequently — continuous glucose monitors.

The Embrace Foundation’s website describes CGM supplies as “limited” and Lopez says that he has to make difficult decisions about how to allocate supplies.

That he believes is not because of a manufacturing issue or a shortage of devices but simply because CGMs are so expensive and so coveted that patients rarely have reason to donate them. He says the Embrace Foundation really only receives CGM donations from the families of deceased patients who don’t need them anymore if there’s an upgrade to the technology and a patient gets access to a newer model or if the patient switches CGM brands.

Dexcom confirmed that the company is not experiencing a device shortage.

“Dexcom’s product supply isn’t impacting access to CGM as Dexcom does not have supply challenges at this time” said James McIntosh a spokesperson for Dexcom in an email. “It’s the need to continue to expand coverage that limits access for some individuals.”

Lopez tries not to discriminate between Type 1 and Type 2 applicants when distributing CGMs and typically aims for a first-come first-served approach but with not enough devices to go around he also tries to prioritize emergency situations.

That often means kids with Type 1 who aren’t old enough to monitor their own blood glucose levels or people whose diabetes might put them at highest risk of being hospitalized.

“It’s hard to say who deserves them and who doesn’t” Lopez said. “We always tell people that we'll be able to give them (a CGM) eventually but we can't really determine when that eventually is.”

As of this summer there were 16 people in Arizona on the Embrace Foundation’s waiting list for CGMs. Six of those 16 have gotten them so far.

Another hurdle is that CGMs still require a prescription so for people who don’t have access to a doctor who can prescribe one the technology is unattainable. Lopez said that his team tells those individuals how to get a prescription but the majority don’t come back with one. The CGMs remain out of reach.

Lopez said it can be difficult to be the person who has to make tough decisions about where their CGM supplies end up.

“(Applicants) give me what they give me. They just tell me a little blurb (on the online form) if anything and it can be hard to kind of just grant who gets this” he said. “But I try to my best ability to decide who would need one who would benefit from one.”

As Lopez strategizes over scant supplies companies are thinking on a much bigger scale. In a quarterly earnings call Insulet a corporation whose technology includes a blood glucose monitor integrated with an automated insulin pump reported surpassing a billion dollars of annual revenue in 2021. The company said it hopes to expand direct-to-consumer advertising efforts aimed at people with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

Jereme Sylvain chief financial officer of Dexcom described a patient assistance program the company introduced during the pandemic and has continued to operate for individuals who have lost jobs or otherwise qualify for aid. But he acknowledged the challenge of eliminating the prior authorizations that make it so difficult for providers to prescribe CGMs.

Dexcom hopes to work with insurance companies — and with the state of Arizona which is one of the few states whose Medicaid program does not cover Dexcom — to try to improve access.

“We really want to put as many folks as possible close to a sensor to better understand what's going on with their glucose certainly those impacted by diabetes” Sylvain said.

He said the company has to scale up operations to bring down the cost of the devices. While he emphasized the company’s role in diabetes care he acknowledged the potential for using CGMs beyond diabetes.

“We believe that there's absolutely a space for folks to move beyond (using CGMs just for diabetes)” he said. “There are utilizations that can take place there. But in the end this is something we really have to work with the FDA to get approval on.”

Lindsy Delco a spokesperson for Abbott said in an email that Abbott does not condone off-label use of their CGMs.

“Our sensing technology has potential for people without diabetes which is why we’re developing a separate line of consumer biowearables” she added in the same email. “We introduced the world’s first glucose biosensor for athletes last year in Europe and plan to bring more biowearables under the Lingo brand name in the future.”

Abbott and Dexcom both say they are prioritizing affordability for diabetics in the meantime including programs and corporate goals intended to improve access.

But in Avondale Ernesto Huerta says those changes haven’t been reaching people like him his wife Summer and his son Leo. Summer and Leo received their diabetes diagnoses within weeks of each other and it took them years to learn about CGMs start using them and to navigate insurance changes related to Ernesto's job.

Sometimes those changes meant they couldn't afford the CGMs for weeks at a time. And they still experience certain weeks where Summer and Leo can't both wear the devices that could save their lives for financial reasons.

“Some of these companies … they do have some programs that will help you. (But) you have to jump through hoops and I don't see how anybody anybody under any poverty level can run through those hoops” Ernesto said.

The silver lining Ernesto said was not the big companies but rather the people on the ground who were willing to help a network of diabetics and their families who stockpiled supplies and gave them to others when situations turned desperate.

He described the parent of one of his son’s friends who gave them a vial of insulin when they really needed it or another parent who gave them some extra supplies because the particular brand wasn’t working for their family.

That he says is where he found solace while he looked for CGMs — not in the system that already existed.

“I felt deserted. Like the whole system just deserted my family” Ernesto said. “They needed the help but it's not affordable enough for me to actually help my family.”

While not everything in Dollar General costs $1 around 20 percent of its inventory does and the chain recently said that it will never increase prices on that assortment according to CSP Daily News. In fact Dollar General intends to expand its $1 selection. The chain sees that price point as meeting the needs of a financially strapped customer who relies on dollar grocery options. The statement comes as Dollar General competitor Dollar Tree has raised its prices permanently to $1.25.

The Dollar Tree move which was announced in late 2021 was criticized at the time by David D’Arrezo former chief merchant at Dollar General as “[destroying] 35 years of brand equity in one fell swoop” CNN Business reported.

Another value store with a price point in its name also recently strayed away from its branding with a cost increase.

In 2019 Five Below named for its selection of products priced exclusively below $5 began piloting a section of its store called Ten Below dedicated to products in the below-$10 range. In 2021 the chain went further rolling out a store-within-a-store unconstrained by price promises called Five Beyond in one-third of its stores nationwide.

Other retailers who know their customers are looking for particular deals have stuck to their knitting on price though despite inflation.

As of July 2022 Costco had not increased the price on its iconic $1.50 hot dog and soda deal or its $4.99 rotisserie chicken according to The Street. The hot dog and soda deal has remained the same price since the 1980s. The warehouse retailer did increase the prices of its chicken bake and its standalone fountain soda.

While Dollar General is aiming to hang on to its under-a-dollar value proposition in its mainline stores the chain also has an entire store concept where it can charge more. In 2020 Dollar General began opening more upmarket stores under the popshelf banner. In popshelf stores 95 percent of products are priced at $5 or below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW4tc2VudGluZWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtZmFtaWx5LWRvbGxhci05OS1jZW50cy1zdG9yZXMtd2hhdC1kby10aGV5LXNlbGwtaG93LWRvLXByaWNlcy1jb21wYXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar Tree Dollar General Family Dollar: What's the difference?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW4tc2VudGluZWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwtZmFtaWx5LWRvbGxhci05OS1jZW50cy1zdG9yZXMtd2hhdC1kby10aGV5LXNlbGwtaG93LWRvLXByaWNlcy1jb21wYXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951A8BBB0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

School Site,"A plan for the site.

A roughly 21-acre property that previously was home to the closed and now-demolished Lafayette Elementary School in Bristol Township will soon be the site of 88 new residences.

Bristol Township Council on Thursday evening approved preliminary and final land development that will allow builder DR Horton which is among the largest homebuilders in the nation to construct 88 55-plus residences spread among 44 structures at 4201 Fayette Drive.

The developer has proposed one in-and-out entrance along Fayette Drive and an emergency access point if the main road is blocked.

The development will abut the PECO right-of-way for the high voltage lines and county-owned Silver Lake Park.

Nate Fox an attorney representing the project said the developer took into account feedback from township officials and moved the residences a bit closer to the new street to give more separation between existing homes.

“We do think the plan came out nicely” Fox told council members.

The site has been prone to flooding and an engineer for the project said the development will include stormwater improvements for the property including several water detention areas.

The engineer said the there’s presently no stormwater management at the site and the development would add them to help mitigate future flooding events.

The development is designed with new stormwater systems to handle a 100-year storm the engineer said.

There is a large drain pipe that sat behind the former school that was clogged which has recently was cleared out. The engineer said the developer is working on ideas to improve it but they are currently leaning toward replacing it with newer pipe system.

A resident raised concerns about traffic from the development and whether one intersection will suffice.

The traffic engineer for the project said they have determined one entrance and exit works for the project.

The residents followed up by mentioning speeding is a problem in the area.

Council President Craig Bowen said the township is exploring ways to tackle speeding in neighborhoods including adding speed bumps in some places.

With development plans approved builder DR Horton is expected to pay the school district between $800000 and $900000 for the plot of land.

DR Horton officials have said the goal is to provide age-qualified housing for local residents. Prices haven’t been set for the proposed residences but the builder said they are aiming to make them more affordable than other similar neighborhoods in Bucks County.

The goal according to a DR Horton is to start construction in spring 2023.

In 2019 Premium Excavating and Demolition of Falls Township took down the closed Lafayette and Maple Shade elementary schools under a 2018 contract to abate toxic materials and demolish the buildings.

McGrath Homes recently bought the 17.5-acre John Fitch Elementary School on Greenbrook Drive 10-acre Abraham Lincoln Elementary School on Plumtree Drive and 17-acre George Washington Elementary School for $1.2 million. The plan is construct 55-plus housing developments at those sites.

At the former Maple Shade school site on a V-shaped 5.7-acre lot along Newport Road in Croydon Maple Shade Development LLC which is connected to Falls Township-based Premium Excavating and Demolition is seeking to turn the land into 24 single-family homes.

Ann Arbor lawmakers said they didn’t make the funding request and it remains a mystery who sponsored it or how it got in a budget bill approved by the Michigan Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer two months ago.

“Nobody ever approached me about this at all and I didn’t know about it” said state Rep. Yousef Rabhi D-Ann Arbor.

Rabhi said the language was so vague he didn’t realize the Ann Arbor project was in the budget — among earmarks for other projects across the state — and he calls it “shady as hell.”

The $20 million is for a private development just across the border from Rabhi’s district in part of Ann Arbor represented by state Rep. Felicia Brabec D-Pittsfield Township.

“Frankly I didn’t realize it was in the budget” Brabec said echoing Rabhi in calling it a surprise.

So far no lawmakers have taken credit for sponsoring or requesting the earmark. No one ever touted it or celebrated it when it was approved and not even the developer mentioned it when asked in July for an update on the project.

The $20 million became public knowledge after being highlighted in a Detroit News investigative report this week.

Big redevelopment of Ann Arbor’s riverfront getting $20M from state

The money is slated to help fund the public infrastructure and public space components of a major transformation of an old industrial site along the Huron River north of downtown Ann Arbor a project by the Detroit-based Roxbury Group.

The developer has formed a nonprofit called the Lower Town Riverfront Conservancy that will receive the funds and oversee public space components of the project known as Broadway Park West. The project also includes new riverfront condos a hotel restaurant commercial space and more with total development costs now estimated at $160 million.

Roxbury which lobbied various legislators for funding maintains the earmark went through the normal appropriations process.

“There was a wide range of support for this legislation across a lot of legislators” said Roxbury principal David Di Rita adding there’s been support on both sides of the aisle.

In addition to the $20 million $17.3 million in tax incentives and a $500000 state grant were previously approved for the project. The conservancy also is seeking private donations and has gotten $2 million from the DTE Energy Foundation.

The blighted Broadway Street site where the project is expected to start taking shape in the near future is a DTE property left polluted by a former coal gasification plant.

The fenced-off land has sat vacant and closed to the public for decades and its redevelopment promises to enhance public access to Ann Arbor’s scenic riverfront with new green space walking trails an event pavilion a new pedestrian bridge to the Argo Cascades and accommodations for kayakers who will be able to pull up to a riverside restaurant.

State lawmakers representing Ann Arbor said they like the sound of some of that particularly cleaning up the site and creating new public access to the riverfront but the budget process to put state funds toward it could have been more transparent.

The process is severely flawed not giving the public a chance to weigh in on what’s proposed Rabhi said.

“And it’s the people that are well connected that have the resources that are the wealthiest among us that are able to get appropriations for themselves in the budget but the rest of us don’t have that kind of voice” he said.

While Rabhi said the developer never lobbied him for funding and he was never notified of the earmark request Brabec said she had one meeting with Roxbury to learn about the project back in March and while she liked aspects of it she never pursued getting a budget earmark for it.

“I was focusing on a different community enhancement grant one that I did advocate for” she said referring to $650000 in state funding now going to a $15 million project to redesign the Ann Arbor-based Nonprofit Enterprise at Work’s center along the Huron River and expand programming.

State Sen. Jeff Irwin D-Ann Arbor said Roxbury also approached him earlier in the year to pitch the project and he knew about the earmark request before it was in the budget but he still doesn’t know who ultimately put it forward.

“That was a question that we’d asked” he said adding there seems to be no paper trail.

Understanding it’s a long-polluted site he knows it needs to be redeveloped he said but he didn’t pursue a budget earmark for it because he was more focused on putting resources toward youth groups community centers and affordable housing. Among the other earmarks in the budget is $500000 for the Ann Arbor Housing Commission and $3.5 million for Avalon Housing an Ann Arbor-based affordable housing provider.

The nearly 1000-page state budget bill approved in July described the $20 million allocation as going to a nonprofit “that is a nature conservancy” in a city with a population greater than 600000 “for restoration of river front land in a county with a population between 300000 and 400000.” The unnamed city is Detroit and the county is Washtenaw.

The way the budget process works the House and Senate both pass their versions of the budget and vote each other’s budgets down then it goes to conference committee where lawmakers hash things out behind closed doors Rabhi said. They then come to an open meeting the public can attend but there’s no discussion and they just vote he said.

“We have the opportunity to either vote yes or vote no” he said. “You cannot make amendments.”

The budget was approved at about 2 a.m. July 1 following a marathon session that began at 10 a.m. the previous day.

Rabhi said he and other lawmakers who weren’t included in the conference committee negotiations which are mainly between the governor and the House and Senate Republican leadership were sitting around most of the day waiting for negotiations to conclude and they only got a budget summary about an hour and a half before the vote then the actual full budget language about 10-15 minutes before the vote.

“So we were not able to review this in any type of detail” he said noting the budget summary did identify the $20 million going to the Lower Town Riverfront Conservancy but it wasn’t clear it was for an Ann Arbor project.

When he more recently looked up the budget summary he noticed the letters “AA” in parentheses but he doesn’t remember seeing that the first time around he said.

While he isn’t taking a position for or against the development Rabhi said he can see benefits to it.

“It’s a vacant contaminated site and it would be nice to see something happen there” he said. “Of all the places development could happen this is one that makes sense.”

Irwin said he doesn’t consider the $20 million a bad appropriation. What really stuck out to him as bad he said are the millions going to help a private “McMansion development” with ties to former Michigan GOP Chairman Robert Schostak in Washtenaw County’s Salem Township.

Irwin agreed with Rabhi the budget process should be more transparent including making earmark descriptions less vague.

“They all read in that same way where you need to do some additional investigation to find out if the public investment is justified” Irwin said.

For the Roxbury development Brabec a psychologist said she’s thinking about the community mental health impacts of being more connected to natural resources and she also likes that the project includes space for outdoor music events and artists.

Brabec and Rabhi still have questions about who will make up the governing board for the conservancy in terms of management of the outdoor space that’s to be open to the public. Since it’s going to stay private land it’s not a true public space Rabhi argued questioning putting public funds toward it.

“As a general principle I do not support public appropriations for private purposes” he said. “These are taxpayer dollars. We paid for this out of our pockets this $20 million.”

Hydrogen fuel could revolutionize the nation’s energy sector using the most abundant element in the universe — and oil and gas companies are lead supporters.

Top energy companies including Shell and Duke Energy spent collectively $16.5 million lobbying Congress during the first six months of 2022 on a range of bills including a push for hydrogen production Senate lobbying disclosures show.

The five companies most of which are surviving companies of the “Seven Sisters” that dominated the global petroleum industry until the mid-1970s have lobbied for tax credits and research on hydrogen.

They aren’t alone in their interest in hydrogen fuel which has an advantage in that it can be produced and stored without certain geographic needs that other energies like solar and wind power require.

“Because it’s a liquid fuel you can store it” Gregory Wetstone president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit American Council on Renewable Energy told OpenSecrets. Wetstone said it resolves “problems such as the need to have energy during time periods when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing.”

The nonprofit has spent $80000 lobbying so far this year and has donated to a slate of Democratic members of Congress including Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).

But unlike other renewable energies hydrogen still relies on natural gas to be converted into a liquid fuel — creating a paradox in which the fuel that could be key to decarbonizing the U.S. power grid is itself a carbon emitter.

Today about 95% of hydrogen fuel is “gray hydrogen” made from natural gas via a steam methane reformation process that produces more carbon dioxide than burning an equivalent amount of gasoline.

For fossil fuel companies this presents an opportunity to use existing infrastructure for a new technology.

Legislators like Manchin who has received large checks to his 2024 reelection campaign from the oil and gas industry have argued for the continued use of natural gas processes as hydrogen is further developed in the U.S.

President Joe Biden has kept his eye more so on “clean hydrogen” that uses renewable energies. Processes like electrolysis which separates hydrogen atoms from water molecules to create “green hydrogen” emit zero greenhouse gas emissions but have high price tags.

Amid a global energy crisis furthered by Russia’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine oil and gas companies have pumped more funds into lobbying efforts as federal lawmakers grapple with U.S. energy insecurity and foreign dependence.

Chevron leads the pack with over $4 million spent lobbying Capitol Hill from January through June of this year. Over $2 million of these expenses come during the second quarter an increase from the $1.6 million spent by Chevron from that same period in 2021.

“Energy policy is a critical public policy issue” Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne Jr. told OpenSecrets in a statement. “When Chevron lobbies we do so on behalf of our employees and shareholders in support of our ambition to deliver affordable reliable and ever-cleaner energy to a growing world.”

The American multinational energy corporation announced in June that it plans to spend about $2.5 billion by 2028 developing both “green hydrogen” and “blue hydrogen.” Blue hydrogen similarly uses natural gas like “gray hydrogen” but resulting carbon dioxide emissions are captured using technology.

Turenne told OpenSecrets that Chevron seeks to grow green blue and gray hydrogen production to 150000 tons per year by 2030 to supply industrial power and heavy-duty transport customers.

This year Chevron has disclosed lobbying for all provisions of the Clean Hydrogen Production and Investment Tax Credit of 2021 Act which would provide tax credits to companies that produce “green” and “blue” hydrogen in order to encourage clean fuel production.

While this particular bill has not seen any movement since it was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means last September hydrogen production tax credits — also lobbied for by Shell BP America and Duke Energy — are a prominent component of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Signed into law by Biden in August the act has a tax credit that scales depending on how clean the fuel’s production is. Maximum credit or $3 per kilogram of hydrogen is given to facilities where hydrogen fuel is made without carbon dioxide emissions.

BP spent nearly $2.2 million on lobbying through June 30 on issues including electric vehicles and solar projects as well as legislation such as Build Back Better the slimmed down version of which now makes up the Inflation Reduction Act.

The British oil and gas corporation is a board member of the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition which aims at “promoting clean hydrogen as a critical pathway to achieve global decarbonization objectives.” Chevron and other energy companies are also members of the coalition.

BP’s affiliate BP America indicated lobbying the Department of Energy on “issues related to hydrogen” in its second quarter disclosure.

The department which states that commercially-viable hydrogen fuel made from natural gas is a “bridge technology” to more sustainable production recently funneled money into clean hydrogen projects.

The DOE launched three initiatives of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in February: $8 billion toward regional hubs producing clean hydrogen $1 billion toward improving electrolysis’ cost-effectiveness and $500 million toward manufacturing clean hydrogen equipment.

“Clean hydrogen is key to cleaning up American manufacturing and slashing equipment from carbon-intensive materials like steel and cement while creating good-paying jobs for American workers” U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.

Experts project that “green hydrogen” made with electrolysis will be cost-competitive with “gray hydrogen” in certain places around the globe by 2030. Rising gas prices have already made “green hydrogen” more appealing.

Looking ahead Wetstone said that it’s critically important to build out the country’s transmission infrastructure to deliver hydrogen to consumers.

“We need to have a 21st century grid that is able to accommodate the high penetration levels of renewable power that we’re talking about” Wetstone told OpenSecrets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL2lkLnVzZW1iYXNzeS5nb3YvdHJlYXN1cnktY2xpbWF0ZS1jb3Vuc2Vsb3ItbW9ydG9uLWFuZC1kZXB1dHktc3BlY2lhbC1lbnZveS1mb3ItY2xpbWF0ZS1kdWtlLXRyYXZlbC10by1pbmRvbmVzaWEtdG8tYWR2YW5jZS10aGUtanVzdC1lbmVyZ3ktdHJhbnNpdGlvbi1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Treasury Climate Counselor Morton and Deputy Special Envoy for Climate Duke Travel to Indonesia to Advance the ...,"We’re sorry this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

(Michelin inspectors told Washingtonian: “Our understanding is that Komi has closed.”) It seems Happy Gyro—and its terrific dessert offshoot Happy Ice Cream—is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

“The whole team has been reunited under one roof keeping up with the gyro pizza ice cream and natural wine fiends and we’ve been having fun growing in those directions” says Marler in an email about Serow’s hiatus.

When it opened in 2011 Little Serow was one of DC’s white-hot “line-standing restaurants” where eager patrons would queue up for an hour before dinner service to snag a spot. Monis’s multi-course tasting menus—full of bold fiery flavors—often earned the subterranean dining room a top spot on Washingtonian‘s 100 Best Restaurant list among other accolades. The kitchen continued to turn out stellar dishes—and tasting menu-style packages—through the pandemic democratizing access to sought-after dishes like spicy catfish laap and whiskey pork ribs.

Now for some good news: Happy Gyro is hosting an end-of-summer September Equinox party on its patio this Saturday September 17 from 1 to 3 PM. Expect bubbles by the glass summer berry sorbets fries stick meat and perhaps some of Monis’s dry-aged fish tacos.

Some used wristbands were attracting bids of up to £70000 before they were removed.

An eBay spokesperson said: “These items are against our policies and we are removing them from our site.” Its event ticket policy prohibits the sale of most tickets including those for events that are free to the public.

The Queen’s lying-in-state at the Palace of Westminster opened to the public at 5pm on Wednesday and 48 hours later about a dozen people had listed their coloured and numbered paper bands for sale on online marketplaces.

People joining the queue that winds its way around central London to view the coffin are given paper wristbands to mark their place. This allows mourners to leave the queue for a short period to use the lavatory or get refreshments then return to their spot.

The wristbands which do not guarantee entry and are strictly non-transferable have been issued by the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) to help manage the huge numbers of people keen to catch a glimpse of the Queen lying in state. Bands have different numbers and colours each day. The DCMS website explains the process for queueing saying the band is “a record of when you joined the queue”.

One seller’s gold wristband was listed with the description “Queen Elizabeth II Lying In State Gold Queue Wristband. Used – see photos from the day! Friday 16th September 11-hour queue same day as David Beckham (was about an hour before us). Joined queue before 6am.”



An orange wristband which features the royal coat of arms and the abbreviation LISQ (lying in state queue) had a price of £1000 after nine bids. The seller described it as “brand new” and “never been used”.

A similar band with a starting price of £550 gained 22 watchers in its first 24 hours of being live.

Several sellers are including bundles of commemorative newspapers alongside their bands and many have included photos of themselves wearing the wristband in the queue to prove their authenticity. One eBay member listed his orange band with a note that: “I originally put this wristband at a high price. As you can see it was same colour as my jacket! But have decided to let it run on auction. Something in me from the Queen said do it.”

The cheapest band listed on the site is priced at £10 and for £20 you can buy one described as a “bit wrinkled but a piece of history”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWxsZWFycy5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9hLXJhcmUtZGlzbmV5LXNvdXZlbmlyLWlzLWJlaW5nLXJlc29sZC1mb3ItdGhvdXNhbmRzLW9uLWViYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An Exclusive Disney Souvenir Is Being Resold for THOUSANDS,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWxsZWFycy5uZXQvMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9hLXJhcmUtZGlzbmV5LXNvdXZlbmlyLWlzLWJlaW5nLXJlc29sZC1mb3ItdGhvdXNhbmRzLW9uLWViYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950B824A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Tim Walz releases plan to bring Minnesota to zero net carbon emissions by 2050,"EAGAN Minn. — Gov. Tim Walz has released an ambitious climate plan that aims to significantly curb Minnesota’s greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades with the ultimate goal of making the state have zero net carbon emissions by 2050.

The governor joined by Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan Democratic legislative leaders and commissioners from multiple state agencies as well as others who contributed to the plan unveiled a 69-page framework Friday Sept. 16 at St. Paul-based Ecolab’s research campus in Eagan. In rolling out the new goals officials said Minnesota must be ambitious to confront the existential threat of human-caused climate change.

“Like many parents I wake up every day and worry about the future of the world that my daughter will grow up in” Flanagan said. “We must do the work and take bold steps now to protect our future generations from the worst impacts of climate change.”

Minnesota has already seen rising temperatures and extreme weather as a result of climate change according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Daily average minimum temperatures December-February have increased in all regions of the state between 1895 and 2021. The report also pointed to record-breaking floods in Duluth in 2012 and Faribault in 2010 and 2016.

Minnesota Pollution Control Agency

Minnesota set its current goals in 2007 when the state adopted the bipartisan Next Generation Energy Act which called for an 80% reduction in 2005-level emissions by 2050. The state missed its goal to reduce emissions 15% by 2015 and is not on track to meet it’s 30% goal by 2025 the climate plan said. Emissions have only decreased by 8% since 2005.

The plan has a three-part framework to tackle the problem:



carbon neutrality

preparing Minnesota communities to handle the impacts of a changing climate

and addressing inequality for communities disproportionately affected by climate change.

It also identifies six different areas of goals:



Clean transportation

improved land use

creating communities resilient to climate change

promoting clean energy and efficient buildings

protecting health in the face of climate change

and creating a clean carbon-neutral economy.

Measurable goals include reducing greenhouse emissions from the transportation sector by 80% by 2040 decreasing vehicle miles traveled per capita by 20% by 2050 and having 20% of vehicles on Minnesota roads be electric by 2030. Right now just 1% of vehicles in Minnesota are electric. Improved land use goals include wetland and forest restoration restoring habitats and reducing emissions from agriculture. The plan also calls for 100% of Minnesota communities to have climate risk plans that address issues such as flooding.

Pollution control agency commissioner Katrina Kessler said Minnesota’s Climate Change Subcabinet based the new plan on input from thousands of state residents and experts as well as tribes local governments and businesses.

MINNESOTA POLITICS:







To achieve the goals agencies will continue with measures to curb emissions including the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency moving forward with a new California clean car standard that has attracted criticism from auto dealers and some Republicans. Minnesota tied its regulations to California's though now California has made its regulations stricter — calling for a ban on vehicles that use gas in 2035. Kessler said the state wouldn't be adopting the newer stricter rules.

Transportation is the No. 1 contributor to the state’s emissions the report said and 70% of the emissions come from passenger vehicles. But the plan's creators also hope for legislation as well as cooperation from business and other groups to help achieve the climate goals.

“We're hopeful that the next biennial budget includes a big robust climate package to support agencies to support local leaders to provide incentives for communities and businesses to further the work” Kessler said.

Republican state Sen. Dave Senjem of Rochester also appeared with Walz and others to speak in support of the plan though any significant legislation will likely face hurdles in the Legislature where the Republican-controlled Senate is not typically receptive to major climate legislation.

With an election in November and no signs lawmakers will return to the capitol before January Walz said it was still a good time to roll out the plan and that election season was a good time to “foster conversations” about the issue. Walz’s GOP challenger Scott Jensen did not mention climate change in an energy policy plan his campaign released in July and has not been vocal on the issue.

“This issue will transcend whoever is elected this issue is not going away it needs to be addressed” Walz told reporters. “There's folks here who are not from elected office and are still moving in the direction of this. This has been years of work. And this is when it was completed and ready to go.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Patients suffering with debilitating symptoms as a result of degenerative mitral regurgitation represent a large and significantly underserved group in the US"" said Bernard J. Zovighian Edwards' corporate vice president transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. ""Edwards' 60-year history of innovation and leadership within structural heart disease positions our team well to bring the PASCAL Precision system to US clinicians supporting excellent real-world outcomes for patients.""

The PASCAL Precision system with its independent grasping atraumatic clasp and closure and ability to elongate enables safe and effective treatment for patients with DMR. Engineered with an intuitive catheter and handle the system is designed for maneuverability and stability enabling precise navigation and implant delivery.

""The mitral valve is highly complex and challenging to treat"" said Firas Zahr M.D. Associate Professor of Medicine Division of Cardiovascular Medicine School of Medicine Oregon Health & Science University whose patients participated in the CLASP IID clinical trial. ""Through my participation in the CLASP IID pivotal trial I have performed many cases with the PASCAL system. With FDA approval of the PASCAL system US clinicians now have an additional option for treating patients with severe mitral regurgitation.""

Data from the CLASP IID pivotal trial the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare two contemporary TEER therapies will be presented as a late-breaking clinical science session on Sept. 17 at the 34th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation.

The PASCAL Precision system has CE Mark certification for the treatment of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. As part of Edwards' continued commitment to building a body of real-world evidence patients receiving treatment with the PASCAL Precision system in the US will be enrolled in the TVT registry for five years.

The PASCAL Precision system is one of multiple transcatheter repair or replacement therapies in development by Edwards that are designed to address mitral and tricuspid valve disease and the company's first such therapy approved for DMR in the US. Edwards is committed to transforming the treatment of mitral and tricuspid patients supported by a robust body of clinical evidence. The commercial opportunity related to this approval is factored into 2022 financial expectations.

About TEER

Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) of the mitral valve is used in the treatment of mitral regurgitation. TEER approximates the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets by grasping them with a clipping device in an approach similar to a treatment developed in cardiac surgery called the Alfieri stitch.

Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian has received the largest gift in its nearly 70-year history: $106 million from the estate of Audrey Steele Burnand.

Hoag officials said the unprecedented gift will be used to significantly expand the hospital’s world-class health care research and treatment capabilities as it steadily climbs into the ranks of America’s top medical institutions.

“The Steele family’s decades of generosity continued by the Audrey Steele Burnand estate have benefited the Orange County community in immeasurable ways” said Flynn A. Andrizzi PhD president of the Hoag Hospital Foundation. “Through this remarkable gift they once again have demonstrated their compassion for everyone who needs outstanding medical care. I can’t think of enough words to properly express how moved all of us at Hoag are by their generosity.”

The major gift from the late benefactress’ estate brings her family’s legacy of giving to Hoag to more than $134 million.

Audrey Steele Burnand a longtime resident of Newport Beach who passed away in 2020 was the daughter of Harry and Grace Steele. In the early twentieth century Harry Steele guided the U.S. Electrical Manufacturing Company into one of the nation’s leading motor manufacturing companies; it eventually merged with Emerson Electric Co.

The Steele family’s unparalleled history of financial giving to Hoag dates to the 1960s with early contributions directed to cancer and cardiology research and treatment.

“Hoag has evolved into a technologically advanced organization that prioritizes patient-centered care innovation and research” said Robert T. Braithwaite president and chief executive officer of Hoag. “Hoag is able to maintain those attributes by keeping its focus and resources local and maintaining our commitment to ensuring that no one needs to leave Orange County to receive world-class comprehensive compassionate care.”

Braithwaite said the gift will help fuel Hoag’s commitment to significantly expand its compassion-based health care services and programs throughout Orange County.

“Simply put we’re driven to achieve the highest level of medical standards and outcomes for our patients and this gift will help us achieve that goal” Braithwaite said. “We’re inspired by the support we continue to receive from the community as we help to not only offer the latest advancements in care but to discover them.”

“Through the decades since it first opened its doors in September of 1952 Hoag has grown beyond its founders’ original vision” Braithwaite noted. “Yet even as Hoag embarks on its next chapter the one thing that hasn’t changed is its culture of excellence – our investment in cutting-edge technology our recruitment of renowned physicians our compassion for everyone who entrusts us with their care. These things continue to guide us in service of our founding ideal: the concept that our patients come first. We’re honored that the estate of Audrey Steele Burnand shares this ideal and has chosen to join us on our journey into the future of health care.”

Thanks in large part to philanthropy Hoag has become one of the nation’s finest health care systems serving a diverse and growing population. The Hoag Hospital Foundation the philanthropic arm of Hoag is an integral partner in Hoag’s vision to become a trusted and nationally recognized health care leader. Through the generosity of a dedicated community of supporters the Hoag Hospital Foundation completed Hoag Promise Our Campaign to Lead Innovate & Transform in 2020. The Campaign raised in excess of $760 million driving Hoag’s continued clinical leadership innovative spirit and transformative potential.

The Louisiana Bond Commission on Thursday approved a $39 million future line of credit for a critical New Orleans area power plant project that had become an unlikely pawn in the ongoing political tug-of-war over enforcing Louisiana’s near-total abortion ban.

For two months the commission — generally known for its historically actuarial role rather than taking political stances — held up a necessary financial approval step for the project as a way to “send a message” to leaders in New Orleans who have expressed opposition to enforcement of the ban.

But as members debated on Thursday they asked if any abortion ""laws were been broken” in New Orleans and noted that the project which is critical to power drainage pumps that remove rainwater in a city that faces chronic flood problems was too important to possibly delay.

“We need to quit messing around with this and go ahead and approve it” said Republican Sen. Bret Allain who voted in favor of the item in August as well.

Battles between Democratic city leaders and Republicans in reliably red states have been happening across the country since the U.S. Supreme Court decided to end constitutional protections for abortion in June.

Dozens of prosecutors nationwide — including in Florida — have promised not to pursue charges against those seeking or providing abortions. In St. Louis hours after the mayor signed a measure providing $1 million for travel to abortion clinics in other states the Missouri Attorney General sued to block it. City councils in places such as Austin Texas and Nashville have passed measures urging law enforcement not to prioritize abortion ban enforcement.

In Louisiana legislation bans all abortions except if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies — when the fetus has a fatal abnormality. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.

Following the downfall of Roe v. Wade the New Orleans city council passed a resolution directing police and prosecutors not to use city funds to enforce the ban and to make it “the lowest priority for enforcement.”

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry a Republican who is considered a likely 2023 gubernatorial candidate described city leaders’ opposition as a “dereliction of duty.” He turned to the Bond Commission who voted to deny a preliminary authorization of the line of credit for a power plant project of the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board.

On Thursday members voted in favor of the future line of credit 11-1. The sole objection was from Landry’s stand-in Algelique Freel. During August’s Bond Commission meeting Landry urged fellow commission members to “use the tools at our disposal to bring” leaders in New Orleans opposing enforcement of the abortion ban “to heel.”

Freel read a letter from Landry on Thursday that reiterated his continuing stance.

“This issue is much more fundamental than Louisiana’s abortion ban"" the letter said. ""Each and every elected official takes an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of our state. These New Orleans officials have taken it upon themselves to pick and choose which laws they are going to enforce in direct contradiction to their oath. What’s next? Can leaders of other municipalities now simply refuse to enforce any state statutes they personally disagree with?”

Caught in the middle of the political wrangling has been a vital power plant project for the state's most-populous city.

State Sen. Jimmy Harris a Democrat who represents New Orleans urged commission members to approve the future credit line — noting that the plant would help protect 384000 people allowing them clean water to drink and bathe in instead of undergoing frequent water boil advisories. Currently the pumps are powered by outdated turbines which also power the city’s water and sewage system.

“Find something nonessential to go after” Paul Rainwater a lobbyist for New Orleans told the commission in August. “Not the Sewerage and Water Board not the power station not the pumps.""

In a state that has been devastated by natural disasters flooding is at the forefront of mind — especially as Louisiana is in the midst of hurricane season. Forecasters have predicted there will be 14 to 20 named storms this year including six to 10 hurricanes.

“For this Bond Commission to hold up flood protection in any form shouldn't be our position” said Republican Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser.

While approval of a future line of credit will not immediately release project funds the approval sends a “critical signal” to contractors that funds will be available to finish the project. The city and Entergy New Orleans are paying for the majority of the project’s cost but Rainwater said state funding will be necessary to keep the project on track to be completed in 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the fourth expansion for the facility announced in 2009 and opened in 2010 with two further phases to follow to eventually reach 7700 square meters of colocation space.

“With the expansion of our ZH4 data center in the heart of the city – by the way exactly where Switzerland’s major Internet lines cross – we are once again expanding our presence in the strategically important location of Zurich. We are thus offering our customers additional capacities and networking opportunities. They allow them to further implement their digitization on the basis of a highly efficient infrastructure"" said Roger Semprini managing director of Equinix Switzerland.

Located at Josefstrasse 225 ZH4 is one of three facilities Equinix operates in Zurich alongside ZH2 and ZH5 the latter of which opened in 2013. The company acquired local operator ICT-Center AG for $5 million in 2017 saying the adjacent facility would enable Equinix to expand ZH4.

The company also operates two facilities in Geneva.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbnoubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL3doeS1lcXVpbml4LWVxaXgtdG9wLWRpdmlkZW5kLTE1NDUwMzM1Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Equinix (EQIX) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nz.news.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /finance/news/why-equinix-eqix-top-dividend-154503356.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952C59180>, 'Connection to nz.news.yahoo.com timed out.

Working with software developer MySunBuddy the certified B Corporation has launched a platform that enables customers in Massachusetts who oversize their arrays — that is who install more solar panels on their roofs than they need to meet their own energy needs — to donate the extra energy savings to low-income families.

“We want to make it possible for people to send their excess energy production — in the form of net-metering credits — to low-income customers” said Ben Underwood Resonant’s co-CEO and co-founder. Net metering allows customers with solar to be paid for the energy they send to the grid with the value credited to customers’ power bills. Sharing those savings with low-income families through the company’s Solar Equity Platform Underwood said would ​“help people benefit from the transition to clean energy who might otherwise be left out.”

Resonant Energy has launched the Solar Equity Platform a tool to enable homeowners and organizations with oversized solar arrays to donate their excess utility bill credits to low-income households. (Resonant Energy)

Owners of the oversized arrays can also get a boost Underwood explained. Incentives for solar energy systems that benefit low-income communities often help offset and can even exceed the cost of building bigger.

The Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target or SMART program pays solar owners a bonus rate for the energy they sell to the grid if at least 15 percent of the system’s production goes to low-income households. For a system that qualifies for example an owner could get compensated at the baseline net-metering rate $0.238 per kilowatt-hour and the SMART bonus $0.068 per kilowatt-hour for a total of $0.306 per kilowatt-hour according to Underwood.

In the scenarios Resonant has analyzed the solar owner almost always breaks even or actually makes a better return on their solar system investment with this approach than they would have otherwise Underwood said. The outcome depends on the utility jurisdiction and other details but ​“in most cases you can get an extra half a percent or up to 1 percent on internal rate of return” he said.

Underwood estimates that if a quarter of residential solar installations were oversized across Massachusetts the Solar Equity Platform could generate about $1.57 million in bill savings annually eliminating the electricity costs for the equivalent of more than 1300 low-income households.

How the platform works

Donating net-metering credits from one utility account to another is more straightforward than it probably seems; it just requires filling out a form said Underwood. The platform draws the relevant data from the accounts of the donors and recipients so both groups can easily see how many solar credits they’ve donated or received. That would normally be a challenge to glean directly from their power bills. The platform also matches networks of donors and recipients making it possible to send credits to low-income customers at a scale that would be impossible through one-off transactions Underwood said.

The tuition-free program is dedicated to building a nurse practitioner workforce committed to working in and with underserved rural and urban communities.

“With the first of the Leonard A. Lauder program Fellows joining us at Penn Nursing we begin the work of preparing these excellent nurses to be leaders in providing care in under-resourced communities” says Penn Nursing Dean Antonia Villarruel. “The impact this program will have in communities that face barriers to care cannot be overstated—and all of us at Penn Nursing are grateful to Leonard A. Lauder for his vision and commitment to improving health and health care in areas where it is most needed.”

The Leonard A. Lauder program at Penn Nursing is a two-year rigorous Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Program. It was borne of a $125 million gift—the largest ever to an American nursing school—by Penn alumnus Leonard A. Lauder Chairman Emeritus of The Estée Lauder Companies.

Each Fellow will complete at least 50% of their clinical education at community partner sites and/or comparable sites that provide direct patient care an invaluable experience that will prepare Fellows to meet the complex needs of patients and families throughout their careers. Every Fellow will be expected to commit to practice or service in an underserved community for two years after graduation.

This October the Estée Lauder Cos. Breast Cancer Campaign will celebrate its 30th anniversary.

In honor of the impact the campaign has had since its founding in 1992 by Evelyn H. Lauder the Estée Lauder Cos. will receive the Sandra Taub Humanitarian Award at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s annual Symposium and Luncheon next month.

“We are humbled and honored to be this year’s recipient of this prestigious award” said Bari Seiden-Young senior vice president of global corporate communications citizenship and sustainability at Estée Lauder and global ambassador for the Breast Cancer Campaign. “In the next 30 years we look to positively impact the community and funding groundbreaking research and medical breakthroughs toward the campaign’s mission to create a breast-cancer-free world for all.”

Bari Seiden-Young

The Breast Cancer Campaign and the Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation have donated a combined $108 million toward research education and medical services with over $86 million of that total funding medical research grants through BCRF which was founded by Evelyn Lauder one year after she started the Breast Cancer Campaign and whom the campaign has partnered with since.

“This award is presented every year to either a person or an organization that exemplifies true generosity of spirit passion for philanthropy and a commitment to our mission” said Myra Biblowit president and chief executive officer of BCRF.

Sandra Taub a longtime supporter of BCRF passed away due to breast cancer in 2006. Former recipients of the award include Tommy Hilfiger Tory Burch Vera Wang Stella McCartney and Katie Couric.

Lauder’s chief executive officer Fabrizio Freda will accept the award on behalf of the company at the event which will take place at the New York Hilton Midtown on Oct. 27.

Said Freda in an email to Beauty Inc “I am so proud of the progress and lasting impact we have made through the support of our employees consumers and partners worldwide. We look to the future and are committed to advancing positive change.”

In the 30 years since the founding of the Breast Cancer Campaign the U.S. breast cancer mortality rate has declined by over 40 percent. The campaign seeks to continue funding vital research through BCRF and aims to tackle the racial disparity in both treatment and diagnosis of the disease which causes Black women to suffer higher mortality rates.

On the one side there’s those like Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla which is trying to bring back employees 40 hours a week and others like Slack and Airbnb that allow workers to be fully remote. In between there are many such as Apple and Peloton that have opted for a hybrid model and a number of those implemented those policies following Labor Day.

Here’s what eight beauty companies had to say when Beauty Inc asked them to comment on their plans for office returns (store and lab workers have different policies).

BeautyHealth

BeautyHealth president and chief executive officer Andrew Stanleick said that the company best known for its Hydrafacial operates a fully hybrid work environment benefiting both the company and employees who now have much more flexibility.



“We’re asset light so on the financial side it helps” he told Beauty Inc during an interview. “We’re offering a huge degree of flexibility. We haven’t been too prescriptive but we’ve created a governance where employees come together for moments be it key meetings during the month or creative moments. But aside from that we give them the flexibility to live wherever they want to. It means that we’ve got teams spread all over the country and we meet in our hub of offices around the country for those moment to get together.

“There’s moments like today when I’ve been doing deep thinking in preparation [for our investor’s day] when I thought it’s more efficient for me to work at home” he continued. “But then I’m really excited to go into the office this afternoon to meet our teams and have a creative session brainstorming our future so our hybrid work approach reflects that flexibility for employees.”

Coty

“We believe that a more flexible philosophy of remote working will give everyone the freedom to choose what works for their individual circumstances and empower them to always perform at their best” a Coty spokeswoman told Beauty Inc.

To that end it launched a hybrid workplace flexibility model including a 50/50 target meaning that all employees are able to work from home up to a maximum of 50 percent of their contractual working time.

“We are constantly reassessing the needs of our employees to ensure that our approach is appropriate. We are collecting employees’ feedback to modify and evolve the approach as needed” added the spokeswoman.

E.l.f.

“We will continue to have an in-office presence as we believe in-person collaboration drives better business results. We have balanced this approach with increased flexibility through a hybrid model returning to the office three days per week” said Scott Milsten chief people officer at E.l.f. Beauty.

As part of its return to the office the listed beauty company made a number of changes that it believes will foster increased work/life balance and enhance the in-office experience. “Our new flexible time-off program allows for unlimited time off. All E.l.f. Beauty offices now close at 2 p.m. local time on Fridays year-round and we’ve added more time to recharge” said Milsten. “On long holiday weekends we close our offices on the Friday before making them four-day weekends and we are closed for the week of Thanksgiving so teammates can unwind and spend time with family. Finally for those teammates who do have an in-office presence our enhanced benefits include catered lunches every Thursday regular happy hours and a new commuter allowance.”

L’Oréal

L’Oréal USA implemented a full return to its offices across the country in October 2021 with a permanent hybrid work policy that allows employees to work remotely up to two days per week.

Sephora

A spokeswoman for Sephora part of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton declined to comment on its plans for return to office.

Shiseido

Head office employees at the U.S. arm of the Japanese beauty giant whose brands include Nars Drunk Elephant and Tory Burch Beauty will be required to be in the office three days a week including Tuesday and Wednesday. The third day is up to the individual.

The Estée Lauder Cos.

After two years of remote working the Estée Lauder Cos. officially reopened its U.S. corporate and brand offices on April 4.



“We continue to be guided by ELC’s global principles of approaching reopenings worldwide in a conservative thoughtful and responsible way that aligns with local government guidelines and prioritizes the health and wellbeing of our employees” it said in a memo to workers at the time. “Not only will April 4th mark in-person reunions for so many of our teams it will mark the beginning of our future ways of working together. As we’ve previously shared ELC will implement a hybrid work model for the vast majority of our corporate employees where employees divide their time between working from ELC’s offices (on average 3 days per week) and remotely. Leaders will work with their individual teams to address the specific hybrid arrangements that work best for their teams and business needs. This new way of working will allow us to balance the joys of working together in person while enabling greater work/life harmonization.”

Ulta

Ulta Beauty’s corporate team returned to the office in May while its store and distribution center teams never transitioned to virtual work. In its offices its model is centered around so-called FlexWork which comes to life most prominently during its monthly corporate team weeks when the entire corporate team is in office during a designated week per month (Tuesday-Thursday). Beyond this designated time corporate associates are required to come into the office three additional days per month based on the specific needs of their team. “Corporate team weeks fuel relationship-building cross-functional collaboration and importantly represent an opportunity to invest in our culture” said an Ulta Beauty spokeswoman. Corporate associates may also choose one month annually to work fully remote."
ETSY,Etsy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvZXRzeXMtY2hyby1pcy1yZWNydWl0aW5nLWludGVybmFsbHktdG8tZml4LXRoZS1sZWFreS1waXBlbGluZS13ZXZlLWludmVzdGVkLWEtbG90LWluLWZpbmRpbmctdGhpcy10YWxlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Etsy's pivot to internal recruiting,"Good morning!

Kim Seymour is focused on the pipeline—the tech talent pipeline that is. The new CHRO of Etsy joined the digital marketplace in April of this year and is taking strides to double down on developing the internal talent she’s inherited. This week the company launched a new development program meant to help map out the career paths of its workers.

Etsy has for a long time led the industry in gender diversity with a workforce comprised of about 47% women. But Seymour recognizes the company still has a long way to go in developing and retaining underrepresented talent. On par with many other tech companies Black and Hispanic employees accounted for just 6.1% and 6.3% of Etsy’s U.S. employees in 2021 respectively according to a report by Protocol. It’s a pipeline issue for sure. But the solution Seymour says lies in making it everyone’s problem to solve.

“It’s not HR’s job. It’s everybody’s job” she says. “It’s everyone’s job to move the needle because it is ingrained in who we think we are [as a company].” Seymour spoke with Fortune about how she’s thinking about the future of Etsy’s talent pipeline and why she’s prioritizing internal talent.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Fortune: What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the phrase ‘talent pipeline?’

The first thing I think about is our internal talent and whether we’re making sure they’re getting the feedback and development they need in order to be appropriate for the jobs that we have. We’ve invested a lot in finding this talent landing them keeping them. So if we have open roles that should be our first hunting ground before we even talk about the pipeline externally.

What initiatives have you developed to help move your internal talent through the pipeline?

A couple of things. [This week] we’re rolling out a program called “Pathways” which is a series of development opportunities curriculum [and] different competencies that are going to help people to choose for themselves where they want to go and how we can help them get there.

We are still paying attention to our entry-level pipelines through an apprenticeship program. We’re focused on people who don’t historically have access to this type of training and curriculum that are maybe self taught. We have a whole curriculum that teaches how to work in the tech space and we’re in our second year of that. The first year was really successful. We hired all the people that we brought into that program and they are still here.

What initiatives are you most excited about?

Some of them are just what I’ll call BAU initiatives—business as usual initiatives which is important to infuse this mindset within everything we do. So for example the way that we interview people is very deliberate. It’s focused on eliminating as much bias out of the system as possible and it’s not an easy thing. It is very structured. It was required that everyone learn how to do it.

With racial and ethnic diversity we’re focusing on where we’re having an issue with people showing up in our population. For us we know it is Hispanic African American and Native American from an ethnicity standpoint. Even looking at the leadership level we’re thinking of how to expand there.

What’s the biggest misconception within HR about the talent pipeline?

People will always have options so don’t act like they don’t and get complacent. Invest in their development invest in their aspirations invest in making sure that they are connected to your company your mission and to each other. All of that is investing in your culture and that is usually the secret sauce for any company when you’re trying to create a place where people want to stay and thrive. It does not happen by accident. You’ve got to be intentional about it.

The U.S. freight business was looking a bit frightening this week. Rail labor disputes reached a fever pitch before a tentative deal was reached late Wednesday night to avert a strike. Here’s what you need to know about the news:

Unemployment debates. Two of the world’s most prominent economists can’t seem to agree on whether higher unemployment reduces inflation. One side says the unemployment rate has to hit 6% to control inflation while the other says limiting job openings will help avoid layoffs. Either way the eventual outcomes will have a significant effect on the labor market and available talent pool. —Will Daniel

Sign up for the newsletter here and follow Cash Only on Instagram and Twitter.

All photos by Zach Sokol.

Cash Only’s 420 Recs is an ongoing series where interesting folks offer recommendations for all things 420 — what strains they like what weed products are blowing their minds and what they like to do once stoned.

Mira Gonzalez rolls the best most aerodynamic blunts west of the Mississippi. On the east the award goes to Janice Griffith—Cash Only fam and unsurprisingly one of Mira’s BFFs. Her skills are so good that she could easily land one of those gigs being the personal roller for a rapper—maybe Waka Flocka Flame is still hiring?

Yes Mira is a legendary toker and she’ll tell you she has the tolerance of at least five grown men though the number could be higher. Outside of huffing Dutchies Mira is an accomplished writer poet and illustrator—with an always-funny Twitter to boot. She’s also published a poetry collection an NSFW coloring book and temporarily co-hosted a really good podcast called “Really Good Financial Advice.”

Mira and I go back to our days as editors at Merry Jane Snoop Dogg’s cannabis media brand. One of the best parts of that gig entailed me catching a ride to work with Gonzalez and us chain smoking blunts while brainstorming articles or talking shit for the whole damn cruise. We also did some great work like breaking a story on black market vape carts and how they were causing a mysterious lung illness amongst consumers as well as partnering with Pornhub on a series of videos including one in which Mira and Janice turned a fleshlight into a bong.

Mira always makes me laugh and her 420 Recommendations for Cash Only definitely scratched that itch. Below the weed lord explains how strain names are mostly fake her love of getting high and “freaking the fuck out” to weird movies and shopping for very expensive hyper-realistic babies on Etsy. Thanks Mira we love ya!

What’s your current favorite strain and how do you like to consume it?

Mira Gonzalez: Honestly one of the first things I learned when I started working in the weed space is that strains are mostly fake and so is the divide between indica and sativa lol.

For example my first job involving weed was as a budtender for a weed dispensary in Los Angeles when I was 19. When we got new weed me the one other employee and the owner would smoke a blunt together. Then the three of us would collectively decide if the weed would be labeled as indica or sativa and what that strain would be called. (Anything we gave the name “Girl Scout Cookies” or “Blue Dream” would sell extremely fast.)

All of that is just to say I don’t really have a favorite strain. I find it’s more reliable to choose my weed based on scent THC content and vibes.

My favorite way to get stoned kinda changes depending on my mood. I go through phases but lately I’ve been dabbing a lot.

When it comes to flower though my favorite way to smoke will always be blunts. Dutches are my preferred brand but tbh I’m not picky. I’ll never be too proud to smoke a Swisher if that’s what’s available.

Do you have any favorite weed products right now?

Like I said I’ve been dabbing a lot. Raw Garden is probably my favorite brand for concentrates.

I also love edibles but I have the weed tolerance of like five grown men so I always want the really strong shit. In California that mainly comes in the form of pills and tinctures. Some of my favorite brands are Protab (tablets) and Proof (tinctures). For flower I love Pure Beauty.

What activity do you like to do after you’ve gotten really stoned?

I love getting really high and braiding my hair. I also like finding weird or niche Etsy shops. The other day I found a shop that just sells hyper-realistic fake babies for thousands of dollars each. The shop had a ton of five star reviews from really happy customers.

Can you recommend something to watch while really high?

Well personally I love to get high and freak the fuck out; just absolutely lose my shit. So if that sounds appealing to you here are some of my recommendations:

Eraserhead (1977)

Angst (1983)

House (1977)

Natural Born Killers (1994)

SexWorld (1978)

Can you recommend something to listen to while smoking?

Taylor Swift.

Can you recommend something to read once stoned?

Wikipedia.

Who’s in your dream blunt rotation?

Cornel West and Dolly Parton.

This is Paolo Confino filling in for Emma. Texas governor Greg Abbott sends a bus containing migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’s D.C. residence House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will introduce stock trade restrictions for Congress and Edward Jones managing partner Penny Pennington shares the best advice she’s received in her career.

– Career advice. “Every day do something that terrifies you.”

Those words come from Edward Jones CEO Penny Pennington who considers this the best advice she’s received in her 22-year career. Getting comfortable with new challenges “invited me to raise my own hand from time to time and to say to my sponsors and my mentors ‘I’ve never been at that table before but I’ve got something to say'” she tells Fortune’s Susie Gharib in a wide-ranging interview about how she built her career and Edward Jones’ approach to navigating periods of volatility.

It’s an approach to self-advocacy that’s paid off for Pennington who’s one of only 44 women CEOs on the Fortune 500. (That’s a paltry 8.8% of companies headed by women.) Within finance Pennington is even more of a rarity. She’s just one of five women leading a brokerage firm with at least $1 trillion in assets under management on the Fortune 500.

It’s a representational shortcoming that’s prevalent across all leadership levels in financial services. Although women have achieved gender parity at the entry-level commanding 52% of these jobs according to a McKinsey study their representation dips to 45% as soon as they move into their first management roles. The trend only worsens as they advance up the corporate ladder so that by the time they get to the C-suite women make up only 27% of executive positions. For women of color the drop-off between entry-level and C-suite jobs is even more drastic at 80%.

“There are many women who say stocks bonds mutual funds and math—not my thing” Pennington tells Gharib. But “this industry is fundamentally about knowledge and empathy. [It’s about] helping families have possibilities…That’s when deep empathetic people of all genders say ‘That’s something I want to be a part of.'”

Hiring more women is a priority at Edward Jones she says where only 22% of financial advisors are women. The company is targeting 30% by 2025.

“We need more women in financial services because we need a woman’s perspective on how women are living today and what they’re concerned about. We need it as financial advisors and as senior decision-makers to make the best decision about the guidance we share with our clients and the products and services we want to build” Pennington explains.

Though Pennington who was appointed CEO in January 2019 hasn’t indicated she is considering stepping down from the firm she is reflecting on her legacy. “I want to be a purpose-driven human-centered courageous leader that helps foster the conditions where people’s minds are blown about the lives they get to have” she says.

Adobe thinks so,"Good morning

Adobe is taking a big digital leap with a hefty price tag.

The tech giant has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Figma a web-first collaborative design platform—and an Adobe competitor—for approximately $20 billion.

Figma founded in 2012 is a design application tool you can use to create websites apps or even logos. It also allows real-time sharing on the same file which users can open in their browers. In Adobe Photoshop for example in order for designers to share their work they’d have to send the image file through email. And collaborators can’t work in the file at the same time. With Figma Adobe will be able to tap into collaboration tools which has become a standard in the current remote and hybrid work environments.

“When we think about the future of what’s happening with creativity and in a sense what’s going to happen as it relates to multiple people engaging in that with respect to collaboration we just believe that this is going to be an incredible value and a way to attract a whole bunch of new customers to the combined platform” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday.

The transaction which is the company’s largest acquisition is expected to close in 2023 pending regulatory approvals Adobe CFO Dan Durn said. The $20 billion would be paid in cash and stock “and if necessary a term loan to be paid down from our operating cash flows following the closing” he said.

The company announced about 6 million additional restricted stock units would be granted to Figma’s CEO and employees that will vest over four years after closing. According to Cruchbase to date Figma has raised $333 million in venture funding and in its last funding round in June 2021 secured a $10 billion valuation. So the deal would be a huge financial gain for the startup.

However following Adobe’s announcement its shares dropped about 17%. And there was some skepticism from analysts during the earnings call. “Shantanu everyone’s admired your ability to stay disciplined on M&A over the last decade and I guess many are kind of feeling like you broke the mold on this” Brent Thill of Jefferies said to Narayen. “So what was it that was so special?”

“We do believe that it will be value generating for the Adobe shareholders” Narayen said.

Adobe’s businesses include Creative Cloud (software for design) Experience Cloud (the interface between a company and its customers on the digital channel) and Document Cloud (PDFs digital documents). Figma’s technology platform will “accelerate our R&D roadmap including the delivery of our Creative Cloud technologies on the web which will allow Adobe to focus and manage our future R&D investments” Durn said on the call.

Figma’s products “address a $16.5 billion market opportunity” and this year they’re expected to add $200 million in net new ARR [annual recurring revenue] surpassing $400 million in total ARR by the end of the year” Durn said. The acquisition is “primarily about creating new markets expanding adjacent opportunities and accelerating growth” he said. “In years one and two after the closing the transaction will be dilutive to Adobe’s Non-GAAP EPS and we expect it to break even in year three and accretive at the end of year three” Durn said.

“Three years to break even sounds like there are some conservative assumptions built in especially because Figma is generating cash” Kash Rangan a Goldman Sachs analyst said on the call.

“This deal’s about growth is about positioning the company to define new categories and drive growth for decades to come” Durn responded. “Starting in year two post close you will see our EPS growth rate faster than our overall revenue growth will be accretive exiting year three.”

Some designers who use Figma took to Twitter to express skepticism about the deal. One designer tweeted: “Figma could’ve built tools to compete—and win—with every Adobe product in the suite. They could’ve pushed a renaissance in design tools that would’ve lasted a generation. So much potential gone.”

Figma CEO Dylan Field explained in a Twitter thread how the partnership with Adobe will work: “We will have the opportunity to incorporate Adobe’s expertise in imaging photography illustration video 3D and font technology to the Figma platform.” Dylan will continue to serve as CEO reporting to David Wadhwani president of digital media at Adobe. Figma currently has no plan to change its pricing Field said.

In its latest quarterly results also announced on Thursday Adobe reported net income of $1.14 billion on revenue of $4.43 billion. This reflects an increase of 13% year-over-year. Regarding the Figma acquisition an analyst questioned whether it would have meaningful impact for the future.

“It’s not unprecedented for Adobe to purchase a dynamic competitor” Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities said on the call. “We can go back many years you’ve done this before. Maybe put this in the context of some of those prior acquisitions where you bought a competitor that had meaningful either competitive impact or complementary technology.”

“It’s all about ‘How do you take things that might seem competitive but are actually more complimentary and expand the nature of the market?'” Narayen said in response. “For me when I think about what we did with Macromedia it was really about saying ‘We’re going to target more graphics professionals and not just focus on imaging. We’re going to focus on what’s happening with video on the web or gaming. And so I think it was an expansive part of how we looked at it. And that’s the same situation here.”

Narayen also said “I think the opportunities are tremendous. I understand that there will be some sentiment associated with the price and the ball’s in our court to go demonstrate how we execute against our current initiatives as well as to demonstrate the value of this new one.”

Have a good weekend. Take care.

The State of Digital Trust 2022 a new report from ISACA a professional association focused on IT governance finds gaps in digital trust between companies and customers. While 98% of IT professionals said digital trust is important the report found that just 12% of their organizations have a dedicated staff role for digital trust. Seventy-six percent of respondents said digital trust is essential to digital transformation and 82% said digital trust would be even more important in five years; but just 29% offer staff digital trust training. ""In everything an organization does the end goal must be answering the question ‘What can we do today to better earn the trust of our customers?’"" Matt Chiodi chief trust officer Cerby said in a statement. ""Those organizations that continually ask this question and make executing on the answers a priority will win in the future—win in market share profitability and engagement with employees and customers."" The report findings are based on a survey of 2755 international business and information technology professionals.

The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform released a memo on September 14 that detailed documents and internal communications from oil companies including BP Shell and ExxonMobil which show efforts to heavily promote their investments in promising technologies to address climate change such as algae biofuels and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) while internally expressing doubt about the viability and immediacy of those investments.

“Today our Committee is releasing new documents from our investigation that shed light on how the fossil fuel industry misled the public about their climate goals their actions and their investments” Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) said at the Committee’s hearing on September 15. “The documents show that both Exxon and Chevron fought hard to avoid making any real commitments to advocate for the policies they claim to support.”

Technologies That Are “Still Decades Away”

The oil majors routinely spend heavily on advertising climate solutions that many scientists environmental groups and other experts have long questioned. As DeSmog has reported over the years many industry climate claims have been criticized as exercises in greenwashing covering up for business as usual.

But the congressional documents also point to skepticism from within the oil companies themselves highlighting the gap between their public and private statements.

“be cagey about project specifics” Shell official advising a colleague on carbon capture talking points in 2019

ExxonMobil has spent $68 million in advertising on its algae-based liquid fuels. In a September 2018 draft presentation for investors ExxonMobil struck an optimistic tone on its algae fuels but notes accompanying the presentation obtained by the House committee state that the technology is “still decades away from the scale we need.”

In addition in preparation of an advertising campaign on algae a public affairs manager at ExxonMobil expressed concern in an April 2016 email about the phrase “abundant algae” cautioning that “even though they are abundant it will take a ton of them to make biofuels so that might create some angst with the research folks who knows that.” Last year the Wall Street Journal looked at ExxonMobil’s claims on algae and found doubts from external scientists that the technology is viable.

From production to combustion here are a few reasons algae biofuel could be such a promising energy resource. pic.twitter.com/cjtFJygZh8 — ExxonMobil (@exxonmobil) September 27 2019 One of ExxonMobil’s ads featuring algae-based biofuels.

Another tranche of documents show that the oil industry privately harbors doubt about carbon capture and sequestration even as it positions the technology as a key climate solution.

For example draft advertisements prepared by PR firm BBDO for ExxonMobil to use in New Jersey describe “carbon capture at mass scale” as one of “the technologies being developed right here in Jersey at ExxonMobil’s Research and Engineering facilities.” But private communications from BBDO show that after meeting with Exxon staff to discuss the ad BBDO noted that it would “replace any lines that imply the technology is live today.”

In another example from October 2019 in advance of an event held in Washington D.C. one Shell official advised another to “be cagey about project specifics” related to carbon capture.

Many carbon capture projects to date trap very little carbon pollution and are riddled with technical and economic obstacles. A September 2022 report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that many carbon capture projects have failed and the successful ones typically funnel captured CO2 back into oil and gas projects to boost production.

To the extent that carbon capture works oil companies view the technology as a way to continue producing more oil and gas well into an increasingly climate-constrained future. An internal document from BP obtained by the congressional investigation states that carbon capture is a way to “enable the full use of fossil fuels across the energy transition and beyond.”

“What these documents are is an insight into how these technologies are viewed inside the companies” Kathy Mulvey accountability campaign director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists told DeSmog. She pointed to the internal tension at ExxonMobil about its algae messaging which she said shows that they are “aware of potential liabilities with these claims.”

Net Zero Scenario Has “Nothing to Do with Our Business Plans”

The documents also suggest there is little movement among the oil majors to actually transition away from fossil fuels.

The oil majors have played a double game with the Paris Climate Agreement. For example in July 2021 ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods stated: “We understand the tremendous challenge represented by climate change and have fully supported the Paris Agreement since its inception.”

But documents also show that ExxonMobil and Chevron attempted to water down messaging related to the international accord. In a memo to Woods from 2019 Exxon’s Manager of Environmental Policy & Planning Peter Trelenberg raised concerns about the messaging for a document to be put out by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative a voluntary industry-led group that promotes climate solutions of which Exxon and Chevron are members.

Trelenberg wrote: “Need to remove reference to Paris Agreement as support for the Paris Agreement goals and member company advocacy are separate concepts and not directly related. Creating a tie between our advocacy/engagements and the Paris Agreement could create a potential commitment to advocate on the Paris Agreement goals.”

In other words Exxon stated clearly in public that it supported the Paris climate agreement “since its inception” but also sought to avoid having the agreement tie its hands.

Shell’s target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 in step with society.



It covers emissions from our own operations and from the end use of all energy products we sell. Read more: https://t.co/kvdr1tleZi #PoweringProgress #netzero — Shell (@Shell) February 11 2021

Shell executives also have parsed language carefully to avoid getting pinned down. Internal communications from October 2019 show Shell managers discussing how to talk publicly about the company’s “Sky scenario” a scenario that mapped out how the world could reach “net zero” emissions and that received in-depth media attention when revealed in 2018. One Shell manager reminded her colleague that the company’s net-zero scenario is “not a Shell business plan but a technically possible although challenging scenario for how global society might meet the goals of the Paris agreement.”

In 2018 Shell did print a disclaimer noting that the Sky scenario was not its business plan but a flurry of emails obtained by the House committee show employees repeatedly reminding each other that the net zero plan is not for the company to pursue.

“What was interesting to me was how careful they had to be in prepping their own executives and spokespeople on that. Because one could easily read those scenarios as being a business scenario” Mulvey said referring to Shell’s communications. “It’s almost like the people inside the company themselves could make the same mistake that they want all of us to make when we hear these claims.”

“The other pattern to notice is where we DO own high GHG intensive things it’s in areas where they aren’t that politically sensitive about such matters: China Singapore Malaysia Louisiana….” Steve Lesher Shell’s U.S. West Coast Manager of Government Relations

Meanwhile Shell’s communications also show that the company aims to shed carbon-intensive assets in jurisdictions where it is feeling public pressure or new climate policies but it has little plans to change its ways in what it views as more permissive states or countries.

“No one in the company has said this mind you but the pattern is pretty clear: If you’re a major greenhouse gas emitter and particularly if you operate in a GHG-sensitive area like CA WA or CAN your days in the Shell Family are probably numbered” Steve Lesher Shell’s U.S. West Coast Manager of Government Relations wrote in an email in May 2021 to lobbying firm McHugh Koepke & Associates.

“The other pattern to notice is where we DO own high GHG intensive things it’s in areas where they aren’t that politically sensitive about such matters: China Singapore Malaysia Louisiana….” he wrote.

Activists in Louisiana took exception with those statements. “If industry doesn’t see the efforts of frontline fighters in these communities it’s because they don’t want to. It’s because they are in the pockets of our elected officials and they don’t care about the communities they invade” Roishetta Ozane organizing director for Healthy Gulf a New Orleans-based climate justice organization told DeSmog in an email. Ozane testified at the congressional hearing on September 15.

“They don’t care that folks are dying and that we are continuously impacted by devastating natural disasters caused by climate change of which they contribute to when they constantly extract fossil fuels” she said. “Enough is enough and if industry wants to see push back tell them to come to Southwest Louisiana and find me fighting on the frontlines.”

Indeed communities opposing polluting industries along the Gulf Coast scored a major victory on the same day as the congressional hearing. The massive Formosa petrochemical facility slated for St. James Parish was shot down by a district court after years of opposition from local communities. “Stopping Formosa Plastics has been a fight for our lives and today David has toppled Goliath” Sharon Lavigne founder and president of RISE St. James said in a statement.

Oil Industry “Continuing to Mislead the Public”

The documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee show that the oil industry’s attempts to mislead the public did not end with overt climate science denial several years ago.

“The recency of it definitely underlines that although this is a decades-long concerted campaign to deceive the public and to block action it continues. And it continues to evolve” Mulvey said.

In addition the documents still don’t tell the entire story. The committee said that the oil companies refused to testify failed to meet a subpoena deadline and “continued to withhold documents at the heart of this investigation.” They also turned over hundreds of thousands of pages of “news clippings and other ancillary materials” in an apparent attempt to drown congressional staff in piles of unrelated documents to stymy the investigation.

The stonewalling combined with the snippets of apparent deception that are contained within the documents “makes it seem like they have a lot to hide. And they’re afraid of the truth coming out. And that they’re afraid of the public and policymakers being able to see through the PR smoke screen that they’re trying to create” Mulvey said. “It points to ongoing justifiable scrutiny on their social license. These are companies that can’t and shouldn’t be trusted to reform themselves.”

As the oil companies themselves have revealed in their own internal communications cultivating positive public opinion of their business practices remains a top concern. In January 2020 a Shell government relations employee sent a company slide deck intended to help those “just learning our narrative” that identified “maintaining a strong societal licence to operate” as one of the company’s three strategic ambitions. It also cautioned that its communications about the energy transition could open up the oil major to additional climate litigation: “what we are saying has the potential to either expose or insulate Shell to/from the legitimacy of further claims—from greenwashing to misleading investors.”

In a statement to DeSmog a BP spokesperson said: “bp’s commitment to the energy transition is clear. We have set near term targets that are consistent with our ambition to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero. We provided hundreds of thousands of pages of documents to the committee. Some of the emails referenced contain inartful attempts at humor that do not reflect the values of bp and should not distract from our actions.”

ExxonMobil Shell and the PR firm BBDO did not respond to questions from DeSmog.

It’s not clear what happens next. If the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections they will presumably quash the investigation. But having the documents out in the public domain is nevertheless useful.

“This evidence is highly relevant to ongoing litigation to hold the Big Oil companies accountable for climate damages and deception. So whatever evidence can get into the public domain seems to me could inform existing and potential future litigation” Mulvey said.

Members of Congress meanwhile offered the industry a warning.

“Let me tell these companies something. The American people are not dumb” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) said at the hearing. “They are walking a very fine line by continuing to mislead the public.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2JwLWFwcGVhcnMtc29saWQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1iZXQtMTY0MDA0MjY4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BP Appears to be a Solid Investment Bet Right Now: Here's Why,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='sg.news.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /finance/news/bp-appears-solid-investment-bet-164004268.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395122F520>, 'Connection to sg.news.yahoo.com timed out.

Driving the news: This week's Consumer Price Index report showed costs for electricity in the U.S. climbed at their fastest rate in 40 years.

In August average electricity prices were nearly 16% higher than they were in August 2021.

Why it matters: Like high gasoline prices escalating electricity costs act as a tax on consumer spending potentially slowing the economy.

On a more personal level it’s a hardship for many families. Over 20 million U.S. households have fallen behind on their utility bills as Bloomberg recently reported.

Those delinquencies and the end of pandemic-related moratoriums on utilities cutting service sets the stage for a “tsunami of shutoffs” one observer told Bloomberg.

The big picture: Surging American electricity costs are a distant but direct consequence of the Russian war on Ukraine which created arguably the biggest shock to the global energy system since the oil crisis of the 1970s.

How it works: Prior to the war Russia was the main supplier of Europe's imported energy in the form of oil natural gas and coal.

Since the invasion sanctions and embargoes disrupted those supplies. (Russia just cut off all natural gas flows to Germany via its Nordstream 1 pipeline under the Baltic sea for instance.)

European prices for these products exploded higher as a result.

Those high prices attracted imports from around the world — including from the U.S. via stateside export terminals that liquefy the gas for overseas shipping.

To compete with high European prices U.S. natural gas prices have risen too — though not as much. The U.S. benchmark for wholesale natural gas is up about 70% over the last 12 months while the European benchmark has skyrocketed by roughly 240%.

Since natural gas is the source of about 40% of U.S. electricity generation those higher prices feed through to higher monthly bills.

Yes but: America's system of regulated utilities which forces some power providers to get regulators' clearance for price increases means Americans are being spared the full impact of the gas price spike.

It's cold comfort — but at least electricity bills aren't up 70% as natural gas prices are.

Photo / Sharni Dysart

A Waihi wedding photographer is accused of breaking the hearts of newlyweds by failing for many months to hand over some or all of several couples' wedding pictures.

When Grace thinks back to her wedding in April this year it isn't her vows dress or seeing her husband at the altar that initially comes to mind.

She thinks of the photographer she hired Sharni Dysart.

Earlier this month Grace told the Herald on Sunday she and her husband were yet to receive any images from Dysart who also goes by the last name Measures online.

""It's affected me in quite a big way. I know it's just wedding photos but I've had sleepless nights I've been so stressed about it. Whenever people ask me when are we gonna see your wedding photos I usually break down in tears.""

Even on her wedding day Grace said things did not run smoothly. She said Dysart failed to turn up claiming she was a close contact of someone with Covid and hired a freelancer to cover their wedding instead.

Although she wasn't shooting the wedding Grace said Dysart was still in charge of editing the images and sending them to the couple.

Grace who lives in Auckland and only wants to share her middle name told the Herald on Sunday the freelance photographer who shot the wedding informed her it shouldn't take more than three or four weeks for Dysart to finish the photos.

But as the months ticked by the pictures didn't eventuate.

""It feels awful to be honest. I just really want my wedding photos. You only get married one time and I'm just really scared I'm never going to get them back.

""It's our special day and she's kind of taken that from us and it's not really about the money for me. I just want the memories.""

Grace is now one of the dozens of members or former members of a Facebook group of spurned newlyweds left in the lurch by Dysart.

Nearly two weeks after the Herald first approached Dysart for comment Grace received her images.

Although she is relieved and happy Grace still feels like their special day was taken away from them.

""I really don't think it's kind of acceptable. It was really unfair on myself and others because well for myself I went through six months of stress thinking I might not get them. Pretty much every unanswered message made me so so anxious and I think I don't know if I hadn't gone to the media if I would have got them.""

Dysart said issues raised by the Herald were being addressed through the ""proper channels"" if they had not been already.

She said her legal and health advice was not to engage in sources of stress so she would not comment further.

Georgia Smith and her partner Isaac Smith married in September last year and while she has the images now she said they're still waiting for prints from Dysart.

In their contract Smith said it stated they would start getting access to some photos to look over within a few days of the wedding and would get to see the photos no later than 12 weeks after the wedding.

But as the weeks passed she said the pictures did not arrive.

""It got to about week eight and she had posted some of my wedding photos to her Instagram.

""When people were asking for my wedding photos the only thing I had to show were these screenshots of her Instagram.""

At that point Smith who works in healthcare in South Waikato said Dysart had still not sent her any images and was ignoring her messages.

""I was emailing her I was sending her text messages Instagram Facebook like everything and she wasn't replying.""

It wasn't until the end of February or mid-March that Smith said she got any images from Dysart. Nearly a year on from her special day she said she's still waiting for the prints.

""I didn't realise how many people she had done this to. And yeah I just want my photos I want nothing more than for everyone else to get their photos or some form of justice. Because it's not fair.""

Xavia Connolly was in a similar boat.

At the Otorohanga teacher's wedding day on December 20 Connolly said Dysart arrived late and was ""very casual"".

When the event wrapped up she alleges Dysart told her she would send through about 10 photos as a ""sneak peek"" in the next few days.

But like the others she said her images also did not arrive on time and by January 10 she emailed Dysart to inquire about where her ""sneak peek"" photos were.

Near the end of January she got a copy of the 10 preview shots and in March she received some more back. But she was still waiting for the remaining images when the Herald on Sunday first spoke to her.

""We don't even have a photo of our actual wedding ceremony. Like we don't we don't even have a photo of me walking down the aisle or us standing. We don't have those"" she said earlier this month.

""It's not just the photos it's not just the money it's the moments of our life aren't captured any more.""

Like Grace Xavia received the images from Dysart this week.

""The fact that we have our photos back is surreal in two ways: one that we have actually got them back; and two that she seemingly only got them back to us because she caught wind that her misdealings were finally catching up with her.""

A spokesperson for Consumer NZ said a photographers' clients are covered under the Consumer Guarantees Act (CGA) which requires the provider to undertake their service with reasonable care and skill and within a reasonable time.

They argued that taking up to a year to hand over images or not handing over the photos as expected breached the consumer's rights under the CGA.

Dianne Lewis a law student from Tauranga decided to take Dysart to the Disputes Tribunal earlier this year after waiting many months to get the photos from her wedding.

She said an adjudicator ruled in Lewis' favour that Dysart had breached their contract and she was ordered to pay $1400.

This Lewis said was the cost they had to pay to the other photographer who had covered her December wedding day after Dysart claimed she hadn't had her second Covid-19 jab in order to get the images from her.

It wasn't until after the Herald on Sunday contacted Dysart this month that Lewis said the photographer finally transferred the funds.

Jenna* who doesn't want to use her real name was also taking Dysart to the Disputes Tribunal over her experience.

Two days before Jenna was due to wed in late January Dysart informed her she was a Covid close contact so she would be unable to photograph the wedding but she had again hired a fill-in who would take the images and Dysart would edit them.

Again as time passed the pictures had still not been sent and by the third month of waiting Jenna realised something was up.

Screenshots of messages from Jenna to Dysart show her messaging the photographer on several occasions across several days and Dysart not replying.

""I was feeling very anxious very nervous and possibly a little bit depressed about it as well.""

Jenna said she reached out to the photographer who was there on her wedding day asking why she couldn't give her the images from her wedding day.

""She said it's because it goes against her agreement with Sharni.""

She said the photographer advised her to try to go through the tribunal route to get the images. While her hearing was scheduled for later this month after Herald inquiries she said Dysart provided the images back on Friday.

This week she too received her images back Dysart.

""It's our wedding day. And you don't want to not have your photos back of your big day. It only happens once.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

With Chase Elliott pursuing him relentlessly for the final 50 laps Chris Buescher held on to win Saturday’s Bass Pro Shops Night Race at Bristol Motors Speedway becoming the 19th different NASCAR Cup Series winner this season.

After the event that set the field for the Round of 12 in the series Playoffs—and eliminated superstars Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick from the postseason—a dozen drivers were breathing sighs of relief and hoping fervently for a return to stock car sanity in the next round.

A two-tire pit stop under caution on Lap 438 of 500 put Reddick in the lead for a restart on Lap 444. The driver of the No. 17 Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing Ford led the final 61 laps and a race-high 169 overall to give the RFK organization its first victory since Ricky Stenhouse Jr. took the checkered flag at Daytona on July 1 2017 at Daytona.

The victory was the first for RFK Racing since Brad Keselowski joined the organization as an owner/driver after the 2021 season.

Buescher was the third straight non-Playoff driver to win a race in the Round of 16 an unprecedented occurrence.

“It’s so special here” said Buescher whose only other Cup win came in a rain-shortened race at Pocono in 2016. “I love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here. It’s so special. It’s pretty awesome.”

Buescher said he wasn’t worried about starting the final run on two fresh tires even though everyone chasing had four.

“I wasn’t a bit” he asserted. “It was up to me at that point. I made it work and we had a really fast (car). We knew we had a really fast race car in practice and didn’t quite get the job done in qualifying (20th)—but what a race car.

“I don’t know what all to say right now. I’m out of breath. This place will wear you flat-out and I love that about it. It’s just a special night.”

Elliott was .458 seconds behind Buescher at the finish. William Byron came home third followed by Christopher Bell who posted his third straight top-five finish in the Round of 16. Kyle Larson was fifth and Ross Chastain sixth as all five drivers immediately behind Buescher in the finishing order advanced to the Round of 12.

Denny Hamlin Chase Briscoe Daniel Suarez Joey Logano Ryan Blaney and Alex Bowman also clinched spots in the next round though all had serious issues during the race.

Elliott got closer to Buescher on the final two laps but ran out of time.

“I felt like we were gaining but it was… I wasn’t close enough to do anything with him” Elliott said. “But I appreciate the effort. We had a long day yesterday. Was able to battle back from a bad qualifying effort (23rd) to get a top two so proud of that.

“Glad to be moving on (in the Playoff) and looking forward to some more opportunities here these coming weeks.”

Needing a victory to advance to the next round Harvick ran consistently in the top five after staying out at the end of Stage 1 to gain track position. But Harvick’s chances evaporated in the pits on Lap 438 when his crew failed to secure the left-rear on his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford.

As the tire rolled away Harvick had to back up into his pit stall. The lost time left him 10th for the final restart on Lap 444. That’s where he finished exiting the Playoffs in 16th place.

“It was pretty tough” Harvick said. “We pitted in front of the 17 (Buescher) so just kind of the way the year has gone. Just went from having a chance to lead the parade to being a part of the parade. Just difficult to pass.”

Busch’s ouster was a touch-and-go affair. Both he and Tyler Reddick fell two points short after Austin Cindric who finished seven laps down in 20th place but gained enough positions by passing back markers to advance.

Busch had accumulated 14 points in the first two stages and was running above the cut line when his engine blew on Lap 270—Busch’s second such failure in the three Playoff races.

“It just goes with our year” Busch said. “I don’t even know what to say. I’m flabbergasted. I just feel so bad for my guys. They don’t deserve to be in this spot. They work too hard. We are too good of a group to be this low—down on the bottom fighting for our lives just to make it through. Two engine failures in three weeks that will do it to you.”

Reddick and Richard Childress Racing teammate Austin Dillon both failed to make the Round of 12 after both drivers’ Chevrolets were damaged in a 12-car pileup on the backstretch on Lap 277. Reddick finished 25th and Dillon 31st.

Keselowski led 109 laps and appeared to have race-winning chances until his right-front tire went flat on Lap 414 while he was leading.

“We had two cars that were really good today and one that was unlucky and one that executed and everything came the right way for them” Keselowski said.

It took a two-tire pit stop with about 60 laps left to go at Bristol Motor Speedway to get clean air for the No. 17 RFK Racing driver.

Buescher who led 169 laps became the 19th driver to win in 2022 tying the Modern Era record.

“This is just so special this team does such a great job” Buescher told NBC Sports after the race. “Just so special here at Bristol. I love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here so special to me. Lost one that had really broke our heart back in 2015 on the Xfinity [Series] side with [Scott] Graves on top of the box so this makes up for that.”

When asked whether he was worried about the two-tire call on the last pit stop Buescher replied “Not one bit. It was up to me at that point. Just hold on and make it work. We had a really fast Fastenal Mustang. Just so proud of everybody. We knew we had a good racecar after practice and didn’t quite get the job done in qualifying. But what a racecar. It’s special. To get RFK in victory lane for the first time. We had great racecars Brad [Keselowski] had really good speed too.”

Tyler Reddick Kyle Busch Austin Dillon and Kevin Harvick ended up below the cut line after the race.

Chase Elliott placed second while his Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron was third. Christopher Bell was fourth after leading 143 circuits and Kyle Larson rounded out the top five.

Ross Chastain AJ Allmendinger Cole Custer Denny Hamlin and Harvick took positions six through 10 respectively.

Multiple cars including several playoff contenders encountered issues throughout the night.

It started with the Fords as several incurred flat right-front tires in stage one. First Harrison Burton and JJ Yeley had flats while Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney suffered down right-front tires later on.

Blaney’s issues continued throughout the early portion of the race which included a tire coming off on pit road and he eventually went behind the wall for repairs on the rear end of the car. He came back out on the track on lap 266.

All these problems brought the caution out several times allowing for differing pit strategies. The RFK Racing duo of Keselowski and Buescher were among those who had stayed out and the clean air helped them stay up front. Keselowski ended up winning stage one.

Buescher stayed out as did many others and held off advances from Harvick to maintain the lead through about lap 237.

During this period four Toyotas and one Chevrolet Alex Bowman reported power steering problems including both 23XI Racing drivers Bubba Wallace and Ty Gibbs. The pair’s pit crews worked on the cars behind the wall and sent them back out late in the race (lap 290 for Wallace; lap 317 for Gibbs).

A couple of Joe Gibbs Racing teammates also had troubles: Martin Truex Jr and Hamlin. Truex’s powersteering gave out as it blew the seals out. Hamlin had a right-front tire go down around lap 235 which also brought out the caution. He was able to continue.

A third JGR driver Bell inherited the lead when Buescher pit on lap 237 going on to win stage two.

Bell ended up leading the next 100 laps while the fourth JGR Toyota of Busch had an engine failure around lap 270. This once again brought out the yellow flag.

Then shortly after the next restart the Bristol big one occurred when Daniel Suarez got loose and tagged the No. 47 of Ricky Stenhouse Jr. As cars stacked up several got into each other including Richard Childress Racing’s Reddick and Dillon.

Reddick was able to get back on track but Dillon couldn’t due to a suspension problem.

Back at the front Bell was able to lead for much of the race though he lost the lead to Larson on pit road. Keselowski pulled a slide job on Larson on lap 388 to take first place.

Another playoff driver Joey Logano had a right-front flat with just over 100 laps remaining and had to pit.

Then a few laps later race leader Keselowski had his right-front tire go down forcing him to pit and allowing Bell to retake first.

On lap 425 pole-sitter Aric Almirola who had spun early on when Blaney got into the wall had a power steering problem and took his car behind the wall. About 11 laps later Bell’s right-rear tire went flat and the caution waved again.

Two more drivers in the playoff hunt had problems on pit road: Harvick and Hamlin. Harvick had a loose wheel but was able to back up without going very far and get a tire back on. However his hopes to win the race were dashed with this miscue.

The No. 11 had a bit of a different issue as some pins were damaged on the hub.

Buescher took two tires and found himself out front and in clean air. It was enough to hold on for the win becoming the third-straight non-playoff driver to win in the Round of 16.

Chris Buescher took the checkered flag at the Bass Pro Shops Night Race in Bristol Tennessee on Saturday night.

Buescher's win is just the second of his NASCAR Cup Series career. He previously won the Pennsylvania 400 as a rookie in 2016. The 29-year-old is the third straight non-playoff driver to win in the Round of 16 joining Bubba Wallace and Erik Jones.

This race was also notable for being the final leg of the first round of the playoffs with the field being cut from 16 to 12 based on the point standings after this result.

Kevin Harvick the 2014 Cup Series champion was first on the cut line coming into Bristol. He was 35 points behind Austin Cindric in the No. 12 spot. The other three drivers facing elimination—Kyle Busch Austin Dillon and Chase Briscoe—were all within nine points of advancing.

Briscoe put himself in a good position to make a move after qualifying in the No. 2 spot. Aric Almirola who did not make the playoff field won the pole position.

This was the best performance of Buescher's career and a banner night for RFK Racing with Brad Keselowski.

Buescher began the race from the No. 20 position and climbed all the way up to the top spot in the first stage. He wound up blowing by his previous career-high total for laps led set earlier this year.

Chase Elliott was the only driver who finished within one second of Buescher (0.458 seconds). Keselowski fell off the pace in the final stage after experiencing issues with his car. He ultimately finished 13th overall but he did get a point bump from winning the first stage.

Elliott's second-place finish and seven bonus points in stage two pushed him all the way up to first place in the playoff standings. The Hendricks Motorsports star began the day 12 points behind Christopher Bell for the top spot but he's now 15 points ahead of No. 2 Joey Logano.

Things got very close for Dillon after the second stage. He was one point behind Daniel Suárez for the 12th and final spot.

Some of the drama was gone by the final stretch of the race as Suarez wound up finishing in the 19th spot and Dillon was No. 31 in the standings.

Briscoe was the only driver on the brink of elimination who was able to climb out of the bottom four. He racked up 15 points in the two stages and finished 14th in the race. The 27-year-old moved up to ninth overall in the point standings.

Tyler Reddick fell from the 11th spot in the playoff standings to No. 13 and missing the cut after another rough outing. He finished 25th in Bristol coming on the heels of a 35th-place finish at Kansas last week.",,,,,,

Rental activities are per se passive.3 Passive activity loss (“PAL”) rules limit the ability to offset net losses from passive activities (like rental income) against other nonpassive sources of income (like wages). PALs may be deducted only to the extent of a taxpayer's passive activity income. The remainder is carried forward to be used when the passive activities generate a gain or upon disposal of the property or activity.4 However a real estate professional who materially participates in a real property trade or business is not subject to the PAL limitation rules and may use rental losses to offset other sources of nonpassive ordinary income.

Real Estate Professional Test

To qualify as a real estate professional a taxpayer must satisfy the following tests:5

Perform more than 50% of services in real property trades or businesses (“50% test”) and Perform more than 750 hours of service in real property trades or businesses (“750 hours test”) and Materially participate in each rental activity (“material participation test”).

A real property trade or business is broadly defined to include real property development re-development construction re-construction acquisition rental operation management leasing or brokerage trade or business.6

The IRS requires detailed records to support the hours worked in real estate compared to those worked in other business. The extent of an individual’s participation in an activity may be established by any reasonable means. Contemporaneous daily time reports logs or similar documents are not required if the extent of such participation may be established by other reasonable means. Reasonable means for purposes of this paragraph may include but are not limited to the identification of services performed over a period of time and the approximate number of hours spent performing such services during such period based on appointment books calendars or narrative summaries.7 Post-event ""ballpark guesstimates"" or unverified undocumented testimony may be insufficient.8

The 50% test and 750 hours tests must be met by one spouse alone. However all real property trade or business activity is included under the 750 hours test regardless of whether an election has been made to aggregate the properties into one real property trade or business9.

Material participation is determined separately for each rental property unless the taxpayer elects to treat all interests as a single rental real estate activity. As a general rule the election is binding until revoked and covers future purchases10.

To be considered a “material participant” a taxpayer must satisfy at least one of the following:11

Taxpayer works more than 500 hours in the activity. Unlike the 50% and 750 hours tests participation of both spouses is counted for material participation.12 Participation by children or employees is not counted; Taxpayer does substantially all of the work in the activity; Taxpayer works more than 100 hours in the activity and no one else works more than the taxpayer (including non-owners or employees); The activity is a significant participation activity (SPA) and the taxpayer’s total time in all SPAs exceeds 500 hours. Rental or leasing activity is not considered an SPA; Taxpayer materially participates in the activity in any five of the prior ten years; Taxpayer materially participates in a personal service activity13 for any three prior years; or Based on all facts and circumstances taxpayer participates in the activity on a regular continuous and substantial basis during such year.14

Net Investment Income Tax and Real Estate Professional Status

Another benefit of qualifying as a real estate professional is relief from the 3.8% tax on passive net investment income imposed under NIIT if:

The taxpayer meets the definition of real estate professional test as described above and rental income is derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business and the rental activity is not a passive activity under existing law.

If the real estate professional participates more than 500 hours in the current taxable year (or more than 500 hours per year in any five of the previous ten years whether or not consecutive) a safe harbor rule deems rental income associated with the activity to be derived in the ordinary course of business.15

Recent Cases

IRS scrutiny over who qualifies as a real estate professional is a constant. Recent court decisions serve as a strong reminder of the substantiation required to qualify as a real estate professional.

In Sezonov v. Commissioner T.C. Memo 2022-40 husband and wife HVAC business owners who owned rental properties and claimed they qualified as real estate professionals were denied passive activity loss deductions under IRC Sec. 469(c)(7). Mrs. Sezonov was responsible for most of the day-to-day management of the rental properties including advertising the properties communicating with renters and prospective renters via email and preparing the properties for the next rental. In addition to his full-time position in the HVAC business Mr. Sezonov assisted in responding to emails and performed maintenance and repairs for the properties.

Taxpayers provided logs to support time spent on the rental activities. These logs were not contemporaneous and the hours were estimated based on rental agreements and emails. The logs were unclear as to who worked which hours. The Court determined that the estimated hours for Mrs. Sezonov fell short of the 750 hours test for real estate professionals. In addition Mr. Sezonov failed to establish that he spent more time working in the real estate rental business than in his HVAC business. Accordingly the rental activities were passive activities subject to the loss limitation rules under IRC Sec. 469.

Similarly in Hakkak v. Commissioner T.C. Memo 2020-46 a taxpayer who practiced law and also held ownership interest in LLCs that held rental real estate failed to establish that he qualified as a real estate professional when he failed to satisfy both the 50% test and 750 hours test. To demonstrate that Mr. Hakkak handled day-to-day management of the rental real estate taxpayer provided handwritten calendars and documents such as emails lease agreements bank account and credit card statements invoices loan and insurance documents and property tax records. The Court concluded that taxpayer’s testimony at trial was vague and the handwritten calendars lacked specificity as to the services performed and the hours works on each activity. In addition the taxpayer did not provide the hours spent on his legal work an activity in which he generated significant income. Accordingly taxpayer was not considered a real estate professional under IRC Sec. 469.

Best Practices

The ability to claim passive activity loss deductions and obtain relief from the net investment income tax can result in significant tax savings. Therefore keeping complete and accurate records that establish real estate professional status and material participation are essential. Keeping contemporaneous records on hours worked in and outside of one’s real estate business and detailing the specific services performed in each activity is the best way to ensure compliance with these rules. While contemporaneous records are not required these cases demonstrate that taxpayers who prepare logs after the fact based on estimates often face difficulties in satisfying the necessary requirements.

Farrow & Ball the 78-year-old U.K.-based historically correct vintage paint and wallpaper company — known for its quirky tint names such as Dead Salmon Mole’s Breath and Sulking Room Pink — is opening a showroom at Bethesda Row in Maryland.

The new location will be Farrow & Ball’s second D.C.-area showroom. There is one in Friendship Heights.

Farrow & Ball has been based in Dorset England since 1946.

Farrow & Ball has a following for its handcrafted wallpapers and richly pigmented paints that are based on historic color palettes. It has worked with organizations including the National Trust to create near-exact matches of colors for restorations of historic buildings.

The company’s paints are expensive costing more than $100 per gallon.

Farrow & Ball’s other services include showroom and in-home consultancy.

The 1200-square-foot showroom at Federal Realty’s Bethesda Row will open in December.

According to home and lifestyle guide Domino the name Dead Salmon was derived from an old painter’s invoice from 1805 found in a historic hall in England.

Farrow & Ball has 63 showrooms in the U.K. Europe and North America.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHA6Ly9tLm1vdW50dmVybm9uZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL3NlcC8xNy9zY2VuZXMtbW91bnQtdmVybm9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scenes in Mount Vernon,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPConnectionPool(host='m.mountvernongazette.com', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/2022/sep/17/scenes-mount-vernon/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x0000023950BD5B10>, 'Connection to m.mountvernongazette.com timed out.

That sent FedEx shares tumbling 21% Friday and took other shipping stocks with it including UPS and DHL. FedEx’s CEO told CNBC Thursday he believed the dip in shipping volume is a sign that a global recession is coming.

Freight volume is generally a good indicator of economic activity because well someone bought all those goods being shipped on planes.

“So when we see major logistics firms like FedEx report disconcerting results it can send up alarm bells for all kinds of economic onlookers” said Adie Tomer a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

FedEx is blaming a weakening economy in Asia among other things for the decrease in shipping volume. And that’s part of it said Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter.

But he said part of it is “self-inflicted.”

Six years ago for example FedEx bought a European company called TNT Express.

And the next year it was hit by a cyberattack. That caused disruptions to service and took some recovery time.

“And anytime you have service issues customers flee to competitive networks” Hoexter said.

He also pointed out that about half of FedEx’s business comes from its Express service which is when people want a package like yesterday.

That means it can’t hold planes even if they’re not totally full.

“If volumes start to decline and now your planes are 80% full instead of 90% full or 70%? Well you still have to fly the plane” said Hoexter. “So you have the fixed cost without the revenue.”

The decrease in volume could also be related to more people shopping in person as opposed to having things shipped directly like they were at the beginning of the pandemic.

“It’s us now going to the store to buy toothpaste and not ordering it online” said Allison Poliniak-Cusic an equity analyst covering transportation and industrial technology at Wells Fargo. “So we’ve returned to a little bit more normal behavior.”

FedEx announced cost-cutting measures including reducing the frequency of its flights and closing more than 90 FedEx Office locations — all of which is unusual in the lead-up to the holidays.

The cuts indicate FedEx is anticipating the holiday season will fall short of expectations said Matthias Winkenbach a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics.

“Typically shippers at this time of the year invest into having excess capacity having rather too many than too few trucks on the road” he said.

Winkenbach said a downturn might prompt FedEx and other logistics companies to change how they approach necessary innovations.

“Think about electrification of fleets. Think about more sustainable delivery models” he said.

He wondered whether FedEx and its competitors will see a downturn as a reason to scale down those efforts — or double down on them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3doeS1mZWRleC1zdG9jay1pcy1wbHVtbWV0aW5nLXRvZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why FedEx Stock Is Plummeting Today,"Quarterly results are going to come in well below expectations.

What happened

FedEx (FDX 1.40%) withdrew its guidance for the year and warned its fiscal first quarter would come in well below expectations. The stock plunged as a result trading down as much as 25% on Friday morning.

So what

FedEx was not expected to report earnings until next week but late Thursday after markets closed the global shipping giant preannounced the results for its fiscal first quarter ending Aug. 31 and issued a grim warning about the global economy. The company said it expects to earn $3.44 per share in the quarter well below analyst expectations for $5.14 per share in earnings.

FedEx also warned it expects to earn as little as $2.65 per share in its fiscal second quarter compared to analyst expectations for $5.48 per share in earnings. The company said it was withdrawing guidance for the full year due to the uncertain economic environment.

""Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter both internationally and in the U.S. We are swiftly addressing these headwinds but given the speed at which conditions shifted first quarter results are below our expectations"" CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a statement. ""While this performance is disappointing we are aggressively accelerating cost reduction efforts and evaluating additional measures to enhance productivity reduce variable costs and implement structural cost-reduction initiatives.""

Those cost-cutting initiatives include reducing airplane flying hours cutting Sunday operations at some ground locations deferring hiring and closing more than 90 FedEx Office retail locations.

Now what

Analysts reacted with at least three downgrades and a flurry of price target reductions. While most had been expecting some demand softening due to a slowing global economy few expected the drop to be so dramatic.

FedEx historically has been a top operator but the company appears ill prepared to head into a downturn at this moment. This is also a pivotal time for Subramaniam who took over for founder and longtime CEO Fred Smith back in June.

FedEx has survived many economic cycles in the past and there is no reason to believe the company can't survive whatever lies up ahead. But given the magnitude of the miss and the uncertainty about what is coming in the months ahead investors understandably prefer to head to the sidelines right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWRleC1zdG9jay1jcmFzaGVzLWFmdGVyLWJydXRhbC1wcm9maXQtd2FybmluZy1hbWF6b24tMTAwMzUzNzgxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As FedEx stock crashes after brutal profit warning analyst points to a lurking Amazon,"FedEx has blown three tires before the peak holiday shipping season and chatter on the Street is that mighty Amazon may have played a role.

""It makes sense to see Amazon to trade off with this but there could also be a competitive element going on here too"" JPMorgan's Jack Atherton wrote in a note to clients. ""Coincidentally Amazon’s Seller conference has been ongoing for the last 2 days which focused heavily on new features for Buy with Prime as it further tries to break down Shopify’s moat. Amazon also launched free shipping software for sellers and discounted shipping rates. Amazon has piled money into its logistics capability over the past few years to the point it has excess capacity for its own needs and is hungry for more share which is being targeted through FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) and could be weighing on FedEx. I’d be buying Amazon on weakness here.""

FedEx served up a brutal earnings pre-announcement after the close of trading on Thursday sending shares crashing. The logistics giant's ticker page was the most visited on the Yahoo Finance platform in the wake of the warning underscoring the severity of the disappointment.

Rival UPS shares also fell around 7% in sympathy as investors read-through the company may issue a lackluster quarter (or pre-announcement) in October.

Here's a rundown of the egg FedEx served up to investors — which runs very counter to the optimism pitched by the company's executives at a closely watched investor day in June.

FedEx's first fiscal quarter fell quite flat.

Non-GAAP earnings: $3.44

Wall Street estimates: $5.14

The current quarter looks to have started weak too.

Non-GAAP earnings guidance: $2.75

Wall Street estimates: $5.48

It's also worth noting...

The company withdrew its full fiscal year outlook.

Key aspects of the FedEx profit whiff:

Significant weakness in Asia and Europe.

Costs are too high given slowing economic growth globally.

Execs were just too optimistic.

Here's what new FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam had to say:

“Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter both internationally and in the U.S. We are swiftly addressing these headwinds but given the speed at which conditions shifted first quarter results are below our expectations. While this performance is disappointing we are aggressively accelerating cost reduction efforts and evaluating additional measures to enhance productivity reduce variable costs and implement structural cost-reduction initiatives. These efforts are aligned with the strategy we outlined in June and I remain confident in achieving our fiscal year 2025 financial targets.”

Story continues

What FedEx says it's doing to stabilize its giant ship:

""Reduction in flight frequencies and temporarily parking aircraft;

Volume-related reductions in labor hours and other linehaul expenses;

Consolidation of certain sort operations to drive productivity;

Reduction of Sunday operations at a number of FedEx Ground locations;

Cancellation of certain planned network capacity and other projects;

Deferral of staff hiring;

Closure of over 90 FedEx Office locations; and

Identification of five corporate office facilities to be closed with additional real estate rationalization planning under way.""

The school district said it detected unusual activity on its information technology systems over the Labor Day weekend which turned out to be an external cyber attack. LAUSD shut down all computer systems from Saturday night and checked and restarted them by Monday night before going public on the ransomware incident.

However LAUSD confirmed that classes would resume on Tuesday as the ransomware attack did not affect critical services such as transportation food and after-school programs. LAUSD also warned that it expected significant delays or modifications in many business operations.

LAUSD has a population of more than 600000 students from kindergarten to 12th grade and 26000 teachers in more than 1000 schools. The education body is the second largest school district after the New York City Public Schools having 919000 students in over 1500 schools.

Cyber attack forces LAUSD teachers and students to reset their passwords

LAUSD implemented mitigations to prevent the districtwide disruption of email computer systems and applications. Additionally the school district convened an Independent Information Technology Task Force to review various reports and network audits.

According to Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho the task force will dive deep into the recommendations and implementations of the Information Security Audit report by the Office of the Inspector General in 2021. Superintendent Carvalho also promised network updates and the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Meanwhile employees and students must reset their passwords and reauthenticate on the school district’s computer systems.

However the school district confirmed that the cyber attack did not affect employee healthcare and payroll systems or the schools’ safety and emergency mechanisms.

Nevertheless LAUSD could not confirm if the hackers exfiltrated data from the impacted information technology systems. Ransomware operators usually exfiltrate data from compromised computer systems before encrypting.

They use the stolen information to coerce their victims to pay the ransom threatening to publish sensitive information online. This double extortion tactic raises the stakes when the privacy and safety of children could be involved.

LAUSD called in the big guns and received an overwhelming response suggesting that the federal government was taking the risk seriously.

“The White House brought together the Department of Education the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to provide rapid incident response support to Los Angeles Unified building on the immediate support by local law enforcement agencies” LAUSD wrote.

Foreign cyber attack on a U.S. school district

Without mentioning the threat actor or country’s name the school district’s superintendent disclosed that the cyber attack originated from a foreign territory. Additionally he clarified that the leaked passwords found on illicit websites were unrelated to the cyber attack.

“As a point of clarification compromised email credentials reportedly found on nefarious websites were unrelated to this attack as attested by federal investigative agencies. All compromised credentials have been fully deactivated to protect network integrity” Carvalho said.

However US authorities issued a cybersecurity advisory over the Vice Society ransomware targeting educational institutions especially kindergarten through K-12. The impacts of such attacks included unauthorized access to student and employee data canceled school days and delayed exams.

According to BleepingComputer Vice Society had taken responsibility for the LAUSD cyber attack adding that it stole 500 GB of data. However the ransomware gang has not published proof or made any ransom demands.

Suspected of being a Russian ransomware gang Vice Society uses various ransomware variants including Zeppelin and Hello Kitty/Five Hands.

“This egregious cyberattack is the latest example of the pervasive threat that predatory cybercriminals pose to everyone from multinational businesses to young school children” said Darren Guccione CEO and Co-Founder at Keeper Security. “No one is safe from cybercrime and often the most vulnerable among us are the most likely to be targeted.”

Cash-strapped schools with targets on their backs hemorrhaging money from ransomware attacks

Over 50 educational entities including 24 school districts and 26 higher education institutions have suffered ransomware attacks.

According to Aaron Sandeen CEO of Cyber Security Works U.S. schools lost $3.56 billion to ransomware attacks in 2021 which also caused the permanent closure of two educational institutions. Sandeen attributed the many school cyber attacks to unpatched vulnerabilities and vulnerable third-party software.

“In this case an unpatched vulnerability led to Vice Society Ransomware infiltrating Los Angeles Unified School District’s systems” Sandeen said. “This specific scenario was covered in CSW’s 2021 Q3 ransomware report and in response created a script any organization can run to identify this vulnerability.”

“The incident has impacted 640000 students across Los Angeles 31 smaller municipalities and Los Angeles County unincorporated sections” said Josh Rickard Senior Security Automation Architect at Swimlane. “With kids returning to school this week as well as school districts’ limited cybersecurity resources school systems like LAUSD have unfortunately become easy targets for cybercriminals.”

Matthew Warner CTO and Co-Founder at Blumira noted that the threat landscape had expanded in the education sector with endpoints increasing and staff and students using personal devices to connect to schools’ networks.

“Colleges in particular have many personal devices on their network since students bring both personal laptops and mobile devices.”

Comparing LAUSD’s strong response to shutting the stable after the horse has bolted Steve Moore chief security strategist at Exabeam laid the blame squarely on educational institutions.

“Although the LA School District’s announcement includes sweeping changes it’s a shame they didn’t make them before the crisis.”",,,,,,

The robber is described as a 5-foot-3 Black female in her mid 30s. She was last seen wearing black pants a black T-shirt glasses and a black Carhartt baseball hat with a brown emblem. She was last seen exiting the bank which is located just south of 13 Mile Road on foot.

The robbery occurred just after 11 a.m.when the woman walked into the bank wearing a mask and gloves and carrying a handgun approached a teller and asked for ""all of the money."" The bank employee complied with that request and the woman left the bank on foot with an unconfirmed amount of cash.

Witnesses told police she walked east toward Washington Boulevard and North Kennedy Circle when she exited the bank.

A scam involving unauthorized Google charges is hitting bank accounts across the country including right here in Indiana.

A Martinsville woman contacted WRTV Investigates for help.

The charges are totally bogus but appear to be coming from Google and Google Play and typically there’s more than one on your credit or debit card.

Anita Caincross of Martinsville went out to dinner with a friend and when she went to pay with her debit card it would not go through.

“I checked my account and it was literally at zero” said Caincross.

She found four separate charges totaling $4065 that appeared to be from Google with names next to each charge that Caincross did not recognize like “Duncan Oti” and “Maleto Ke.”

“I was angry” Caincross said. “What the heck happened here?”

Caincross said the bogus Google purchases emptied her account which made it difficult to pay the bills.

“I had a car payment and a house payment and I’m never late on payments like that” Caincross said.

Caincross contacted Google but she says the company refused to refund her money.

So she contacted her bank Fifth Third who reversed the charges.

“I canceled the card and filed the dispute” Caincross said.

WRTV Investigates found customers from other banks across the country who’ve also been hit with bogus Google charges.

This Reddit blog shows dozens of people who experienced fraudulent Google charges.

The amounts often start small because the scammers hope you won’t notice.

""You may not think twice if you see Google so that's why you've really got to drill down and see what those charges are” said Jennifer Adamany a spokesperson for the Better Business Bureau Serving Central Indiana. “Access your Google account and see what you're subscribed to and see if something doesn't look right. You have a better chance of stopping it early on.""

The best thing you can do is to regularly check your banking statements and look for unauthorized charges even if they’re small.

“Keep an eye on it early on so you can put a stop before it gets to larger amounts” Adamany said.

Anita Caincross is sharing what happened to spread awareness about phony Google charges.

""It's important to be careful when using your debit cards online or anywhere because your information is extremely vulnerable” Caincross said. “They can wipe you out in the matter of a seconds. You have to be hyper-vigilant.”

WRTV Investigates has reached out to Google via email and phone and we are still waiting to hear back.

Fifth Third provided the following statement:

We have not seen any specific uptick related to this scam however Fifth Third takes fraud very seriously and continues to monitor trends and mitigate risks for our customers. Customers should always report any fraud as soon as possible to Fifth Third. They should also continue to be alert to scams via text and email.

There always seems to be new (and old) ways to try to scam people. People commonly get these types of fake messages purporting to be from different banks so people need to be careful regardless of where they bank. Below are some tips we provide related to scams:

Be suspicious if you get a call or text asking for personal information such as account numbers or your Social Security Number.

Be cautious if the person calling or texting has an urgent tone or if you are directed to an automated voice response asking you to validate information.

Be cautious about clicking links within text messages.

Never provide personal information over the phone or via text unless you initiated the call to a verified Fifth Third Bank phone number.

By Giles Parkinson for RenewEconomy

South Australia – already leading the world with its share of wind and solar – is poised to become the first grid of its size to operate without synchronous generation within the next few years according to a new planning document from the market operator.

South Australia leads the world with the penetration of wind and solar in its grid and has averaged more than 64% over the last 12 months.

It regularly reaches levels where wind and solar produce more than 100% of state demand – in fact it set a new record of 146% of state demand from wind only on Wednesday morning – but this excess is exported to Victoria through its transmission links.

Even when wind and solar have produced much more electricity than is needed in the state at any one time it has always had to have some synchronous generators and always gas fired generators in South Australia running to ensure some of the principal grid services can still be delivered.

This requirement was last year reduced from four generators to two generators after the installation of four synchronous condensers that are spinning machines but do not burn fuel and can deliver many of those same services as synchronous generators.

Now the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is looking to reduce that number from two to one.

Most of the time the second one is only running as a backup incase the other gas generators suddenly fails but a growing confidence in the ability of battery inverter technology to provide those services and the presence of more “fast start” generators that could quickly switch on in case of an incident means that AEMO is now thinking about reducing its minimum requirement to one synchronous generator.

The immediate impact of that is that fossil fuel’s share of overall generation in the state (including that for export) could fall from its current minimum of around 5% to just 2% because only one synchronous generator will be required.

And that in turn will further reduce curtailment of wind and solar and on the number of “directions” from AEMO for gas generators to run. That has already fallen dramatically in the last year.

It also means that with the completion of the new link to New South Wales due in 2025/26 the state will likely be able to remove the need for even a single synchronous generator when that is connected.

Christian Zuur the head of energy transition at the Clean Energy Council described it as a “remarkable” document in a LinkedIn post.

“South Australia (is) again at the forefront of the clean energy transition” Zuur wrote.

“AEMO advised that subject to some technical studies being completed they are looking to reduce the minimum requirement to just one gas generator … and are undertaking further studies to understand whether that last unit can be taken offline.

“This would be a world first as far as I am aware and is something to watch very closely in coming months.”

South Australia is a living laboratory of how to manage the transition to wind and solar and an inverter-based grid and – as Zuur says – it is remarkable to see how the engineering assessment of system needs has rapidly evolved in recent years.

The new document says that for some of the critical grid services the synchronous generators are already redundant. This includes grid forming and grid reference two qualities that can now be provided by so-called “grid forming inverters” that are deployed at two South Australian batteries – Dalrymple North and Hornsdale.

“The SA power system currently requires at least one large synchronous generator for grid formation and grid reference” the AEMO document notes.

“Results of power system analysis suggest a synchronous generator may not be required for grid reference. This means grid-following inverter based resources can ‘latch-on’ to the voltage waveform supplied by the synchronous condensers.”

It says more system tests will be required to demonstrate grid formation and grid reference in a power system the size and scale of South Australia with no synchronous generating units online and it will continue to look at the capabilities of battery inverters through its program that it is running with ARENA. There are challenges in some parts of the grid with voltage control which AEMO and the local network operator ElectraNet are looking in to and in large “ramping” events when the amount of wind and solar produced suddenly changes such as in the evening. It is satisfied that now only one rather than two units are required to handle these events but wants more work before reducing that to zero and is considering measures such as ensuring enough battery inverters are in reserve or fast start generators ready to go if needed. EU energy crisis plan: gas price renegotiation and windfall taxes Similar work is looking at the issues of frequency control and network protection but it says that it is now clear that even one synchronous generator will not be required to be on line at all times – in system normal conditionas- once the new NSW link is completed and a scheme put in place to manage a sudden loss of those links.

This of course doesn’t mean that fossil fuels are not needed and that the remaining unit will be closed. South Australia still has a way to go to build enough wind and solar – and storage – to cover the gaps to provide close to an average of 100% renewables all year around.

Small grids can to it but the fact that a gigawatt scale grid is now within touching distance of running at times with no fossil fuels and no synchronous generation is – as Zuur notes – quite remarkable.

It would have been unthinkable a decade or so ago and it should be noted that some doubters in the industry still question if it is indeed possible. And when it does happen it will remove the last quibbles about whether a state grid is truly 100% renewables or not.

The second-phase project has a solar power generating capacity of 410 MW plus 1786 MWh of battery storage. It will add this to the 345 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) and 1505 MWh of storage capacity deployed as part of the first phase now fully operational.

The solar-plus-storage complex is located in Kern County on land leased from Edwards Air Force Base and on adjacent private land. The solar portion of the second phase is seen to become operational by the end of the year while the batteries should be fully operational by the third quarter of 2023.

The secured financing consists of a USD-460-million construction and term loan facility a USD-403-million tax equity bridge facility and a USD-96-million construction and revolving letter of credit facility. The tax equity commitment comes from US Bank while BNP Paribas CoBank ING and Nomura Securities lead the construction and term financing.

""Consistent with the first phase of the Edwards Sanborn project the second phase deploys an innovate offtake structure that has been well received in the financing markets and allows us to raise the capital necessary to progress the construction of this transformative project"" commented Jim Pagano Terra-Gen's CEO.

Mortenson is providing full engineering procurement and construction (EPC) services for Phase Two while First Solar is supplying PV panels and LG Chem Samsung and BYD are delivering the batteries.

Terra-Gen noted that in the future phases of this huge project which it is currently advancing it expects to deploy more than 2000 MW of incremental solar and energy storage. Financing for these phases should be obtained from next year.

But at least one industry analyst's report indicates that Strah's resignation announced as a retirement was voluntary.

FirstEnergy disclosed after the stock market closed Thursday that Strah 58 who had been with the Akron utility for 38 years was retiring from the company immediately including as a board member. Somerhalder 66 brought into the board of directors in 2021 and who has experience as CEO at other companies was named acting CEO until a permanent replacement is hired from outside the company.

Steven Strah:'There were fundamental things that had to be corrected' after scandal

The company has been making major executive leadership and board changes in the years-long aftermath of the $61 million Larry Householder/House Bill 6 bribery scandal in which the utility admitted to playing a major role in order to receive taxpayer subsidies for two former FirstEnergy-owned nuclear plants.

Investigations into the scandal are ongoing with FirstEnergy having to pay a $230 million federal fine and sign what is called a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice.

Strah's resignation followed a management team review required in a settlement to a major shareholder lawsuit tied to the scandal. A federal regulatory filing noted that Strah will not receive severance pay or benefits. That's because Strah voluntarily retired and he instead is eligible for certain retirement benefits a FirstEnergy spokeswoman said.

Stock market reacts to FirstEnergy change

FirstEnergy shares on Friday rose even as major stock market indices were down in some cases sharply. FirstEnergy shares were up 67 cents or 1.7% to $41.08 as of 2:45 p.m. Over the past 52 weeks shares have ranged from a low of $35.32 to a high of $48.85.

Industry analysts took part in a conference call with FirstEnergy executives on Thursday over the abrupt departure of Strah and to discuss what that might mean for the utility.

""Somerhalder indicated that Strah's resignation was voluntary with the board accepting his resignation"" Morningstar utility analyst Andrew Bischof said in a note to clients. ""Strah had been CEO for less than two years and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.""

FirstEnergy's board of directors supported Strah's decision to retire FirstEnergy spokeswoman Jennifer Young said Friday.

Strah's departure followed management review

FirstEnergy will not publicly discuss the management review Young said.

""The company does not have any new information on the issues described in the deferred prosecution agreement"" she said.

Morningstar's Bischof referred to the management review in his note.

""While the company is not required to disclose the report's findings Strah was (chief financial officer) when FirstEnergy admitted it paid bribes to key legislators to pass HB 6 legislation"" he wrote.

FirstEnergy's announcement that it will fill the CEO position with someone from outside the utility ""is a smart decision and should help the company mend key regulatory relationships in Ohio"" Bischof wrote. ""We had previously thought an external candidate was needed after the termination (in October 2020) of previous CEO Chuck Jones. We think the board will act quickly to name a permanent successor.""

Strah succeeded Jones as CEO initially on an interim basis.

The Ohio Consumers' Counsel issued a statement following the Strah announcement noting it has been trying to work with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to depose Strah as part of its own investigation into FirstEnergy's activities.

“On August 4th OCC asked the PUCO to sign a subpoena so we can take the deposition testimony of Mr. Strah"" Consumers' Counsel spokesman J.P. Blackwood said. ""It’s part of our investigating of FirstEnergy and its Ohio scandals. We have yet to receive the signed subpoena we still need from the PUCO. And recently the PUCO granted a request by the U.S. Attorney to place the PUCO’s FirstEnergy investigations on hold. A legislative change is needed to give OCC its own subpoena power for investigating utilities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkdG4uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvbmZsLWNsZXZlbGFuZC9jbGV2ZWxhbmQtYnJvd25zLWdhbWUtZ3VpZGUtZmlyc3RlbmVyZ3ktYW5kLW11bmktbG90LXJ1bGVzLXRyYWZmaWMtdGlwcy_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHRuLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmZsL25mbC1jbGV2ZWxhbmQvY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy1nYW1lLWd1aWRlLWZpcnN0ZW5lcmd5LWFuZC1tdW5pLWxvdC1ydWxlcy10cmFmZmljLXRpcHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Browns game guide: FirstEnergy and muni lot rules traffic tips,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkdG4uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvbmZsLWNsZXZlbGFuZC9jbGV2ZWxhbmQtYnJvd25zLWdhbWUtZ3VpZGUtZmlyc3RlbmVyZ3ktYW5kLW11bmktbG90LXJ1bGVzLXRyYWZmaWMtdGlwcy_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHRuLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmZsL25mbC1jbGV2ZWxhbmQvY2xldmVsYW5kLWJyb3ducy1nYW1lLWd1aWRlLWZpcnN0ZW5lcmd5LWFuZC1tdW5pLWxvdC1ydWxlcy10cmFmZmljLXRpcHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FA48CA0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But with the fans in control of this decision how does the team feel about the logo?

For head coach Kevin Stefanski he said he's not an expert about field design but as a guy who has embraced the Brownie logo—often seen wearing hats and gear adorned with the elf—he seemed pretty happy with the results of the vote.

“Not my area of expertise"" Stefanski laughed. ""Great decision whoever’s decision it was.""

But most importantly the head coach said his opinion really is about the fans' reaction.

""Are the fans happy about it?"" Stefanski asked before being told it was a fan vote. ""Then I am happy about it. Sounds good.”

But special teams coordinator Mike Priefer isn't sold on Brownie's football prowess critiquing the elf's poor form while executing a stiff-arm.

“Ball security it's bad—he's not covering up the tip of the ball; that is the first thing I think of"" Priefer joked. ""His hand is back here and the tip of the ball is exposed. I can’t believe they are going to put that at the 50-yard line...he will not be our returner no.”

While Priefer gave Brownie a hard time for his technique on the field defensive end Myles Garrett has some other concerns.

""I mean we’re the dawg pound but we’ve got an elf and a helmet. I think we’re a little bit confused on what route we want to go creatively"" Garrett laughed.

The defensive end said that he would have voted for the Browns' dog logo but respects Brownie and loves that the fans are getting what they want.

""It’s original it’s unique. I’ve always been more of a fan of the dog"" Garrett said. ""But if we have something that everyone can stand behind as far as fans and we can rally behind it I’m all for it.""

Brownie the elf has a rich history with the team used in their inaugural season back in 1946 and being a part of the team through seven championships. Garrett didn't know the history of Brownie at first but once he learned that he had a change of heart and an idea.

""Seven championships with the elf?"" Garrett asked. ""If we get an eighth championship with that elf I might come in here with a little elf outfit on.""

While Browns fans may be eagerly awaiting a Super Bowl win—and now Myles Garrett dressed in an elf costume—they won't have much waiting to do when it comes to seeing Brownie at midfield. The elf will greet fans Sunday afternoon as they flood in the stadium for the Browns hope opener against the New York Jets.

Whether he fully embraces it or not Post Malone is no longer merely living like a rockstar. He is one. On Thursday night at Fiserv Forum that was ever apparent as a nearly sold out crowd screamed and sang with every move while he traversed a stage that encompassed half of the arena floor.

On just the fourth night of a 38-show tour his first since the pandemic began Malone told the crowd that he “felt like shit already.” He would also apologize repeatedly for his voice being strained and there were plastic cups with what one could assume might have been water or perhaps something harder to fight the pain at each of the six stations along the stage’s pitchfork design. Whatever was ailing him didn’t really seem to affect his vocals however and definitely did not waver the crowd from being more than enthusiastic throughout a roughly 90-minute set. Much of Malone’s material is about emotional pain in which case it would behoove him to emphasize any sort of ailment. By the end of the night though his voice would start to audibly strain getting assistance from the crowd on “Sunflower.”

Following the dramatic entrance of “Reputation” the headlining set started hot and would gradually slow down into Malone’s wheelhouse. A number of his hits including the pyrotechnics-assisted “Wow.” and “Wrapped Around Your Finger” kept the energy up in the arena at the top of the show before an divulgence into more emo material. “I Fall Apart” was the first slower track to slow the tempo down and only that would close out roughly the first third of the show. For every emotional track though there was a more pop-oriented single to follow never in danger of losing the crowd. If all else failed flames shooting from the stage or the raising and lowering light towers would create their own spectacle to keep fans invested.

While he may have been battling some vocal issues there was only one true stoppage in the hour and a half of music. A brief pause where the arena went dark didn’t hinder anything though as fans would chant Malone’s name in the darkness before re-emerging for smash “Rockstar.” The night would end on a trio of big songs with “One Right Now” “Congratulations” and “White Iverson” finishing the show. Before the closer Malone would mention that he couldn’t leave without playing his “one good song” in a sentiment that everyone inside Fiserv Forum would agree was a lie.

Opener Roddy Ricch who would normally not be relegated to that role was the first to get fans out of their seats. With fairly minimal stage production Ricch wandered about the pathways of the layout to greet fans and rifle through material from his pair of albums and TikTok-friendly singles. In about 40 minutes of music he would pick and choose his spots to get the crowd excited but also find time to have a bit more substance to what he was doing on stage. In particular 2018 track “Die Young” held more weight in the wake of the recent murder of rapper PnB Rock and was accompanied by a video screen tribute to not only rappers that were gone way too soon but also victims of police brutality. Ricch did an expert job of weaving those moments in with his more club-friendly songs culminating in breakout hit “The Box.” Ricch would also make an appearance later in the night with Post Malone for “Cooped Up” while donning tour merchandise under his many chains.

The night could ultimately be chalked up as a master class in holding the attention of a generation that has increasingly less of it. Just over two hours of music could have easily fallen off for fans that live on one-minute videos daily but Post Malone and Roddy Ricch made that timeframe breeze by captivating an audience along the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb25taWx3YXVrZWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3Bvc3QtbWFsb25lLWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bS1yZWNhcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 takeaways from Post Malone's first Milwaukee show,"You'd think a place nicknamed Brew City would've been an early and often stop for an artist with his own branded beer pong set and an album named after beer bongs – but no Thursday night actually marked emo rap/pop star Post Malone's first Milwaukee show. Would the divisive ""rockstar"" singer's long-awaited touchdown in Fiserv Forum be worth the wait and earn a ""wow""? Or were you fine passing on Posty? Here are eight takeaways from the hitmaker's maiden Milwaukee voyage.

1. It was Post Malone's debut ... not that he seemed to realize it

Throughout Thursday night's show Post Malone regularly proclaimed how happy he was to back together with the Milwaukee crowd again performing once more after two and a half long years sidelined by COVID. A nice sentiment ... but what's this ""again"" you speak of? Unless fans made their way down to Lollapalooza in recent years or took a Posty pilgrimage elsewhere Thursday night's show marked Milwaukee fans' first chance to see Post Malone live – and the crowd definitely showed up. Because while it may have been two and a half years for him for Post Malone's Brew City fans the wait's been literally forever.

2. A big stage worthy of a big name

While the singer's stage presence was generally pretty reserved throughout the evening content to shufflingly strut around in between thousands upon thousands of handshakes and impromptu fan-provided costume changes (the man is leaving Milwaukee with damn near a whole new closet) the stage itself was anything but modest.

The main stage featured a massive screen backdrop playing videos and light shows throughout the night along with three long catwalks stretching out through the ground-level pit. The catwalks themselves had about five circular hubs with giant puck-like lighting structures above them raising lowering and even tilting throughout the night with bars of glowing beams emanating down making Darth Vader-like meditation chambers of light. Later on in the night they'd add lasers shooting from their sides in mesmerizing formations. The only negative production-wise was perhaps ""Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol"" – an intriguing visual concept featuring a wide-angle camera at the bottom of the platform though Malone himself was lit too dark to see well while the camerawork on the screen was too shaky and up-close to watch there either – but even so the staging itself did a great job of creating different looks and eye-catching moments of raw moody angst throughout the night.

And that's before I ever mention all the fire! After a very subdued open with ""Reputation"" Post Malone's Fiserv Forum show exploded to life – quite literally as a sudden pop of fireworks jolted audience members into his creeping swaggery hit ""Wow."" He then held back on the pyrotechnics only to seriously unleash them near the final third of the show with a surprise roaring inferno blasting to life behind the screen for his Ozzy Osbourne collaboration ""Take What You Want"" and even more fiery excitement for – obviously – his smash hit ""rockstar.""

With all of that even if you're not the biggest fan of Post Malone's music you got a sizable show on Thursday night.

3. Post Malone was convinced he sounded bad

If you're not a fan of Post Malone he knows – and maybe agrees? Throughout Thursday's performance the singer regularly made amusingly self-effacing cracks about his music. For instance after the flirty romp ""I Like You (A Happier Song)"" early in the evening he introduced himself to the raucous Milwaukee crowd by announcing he was going to ""sing some sh*tty songs and get f*cked up with you."" He then wrapped up the night with ""my only good song"": ""White Iverson."" Judging by the crowd's screams and sing-alongs throughout the night they strongly disagreed with his self-assessment.

On top of that though Malone was apparently not feeling his best on Thursday night regularly apologizing to the crowd if he sounded not at his best – or put in his elequent prose ""if I sound like balls."" Honestly save for maybe a few songs pushing his range near the end of the night the singer sounded pretty much just like a match to his recorded material – which is a remarkable compliment to his vocal skills (or if you're not a fan the ultimate insult).

4. The star has an undeniably compelling stage presence

For a guy whose songs are the life of the party these days Post Malone wasn't much of one on stage. He started off slow and stationary with ""Reputation"" – not the most unusual opening approach for concerts these days – but even after the setlist's energy took a leap with ""Wow."" and ""I Like You"" Malone stayed fairly reserved his two on-stage moves confined to boppingly shuffling from catwalk to catwalk and high-fiving just about everyone he could. (No really by the end of the show even as the music died off he was still stretching from the stage to get what few people hadn't gotten a handshake yet.) For one of the biggest pop stars of the moment he doesn't perform big. (In fairness he did dance ... once briefly during ""One Right Now"" near the end of the night as almost an apology for his barely recognizable vocal struggles.)

And yet there's something oddly compelling about Malone on stage even if he's not the most active performer. He's certainly an earnest performer really belting and leaning into his songs to the degree that he regularly took a knee or sat down – and when he talks to the crowd about being there for them about people loving one another and about not letting anyone feel alone it rings true and sincere not just like the usual concert interaction pap.

But in addition to being oddly compelling Post Malone's stage presence is also just ... compellingly odd. Throughout the night for instance Post Malone had a number of costume changes – not planned ones offstage but just simply grabbing every item of clothing chucked blindly onto his catwalks and trying it on for a solid bit. From a nifty jacket that practically got its own ovation to approximately a dozen hats of all varieties – cowboy baseball bucket a bra I think? – there was nothing Post Malone wouldn't try on for size in between all of the handshakes. There was also his sense of humor – sure degrading and making fun of his own music but also leading into an acoustic segment of ""Circles"" by describing the song as about isosceles triangles. Who had geometry humor on their Post Malone concert bingo card?

Add in handing out shards of smashed guitar to the crowd – sharp splintery wood pieces amongst people drinking in close proximity; what could go wrong? – and even if he wasn't doing much you couldn't not watch what he was doing throughout Thursday night's show.

5. The hits are no-doubter bops

I say this as someone who isn't a major Post Malone fan: If you say you don't like any of the hip-hop pop star's tracks you're a liar. ""Wow."" is a bop with its shuffling sinister bass while ""I Like You (A Happier Song)"" and ""Sunflower"" are rare sweet charmers from the mostly lamenting pop star. (Plus the latter came attached to ""Into the Spider-Verse"" one of the best movies of the past five years so bonus points for that.) Even if you were dragged to Thursday night's show you almost certainly heard a hit across the evening's 90-minute run that got you moving and singing along with the overwhelming Fiserv Forum party.

6. A guitarist from the crowd briefly stole the show

Last night in #Milwaukee it’s #PostMalone signing Stay with some kid from the audience playing guitar. Did he do that in #chicago? @Star1055 pic.twitter.com/VyFfXswQ15 — Joe Cicero (@radiojoecicero) September 16 2022

Post Malone pulled all matter of hats jackets and more out from the crowd – but after ""Euthanasia"" near the middle of the set he outdid himself and pulled out an entire person to help him with his next song the ballad ""Stay."" Sitting down on a stool and playing the acoustic guitar so comfortably you could've thought he was a plant the talented crowd member captivated his fellow audience members – and Malone himself who took the opportunity to light a dart for the somber song and to further savor his surprise stage partner. The two then ended the number sweetly cheersing their drinks the audience member briefly snagging the mic for a bonus second to thank Post Malone for his music and for the unforgettable moment before heading off stage. With sequences like that – personable without feeling forced – it's not hard to see how Post Malone's become the people's pop star of the moment.

7. People deservedly arrived early for Roddy Ricch

Those who arrived on time at 8 p.m. or at least 15 minutes after – which seemed like most of the sellout-level Fiserv Forum crowd to their credit – were treated to an equally entertaining pre-show as opener Roddy Ricch got the audience moving early with hits like ""ROCKSTAR"" ""The Box"" and ""High Fashion."" (He also made an appearance during the main show joining Post Malone for their COVID-esque collab ""Cooped Up."")

Like the night's lead act the rapper's a fairly modest stage performer – but he too knew how to put on a show nevertheless. For an opening act he got an impressive pyrotechnics budget – and in a nifty detour he briefly ventured over to a freshly moved-in piano at the side of the stage and impressively played a tune from the bench. Plus as the show went along his presence and personality grew – and grew in confidence – cracking jokes about how one of songs was going to get folks lucky his overall earnest vibe charming all the way to the back of the auditorium. He may have looked small mainly just meandering down the main catwalk while rapping but in the end he made a big impact as the night's opener – with even bigger potential in his future.

8. Like him or not Post Malone's gonna be around for a while

Post Malone's show wasn't all wow especially if you're not the kind of fan who came in eager for matching painted face tattoos. (Of which there were many!) With certainly several exceptions his ""sad bastard"" brand of music can play dreary and one-note mopey – and for a big arena show for a top 40 musician I want to feel like the artist is working up a sweat exuding energy and putting in a star's effort – which isn't entirely what I got from Malone's more casual ambling stage presence on Thursday.

But even for non-disciples there was much to appreciate Thursday night. On a stage worthy of a massive star Malone played a good mix of his blockbuster hits across the span of his career all sounding on point with the versions fans know and love (even if he strangely didn't think so) and all while captivating his audience with personable handshakes and hellos a plenty – plus a humble brewski request. I'm not sure he would've converted any haters in the crowd but it certainly wasn't a show that would've earned him any new ones either.

And the crowd indeed loved it – a crowd that spanned a larger age range than expected and that was as loud as a peak boy band pop show at points. After waiting several years for his first visit Post Malone clearly delivered – and judging by those overjoyed and ecstatic reactions his reign at the top of music charts isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The only thing the crowd wanted by the end? For Post Malone to not take so long to make his second Milwaukee visit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlYXNpbmdsaWZlLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9hc3NldC1maW5hbmNlLXRlY2gtcHJvdmlkZXItdG9wcy1pZGMtZmludGVjaC1yYW5raW5ncy0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asset finance tech provider tops IDC FinTech Rankings 2022,"Five globally focused software providers for equipment financing find themselves in the top 100 rankings of a key indicator including the company that’s claimed the number one ranking.

In its first appearance on the list Solifi a software provider to the secured finance sector came 82nd this year. An earlier incarnation of the company IDS Group ranked 69th in the 2021 rankings. Solifi was formed in October 2021 when IDS acquired White Clarke Group and William Stucky & Associates and underwent a company name change and rebrand.

The IDC FinTech Rankings are in their 19th year and look to evaluate technology providers based on calendar year revenues from financial institutions for hardware software and/or services. IDC collects data from vendor surveys original research and in-house market analysis according to a company statement.

“The providers featured in the annual FinTech Rankings supply the technological backbone of the financial services industry an industry in which IDC Financial Insights forecasts worldwide spending on IT to be US$590 billion by 2025” the group said in a statement.

Gary Norcross chairman and CEO of FIS said: “Earning the top spot in IDC’s FinTech rankings for nearly a decade brings great pride for FIS as it validates our approach and passion for advancing the way the world pays banks and invests.”

Marc DeCastro research director IDC Financial Insights said: “The 125 companies represented in our IDC FinTech Rankings provide the innovation efficiencies and scale for the industry to succeed in a digital-first world.”

“When it comes to providing financial services technology solutions these organisations currently capture close to 60% of the total spend of hardware software and services which still leaves considerable opportunities for growth as well as new and emerging vendors to compete for the rest.”

Quick Share

UPL and CleanMax Enviro Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. are to build a wind solar hybrid power project of 61.05 MW in the state of Gujarat India.

The project will result in UPL using renewable energy to fulfil 30% of its total power consumption needs globally

The captive project will lead to carbon abatement of 1.25 Lakh tonnes of co2 equivalent per annum.

17 September 2022 Mumbai: UPL Ltd. announced a joint venture with CleanMax Enviro Energy Solutions (‘CleanMax’) a Mumbai-based renewable energy company to establish a hybrid solar-wind energy power plant in Gujarat India.

UPL and CleanMax will set-up and operate a hybrid captive power plant with a capacity of 28.05 MW of solar power and 33 MW of wind power. Combining two of the fastest growing renewable energy technologies this project will enable UPL to increase its renewable energy usage to 30% of its total global power consumption (against 8% currently). Due to their complementary nature wind solar hybrid power plants are highly efficient providing reliable and continuous power supply that helps to effectively manage power loads.

Jai Shroff Global CEO of UPL said: “At UPL we are committed to Reimagining Sustainability internally as well as with our farming partners. Ensuring we have access to reliable clean energy will help realise that vision as we significantly reduce our carbon footprint. We look forward to welcoming CleanMax to our OpenAg network through this partnership and are excited to be joining India’s green energy wave.”

Kuldeep Jain Founder & Managing Director CleanMax said “This 61.05 MW captive wind solar hybrid project is a part of a larger wind solar hybrid farm developed by CleanMax in Gujarat. The overall capacity of the CleanMax wind solar hybrid farm stands at over 400 MW; comprising 230 MW wind and 180 MW solar; leading to carbon abatement of 8.75 Lakh tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum.”

“We are excited to partner with UPL. The hybrid plant combines wind and solar power to maintain a consistently high supply of renewable energy to UPL across months and different times of the day.”

The automaker has committed over $50 billion to electrify its lineup with new products and the factories needed to build them but Ford CEO Jim Farley said it is also continuing to spend on future internal combustion engine (ICE) models like the 2024 Ford Mustang unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show and the upcoming F-Series Super Duty pickups.

""We’re investing in ICE segments where we’re dominant and where we think as competitors leave the segments we can actually grow"" Farley told FOX Business.

""I find it intriguing that we’re portraying the future of our industry as monolithic. That’s not how it goes. That’s not how it’s going to manifest itself.""

IN OR OUT: FORD GIVES DEALERS ULTIMATUM ON EV SALES

In March Ford split its core business into the Ford Blue division dedicated to ICE and hybrid vehicles and the Model e division which is focused on fully-electric products like the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E highlighting its commitment to continue to pursue both paths in contrast to some competitors like General Motors and Volkswagen who have committed to all-electric futures in the U.S. It has even given its dealers the option of just selling ICE models if they do not want to make the investments required to support EV sales.

""Not all segments will go to electric at the same time and some may never"" Farley said specifically calling out the Heavy Duty truck classes that the F-Series Super Duty participates in.

""If you’re towing a fifth-wheel trailer or you have a bucket body on the back of a chassis cab Super Duty an electric vehicle makes almost no sense"" he said.

The auto industry is facing a new challenge with California's decision to require 35% of all light vehicles sold in 2026 to be all-electric with that number rising to 100% by 2035.

SOME STATES IN LIMBO AFTER CALIFORNIA'S NEW ELECTRIC CAR MANDATES

""Look we’ll do what’s required and we’re going to grow our EV business to two million vehicles in four years and most of that will be conquest but we want these loyal customers who own F-150s and Broncos and Mustangs to continue to have a great experience"" Farley said.

""If they’re not able to be sold in California so be it but there are plenty of other places to drive a Mustang in the United States.""

The recently updated federal electric car tax credit program has also thrown a wrench into the works by requiring that battery packs and their materials be sourced from suppliers located in the U.S. or within free trade partner countries to qualify for the full credit while most battery material production currently takes place in China and other countries outside that block.

Farley said he is not sure when Ford will be fully compliant with the new rules but that it had already been taking steps to domesticate that part of the business.

""We’re moving as much of that raw materials processing back to the U.S"" Farley said.

""It’s not just because policy will reward us financially it’s because we want to help build a battery raw material processing ecosystem here in America. We’ve learned over the 120 years of the company that works best.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA5LTE1L25pa29sYS1iYWRnZXItcHJvdG90eXBlLW1hZGUtZnJvbS1mb3JkLXJhcHRvci1wYXJ0cy1qdXJ5LXRvbGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nikola Founder Milton Trial: Ford F-150 Parts in Electric Car Jury Sees Texts,"Why did this happen?

If you’ve been following along to my weekly Tour Reports here on GolfWRX.com then you know I’ve been reporting on the new and custom gear we see each week out on Tour.

This week I’m trying something a little different by putting all of the gear news into a video version of the Tour Report. Watch the video at the top of the story to check it out. You’re still getting a look at all of our photos and I’m still providing information about the equipment discussed…it’s just in a video format.

I’m all about what’s best for GolfWRX fans though so I’m looking for feedback on the first Tour Report video. What are your thoughts? Do you like the new format? My goal is to provide the best user experience possible when highlighting the coolest and newest gear that we see on the PGA Tour each week. I hope you enjoy the first Tour Report video from Napa and if you don’t let us know why in the comments!

Don’t forget to check out all of our photo galleries from the 2022 Fortinet Championship below. If you want a more extended discussion from the week listen in to our new Two Guys Talking Golf podcast.

After drivers handled recent supply chain bottlenecks and coronavirus delays the nation isn’t missing a chance to thank these key workers.

Yellow Trucking senior vice president of trucker relations Bryan Reifsnyder shared on ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday that his company is celebrating its workers with cookouts sit-down conversations and more.

THIS LABOR DAY A GRATEFUL NOD TO THE LONG-HAUL TRUCKERS WHO KEEP AMERICA MOVING

""We had our customers tell us what they appreciated most about our drivers"" he said.

""It was just really heartwarming.""

Pennsylvania trucker Esther Parsons joined the conversation mentioning that she left her previous job to become a truck driver while putting her kids through college.

""It’s been great"" she said.

""I’ve had a great experience and I wouldn’t change it for the world.""

Ohio trucker Russ Simpson pointed out how easily a person is able to join the industry.

While there are 3.6 million drivers on America’s roads Simpson said the industry still ""needs more.""

""We’re in a situation right now where we don’t have enough drivers"" he said.

""I want to say thank you to all those drivers out there for what you do.""

Parsons added that truck driving doesn’t mean sleeping on the side of the road anymore.

""I’m home every day"" she said.

""I’m either home for dinner or breakfast every day.""

The female trucker admitted that there were more mental hurdles keeping her from joining the industry than when she finally hopped aboard.

""The people have been great the industry has been great to me and the road’s been great"" she said.

HERE ARE THE BEST JOBS FOR 2022

Reifsnyder said new truckers can make a very nice salary — anywhere from $60000 to more than $100000 per year — right from the start.

The VP said that Yellow Trucking has 22 driving schools and a program that will cover the cost for candidates to earn their CDL.

Even with the perks Simpson commented that it’s still hard to get new drivers into the industry.

""There’s too many people leaving"" he said.

""It’s a good living.""

It's been an excellent September so far for copper mining stocks with Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) First Quantum Minerals (FQVLF) Ivanhoe Mines (IVPAF) and HudBay Minerals (HBM) all rising despite a recent correction. The moves highlight the volatile nature of commodity stocks and some reasons why putting money into copper miners is an attractive theme for investors.

Why copper mining stocks soared

The key factors behind the move come from near- and long-term catalysts:

As ever investors need to keep an eye on the price of copper because rightly or wrongly copper mining stocks tend to track it. The price of copper rose from $3.40 per pound at the start of the week to $3.56.

The sector has seen a rise in proposed acquisitions recently leading to ""who's next?"" speculation.

The underlying supply/demand balance remains favorable to support the investment thesis around the sector.

These factors are interlinked. No company will launch a bid for another unless it believes the target has attractive assets and for that it has to think that the long-term supply/demand situation is favorable.

That's the thinking behind mining giant Rio Tinto's (RIO) recent agreement to acquire the remaining 49% of shares it doesn't already own in Turquoise Hill (TRQ) at a 67% premium. That deal followed from BHP Group's $5.8 billion failed bid to buy Australian copper and nickel miner Oz Minerals in August for a 32% premium. The takeover fever has caught on with the investment community and stocks like Freeport First Quantum Ivanhoe Mines and HudBay Minerals are possible targets (more on them in a moment).

Electric vehicles renewable energy electrification and mining permits

The reasoning behind the bids is twofold: good old-fashioned supply and demand. Copper bulls see long-term demand driven by a combination of positive trends. Battery electric vehicles (EVs) require around 83 kilograms of copper compared to just 23 kilograms for internal combustion engines (ICE). Hybrid EVs use roughly 2 to 3 times the amount of copper as ICE cars.

Similarly significantly more copper is needed in renewable energy for collection storage and distribution networks.

Lastly the trend toward electrification in the economy (with industrial automation smart buildings wireless-enabled devices EV charging networks and the like) means copper has a significant role to play in the green economy. The metal is already widely used in the economy but the marginal growth coming from EVs is likely to be the swing factor in pushing long-term demand higher.

Turning to the supply side the increasing difficulty of acquiring mining permits and potential political instability in crucial copper-producing regions like South America (Chile and Peru in particular) and Africa (for example Sibanye Stillwater has suffered extensive strike action in South Africa this year) mean miners with productive assets are in demand.

Instead of going to increasingly costly moves to acquire and develop projects it could make sense to pay a premium for smaller mining companies with assets. Moreover it might make sense for the smaller miners to sell because the mining assets they own (as shareholders in the smaller companies) can receive investment from the new owners (BHP Rio Tinto and others) with deep pockets.

The potential targets

Buying a stock as a takeover target makes little sense unless you are happy holding the stock even if a bid doesn't come. That noted it's fair to say Freeport is attractive enough in its own right. Still with a market cap of $46 billion it's tough to imagine anyone other than the largest miners moving in and Rio Tinto is already engaged with Turquoise Hill. HudBay Minerals' collection of assets in Peru (already operating) Canada and the U.S. make it a viable takeover target as it has a sometimes fractious relationship with its largest shareholder Waterton Global Resource Management (26%).

Given the multibillion-dollar bids from Rio Tinto and BHP it would suggest that Ivanhoe Mines ($8.5 billion market cap) might also be in play. But Ivanhoe is 26% owned by China's CITIC Metal with China's Zijin Mining owning 13.7% (Ivanhoe has deals in place to buy copper output from its mines). As such it's hard to see a bid for Ivanhoe coming from outside of China.

Canada's First Quantum Minerals is interesting because it has a poison-pill defense if any person or organization buys more than 20% of its shares; at that point existing shareholders would get the right to purchase additional stock at a ""substantial discount"" to the market price according to the company. That suggests any bid for the company would likely be a friendly one agreed upon in advance or a substantive premium would need to be offered.

Bids or no bids the takeover activity is a sign of confidence in the industry and that's good news in itself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY3JvbmtpdGVuZXdzLmF6cGJzLm9yZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L2FyaXpvbmEtY2FyZGluYWxzLXJhbmstMzB0aC1uZmwtbW9zdC12YWx1YWJsZS10ZWFtcy1mb3JiZXMtbGlzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arizona Cardinals rank 30th among NFL's most valuable teams in annual Forbes list,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='cronkitenews.azpbs.org', port=443): Read timed out.

One-minute review

Not content with revamping its massively successful Forerunner line Garmin also brought out the Enduro 2 designed to usurp the original Enduro (and the Fenix line) as one of the best Garmin watches especially for ultrarunners and other high-performing endurance athletes.

It’s a brute of a watch with an upgrade to the original’s already-impressive battery life being the headline along with the addition of a touchscreen. Topographical maps have also been added – an essential feature for a serious adventure watch – alongside a host of other features some exclusive to the Enduro 2 for the time being anyway.

There’s even memory space for internal music the lack of which was one of the original’s most significant drawbacks. In addition to having a stonking performance watch you’ll no longer have to either bring your phone with you or have to otherwise amuse yourself on long trips.

Considering the similarities between the Enduro 2 and the Fenix 7 line it's easy to see what Garmin's plans are with the former: to replace the latter at the top of the adventure watch food chain. Given its size the Enduro 2 will not attract many casual users but for those who need an accurate rugged and premium Garmin watch the Enduro 2 is the obvious choice going forward.

Garmin Enduro 2: Price and availability

The Garmin Enduro 2 is available now from Garmin priced at $1099.99/£929.99/AU$1749.00. Unlike the Garmin Fenix series the Enduro 2 comes in only one version featuring a Power Sapphire lens titanium bezel and fibre-reinforced polymer case with a titanium rear cover. You can also take the time to check out the latest Garmin promo codes before making a purchase.

Garmin Enduro 2: Design

Titanium bezel/rear cover and Power Sapphire lens

Extremely chunky and rugged

Familiar Garmin OS and Connect app structure

The Garmin Enduro 2 shares a lot of its design ethos with its older sibling the original Garmin Enduro. The watch case and bezel are built of tough titanium with a Power Sapphire glass lens offering battery-lengthening solar charging capabilities just as the last one did.

That said the new Power Sapphire glass lens is the updated variety meaning it harvests solar energy more efficiently than the one found on its predecessor. Plus the Enduro featured 'only' the Power Glass whereas the Enduro 2 has Power Sapphire integrating the scratch-resistant Sapphire material with the solar-harvesting ring around the watch face.

The classic five-button Garmin structure is here with the start/stop back/lap up down and light buttons joined by the addition of a touchscreen. Like the Forerunner 955 Solar you have the option of using either the touchscreen or buttons to navigate around the watch. Adding touch controls to the Enduro 2 was a great idea not just because any decent smartwatch should have this in 2022 but it comes in especially handy when operating the newly-added topo maps.

The Enduro 2 comes with two options for straps: the velcro Ultrafit strap designed specifically for endurance exercise and the thicker silicone strap for everyday wear. They’re easy to swap over but the huge 1.4-inch face and thick body of the watch combined with the meaty silicone strap look borderline ludicrous in social environments.

This is a utilitarian tool and you won't be able to move seamlessly from runs to restaurants without attracting a few odd looks. Unless you're really into Gorpcore in which case the Enduro 2 will blend in seamlessly with the rest of your attire.

Fittingly the Enduro 2 feels satisfyingly hefty in the hand with its premium construction and engineering evident in handling. This is a tank not a high-performance supercar of a watch: instead of Michael Keaton’s dainty and somewhat aerodynamic Batmobile think of Christian Bale’s monster truck version of a car.

The robust body of the watch is unlikely to put the target market off from buying the Enduro 2; ultrarunners distance cyclists and other high-performing endurance athletes are happy to sacrifice sleekness to access more features longer battery life and improved accuracy. If you were interested in having an all-purpose watch for everyday use you’d get something slimmer sleeker and probably cheaper – like an Apple Watch.

The design of the watch's OS and Garmin Connect app will be familiar to most existing Garmin users: if you've ever used one of the brand's other performance watches in the last couple of years there's been no reinventing the wheel here. Holding the 'down' button to access the widget menu from your watch face brings up the usual customizable menu with quick access to everything from your previous activities to your Body Battery score to your built-in compass and barometer.

Design score: 5/5

Garmin Enduro 2: Features

Topographical maps added

Health Snapshot feature bundles metrics into an easy-to-read package

Multi-LED flashlight

Built-in music capacity

This monstrous watch is stuffed to the brim with almost everything a die-hard endurance race addict or adventurer could want. New to the Enduro 2 is topographical maps courtesy of Garmin’s TopoActive community-based maps which offer turn-by-turn directions.

Two standout features of the Enduro 2 are NextFork and Grade-adjusted Pace the former closely connected to the also newly added maps. NextFork is automatically activated in some of the sports modes (e.g. outdoor running trail running) and shows you the name and the distance to upcoming 'forks' a.k.a. intersections on your route.

Grade-adjusted pace is also automatically activated in some sports modes and it shows you how your pace on a gradient translates to if you were to run on a flat surface. This is a handy feature for trail runners and even road runners who live in hilly areas as it can be hard to guess how to adjust your pace to the gradient yourself.

The Garmin Enduro 2 inherited a number of performance features from the latest cohort of Garmin watches including Visual Race Predictor which looks at your training history and estimates a pace you’ll be able to complete on the day.

Combined with Garmin’s already impressive elevation tools and TracBack features you’ll never get lost again. Ski maps too form part of this making Garmin’s toughest watch yet an ideal companion on the slopes as well as the trails.

Garmin has also added the Health Snapshot feature on the Enduro 2 something we've seen in many Garmin watches before. In essence it’s a new way of packaging metrics it already collects such as Body Battery Pulse ox (blood oxygen level) heart rate and stress levels and sending them to you in a single push notification as the new Morning Report functionality did on the 955.

In terms of hardware the Enduro 2 is well-equipped for late-finish adventures. As well as the detailed multi-band GPS guidance we've come to expect from Garmin the Fenix 7X’s multi-LED flashlight is here but twice as bright. The flashlight is also dimmable so you can find your campsite on a lower setting or signal for help in the dark on its highest. Running in the dark? A red light safety mode allows the user to see and be seen. Another safety feature is automatic incident detection which can alert a designated contact with your live location.

As for the usual smart functionalities such as notifications Garmin Pay and music controls they’re all here as expected. But built-in music space is also present so you can finally listen to your favorite tunes on the Enduro 2; no need to carry your phone around as well.

The Garmin Enduro 2 might be great on the slopes on weekend hikes and for paying for your groceries with your wrist but it looks set to really shine on race day. An automatic rest timer can detect how much time you spend at aid stations while Garmin says “the [Adventure-Racing World Series]-approved adventure racing activity profile tracks heart rate elevation segment times and other metrics when the race is on and saves the data for post-race viewing in accordance with adventure race rules.”

Although it does everything and more now this is a watch for those who’ve read Born To Run cover-to-cover more times than they can count.

Features score: 5/5

Garmin Enduro 2: Battery Life

46 days in smartwatch mode

150 hours in GPS mode

The Enduro series has always been famous for its mind-blowing battery life and thankfully the Enduro 2 doesn't disappoint in the battery department. With up to 46 days in smartwatch mode and a massive 150 hours in GPS mode (that's over six days of continuous GPS tracking) you could run for a whole weekend and never need to turn this thing off

The battery is supported by the updated Power Sapphire glass (i.e. improved solar charging) and SatIQ a new feature that automatically detects what kind of GPS mode is best for conserving battery life without losing your navigation. So in an urban environment the Enduro 2 might use the 'Max Accuracy' GPS setting while out in an open field it might switch back to a single band to conserve battery life but without sacrificing accuracy. And does it all automatically with zero input from you.

Battery life is in fact out of this world on the Enduro 2 overshadowing battery powerhouse watches such as the Garmin Fenix 7X. Even if you use the watch for GPS tracking for an hour every day it's unlikely you'll need to charge it more than once a month especially if you happen to expose it to direct sunlight which helps conserve battery life.

Don't expect the Power Sapphire tech to charge your Enduro 2 though; you can't just leave the watch out on the balcony for a day and expect it to be fully charged by the end of the day a common misconception among Garmin users. The Power Sapphire lens can help slow down the battery drain but it's likely you'll be using the watch for HR tracking when you're out and about which drains the battery.

Battery life score: 5/5

Garmin Enduro 2: Verdict

The more time we spent with the Garmin Enduro 2 the more we appreciated its features and capabilities. The watch is not for everyone; the hefty price tag will surely put many people off from impulse buying the Enduro 2. But those who need the best battery life the latest sensors and access to the Garmin ecosystem can't get around not buying the Enduro 2.

That said there are many alternatives to the Enduro 2 even within the ever-increasing roster of Garmin watches. If you're after a more lifestyle-oriented yet rugged smartwatch you might want to pick the Garmin Epix Gen 2 which also has an AMOLED screen which is easier to read in broad daylight.

For those with smaller wrists we'd recommend the Garmin Fenix 7S – that multisport watch has a rugged build but is also more stylish and most importantly fit on smaller wrists better. For running and triathlons you're better off using the Forerunner 955 Solar or the Forerunner 255S the smallest of triathlon watches out there.

Once you have tried the Enduro 2 though it'll be hard to go back to either of the watches mentioned above especially since it has most of the features of those wearables plus insanely-long battery life and premium titanium construction. Not to mention the super-bright flashlight everyone's favourite feature.

Buy the Garmin Enduro 2 if...

If you don't like charging your smartwatch too often Even with GPS turned on the Enduro 2 will go for nearly a week without charging. Battery life is absolutely insane – so much so that it's unlikely you'll have to charge the watch more than once a month.

If you're a lover of the Great Outdoors and like to get lost in the woods for days The Enduro 2 has long battery life topo maps and bunch of other trail-specific features that make the watch the perfect choice for longer bouts of outdoor activities whether it's hiking or running the UTMB.

Want the latest and great tech and features Garmin has to offer It might have a steep price but the Enduro 2 represents the best features and the latest sensors Garmin has with more features added constantly via free software updates.

Don't buy the Garmin Enduro 2 if...

Have a small wrist The Enduro 2 is a big watch which might be an issue if your wrist circumference is smaller. It only in come in one size too so if you need a rugged Garmin watch with maps you're better off getting the Fenix 7S. Don't care about maps? Go for the Instinct 2 Solar.

Need a jack-of-all-trades smartwatch The Enduro 2 has many health and fitness features but it's not a watch you can wear on suit-and-tie occasions. It's big and bold and heavy; will look slightly out of place on a dinner night.

On a tight budget The Enduro 2 is one of the most expensive Garmin watches on the market – only the MARQ series sells for more. As such it's not the best option for people who need to think twice (thrice four times) before they depart any money. The original Enduro is much cheaper not to mention Fenix 5 and 6 series watches.

Also consider

Garmin Fenix 7 Garmin's other premiere outdoors and fitness watch the top ultra-marathon watch around until the Enduro 2 tore its crown off its head. Worth a look if you can find it at discount.

Even the highest-quality names out there are getting hammered these days as earnings are likely to be compressed going forward amid raging inflation and a strong dollar. Even the best dividend growth stocks are likely to slow down the growth of their payouts. However two stocks are likely to remain strong amid excellent earnings growth visibility: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD). Accordingly I am bullish on both names.

However to better understand the companies’ dividend growth prospects let’s examine why their earnings are set to remain robust in the current market environment.

LMT and GD Stocks are Set to Produce Strong Earnings

While most sectors are being negatively impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic setup including FX headwinds the escalating war in Ukraine and elevated energy costs a few industries have benefited significantly. Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are two major beneficiaries of the ongoing geopolitical mentions and are presently enjoying significant tailwinds.

For perspective while the S&P 500 has declined over the past year shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation and General Dynamics have returned 25% and 19% respectively excluding their underlying dividends.

It makes sense after all as the current market environment provides an excellent platform for both names to grow their earnings predictably over the next few years. Specifically as Western allies continue to provide Ukraine with all kinds of weaponry and military equipment both companies are well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for their relevant products and services.

Specifically the Armed Forces of Ukraine are currently making heavy use of Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3 and THAAD interceptor missiles as well as armored combat support vehicles made by General Dynamics.

However these tailwinds won’t be short-lived. Even if the unfortunate war were to be resolved tomorrow Western allies would ultimately have to restock their arsenal following the continued weapons deliveries. This will result in a boosted backlog for Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. For instance the General Dynamics-made armored vehicles were delivered to Ukraine by Canada and Canada will have to restock them.

For this reason both companies are set to continue producing quite predictable and increasing revenues in the coming years. The cherry on top is that as a result of the current landscape the DoD’s R&D budgets are anticipated to jump moving forward. Hence we are looking at a multi-year supercycle for Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics.

Evidently in its Q2 results Lockheed Martin’s backlog came in at around $134.6 billion suggesting that the company has secured roughly two years’ worth of future revenues. In the case of General Dynamics the company’s current backlog stands at $87.6 billion. This means that its cash flows over the next two-to-three years have already been secured by its clients presuming of course General Dynamics rises on occasion for these projects.

For these reasons I believe that both Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics enjoy a clear pathway in terms of growing their earnings ahead. Accordingly they should continue to sustain their already admirable dividend growth track records.

LMT and GD Stocks Have Solid Dividend Growth Prospects

Both Lockheed Martin’s and General Dynamics’ dividend growth track records have been exceptional while maintaining a comfortable payout ratio. This disciplined approach could easily allow both companies to continue growing their dividends.

In the case of Lockheed Martin the company boasts a 19-year track record of consecutive annual dividend hikes with its ten-year dividend-per-share CAGR (compound annual growth rate) standing at 12.55%. The company’s most recent quarterly dividend hike was by 7.7%. In addition based on management’s Fiscal Year 2022 EPS outlook of $21.55 Lockheed’s payout ratio hovers close to a comfortable 52%.

General Dynamics features an even more outstanding dividend growth track record featuring 27 years of successive annual dividend hikes. Accordingly the company is a constituent of the S&P 500’s Dividend Aristocrat Index.

Despite such a mature dividend growth track record General Dyncamics’ ten-year dividend growth CAGR of 9.82% displays the rapid pace of said hikes. While the most recent dividend hike was also by a lesser pace of 5.9% there is plenty of room for the company to reaccelerate it. Consensus EPS estimates for the year average close to $12.16 implying a payout ratio of just around 41% for GD stock.

What are the Price Targets for LMT and GD Shares?

Turning to Wall Street Lockheed Martin has a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys and nine Holds assigned in the past three months. At $472.33 the average Lockheed Martin stock forecast suggests a 14.8% upside potential.

While General Dynamics features a brighter Strong Buy consensus rating which is based on six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months its upside comes close to that of Lockheed Martin’s. Specifically at $261.13 the average General Dynamics stock forecast implies a 15.7% upside potential.

Conclusion – LMT and GD Stocks Will Provide Secure Dividend Growth

Both Lockheed Martin Corporation and General Dynamics feature exceptional dividend growth track records already. Their yields stand at a notable 2.7% and 2.2% respectively as well. The two companies also feature ample room for their aggressive dividend hikes to continue especially in the current market environment. As a result dividend growth investors are likely two find these two names rather worthwhile.

With more than 3700 such trades in those three years alone the investigation reveals potential conflicts of interest in nearly every area of policymaking.

Defense policy is no different. At least 25 members sat on committees that shape national security policy while simultaneously trading financial assets in companies that could create competing interests with their work such as defense stock. With a near-even party split Democrats and Republicans may have found a rare instance of common ground.

The majority of these members sat on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees — the committees responsible for the budget and oversight of the Department of Defense.

The list includes the former chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee James Inhofe (R-Okla.) who bought and sold shares of technology companies as they fought over a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon which eventually went to Microsoft. When the Pentagon later decided to cancel the contract House Armed Services Committee member Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) sold up to $250000 worth of Microsoft stock two weeks before it was publically announced. Fallon served on the subcommittee which oversaw the deal though a spokesperson said at the time that he had “absolutely no prior knowledge the Pentagon intended to cancel” the contract.

It also includes Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) who reported more trades than any other member of Congress. Though they were “made by trusts in the name of his wife and young children” these trades spanned all of the top five weapons contractors — Lockheed Martin Raytheon Boeing General Dynamics Northrop Grumman — which could conflict with his role as a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Khanna has been an opponent of overspending on the Pentagon an indication that there is not always a straight line between stock ownership and votes on the budget. But that is decidedly not the case with many other members who cash in on defense stocks while wielding power in favor of bigger defense spending.

Members of the Foreign Affairs Homeland Security Intelligence and Appropriations committees also reported trades that could constitute a conflict of interest.

John Rutherford (R-Fla.) for instance traded Lockheed Martin Microsoft and BAE Systems stock while sitting on the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for determining the Department of Homeland Security’s funding. All three of those companies have been awarded contracts with the Department of Homeland Security. Rutherford then bought Raytheon stock the day that Russia invaded Ukraine a company that has also been awarded contracts by the Department of Homeland Security.

The New York Times analysis defines a potential conflict of interest fairly narrowly only focusing on stock trades in companies relevant to committee assignments. Given the daunting task of assembling such a comprehensive list it is also limited to that three-year span. As a result it doesn’t include instances like Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) picking up Raytheon stock the day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) buying Lockheed Martin stock the day before. By the Times’ own admission “the analysis is surely an undercount.”

Though all of these lawmakers deny any impropriety the capacity for competing interests is clear; Congress continues to approve defense budgets beyond what even the Pentagon even asks for more than half of which goes to private contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon which could in turn privately benefit members of Congress invested in those stocks.

This could create a perverse incentive structure when taking into account that when global tensions rise defense stocks tend to follow suit. War is often good for defense companies' bottom line; Jon Schwartz noted in the Intercept last year that “defense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by 58 percent during the Afghanistan War.” Some members of the defense industry even acknowledge this connection as Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes did during an earnings call earlier this year:

“We are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales. We just have to look to last week where we saw the drone attack in the UAE which have attacked some of their other facilities. And of course the tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we're going to see some benefit from it.”

Pressure is mounting for Congress to seriously consider self-regulation of stock trading. Seventy percent of Americans support banning lawmakers from trading stocks including a majority of both Democratic and Republican voters. To date at least six different bills have been proposed to limit the ability of members of Congress to trade stock.

Despite the popularity of these measures self-regulation is always a tall order. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) went on record saying that limiting lawmakers’ ability to trade stocks would be “ridiculous” and that “it would really cut back on the amount of people that would want to come up here and serve.” Tuberville himself traded stock of major defense contractors such as Honeywell and General Dynamics while sitting on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Confidence in Congress sits in the single digits as overinvestment in the Pentagon has come at the underinvestment in healthcare education and addressing the climate crisis. Even if lawmakers defend their trades as routine the goal should be to eliminate both the appearance and reality of conflict in setting national security priorities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L21vcmUtdGhhbi0xMTAwMDAtam9icy1pbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZW1haW4tb3Blbi1oZXJlcy13aHktZW1wbG95ZXJzLXdhZ2UtYS1jb25zdGFudC1iYXR0bGUtdG8taGlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than 110000 jobs in Connecticut remain open. Here's why employers wage a 'constant battle' to hire.,"Electric Boat is hiring welders as fast as the submarine manufacturer can find them. Highland Park Market is looking for entry-level supermarket workers. And during blistering heat spells this summer broken air conditioners went without repairs for lack of technicians.

In Connecticut and across the U.S. employers in nearly all industries are scrambling to find workers who quit during the pandemic retired or are stymied by a lack of transportation and day care.

“Everyone is out hiring” said Cathy White director of talent acquisition at Electric Boat. “Competition is fierce for skilled labor.”

The subsidiary of General Dynamics Corp. faces U.S. Navy deadlines to manufacture two nuclear submarines a year in addition to the start of production of its next-generation Columbia class setting a pace only imagined a few years ago.

Electric Boat with shipyards in Groton and Quonset Point Rhode Island expects to hire 500 welders this year at starting pay of nearly $22 an hour White said. Hiring managers use various strategies such as “walk-in Wednesday” sessions at the company’s employment office; job fairs; outreach to high schools technical schools and colleges; and appearances at events such as Military Appreciation Day in New London in August a summer boat festival in Hartford and the Travelers Championship in June.

Timothy Devanney one of the owners of Highland Park Market which operates three supermarkets in Farmington Glastonbury and Manchester said hiring is a “constant battle.”

Ten applicants will respond to one job posting and managers will reach four. Two will come to the interview and one will be hired. It’s a “50-50 shot” if the successful job-seeker shows up for work he said.

Highland Park Market which closed two hours earlier at 7 p.m. during the pandemic has kept the reduced hours due the labor shortage Devanney said.

Stop & Shop which said it’s hiring for all departments shifts and jobs scheduled a hiring fair in August to fill more than 400 permanent part-time e-commerce and store jobs including positions in the bakery deli grocery seafood and produce departments. The supermarket chain hired 185 part-time workers for its Connecticut stores as a result of the job fair. Openings remain for overnight shifts cashiers porters baggers and home shoppers.

Police departments too are grappling with shortages brought on by retirements and difficulty finding candidates said John Ventura chief of the Wallingford Police Department. “People are not going into law enforcement. It’s not an attractive landing pad for people” he said.

Employment opportunities that once drew 500 to 1000 prospective candidates now attract fewer than a dozen Ventura said.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday 113000 job openings in Connecticut in July forcing employers to figure out how to find workers or get around shortages by offering more overtime and cutting hours of operation. Nationally 11.2 million open jobs in July increased from 11 million in June.

The number of job openings is 41% higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic when available jobs in Connecticut didn’t exceed 80000 said Patrick Flaherty director of research at the state Department of Labor.

The state Department of Labor reported 77800 unemployed workers in August or 35200 fewer than the number of job postings. In comparison in pre-pandemic 2019 68700 jobless workers outnumbered 65000 open jobs.

“This is both a Connecticut issue and a national issue” Flaherty said. “Unfortunately some people in the labor force before the pandemic have not returned. Some died. Some were sick with COVID.”

Economist Donald Klepper-Smith cautioned against reading too much into the job openings data published by federal officials. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought on significant changes to the economy he said: shortages of labor and supplies high inflation after years of price stability and an abrupt change in work as employees operate from their homes.

“People try to explain in simple terms there are more jobs than people” he said. “There’s a lot of extrapolation with that. It’s a squishy number.”

The sectors with the greatest number of of open jobs are health care and social assistance retail manufacturing and finance and insurance according to Connecticut’s Help Wanted Online Data Series.

Worker shortages are so acute in the heating ventilating and air conditioning business that employers have a “very hard time” taking on new customers said Stillman Jordan government affairs chairman of the Connecticut Heating and Cooling Contractors Association.

Columbia Manufacturing Inc. can’t find experienced welders and instead hires young workers it trains on the job. Pictured here from left welders Isaiah Hutchins and Gustavo Sanchez build parts for a B-52 inside the Columbia plant in Columbia Connecticut. (Courant file photo)

At peak demand during this summer’s heat waves air conditioning repair workers couldn’t be found he said.

Rob Friedland chief executive officer of Columbia Manufacturing Inc. which makes turbine engine components said welders and inspectors with aviation experience are the hardest workers to find.

He’s “pretty much abandoned hope” of finding experienced welders and instead hires young workers who are trained at the manufacturer in Columbia after completing their schooling he said.

Friedland said a shortage of welders who are in demand in numerous industries such as construction and manufacturing will get worse as commercial aviation rebounds from its low point during the pandemic when airline fleets were grounded

“We’re all going to be looking for people” he said. “I’m not expecting it to get better anytime soon.”

Chris DiPentima president of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association said the worker shortage tracks the state’s stagnant population that has been largely unchanged since the recession of 2008-2009.

More housing is needed particularly close to public transportation and can be encouraged with incentives for builders to renovate blighted housing he said.

DiPentima also cited Connecticut’s cost of living taking aim at the state’s gift tax he said “comes into play” with business successions. Connecticut is the only state that imposes the tax according to the Tax Foundation a tax policy research group.

No uniform explanation applies for worker shortages. Flaherty said for every worker “missing” from the labor force “there’s probably a reason and a strategy.”

Jordan blamed the shortage of heating and cooling repair workers on an emphasis of college over trade schools and restrictive state policies in Connecticut disputed by organized labor that limit the number of apprentices that can be hired.

Local police shortages are the result of abundant opportunities at other agencies Ventura said. A study by the International Association of Chiefs of Police said recruitment troubles are due to “multiple social political and economic forces” that include an increasing emphasis by employees on work-life balance and public perception of police following high-profile police shootings.

Conglomerates are feeling the impact of worker shortages that are magnified because of the size of the businesses. CEO Greg Hayes said Raytheon Technologies Corp. the parent company of jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney and two military and intelligence units began the year with 174000 employees. The Arlington Virginia-based company has hired more than 23000 workers this year about half of whom are engineers he said Wednesday at an industry analysts’ conference.

About 15000 employees have left the company and after hiring 13000 jobs remain open he said.

“That is the challenge that we all have is: Where are all those workers going to come from?” Hayes said.

(NYSE:GIS) is the company behind many well-known food and snack brands including Cheerios Chex Lucky Charms Trix Cocoa Puffs and Nature Valley.The company is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings before the open on Wednesday Sept. 21.

A look back at General Mill's last eight earnings reports shows that the stock's next-day response is split with four of these returns being positive including a 6.3% jump during its June report. Regardless of direction GIS has averaged a post-earnings return of 3% which is slightly smaller than the 4.9% move options traders are pricing in this time around.

The equity has been outperforming the market up 12% year-to-date and 28.3% year-over-year. Despite this analysts have been hesitant which could create some room for bull notes especially with earnings on the way. Of the 12 in coverage just four say ""strong buy"" compared to seven ""hold"" ratings and one ""strong sell."" What's more the 12-month consensus price target of $73.18 is a 3.2% discount to current levels.

General Mills stock's price-earnings ratio sits at 17.23 and its price-sales ratio at 2.46. Although these valuation metrics aren’t generally considered high they indicate a rich value relative to the business’s growth rate. General Mills is estimated to generate 2.3% revenue growth and 1.5% earnings growth for fiscal 2023. It is also expected to increase its revenues and earnings by 2.1% and 6% respectively for fiscal 2024. Furthermore the food and snacks company holds an unfavorable balance sheet with $819.2 million in cash and $11.98 billion in total debt which could further reduce its net profits over the long run.

Nonetheless General Mills has remained consistent with its top and bottom line growth over multiple years. The business has grown its revenues and net income 12.6% and 15.4% respectively since fiscal 2019 following a slow but steady approach. In addition General Mills stock offers a nice dividend yield of 2.90% at a forward dividend of $2.16. Altogether this has helped the equity become a safe haven for investors during uncertain times like it presently is which has undoubtedly been reflected in its price-action. However at its current valuation only long-term investors will want to consider adding GIS to their portfolios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd29ydGguY29tL3BlcnNvbi9hZGFtLXRhbmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adam Tank - Worth,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd29ydGguY29tL3BlcnNvbi9hZGFtLXRhbmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C2260>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Monday: AutoZone (AZO US) will report fourth-quarter earnings before market. Relatively larger exposure to the do-it-yourself car repair market have hurt the company more than peers as DIY enthusiasm from the pandemic is waning Bloomberg Intelligence said causing a reversal of same-store sales to low-to-mid single digits. BI and D.A. Davidson analysts noted the potential for growth in the commercial segment as vehicle owners -- who are getting more mileage out of their cars instead of replacing them due to high inflation -- now rely on trained mechanics for maintenance. This though may dent operating margin as reliance on the less profitable segment increases. Investors may watch for forecast on store count for the coming year and more color on trends as the industry reaches the late stages of the pandemic-induced cycle.

Tuesday: Stitch Fix (SFIX US) is due after the bell. Investors may watch for 1Q guidance and initial annual outlook for FY23 after the online styling platform announced job cuts in the prior quarter. Gross margin is likely to remain similar to the previous period as product and transportation costs remain elevated the company had said. More than 80% of the stock’s analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a “hold” rating on the company as they seek clarity on the firm’s pivot to letting customers do direct buying under its “Freestyle” service which has driven incremental gains since it was introduced. On that end researchers at Telsey Advisory Group are expecting management updates about consumer retention rates and algorithm improvements that would inform its styling decisions.

Wednesday: General Mills (GIS US) reports premarket. The company is set to follow up the release of its full year outlook that beat market expectations with positive top- and bottom-line growth in the first fiscal quarter driven by strong results from its Pet Food business based on consensus estimates. Analyst are calling for organic sales growth of about 8% versus 2% last year as gains made from price increases outpace the effect of falling sales volumes on balance according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That pricing power may become constrained going forward though BI said as persistently high commodity prices could make new rounds of hikes more difficult for the company.

Thursday: Costco’s (COST US) fourth quarter results due after market close may top consensus sales growth expectations according to Bloomberg Intelligence as the company reaps the benefits of its savvy supply-chain management and attractive prices. Thanks to Costco’s appeal to value-conscious consumers analysts are calling for the discount retailer to grow same-store-sales excluding changes in currencies and gas prices by about 10% as both traffic and ticket size increased throughout the period based on BI data. More customers are expected to be drawn into Costco’s membership program as well with analyst expecting the company to end the period with around 118 million total cardholders and generate fees in excess of $1 billion for just the fourth time in company history.

ESG in Focus: FedEx (FDX US) will report first-quarter earnings in the wake of its disappointing preliminary results. Volatile macro conditions and softening demand caused its revenue to come in more than $800 million below the company’s expectations for the first quarter forcing the courier to withdraw its 2023 guidance. In response the company has taken “immediate and decisive action” to cut spending including temporarily parking some aircraft and reducing labor hours. Analysts will likely seek more details on how aggressive the company can be with these initiatives without sacrificing services ahead of the busy holiday season as well as how the current contractor dispute factors into the equation. FedEx Ground’s network of around 6000 contractors responsible for the company’s last-mile deliveries have been agitating for changes to FedEx’s compensation policies as operating costs remain elevated. Despite the slowing demand the overall labor market shows little signs of loosening according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ESG Analyst Gail Glazerman and is set to remain a challenge for both FedEx and the contractors though labor conditions may soften if the demand slowdown proves widespread.

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9tb3RpdmVsb2dpc3RpY3MubWVkaWEvZ20vdGhlLWxvZ2lzdGljcy1vZi1yZXNpbGllbmN5LWZvci1nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy80MzQ0My5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The logistics of resiliency for General Motors | Interview,"Edgard Pezzo executive director of global logistics and containerisation explains how GM has invested in visibility extra logistics capacity and focused on collaboration to protect the carmaker’s supply chain. He spoke ahead of the Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Global Conference  where he joins on a panel on logistics resiliency.

General Motors has been no less immune than other OEMs to the material logistics and labour shortages that have disrupted so many automotive supply chains over the past two-and-a-half years. Whether it has been a lack of semiconductors causing plant stoppages across the Americas and Asia constraints in global ocean container shipping impacts from ongoing lockdowns in China and more recently service instability for the transport of finished vehicles by rail in North America the carmaker’s supply chain has felt the strain in capacity costs and volume.

However this onslaught of disruption has also prompted significant intervention from senior leadership in GM’s supply chain design and operations with a strategic focus on creating more resiliency. This effort which has been coordinated across GM’s functions within its Global Purchasing and Supply Chain (GPSC) organisation – including procurement supplier coordination transport logistics and packaging – has led to real investments and changes in the way the carmaker plans and purchases logistics services.

For example GM has stepped up in investment in visibility tools and processes across inbound logistics manufacturing and vehicle distribution including more use of technology such as GPS and telematics. The carmaker’s logistics and supply chain teams have also been readier to revaluate trade-offs between transport costs and inventory for example with the aim of keeping plants running and delivering vehicles. GM’s logistics organisation has also been willing to purchase more transport capacity in advance on key trade lanes to act as ‘insurance’ while increasing more direct delivery services for vehicle logistics.

For Edgard Pezzo who has led GM’s global inbound and outbound logistics for the past nine years even more important than the willingness to spend on capacity or technology has been the strategic coordination both internally across GM departments and in sync with the carmaker’s global logistics service partners with whom the carmaker is sharing more information more frequently and doing more to plan before a crisis bites.

“The most important focus for us is to have very close partnerships and links with our logistics partners all the time” says Pezzo a native Brazilian based at GM’s Technical Center in Warren Michigan near Detroit where he leads a global team.

And the carmaker has seen results. After being hard hit by disruptions in 2021 this year GM has been able to maintain production and delivery ahead of many rivals regaining its leading position and market share in the US for example. Along with volume gains and staying competitive the changes are also part of an important focus on its supply chain design just as GM ramps up electric vehicle production. Improving logistics resiliency will be an essential part of GM’s present and future success.

Christopher Ludwig: With so much material capacity and labour disruption across automotive production ‘resiliency’ has become the talk of all supply chains in the current climate. What does resiliency look like in global logistics for General Motors in 2022?

Edgard Pezzo: For the first time purchasing supply chain and logistics are working together on supply chain resiliency. At GM the enterprise has made substantial investment in resiliency initiatives with full senior executive leadership approval and support.

For example in mid-2021 we initiated a focus on ‘full end-to-end visibility’ in the supply chain which includes inbound logistics of parts to plants for shipment visibility; manufacturing at plants to create finished products; and outbound logistics visibility driving end-customer delivery. It has been a very strategic focus at the highest levels.

Has this led you to invest in further visibility improvements in logistics?

Yes we continue to invest in visibility tools for both inbound material and outbound finished vehicle deliveries with a long-term partner FreightVerify. This gives us the capability to track inbound material shipments and in-transit finished vehicles throughout the network. The tool utilises GPS providing real-time tracking capability of planned shipments and vehicles.

For vehicles we are using telematic events as the inputs for ‘track and trace’ operations.

GM’s On-Star telematics systems has been around for a while and had previously been explored for logistics too. Is this a newer implementation?

Yes that’s right we’re now using it in our logistics activities.

We’ve seen more efforts among automotive manufacturers and their logistics providers to flexibly shift and change shipping routes and transport modes. Has GM also been changed transport mode and logistics engineering more frequently than previously?

While we work to optimise our complex network we are constantly working to adapt to the higher-than-normal changes to the supply chain. Many of these changes have come with little to no lead time for example during the Shanghai lockdown or in facing border issues between the US and Mexico or the US and Canada.

These impacts have become more frequent over the last two years and they have pushed our team to remain nimble and agile to address them every time that we face those challenges.

Has it changed the way that you work with your logistics partners?

Yes firstly it is important that we start working with partners very early on and not wait for the crisis to come first. Secondly it is important for us to have a very proactive link with our partners and that has been key for us in managing the issues that we have faced.

Edgard Pezzo joined panellists in a session on logistics resiliency during the Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Global conference in Detroit on September 21 2022. It is now available on-demand to watch

Watch GM IAC Ceva and DSV discuss logistics resiliency

Has GM had to adapt long-standing patterns in its manufacturing and logistics for example in rethinking just-in-time or just-in-sequence deliveries or lean inventory levels?

All areas have needed to adapt to changes with both supply chain challenges and the introduction of electric vehicles. The key here is communication and creating cross-functional solutions working with manufacturing planning purchasing logistics and supply chain leadership to handle challenges that impact all groups.

For example that has led to re-assessing trade-offs between inventory and transportation and so developing warehousing solutions to determine the right inventory level to minimise risk to plants. It has also led us to develop cross-functional solutions to respond to changing customer requirements

What we have also been doing throughout this crisis is working with our partners for the first time to have an ‘insurance policy’ by buying extra logistics capacity in advance for transportation modes for example for container shipping at sea and even for air freight. Having these insurance policies has become important and our part of a very proactive approach to protect the supply network for us.

This added capacity in advance is important and not something that every manufacturer has done or even could do. As well as taking out this insurance have you needed to use some of that capacity?

Yes and that was exactly the point. We took this insurance with the view that when we needed it we would use it and if we didn’t then we wouldn’t. But it was very important for us to have the capacity in place.

“[In the crisis we are] working with our partners for the first time to have an ‘insurance policy’ by buying extra logistics capacity in advance for transportation modes…Having these insurance policies has become important and our part of a very proactive approach to protect the supply network for us.”

-Edgard Pezzo GM

I’d like to turn to finished vehicle logistics. With vehicle inventory levels low we are seeing more vehicles assigned customer orders in transport or even before production. Has this shift also changed the way that logistics team tracks and adjust estimated times of arrival (ETAs)?

We are not changing how we predict ETAs based off low vehicle inventories but we are adapting them with newer technologies to determine the most accurate ETA. We use the best methodologies as well as the latest technology to get the best results we can provide and look for ways to improve. For example as I alluded to earlier we are partnering with VIN View – a product from FreightVerify – which has helped improve results regarding ETAs

VIN View utilises multiple vehicle status sources including milestones telematics and OnStar providing near-real-time VIN location mapping and intelligent ETAs for dealers.

The North American rail network is facing labour shortages and service issues. Have you had to adapt your network or how you work with logistics providers to overcome these challenges especially for outbound vehicle logistics?

The industry is going through unprecedented network disruption as you mentioned whether that is labour or supply chain issues. We keep our strategic partners in close communication providing them visibility and alerting them when quick escalation is required.

That includes several actions that we are taking with our rail partners such as establishing a daily leadership communication among several railroads. This helps us to expedite the decision-making process and prioritise action items if needed.

We understand that the capacity and asset availability is scarce so we try to maximise the utilisation and efficiency based on our customers’ needs. It goes back to the early partnership and planning that we discussed.

Finally we are seeing vehicle logistics transport capacity issues even though overall vehicle production and sales volume remain at levels lower than before the pandemic. How are you working with your partners to mitigate this?

GM is working very collaboratively with strategic suppliers in ways to better understand specifics of capacity constraints for example in equipment driver shortages fuel issues etc. Our focus is and has always been building strong carrier and supplier relationships and we are committed to working with them to develop solutions.

Some examples of areas where we are working with our providers includes expanding dedicated fleet contracts to improve customer service. We are also thinking strategically with our network design.

And that is an approach that will help you in managing capacity issues and in adjusting to further changes in the network.

Exactly and this collaborative approach along with always being flexible and optimising the network are very important to do this.

Thank you for sharing these views with us. I’m particularly excited because we’ll be discussing them further on a panel with other logistics leaders at Automotive Logistics & Supply Chain Global in Detroit which our audiences can either come to watch live tune in online or watch afterwards on demand. I will see you there Edgard.

Thank you Chris and I’m looking forward to it!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuYWNhcGl0YWxjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tLz9wPTE3MzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM announces $491 million investment to support EV production at Marion plant • Indiana Capital Chronicle,"General Motors plans to spend $491 million to expand and upgrade operations at its Marion Metal Center the company announced Thursday.

The investment is meant to help increase production of GM’s “future vehicles” including electric cars company officials said.

The automaker said it will purchase and install two new press lines complete press and die upgrades and make renovations to the plant. A roughly 6000-square-foot addition is also planned.

Work on the facility is slated to begin later this year with expanded operations expected to to start in late 2024.

“Technology is changing everything that we do and our industry is no exception” Gerald Johnson GM’s executive vice president of global manufacturing said Thursday at the Marion plant. “We are committed to this workforce and committed to the (electric vehicle) future that they can participate in. Marion has a strong history of stamping excellence and quality … they’re going to the future with us.”

Marion plant at the forefront of a nationwide automotive transition

The Marion center which opened in 1956 produces sheet metal stamped parts and blanks that are sent for multiple GM assembly plants across North America to support production of Chevrolet Buick GMC and Cadillac vehicles. The plant employs more than 750 workers.

GM said its employment is expected to remain stable “with the addition of this new work in the plant.” Johnson noted that the company’s current “commitment” with the new investment is to the workforce “that’s here now.”

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation plans to offer GM with up to $12 million in conditional tax credits as well as up to $500000 in training grants among other incentives based on the company’s job retention and workforce development plans.

The state incentives package must be approved by the IEDC’s board of directors. The city of Marion will also consider additional incentives.

“We don’t take it for granted … we are so grateful that GM is going to be here for a long time to come” said Marion mayor Jess Alumbaugh.

Preparing Indiana for more electric vehicles

The project announcement comes amid GM’s push to ramp up its foothold in the electric vehicle market.

The company said new equipment manufactured at the Marion plant will help build new and future electric vehicle models including the Chevrolet Silverado EV GMC HUMMER EV HUMMER EV SUV and Cadillac LYRIQ. The vehicles will all utilize GM’s Ultium battery platform.

Johnson emphasized GM’s “very bold commitment” to phase out petroleum-powered cars and trucks in the United States by 2035. Instead the company plans to sell only vehicles that have zero tailpipe emissions

“We won’t produce any more emissions-bearing vehicles and that’s still our commitment” he said. “That trajectory is 15 years or so out but it’s fast paced accelerated and we’re engineering our way into that future.”

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb who visited the Marion plant on Thursday called the “jaw-dropping” investment a “wise” move by GM saying Indiana is “all in” the greater automotive transition to electric vehicles.

State officials and private partners laid out their plan in July for creating a statewide network of reliable electric vehicle chargers using federal funding. That plan has been criticized for being “inequitable” however and Indiana’s EV charging plan is not yet approved by the federal government.

Holcomb said “it’s incumbent upon our state” to actively participate in the electric vehicle transition adding that part of that will require Indiana to make future investments to its infrastructure.

“This is about the future of mobility itself and transportation” Holcomb said. “We’re going to continue full steam ahead on building out our statewide charging network and making sure that we’re trying to attract more battery manufacturing trying to attract more semiconductor (companies). All these pieces snapped together … remind us that we are in the driver’s seat in terms of the future of mobility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtYXV0by5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtZnV0dXJlLW1vZGVscy1jYWRpbGxhYy0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Motors future models - Cadillac,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.just-auto.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /features/general-motors-future-models-cadillac-2/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950B42320>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3QtYXV0by5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC1tb3RvcnMtZnV0dXJlLW1vZGVscy1jYWRpbGxhYy0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZXZlbnRzLXBhcnR5LXBpY3R1cmVzL2lkZWFsLWdyb3VwLXN1cHBsaWVyLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ideal Group GM Supplier of the Year Celebration 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZXZlbnRzLXBhcnR5LXBpY3R1cmVzL2lkZWFsLWdyb3VwLXN1cHBsaWVyLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950B42530>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

We recently updated our strategy and committed to actions which will fundamentally reshape our division into a technology-enabled globally connected payments franchise and better support clients’ needs. We also introduced a new name for our business—Global Payments Solutions (GPS) from Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM). This reflects our global network and reach our role in facilitating commerce for our clients and the insightful solutions we provide our customers to support their efficiency and growth objectives.

GF: The combined impact of the global pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has weakened the economy and boosted inflation to the highest rate in four decades. What lessons can we heed from the global financial crisis to prepare for what may be next?

Kohli: The global financial crisis created a shift in the way that companies looked to optimise the cash conversion cycle enhance visibility and realign their cash flows to build buffers. We recognise that businesses are now facing similar pressures to adjust their operations and realign their business models. Our Global Payments Solutions business is uniquely positioned to offer innovative payments and receivables products and digital banking services to help customers future proof solutions streamline processes and create efficiencies. We understand that trust is the driver of our business not only in our products but also in that we will be there when our clients need us particularly as they navigate the current climate.

GF: ESG is important to businesses of all kinds but balancing it with growth is a challenge. How can GPS drive innovation to help achieve this?

Kohli: The biggest impact we can make is by working with our customers to support their transition to lower carbon emissions. In GPS we are digitising all our client journeys and experiences which has a direct impact on sustainability including the use of less paper and plastic. We are focused on making payments more accessible globally helping to break down barriers and we are improving end to end transparency of payer/beneficiary information which can allow more businesses to choose sustainable buyers and suppliers. At HSBC we have expanded our Green Deposit products across markets globally and more recently we have started to support our clients to invest their excess liquidity into ESG thematic funds. The coverage of markets where our solutions are offered enables multinational corporates to invest their liquidity across several currencies through a common set of standards helping them achieve consistency and efficiency.

GF: What will be single greatest catalyst for change in digital banking both for the future of GPS and the individuals that work in the sector?

Kohli: While it is difficult to name the single greatest catalyst one of the most significant drivers for change in digital banking is the shift we are seeing amongst businesses towards digital commerce with direct distribution models that are interconnected always-on and inherently global. Companies are also increasingly looking to build their own buyer/supplier platforms and consumer portals to connect better with their customers. Additionally corporates are seeking to integrate financial services (such as payments) into their own customer proposition at the point of sale to deliver better experiences for their customers. These shifts will raise the bar for what is considered the minimum requirements for payments and cash management competitive capabilities across banks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0dWMtY3NpLm9yZy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWVxdWFsLXBheS1kYXktMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Equal Pay Day: We need a new social contract to close the gender pay gap,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0dWMtY3NpLm9yZy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWVxdWFsLXBheS1kYXktMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951230610>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

While individual characteristics such as education working time occupational segregation skills and experience explain part of the gender pay gap a large part is due to discrimination based on gender.In addition women have been among the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic including in terms of their income security disproportionate representation in some hardest-hit sectors and the unequal and gendered division of family responsibilities. These factors negatively affected women’s employment threatening to reverse decades of progress made towards gender equality.The new ILO study Pay transparency legislation: Implications for employers’ and workers’ organizations  finds that pay transparency measures can help to address the gender pay gap and reduce broader gender inequalities in the labour market. Pay transparency may provide workers with the information and evidence they require to negotiate pay rates and provide them with the means to challenge potential pay discrimination. For employers pay transparency can help to identify and address pay discrimination that might otherwise negatively affect the functioning of the enterprise and their reputation.The study offers a detailed mapping of existing equal pay legislation in countries worldwide and discusses arguments for and against pay transparency legislation. The paper also pays attention to the role of employers’ and workers’ organizations and presents the findings of an online survey of social partner organizations that assesses their understanding of how pay transparency measures are implemented and seeks their views on how to improve their application.While countries are using a variety of approaches – such as periodic pay disclosure pay audits and giving workers the right to access pay data – a proactive approach by governments to engage with employers’ and workers’ organizations during negotiations for and the design of pay transparency legislations is important. The paper finds that active social partnership is crucial in delivering the results intended by legislation and – most critically – to eliminate pay discrimination in the world of work.The findings of the paper will be among the topics discussed at a webinar on 16 September organized by the Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) to mark International Equal Pay Day 2022.The webinar discussed the main challenges and opportunities that governments workers and employers face worldwide in addressing the gender pay gap highlighted some of the pay transparency measures being implemented in different parts of the world their potential and actual effectiveness on reducing the gender pay gap and broader gender inequalities in the labour market.“These are still early days for pay transparency. We see countries pursuing different approaches to advance it which shows that there is no ‘one-size fits all’ solution” said Manuela Tomei Director of the ILO Conditions of Work and Equality Department. “While more time is needed to assess the effectiveness of the different measures and practices it is encouraging that Governments workers’ and employers’ organizations seek to devise innovative solutions such as pay transparency to tackle a stubborn problem.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9jcm9zcy1ib3JkZXItY29tbWVyY2UvMjAyMi9vdHQtcGF5LWJyaW5ncy1jcm9zcy1ib3JkZXItdHJhbnNhY3Rpb24tcHJvY2Vzc2luZy10by11cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OTT Pay Brings Cross-Border Transaction Processing to US,"Canadian payment service provider OTT Pay is bringing its cross-border transaction processing solutions to the U.S. to more efficiently serve global eCommerce companies.

Williams also introduced his brand of recreational marijuana Highsman which will be hitting select stores across Massachusetts.

Take one wild guess why former 11-year NFL running back Ricky Williams was in Cambridge on Friday morning.

Getting into the marijuana business was natural for Williams now 45.

“The one thing I was always looking for as a football player was how do I make myself significant beyond just being a football player?” Williams said. “And I had no idea it looked like this but here we are.”

When Williams played (1999-2011) he was widely vilified by the NFL and its fans for his marijuana habit. He was suspended for nearly three seasons and became a national punchline as the pothead who threw away his career. No one seemed to listen much when he said that he smoked marijuana to deal with anxiety and mental health.

Now marijuana is legal in 37 states the NFL has essentially “decriminalized” it and the league is even funding studies into cannabis and pain management.

“I feel a sense of pride that my sacrifice wasn’t in vain” Williams said. “And at the time I didn’t see it as a sacrifice. I was trying to figure things out.”

A Heisman Trophy winner. The guy Mike Ditka traded the Saints’ entire draft for in 1999. Massive success with the Dolphins. Multiple marijuana suspensions and a surprise retirement that cost him millions. Living in a tent in Australia and getting mental health treatment at McLean Hospital in Belmont. Returning to the NFL for five more seasons and finishing with 10009 rushing yards.

Williams spoke with the Globe about his fascinating journey and new venture (answers condensed for space and clarity):

Q. Peoples’ attitudes toward you seem to have changed a lot.

Advertisement

A. “It’s funny I was up here [in Boston] a few weeks ago for a soiree where we really launched the brand. And I had to give a five-minute speech and I said ‘This was the first time I’ve been up here on stage and people weren’t booing me.’ Cannabis is something that people are becoming more open to. For better or for worse it’s been attached to my name so I’m utilizing the opportunity to have a platform to spread the good word.”

Q. When did you get into the business?

A. “In 2016 I did a deal with Weedmaps and I consulted with them for a year. Then I launched my own brand which was more in the CBD and health and wellness side. And then as I was visiting dispensaries and talking to people everyone’s like ‘Where’s the weed at?’ So then about a year ago I took my first step into the recreational market.”

Q. You really lean into your persona instead of running from it.

A. “I’ve tried to run away from it but every time I tripped back into it. When I first got into the industry my former teammate Kyle Turley called me up and said ‘There’s a big cannabis conference in Phoenix why don’t you come out and tell your story?’ I said ‘They have cannabis conferences?’ I said no but I hang up the phone everyone probably thinks I smoke anyway so I called him back up and said I’ll do it and that was what really got me launched.”

Q. Do you ever lament that you came too early for the NFL?

A. “That’s kind of the point. When I started consuming cannabis I started realizing I didn’t care about having a long career as a football player. I cared about the platform and the people it allowed me to touch and that’s what I’m leaning into now.”

Q. You’re still smoking?

A. “Of course. Daily. I’m still smoking this morning. It’s really part of my daily self-care routine. I feel like people refer to me as an advocate for cannabis but I really feel more like I’m an advocate for introverts.”

Q. How do you look back on your career?

A. “That 10000-yard rushing mark for me was a big milestone. To have the ups and downs spend almost three years out of the league and to still average almost 1000 yards a season I feel pretty good about it considering I didn’t start the last half of my career.”

Q. What else are you doing now?

A. “I’m really into astrology. That’s my job really. Yesterday was the craziest day. I had a big cannabis conference in Chicago flew in here landed at midnight woke up and did a radio interview then did four dispensary visits. I launched an astrology app so I had a meeting with my product manager for an hour and then after that I had a 90-minute reading. So it was like a 12-hour day of all the different things I’m into all jammed into one day and in the middle I got to call my wife and talk to my 1-year-old.”

Q. Do you watch football?

“I went to the Rams-Bills game.”

Q. So you go to games?

A. “I’ve become pretty good friends with Dwyane Wade in LA. He has a suite so they pretty much invite me to almost every game so I went to two or three last year.”

Q. The Super Bowl?

A. “I didn’t. I had a Super Bowl party and I was so focused on that game my wife was like ‘Who are you?’ Because she’s never seen me get involved with watching football.”

DECISIONS DECISIONS

Some coaches missed the call

It's hard to defend Nathaniel Hackett's late-game decisions against the Seahawks in Week 1. Ben VanHouten/Associated Press

The AFC West has so much talent that all four teams are competitors for the playoffs and the Super Bowl. But a couple of head coaches made some head-scratching decisions in the last week to put their teams in the loss column.

Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett had one of the worst coaching debuts in recent memory with Monday’s 17-16 loss in Seattle. The Broncos were sloppy with 12 penalties and two fumbles on the goal line. And Hackett butchered clock management at the end of the game — sitting on all three timeouts letting the time dwindle then opting for a 64-yard field goal attempt instead of a fourth-and-5 play with Russell Wilson their $49 million quarterback.

Hackett’s decision was terrible enough but his responses to it the next few days were even more baffling. Hackett claimed that Wilson tried to draw the Seahawks offside which simply wasn’t true. He also said that the Broncos decided in pregame that the 46-yard line would be the limit for kicker Brandon McManus without explaining why. The kick had about a 4.9 percent chance of being converted compared with about 49 percent for fourth and 5.

“Looking back at it if you missed the field goal you’re always going to wish you would have gone for it” Hackett said. “If you would have gone for it and not gotten it you wish you would have given him a chance. So that’s the crazy thing about this game.”

Sorry but it’s hard to think anyone would have said “Why didn’t the Broncos try a 64-yard field goal?” Hackett’s explanation couldn’t have been too satisfying to new Broncos owner Rob Walton who bought the team after Hackett was hired and has no emotional attachment to him.

Then on Thursday night Chargers coach Brandon Staley looked like a shell of his former self in his team’s 27-24 loss to the Chiefs. Staley went 4 for 4 on fourth downs but was unusually timid on several opportunities — kicking a field goal on fourth and 2 and punting twice from midfield on fourth and 2.

“Just wanted to give our defense a chance to compete” Staley said. “I felt like we were aggressive when we needed to be tonight converted all four of our fourth downs. But felt like with who’s over there and the way our defense was playing field position would be a big edge for us to pin them back there.”

That’s a far cry from last year when Staley consistently went for it on fourth down even deep in his territory. It’s fair to wonder if the Chargers’ owners talked to Staley this offseason and told him to rein it in on fourth down which would be a shame because Staley’s decisions were mostly correct and the NFL is more fun when teams go for it on fourth down.

Not expecting much from Tagovailoa

Some are struggling to see the potential in Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Rebecca Blackwell/Associated Press

When Sean Payton and Ryan Fitzpatrick talk about the Dolphins I’m listening. Payton was in talks with the Dolphins this year to be their head coach while Fitzpatrick played in Miami from 2019-20. They clearly know a lot about the team.

And neither Payton nor Fitzpatrick is too keen on Tua Tagovailoa the Dolphins’ polarizing first-round pick from two years ago (over Justin Herbert).

Payton appearing on “The Colin Cowherd Show” said “I think at some point we’ll see two [quarterbacks] in Miami. Teddy Bridgewater I’ve had before he’s an outstanding player.”

And Fitzpatrick benched for Tagovailoa in 2020 doesn’t see special talent in his former teammate.

“If you’re a top-10 quarterback you have to have at least one trait that is absolutely special something you can do that nobody else can do” Fitzpatrick told Dan Le Batard’s podcast. “With Tua it’s not the arm strength. It’s not the ability to run. It’s not the ability to scramble or get out of trouble … The problem is sometimes you have to create and he’s not going to be able to scramble around escape the pocket and make the big plays down the field.”

Changes to be made?

Payton also told Cowherd that he counted eight teams where he expects multiple quarterbacks to play this year because of performance not injury.

We already know the Dolphins are one. But it’s not so easy to guess the other seven.

The 49ers are obvious — there’s a reason they kept Jimmy Garoppolo behind Trey Lance. The Steelers also seem obvious with rookie Kenny Pickett waiting behind Mitchell Trubisky. The Giants are probably another team though Daniel Jones would have to be a disaster to get replaced by Tyrod Taylor. The Falcons are probably anotherwith journeyman Marcus Mariota staving off rookie Desmond Ridder for now.

Payton probably counts the Browns as another team with Jacoby Brissett eventually giving way to Deshaun Watson. The Seahawks could be another with Geno Smith beating out Drew Lock for now. Or maybe the Panthers with Baker Mayfield starting ahead of Sam Darnold. Perhaps Payton also includes the Jets who are going with Joe Flacco until Zach Wilson comes back.

Prime time for a deal

The NFL began a new frontier on Thursday night with the launch of its “Thursday Night Football” package on Amazon Prime the league’s first exclusively streaming broadcast deal.

While many of us dinosaurs aren’t thrilled by the move the NFL said it is important to follow viewing trends particularly for younger fans.

NFL executive vice president Jeff Miller compared the Amazon package to the NFL’s deal with ESPN in 1987 for “Sunday Night Football.” At the time ESPN only had 45 million subscribers.

“This is the 21st century version of that” Miller said. “We’re hoping as we look back several years from now that our relationship will resemble the positive relationship we’ve had with ESPN.”

Guardian Caps did the job

Those Guardian Caps that players wore in training camp were cumbersome and looked goofy but according to the NFL they worked really well. All offensive linemen tight ends defensive linemen and linebackers were forced to wear the Guardian Caps — extra foam padding on top of their helmets — in practice through the second preseason game.

The NFL reports that just 11 players from those positions suffered concussions during practices down from an average of 23 in previous years. And six of those 11 concussions were the result of a blow to the face mask which isn’t protected by the Guardian Cap.

“The benefits of the Guardian Cap exceeded our expectations so far” Miller said.

Extra points

Boy was there a lot of drama in Seattle the last several years. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll speaking Tuesday on ESPN 710 after defeating the Broncos acknowledged that beating Russell Wilson was sweet. “I wanted to win for all of the reasons that come along with this one — maybe as much as anything is representing the guys that have played before” Carroll said. “It meant a lot to those guys. I was so thrilled to be able to hug those guys up and see them and look them in the eye.” When asked why it was so meaningful Carroll answered “You figure that out.” Wilson won a Super Bowl in 2013 and went to another in 2014 but the Seahawks seem thrilled to be done with him … You can’t improve your lie in golf or in football either. Bears punter Trenton Gill was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct at the end of the first half last Sunday when he brought a towel onto the field to dry the spot for Cairo Santos’s 47-yard field goal in a monsoon … There are five games this Sunday that opened with double-digit favorites — Rams over Falcons 49ers over Seahawks Broncos over Texans Packers over Bears and Bills over Titans. It marks the first time since 2007 that there were five games with double-digit pointspreads within the first four weeks of the season … Note to defensive coordinators: Don’t do what the Cardinals did. They blitzed Patrick Mahomes on 54 percent of his dropbacks the first time he faced more than 50 percent in his career. He finished 15 of 21 for 137 yards and four touchdowns against the blitz in the Chiefs’ 44-21 win … The Browns are 1-0 for the first time since 2004 … Sunday’s Patriots-Steelers game is the first time the teams are kicking off at 1 p.m. in their last 16 meetings. The last early kickoff was the 2002 AFC Championship game (12:40 p.m. kickoff) and the last 1 p.m. game in the regular season was in December 1998 a 23-9 Patriots win … The family of the girl who was put in a coma by former Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid son of Andy Reid is furious that Reid brokered a deal that caps his prison sentence at four years. Reid pleaded guilty this past week to being legally drunk in February 2021 when his truck slammed into the back of a car at high speed. Ariel Young then 5 was in a coma for two weeks and still is recovering. Reid is no longer coaching in Kansas City but the Chiefs should be held responsible by the NFL too particularly because it’s possible that Reid was drinking at the team facility. The Chiefs agreed to an unspecified settlement with the family but the NFL had no comment this past week on any potential punishment for the organization.

ROME – School-aged children are bearing the brunt of today’s Global Food Crisis with devastating consequences for their education and their ability to catch up on learning lost during COVID school closures warn the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) the African Union Development Agency NEPAD and organizations working on education including the Education Commission chaired by Gordon Brown former British Prime Minister and UN Special Envoy for Global Education.

WFP estimates that the global food crisis has pushed an additional 23 million under-18s into acute food insecurity since the start of the year taking the total of children now affected to 153 million. This represents nearly half of the 345 million people facing acute hunger according to WFP data from 82 countries.

The global food crisis is threatening the futures of millions of school-aged children who have only just returned to classrooms following the Covid-19 pandemic. Emerging evidence points to unprecedented learning losses during the pandemic which risk being further compounded by this current food crisis. The World Bank estimates that the share of 10-year-olds in poorer developing countries unable to read or write has increased from 53 per cent to 75 per cent.

“As every parent and teacher understands hunger is one of the biggest barriers to effective learning – and the surge in hunger among school-age children now poses a real and present danger to a learning recovery. For children who are going hungry in their classrooms we have a ready-made cost-effective antidote – school meal programmes. Let’s use it” said Gordon Brown adding: “The Transforming Education Summit is a critical opportunity to tackle the hunger crisis.”

Ahead of the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and the Transforming Education Summit in New York WFP and partners are calling for an ambitious plan of action to restore school meal programmes disrupted by the pandemic and expand their reach to an additional 73 million children. Detailed costing estimates for the plan suggest around $5.8bn annually would be required.

The plan would supplement wider measures to combat child hunger including an expansion of child and maternal health programmes support for out-of-school children and increased investment in safety nets. Hunger levels among the 250 million children now out of school are almost certainly higher than for those in school the WFP warns.

“Millions of children are living with the consequences of the mutually reinforcing food and learning crises. Yet the link between hunger and lost opportunities for learning needs to be more prominent on the international agenda – and school meal programs can help break that link. Not investing in school meals programs is perhaps one of the worst possible economic decisions governments and donors can make especially now” says Carmen Burbano Director of WFP’s School-based Programmes Division.

School meal programmes are among the largest and most effective social safety nets for school-aged children. They not only keep children particularly girls in school but help improve learning outcomes by providing better and more nutritious diets. They also support local economies create jobs and livelihoods in communities and ultimately help break the links between hunger an unsustainable food system and the learning crisis.

The Transforming Education summit needs to deliver results said Wawira Njiru who leads the Food for Education Foundation an NGO which delivers school meal programmes in Kenya and one of the leaders of the coalition’s ‘Communications and Partner Outreach Group’.

“The long-term effects of hunger and malnutrition are devastating for Kenya and children in particular. Children do not have a vote and they are not asked what their top priorities are. We have a moral duty to ensure that everyone is better protected from food price spikes and economic shocks. Failure to do so is quite literally handicapping the future of our country” said Njiru.

A growing coalition of governments has come together to build the School Meals Coalition which aims to ensure that every child can receive a healthy nutritious meal complemented by other health interventions by 2030. Led by France and Finland 70 countries supported by more than 70 organizations have worked tirelessly to scale up school meals programmes increasing domestic investment as a response to the crisis.

For example in Rwanda under the leadership of President Kagame the national school meals programme has increased its coverage from 660000 to 3.8 million children in two years while in Benin President Patrice Talon has committed to increase the budget for the national school meals programme from US$79 million to US$240 million over the next five years. The United States has committed to provide US$943 million for the next year to support the purchase of locally-grown foods for its national school meal effort in response to the ongoing impacts of rising food costs.

Fati N’zi-Hassane Head of Human Capital and Institutional Development with the African Union Development Agency which is a member of the School Meal Coalition’s taskforce said: “African countries have long recognized the benefits of school feeding to protect children's health nutrition and education whilst strengthening local food systems. Country ownership and commitment is the key. Efforts to protect and scale up these programmes are now more important than ever to protect the youths of Africa from the colliding food and education crises.”

Despite some progress the bleak global economic outlook and debt distress in low-income countries remains the main barrier to expanding school meal programmes. WFP the Education Commission and education partners are therefore calling for three things: the prioritization of school health and nutrition programmes at the Transforming Education Summit; the scale up of safety nets such as school meals as part of the food crisis response; and a robust donor response to match domestic commitments already being made by low- and lower middle-income countries. These actions should also be monitored to help drive greater ambition and provide critical accountability. This must be done alongside core investments in maternal and child health and nutrition services to maximise impact throughout the first 8000 days of life and to set children up for a healthier and more prosperous life.

“Prioritizing school health is a sound economic and social investment. Sustained and adequate funding of school health including school feeding water and sanitation deworming and immunization will unlock the full potential of our countries' human capital and resilience while fostering equity and inclusion across sustainable development program.” said Yacine Diop Djibo Founder and Executive Director SpeakUpAfrica an advocacy action tank dedicated to catalysing leadership in Africa and an active member of the School Meals Coalition.

Note to editors:

For the calculation of the number of acutely food insecure children WFP used country level population statistics and food security data. The sample consists of 82 countries/country groups where WFP operates. The estimated number of acutely food insecure children is derived from the total number of people estimated to be acutely food insecure in 2022 based on integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) data equivalent data from other sources and estimations as reported in WFP's Global Operational Response Plan June 2022. WFP calculated the number of children among the total by multiplying the share of children in the total population of a country with the number of people facing acute food insecurity. The country figures are aggregated to a global figure. Variations in the number of children according to income levels are taken into account.

The U.K.’s Open Banking rules which have been in place since 2018 have helped boost competition given consumers better access to their banking data and facilitated faster online payments. But the benefits have primarily accrued to retail customers and some smaller businesses.

Larger commercial customers on the other hand have mostly been an Open Banking afterthought. The directive was designed to address the need for innovation and digitalization for consumers and small and medium sized companies - a topic that was discussed in a previous post. The initiative was never designed to transform the corporate treasury services that banks offer. For larger companies the digitalization of their banking relationships has for the most part been moving forward on its own track.

We see an opening however for corporates of a certain size to benefit from Open Banking APIs—particularly for cost effective data and reporting purposes. Reporting has been one of the big success stories of Open Banking and a growing company of medium size might find itself in a sweet spot where this can be an effective option to help increase the automation of bank communications.

For this hypothetical growth company with revenue of say $200 million its treasury personnel might be logging in to multiple online banking portals daily to gather transaction and balance data. Open Banking APIs may provide a more secure reliable and low-cost way to collect this data. Time that today is being wasted gathering banking information manually can instead be used to analyze it through accounting software that pulls in balance and payments data from banks.

The data available through Open Banking is of course the same data that the customer gets from its banks by any other method. In fact Open Banking APIs are built on the same ISO 20022 data standard that is used for the more sophisticated APIs that financial institutions including Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking (TxB) provide. There are nuances and limitations however.

Open Banking APIs produce a subset of the data that might be available through a bank’s premium APIs. If the treasury team needs a start-of-day balance daily transactions and an end-of-day statement balance to know how the bank will calculate interest and fees that may be difficult to assemble using Open Banking. The data may not be in a format that the company’s systems can input or map properly or there may be missing data points. There are third party providers who can help an organization overcome some of these issues and aggregate the data acquired through Open Banking into more usable reports.

Not for Everyone

To be sure larger companies that have already begun to automate their banking communications would likely be stepping backward to try to use Open Banking APIs. Corporates may have bank reporting aggregated through SWIFT or may be tapping direct connections to their banks. There are in other words better options than Open Banking for these organizations.

But for smaller firms taking the first steps up the automation ladder Open Banking may be a perfect choice. It will certainly ensure that initial automation efforts do not come with excessive costs.

Open Finance’s Future

As an organization grows and requires more sophisticated banking automation the desire to connect to the more comprehensive APIs that banks provide may be justified. And there may yet be a role for Open Banking APIs as the implementation of these rules mature. Feedback from corporate treasury and finance teams is already influencing how Open Banking is evolving and the APIs are becoming more complete.

At TxB we both recognize the role of Open Banking regulations and see the broader importance of an open finance future for all banking transactions so that clients have more data from which to share knowledge and foster innovation. The culture of our organization and the features of our fully API-based technology platform are fit-for-purpose for that future.

We believe that data is the most valuable resource that our customers own and we do not charge our clients to access or retrieve their data - no strings attached. Moreover the size or location of our customer is not what’s most important. Whether the customer is a London-based small business using Open Banking APIs or a larger treasury services client in Dallas with sophisticated automated banking communications our vision for open finance is consistent across businesses and borders—large and small far and wide.

The 5-year agreements—the largest of their kind to date in the oil and gas industry according to ADNOC—went to Abu Dhabi’s Al Ghaith Oilfield Supplies and Services Company Al Mansoori Directional Drilling Services Schlumberger Middle East SA Halliburton Worldwide Limited Abu Dhabi and Weatherford Bin Hamoodah Company LLC following a tender.

The awards apply to ADNOC’s onshore and offshore fields as Abu Dhabi aims to boost conventional drilling by 40% by 2025 as well as tap into unconventional reservoirs to reach 2030 production targets. If needed the agreements can be extended by another 2 years the company said.

Abu Dhabi set its 5 million B/D production goal with intent to retain the country’s position as a leading low-cost low-carbon oil producer while also producing enough gas to support the UAE’s domestic needs and industrial development. Over 75% of the award value is expected to flow back into the UAE economy under its In-Country Value program.

Commenting in a separate press release Weatherford President and CEO Girish Saligram noted that besides his company’s technology solutions Weatherford’s “manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi will further bolster the In-Country Value Program—an initiative Weatherford has supported since the beginning.”

Weatherford pegged the value of its most recent contract with ADNOC at more than $400 million.

ADNOC has optimized its procurement strategy of late focusing on long-term contracts with an optimal number of suppliers that provide stable and reliable delivery at competitive rates.

Since November 2021 the company said it has awarded more than $11 billion to top-tier contractors for wellheads and related components downhole completion equipment and related services liner hangers cementing services wireline logging and directional drilling.

“These (latest) awards (made in the last month) build on our ongoing investments in drilling services and they will deliver substantial in-country value for the nation to support economic growth and diversification in line with the UAE Leadership’s wise directives” Yaser Saeed Almazrouei ADNOC Upstream Executive Director said.

According to a statement from the Local Content Secretariat (LCS) of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) several companies including SBM Offshore and Halliburton have amended their Local Content Master Plans to ensure that Guyanese suppliers are paid within 30 to 45 days following the receipt of correct invoices.

The signing of the amended plans was done at the ministry’s head office in Kingston on Wednesday. Vickram Bharrat the Minister of Natural Resources reminded contractors about the importance of implementing the amendment while pointing out that appropriate contract and payment terms promotes local suppliers’ competitive financing and growth according to the release.

Vahaman Jurai Halliburton’s Country lead said the company’s five-year local content plan is in line with Halliburton’s guiding principle of Global Citizenship. “Halliburton is eager to work closely with our local vendors [and] sharing our knowledge when needed. We hope to significantly contribute to the development of Guyana’s oil talent in the oil and gas sector whether through the university programmes we support or through hands-on experience working with us” the release quoted Jurai as saying.

Amid concerns that some oil and gas companies were taking as long as 90 days to pay local suppliers of good and services the government ordered that this period be contracted to within 45 days.

A statement from the LCS earlier this week had said that the Government and the private sector have examined a thirty-day payment period for Guyanese and Guyanese businesses that supply goods and services to the petroleum

sector. Upon further assessments and engagements the Secretariat wrote to contractors and sub-contractors instructing them to include an amendment to their five-year Local Content Master Plan for local companies to be paid between 30-45 days upon the correct receipt of an invoice.

Contractors have committed to fostering local content by prioritizing Guyanese nationals for employment; implementing policies that will ensure that Guyanese are treated equally; incorporating the requirements of the Act and the Procurement and Bid Evaluation Guideline issued by the Secretariat into their procurement strategy; planning capacity-buildings activities for Guyanese nationals and Guyanese companies that supply goods and services to the industry and projecting anticipated expenditure on local values.

“The Ministry of Natural Resources through the Local Content Secretariat will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that the goals of the Local Content Act are achieved” the ministry assured.

Bharrat Jagdeo Guyana’s Vice President had said that the 90-day pay delay was an unfair practice to local companies as they are not afforded the full range of opportunities available to them. He also said that as they aim to address these issues government will also have to find ways to address another thorny matter – contract bundling. With this consolidation of a contract for goods and services some local companies are locked out from tendering opportunities as they are unable to fully meet the requirements of the ‘bundled’ services. Local companies have complained that the services they are capable of providing are often bundled with others that they cannot provide thereby preventing them from bidding for some contracts in the sector.

“I believe the oil companies and the first tier contractors can do much more to present the opportunities here in a manner local people can utilise… There must be fair opportunities for Guyanese and other companies to be able to identify and bid on opportunities that are available to them” he stated. “They can’t pay local companies in 90 days. I don’t care who defends that Exxon or not… We will close this” Jagdeo said.

Meanwhile the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) yesterday welcomed the inclusion of the 45-day payment period.

“The Chamber has been of the firm view that to fully realize the benefits of the Local Content legislation suppliers to the industry must be paid within a timely fashion such as the identified 45-day period. It is however unfortunate that the Tier 1 contractors could not make timely payments in an independent manner without having to be regulated into such by the Government of Guyana” the GCCI said.

The GCCI called upon Tier 1 contractors to play their part in the development of local content and operate both within the spirit and intent of the legislation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvYmJzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9wZXJtaWFuLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1hZGRzLXR3by1uZXctbWVtYmVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Permian Strategic Partnership adds two new members - Hobbs News Sun,"For the News-Sun

The signing which took place on Wednesday comes on the heels of a newly proposed modification by the Local Content Secretariat.

That amendment which is included in the five-year local content plan and is enforceable by law will now see contractors and sub-contractors operating in the nation’s petroleum sector issuing payments to Guyanese suppliers within 30 to 45 days following the receipt of a correct invoice.

At the signing Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat underscored the importance of contractors and sub-contractors implementing the amendment. He reminded that the move promotes local suppliers’ competitive financing and growth through appropriate contract and payment terms and is in keeping with Guyana’s Local Content Act.

Martin Cheong general manager of SBM Offshore one of the contractors said the company was excited about the approval of its Master Plan.

Police were called around 10 a.m. Saturday to Perry Junior High School where the New Hartford Central School District was hosting a cross-country meet. A student competing for a visiting school said he had been lured into the woods by a man dressed in camouflage with a handgun a release from New Hartford police states.

The student said he was able to run away and became lost before being found by a civilian off the school campus according to police.

After being found 911 was called and the cross-country meet was canceled the release said. Participants and spectators were evacuated by police and school staff. New Hartford police and firefighters set up a perimeter and a command post and Utica police and New York State Police were called in to assist and provide K-9 officers to search the wooded area. The Oneida County Sheriff's Office Drone Unit also assisted in the search the release said.

The student eventually admitted to police he made up the story and nothing that he had reported was true the release states.

The news release states that the police department will not release the student's name because he is underage. The student has been charged with misdemeanor falsely reporting an incident and will be referred to the Oneida County Probation Department according to police.

Driving the news: Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) chair of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee this week asked the HHS to look into HCA Healthcare’s emergency department admissions.

Pascrell also sent a letter to the company asking whether doctors received incentives for patient admissions and how physician performance was measured.

Details: Several large unions last year alleged that HCA was admitting patients who didn’t necessarily need emergency care. There are also allegations the company has ""corporate admission targets"" and has threatened retaliation against staff who don't meet them.

The company's facilities have also faced understaffing allegations as well as press reports of preventable patient deaths including this one in Denver and one hospital's potential termination from the Medicare program.

In the letters Pascrell also points out how HCA had established a joint venture with a private equity-backed emergency care services firm which provides emergency physician staffing in “virtually all” of HCA’s hospitals.

A staffer in Pascrell’s office told Axios that complaints from workers about HCA as well as the congressman’s interest in private equity’s role in health care motivated him to ask for the investigation.

The big picture: HCA owns more than 180 hospitals and is the largest for-profit health care chain in the U.S. In 2021 the chain turned a profit of almost $7 billion.

The inquiry into admissions practices could extend to other health systems part of the government's increased focus on private equity investments in health care.

The other side: HCA spokesperson Harlow Sumerford said in a statement that the company was reviewing Pascrell’s letter and will respond to his requests for information.

Sumerford added the company had previously faced the same complaints and requests for information from the labor union group and filed their response publicly with the SEC.

“We believe that our operational processes and procedures are working well and that we are meeting the healthcare needs of our patients and communities” Sumerford added in the statement.

Flashback: In 2003 HCA had to pay $631 million to the U.S. over allegations that it submitted false claims to Medicare and other federal health care programs in what at the time was the biggest health care fraud case ever settled.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was previously CEO of HCA during the time the FBI raided company facilities in 1997 to investigate fraud claims. He was ousted before the company settled with the federal government.

Several reports and a whistleblower lawsuit in Florida accuse HCA of systematically admitting patients through the emergency department rather than treating them and sending them home.

Nashville-based HCA the nation’s largest private health system has faced years of scrutiny from a powerful labor union over how it runs its emergency departments. And now Rep. Bill Pascrell a Democrat from New Jersey is calling for a federal investigation and asking questions of his own.

Pascrell chairs the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee and has asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicare to look into claims made in a report released released in 2020 by the SEIU national labor union.

“In light of reports that there may be misconduct and potentially the improper shifting of taxpayer dollars I ask that HHS launch an investigation into the allegations leveled against HCA regarding its emergency department admissions practice” Pascrell wrote in his letter.

Compared to non-HCA hospitals the 58-page SEIU investigative report found HCA is much quicker to admit patients from the emergency department estimating the unnecessary admissions resulted in overcharging the Medicare program $1.8 billion over roughly a decade.

The U.S. Justice Department has pursued such claims before. A civil and criminal investigation into HMA acquired by Franklin-based Community Health Systems in 2014 resulted in a $262 million settlement in 2018. The government alleged that HMA knowingly billed for inpatient services when only lower paying outpatient or observational services were warranted. HMA was also accused of paying physicians for patient referrals and inflating emergency department facility fees.

The SEIU isn’t the only one who has accused HCA of similar practices. A lawsuit filed in 2018 by a whistleblower doctor in Florida claims HCA hospitals induced physicians to increase inpatient admissions “without regard to whether such admissions were medically necessary.” Dr. Camilo Ruiz says in the suit which he stopped pursuing in 2020 that hospital administrators heavily scrutinized observational numbers setting up a de facto quota for higher-paying inpatient admissions.

The SEIU report was first taken to HCA directly which responded through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The union which was in the midst of labor disputes at several HCA hospitals also enlisted a union-backed investment group to raise concerns with the SEC.

“They don’t do anything. They just say ‘We already answered this.’ So we need to go to the agencies that do have the authority” says Joseph Lyons the research coordinator for the SEIU who authored the report.

Whether or not HHS launches an inquiry the oversight subcommittee is doing its own bit of investigating. Pascrell sent a letter to HCA CEO Sam Hazen requesting reams of information about how doctors are incentivized to admit patients. Asked for comment HCA spokesperson Harlow Sumerford says the company will respond to Pascrell’s request but also continued to dismiss the SEIU’s data.

“Our hospitals are staffed by physicians clinicians and nurses who work tirelessly to ensure our patients receive medically necessary care in the appropriate clinical setting” Sumerford said in a statement. “We believe that our operational processes and procedures are working well.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the status of a whistleblower suit filed against HCA. Camilo Ruiz’s suit was dropped in 2020 and is no longer pending.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJwci5vcmcvYnByLW5ld3MvMjAyMi0wOS0xNi9taXNzaW9uLWhlYWx0aC1vcGVucy1uZXctYW5nZWwtbWVkaWNhbC1jZW50ZXItaW4tZnJhbmtsaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mission Health opens new Angel Medical Center in Franklin,"Western North Carolina leaders and HCA Healthcare cut the ribbon on a new hospital in Franklin this week.

The ribbon ceremony began with the national anthem sung by local group Blue Jazz as the American flag was raised outside the building for the first time.

Lilly Knoepp Blue Jazz performed as the flag was raised for the first time.

The doors of the hospital were also blessed with frankincense and myrrh by local pastors.

The new Angel Medical Center in Macon County marks a commitment that HCA Healthcare made when it purchased Mission Health System in 2019.

“I don’t think that another community comparable to Franklin that can boast of a new 82500 square foot hospital that with an investment that including the new heliport equals over a $70 million” said Franklin Mayor Jack Horton. “If there is another place in the country I’m not aware of it. We are very blessed and very fortunate.”

HCA ended up spending $25 million more on the hospital than the original estimate.

Greg Lowe president of the North Carolina division of HCA also welcomed the crowd.

“We’re just so excited to enter this new chapter and this new phase. It's definitely going to be change as we move into this new facility” said Lowe. “And I’m excited as you to tour this new facility and walk in.”

Angel Medical Center became a part of Mission Health in 2013. The hospital had a management agreement with Mission in 2011. As part of the deal Mission provided $16 million toward Angel’s medical debt helped negotiate insurance rates and cut wholesale costs.

Four years later the hospital closed its Labor and Delivery Services. While those services will not be restored at the new hospital CEO Clint Kendall showed off bigger rooms and upgraded technology during a tour of the facility. When asked what trauma level the hospital can support Kendall says Angel doesn’t use that metric:

“It’s technically a three four trauma but we do not go by trauma levels” said Kendall. “So Mission is our level two trauma that would be our tertiary center for us.”

Level three or four trauma centers provide “evaluation stabilization and diagnostic capabilities for injured patients” according to the American Trauma Society. Patients are then typically transferred to a higher trauma level center that can provide more comprehensive care. Mission Hospital in Asheville is a ""State designated Level II Trauma Center."" According to the American Trauma Society the top level of care is Level One. Those hospitals can provide “total care for every aspect of injury.”

The new Angel hospital will have a 30-bed capacity inpatient unit with five acuity adaptable beds 20 medical surgical beds and five observation beds plus a 17-bed emergency department. There will be three beds that are set up for behavioral health patients. Four rooms are designated for ADA compliance with bigger bathrooms. The hospital has new MRI and CAT scan machines.

Lilly Knoepp Some of the rooms at Angel Medical Center were set up for the tour on September 13th.

Kendall previously explained that the new rooms are about twice as big as the hospital rooms at the soon to be vacant Angel Medical Center. The average stay for a patient at Angel is three days Kendall says.

Many in community have been critical of Mission’s role in the region – and the new hospital - citing concerns about excessive billing decreasing services and expensive transfers to Mission Health in Asheville.

HCA is currently being sued for predatory monopolistic practices in multiple lawsuits including by local governments in Brevard Buncombe and Madison counties; by State Treasurer Dale Folwell as well as individuals.

This week  HCA filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the city of Brevard.

There is a need for more hospital beds in Western North Carolina according to the NC 2022 State Medical Facilities Plan. Two other hospital systems and Mission Health have applied to the NC Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Health Service Regulation for the opportunity to expand in the region. The state is expected to make a decision before the end of 2022.

The current Angel hospital is a 25-bed critical access hospital. There still isn’t an update on what will happen with the old hospital building.

Cara Smith is director of clinical operations at Angel Medical Center. She explained most of the old Angel equipment will stay in the Mission Health system after the move.

“We’re making it available to our colleagues. So Highlands will be getting – so if there is something that we have that will be an upgrade for them they will be taking that and giving that to them. Anything that we aren’t able to share with the hospitals in our area we will put up for auction or part out” said Smith.

As for staffing Mission spokesperson confirmed that rotating physicians are contracted by HCA through Team Health. During the tour Kendall also explained that Angel has recently hired four new physicians: Dr. Blake Rudeseal Family Practice; Dr. Samantha Brothers Family Practice; Dr. Mark Moriarty Orthopedics; and Dr. Zachary Phillips General Surgery. Kendell says he is working on hiring more staff.

The new Angel Medical Center will open on Sunday September 18th.

About 20 patients will be moved from the existing Angel Medical Center to the new facility with the help of Macon County EMS at 6 am that morning. Kendell hopes they will be finished by 9 am – before folks on nearby Church Street are heading to Sunday Services.

For example many people don’t realize allergies can be deadly. Or that eating local honey living in a dry climate or avoiding cut flowers won’t cure allergies or prevent an allergic reaction.

And these days there’s often the question: Is it allergies or is it COVID-19? Fortunately there are tests doctors can perform that can help them make that distinction. Here are a few facts that can help you too.

What To Look For

Allergy symptoms can include:

Watery Eyes

Congestion

Runny Nose

Itchy Eyes

Vomiting and/or stomach cramps

Wheezing

Shortness of breath

Dizziness or feeling faint

Pale or blue skin

Weak pulse

Hives

Repeated cough

Tight hoarse throat trouble swallowing swollen tongue

What is an Allergy?

Allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. An allergy is an overreaction of the body’s immune system to an ordinarily harmless substance.

Allergies exist throughout the year indoors and out and affect people of all ages. Animal dander house dust mites foods grasses trees weeds and molds can all trigger an allergic reaction.

Autumn Allergies

Some allergies are seasonal and more likely to occur at different times of the year. The most common culprit for fall allergies is ragweed which grows wild almost everywhere generally between August and November.

A number of plants that thrive during cool nights and warm days also trigger fall allergies.

Who is Affected?

Twenty to 40 percent of the population—including at least one of every four children—suffers from allergies*.

People with allergies are often sensitive to more than one allergen. Prevention or treatment can make the difference between chronic illness and a productive healthy life.

Diagnosing Allergies

Unfortunately many of these also show up when someone has a cold the flu or even COVID-19 but doctors do have ways to tell the difference. The first step is to identify allergen-specific antibodies called Immunoglobulin E (IgE). This can be done two ways.

1. Skin Prick Testing: Commonly performed on the forearm and sometimes the back the skin is cleaned with alcohol and an allergen extract is pricked into the skin. If an allergy is present a small itchy bump and surrounding redness often referred to as a “wheal and flare” will appear in about 15 minutes. This indicates the specific allergen.

2. In-Vitro Testing: The doctor simply draws a small amount of blood and has it tested in a lab. It is a less invasive method and receives test results within 24 hours. Many professional medical societies recommend also using in-vitro tests such as the OPTIGEN® Allergy Test.

So once you know you have allergies what can be done? Here are some options.

Treatments

Allergy management falls into three main categories: avoidance medication and immunotherapy.

Avoidance: Once the source of an allergy is identified a solution may be to simply avoid it. This is most effective with food and animal allergies.

Medication: Prescription drugs can reduce allergy symptoms. Many are effective immediately though some may have side effects or not work for everybody.

Immunotherapy: Allergy shots are given frequently in scheduled doses of gradually increasing concentrations using extracts containing relevant allergens. The idea is to slowly desensitize the body to the offending allergens. Ideally an injection program can be discontinued after some years.

Some teams already look like section champions and district playoff contenders. Others hope to improve on last year’s records. Some players are well on pace for double-digit scoring while others look forward to starting every game of the year.

Ellie Hershey’s first goal for this fall was just to get back on the field.

Hershey a senior at Conestoga Valley had open heart surgery last spring making that goal anything but a certainty.

“I was running in a track meet and blacked out” Hershey said.

Doctors found a cyst on Hershey’s heart. It was benign but it was reducing the amount of blood circulating through her body. In April Hershey had surgery meant to remove the cyst but her doctors found that all they could do was push the cyst down allowing the blood to flow properly again.

“The first two weeks were horrible” Hershey said. “There was so much pain. It took three months for me to recover.”

It may have been three months during which Hershey could not participate in athletics but she was able to use that time to support her Buckskin teammates.

“She’s always been a team leader” Conestoga Valley head coach Kelly Dearolf said. “She showed up a every practice and Nook League game even before she was cleared.”

Hershey was cleared to play in July.

“It was devastating to not be on the field with my teammates” Hershey said. “They’re literally my best friends and family. They celebrated with me when I was first cleared and again for my first game back.”

Though Hershey is now back on the field and has shown no signs of trouble this fall it is still a balancing act for Dearolf to know how much to play her each day.

“She would play in her sophomore and junior years every game all game” Dearolf said. “When she came into practice (this season) she hadn’t run or done cardio. She was cleared but you just didn’t know how long she could play at a time. When she looks tired we get someone to sub in for her. But she was told by her surgeon that she needs that exercise for her heart to grow stronger so we don’t want to hold her back either.”

Buckskins attacking the net

Conestoga Valley has been one of the area’s top-scoring teams in the first half of the season. The Buckskins have four of the top 10 scorers in the Lancaster-Lebanon League: Alaina Culbert (seven goals nine assists entering the weekend) Mikyla Rineer (nine goals three assists) Jamie Handwerger (nine goals) and Sophia Livingston (six goals two assists).

“Conestoga Valley field hockey wasn’t always known as a big scoring team” Dearolf said. “We’ve been known for keeping the ball out of the cage. I was pleasantly surprised to have us average four or five goals a game. We have a lot of speed in our forwards.”

Almond takes reins at Northern Lebanon

Warwick alum Noelle Almond is guiding Northern Lebanon as a first-year head coach. Progress has been slow for the Vikings early but they still have not faced a Section Four opponent.

“I’m really looking forward to those games” Almond said. “We played Octorara who’s Section Three but a comparable size to Section Four and I was encouraged to tie with them.”

Almond graduated from Warwick in 2015 and played one year of college hockey at Lock Haven and another at Shippensburg. She always hoped to get back into the sport but her profession got in the way for a few years.

“I work as a physical therapist assistant. My first job didn’t give me time to here. I got a new job and I had the availability and opportunity to be head coach.”

In addition to adjusting to a new head coach the Vikings are also adjusting to a new turf field.

“I think we are adjusting well” Almond said. “With a new coach and new players there are changes with a new style of play. I’m seeing improvement. And with a turf field after playing on grass there has to be an adjustment.”

Every morning hundreds go to work at the taxpayer-supported Foxconn campus in Mount Pleasant but for the last five years very few people in Wisconsin have known what goes on inside the buildings.

There have been high profile announcements promising production of flat screen televisions coffee kiosks and electric vehicles. None have come to fruition. And the company has not provided any media tours or updates.

One person who has spent the last 90 days working at Foxconn said workers at one building in the massive complex are assembling motherboards — a crucial part of computer hardware — for Google and Amazon.

The worker's comments — and a video he made — provide a rare insight into the puzzling and secretive operations at the massive Racine County facility touted by former President Donald Trump as the ""eighth wonder of the world.""

The 38-year-old southeast Wisconsin resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he signed a non-disclosure agreement said there is very little work for employees.

""I talk to guys who have been here nine 12 months and they say they've worked about three of those months"" the employee said. ""It's boring and you get in trouble if you are just standing around doing nothing.""

The employee who works in a warehouse-type building on the northeast side of campus making parts for Google said he's speaking out because he doesn't like the way he and his fellow employees are treated.

""Everyone who you talk to will say they never worked in an environment like this"" he said. ""When I did my orientation they gave us a tour of the building and people in the warehouses told us to run.""

In a statement Foxconn Technology Group said it could not disclose the nature of its manufacturing operations to ""protect aspects of commercial sensitivity.""

Representatives from Google and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.

Partnership with Google

In November 2020 Bloomberg reported Foxconn planned to assemble key components of Google servers in Wisconsin. At the time a Foxconn representative confirmed the company was developing its data center infrastructure and high-performance computing ""capabilities"" in Wisconsin but declined to name any customers.

The employee who spoke with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the building where he works has five manufacturing lines — although one has been permanently shut down.

He said people who worked on that line now spend most of the day sitting in the break room. Supervisors ask employees around noon if they want to go home but they have to use their own personal time off so many stay he said.

In its statement Foxconn attributed the slowdown to supply chain problems.

“As with many other industries and businesses Foxconn in Wisconsin is not immune to supply chain shortages for critical materials. Despite supply chain challenges Foxconn continues to find successful business opportunities in Wisconsin which remains a key strategic asset for the company"" the statement says.

Foxconn continues to hire

Since announcing plans to build in Wisconsin in 2017 Foxconn has constructed four buildings: a nearly 1-million-square-foot ""advanced manufacturing"" facility; a 300000-square-foot ""smart manufacturing center"" a 120000-square-foot ""multipurpose building"" and a 100-foot tall ""high performance computing data center globe.""

The employee has only been inside the building where he works. The globe he said is only used for tours and presentations.

When Foxconn was announced in 2017 the company promised 13000 high tech high-paying manufacturing jobs. When it became clear that wouldn't happen the state renegotiated the nearly $3 billion public assistance package to better reflect what might happen: the creation of about 1454 jobs — 11% of the original plan — by 2024.

Foxconn qualified for $28.8 million in state tax credits in December 2021 after investing $266 million and creating 579 jobs during 2020.

In April Foxconn filed a report with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. for Jan. 1 through Dec. 31 detailing the number of jobs and capital investments made in 2021. WEDC now has until Dec. 31 2022 to determine if the company is eligible to receive tax credits.

Job creation is cumulative. Under the new contract Foxconn has to have 1454 employees by 2024. Annual wages required to earn credits is $53875 per year.

The employee said he was hired at $16.50 an hour. He and all of his co-workers were recently bumped to $20 an hour or $41600 per year.

""I don't know why I got a raise the majority of the time there is no work to do I barely work"" he said. ""And they're hiring people like crazy. They have a second shift now and they are starting to hire a third shift.""

Before coming to Foxconn the employee spent seven years in the airline industry. His last job was at Chicago O'Hare International Airport where he loaded cargo for Air France. A sprained wrist led him to Foxconn.

He saw an ad on the job site Indeed. The recruiter told him job fairs were held every Thursday. He was hired on the spot.

Foxconn said the company will continue hiring and offering competitive pay and benefits.

“With more than 600 employees verified by economic development officials as part of the most recent 2020 reporting period Foxconn has since hired several hundred more employees with competitive pay and with full benefits such as health dental 401K match"" the company statement says.

On Thursday the employee said he had decided to resign.

Founded by Andy and Candis Meredith the ""Home Work"" show from Magnolia turned out to be a short-lived dream that abruptly ended as a nightmare for many involved. Unlike ""Mind For Design"" ""Restoration Road With Clint Harp"" and other successful home improvement shows from the network ""Home Work"" got abruptly canceled shortly after its January 5 2022 premiere (via Mail Online).

According to The U.S Sun Andy and Candis were co-founders of a 2015 HGTV show called ""Old Home Love"" which started as Candis' project in June 2003 as noted on her LinkedIn profile. Candis Meredith has been flipping homes ever since she was 16 years old. Meanwhile her husband (Andy) was an enterprise-managed print services sales consultant of the renowned computer hardware company HP (Hewlett Packard.) He worked there for 11 years before resigning to become a part of ""Old Home Love"" followed by ""Home Work.""

While the couple has pioneered successful projects in the home improvement industry (one of which was reviewed on Mail Online) ""Home Work"" turned out negatively different. So far three unsatisfied guests have taken to social media to make complaints some of which were featured on US Weekly. The allegations range from homes being left in inhabitable conditions delivery of substandard or unfinished renovations increased renovation costs and extension of delivery time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHWh0dHBzOi8vaXRlbC5hbS9lbi9uZXdzLzEzODIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Armenian Revytech to cooperate with SAP and SAP Fioneer,"Armenian Revytech startup will cooperate with SAP and SAP Fioneer the world’s largest provider of enterprise applications.

HALL OF FAME

ARN Hall of Fame 2022 Inductee: Tara Ridley

Tara Ridley's outstanding career dedicated to the channel actually started with a 'sliding doors' moment.

Having arrived on day one at a titan of technology in the early 1990s - thinking a career in marketing beckoned - an unexpected assignment to sales ignited a flame which more than 25 years on shows no sign of burning out.

With the door thankfully swinging in the direction of the ecosystem Tara has since forged a reputation as a relentless partner advocate - built on passion relationships and trust.

Following more than a decade at Hewlett Packard and Macquarie Telecom Tara spent the next 13 years rising through the management ranks within Cisco - running key partner accounts sales and services functions before taking the reins as channel chief. From excelling at Cisco to now shining at Salesforce Tara’s service to the channel cannot be understated.",,,

The company acquired the hotel in winter 2020.

Because of a slow start immediately following the acquisition due to the pandemic and delivery delays in advance of the horse racing season Gulph Creek limited the scope of the 2020 renovations to paving site cleanup and the replacement of the water sculpture on the property.

Later in 2021 and into early this year Gulph Creek completed a full lobby renovation including the addition of a full-service bar market and breakfast area and the complete replacement of lobby furniture fixtures and equipment. The corridors guestroom bathrooms and the fitness room also were renovated.

To better align the hotel with the adjacent 2400-acre Saratoga Spa State Park Gulph Creek partnered with the Saratoga Performing Arts Center which is within walking distance from the hotel as its marquis host hotel for concerts and cultural events.

Fiscally Gulph Creek Hotels' strategy with the Saratoga property is to drive revenue and control costs to maintain a breakeven operation from November through March while maximizing revenue and profitability during shoulder and peak seasons. To date despite the early COVID and operating challenges during renovation the company achieved 15 to 20 percent annual cash-on-cash returns to its investors and is forecasting a return in the mid-20s for 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rbGFob21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L29rbGFob21hLWNpdHktc2tpcnZpbi1oaWx0b24taG90ZWwtcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci1zYWxlLzY5NDk0ODgwMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Owner preparing to sell Oklahoma City's Skirvin Hilton hotel,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rbGFob21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L29rbGFob21hLWNpdHktc2tpcnZpbi1oaWx0b24taG90ZWwtcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci1zYWxlLzY5NDk0ODgwMDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501EDE70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Sharnise recently graduated from the HBI program whose training curriculum prepares students for careers in the building industry. She was accepted to Tuskegee University on a full scholarship to study architecture. The Path to Pro program has given Sharnise the tools she needs to help refine her focus and achieve her career goals. She champions other women considering this career path and feels they should be confident in their pursuit.

""Our consumer our customer pro and DIY have been resilient"" Decker said.

The company last month reported earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations in its latest quarter and cited healthy project backlogs despite a weakening housing market and persistent inflation.

""Our customer tends to have strong income. They tend to be homeowners. And guess what they're spending more time in that home and that home's aging"" Decker said.

He acknowledged that the seasonal aisle has seen some softness even though the project business has held steady.

""It's hard for us — is that a demand signal because of the weather? We had a tough spring"" Decker said. ""Or is it a reaction to pricing or an uncomfort level with the economy? It's hard to tease that out.""

Redoing the floors in your home is a major renovation and can get pretty costly depending on the size of the room and the material you choose. You also have to factor in the price of installation as well (unless you plan on doing the job yourself). In this case with professional installation the average price of laminate floors is between $1500 to $3500 for a home says Fixr.

When shopping for the best deals for renovation and remodeling projects you're probably looking at both Home Depot or Lowe's two of the biggest home renovation stores out there. Home Depot has eight options from brown tones to rustic finishes. Lowe's has several selections as well including water-resistant and with attached padding.

The complexity of weapons today and the practice of creating as many subcontracts as possible for political purposes sets the conditions for faulty unwanted or potentially harmful items to find their way into the final product. The F-35 program’s various mission systems structural components and ground-based supporting architecture are manufactured by thousands of suppliers around the world. Lockheed Martin the prime contractor for the F-35 program boasts on its website that there are more than 1500 companies worldwide building parts for the program.

The component at issue in this case the F-35 turbomachine illustrates just how complex the supply chain is for even one part. Honeywell manufactures the turbomachine which provides power when starting the engine. Officials at Honeywell learned about the use of Chinese-made alloy in its product when its supplier of lube pumps reported that its supplier of magnets had used the alloy. For those keeping count the item passed through five different companies to make it into the F-35: the alloy manufacturer the magnet supplier the lube pump supplier Honeywell and finally the prime contractor Lockheed Martin.

The Pentagon’s top acquisition official Bill LaPlante admitted how difficult it is for the services and the defense industry to track materials through the supply chain. He told Bloomberg News “I had [a] CEO tell me two weeks ago that he thought he had 300 suppliers and he discovered when he counted all of the suppliers he probably had 3000 and suppliers can change overnight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9uZXdzL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2d1bGYtYWlyLXNhdmVzLW9uLWZ1ZWwtd2l0aC1ob25leXdlbGwtZm9yZ2UtZmxpZ2h0LWVmZmljaWVuY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gulf Air saves on fuel with Honeywell forge flight efficiency,"More than 2700 aircraft worldwide including Gulf Air’s fleet use Honeywell Forge Flight Efficiency to deliver more profitable and sustainable operations.

iCloud icon

Xu Yanjun an officer in China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) was caught with the help of an iCloud backup of his iPhone.

A federal jury convicted Yanjun on November 5 2021 of industrial espionage against GE Aviation and Honeywell. The goal was to steal secrets relating to advanced aerospace engines so China could learn to manufacture their own.

Unfortunately investigators couldn't get anything directly off Yanjun's iPhone as an unknown party remotely wiped it a day after his arrest. However the investigation details shared by Bloomberg reveals that Yanjun's iCloud data was a key factor in his arrest and conviction.

Backups in iCloud are encrypted in transit and while sitting on servers. But as it has done many times before Apple can hand over the data after a valid subpoena from law enforcement — this time the FBI.

The iCloud data included a document never seen before by the FBI or other US agencies. The report compares it to Standard Form 86 a questionnaire American intelligence employees are required to complete.

Through Ministry of State Security officers like Yanjun China reportedly targeted academics and engineers working on secret aerospace projects. Invited to the country under the pretense of giving academic talks spies gradually gained access to information.

An employee of GE Aviation David Zheng was quickly caught and used in counterintelligence to draw Yanjun out of China. GE worked closely with the FBI using technical papers that didn't contain real secrets but were carefully edited to be suggestive.

Zheng then handed these to Yanjun to fool him and Chinese academics into thinking they were helpful information. Finally after months of work investigators were able to lure Yanjun to Belgium where he was arrested and extradited to the US."

It is located on the front lawn of 1 Hormel Place and serves as the anchor of the new outdoor plaza. The plaza’s name is a nod to the company’s purpose statement Inspired People. Inspired Food.™

The sculpture is rich with meaning including being emblematic of the 131-year-old Hormel Foods Corporation. “Food is at the center of all we do and who we are. Food has the power to change lives lift up communities and bring people together. Our team of 20000 inspired people donated the forks to create this visionary work of art representing the power that food has to make a difference in the world. This sculpture is dedicated to them and to the community of Austin our hometown since 1891” said Jim Snee chairman of the board president and chief executive officer Hormel Foods.

The project had its genesis nearly two years ago. Deanna Brady executive vice president of Refrigerated Foods was one of the company leaders interested in finding a way to honor the part food plays in nourishing bodies and also minds and spirits. “It can transform lives build communities and change the world” she said.

“When you think about the special moments in our lives food is there. There is incredible power in it – the sharing the creating the sitting down and talking. We’re honored to be part of that” Brady said.

Armed with a purpose the team began its search for an artist to bring the vision to life. The search brought them to Napa Calif. and the studio of Gordon Huether. For 40 years Huether has produced multimedia works of art especially large public installations that spotlight cities regions companies universities and more. His wife and business partner Darcy Huether was born in Austin Minn. and several of her relatives previously worked for Hormel Foods. For her it was a sign the partnership was meant to be.

“To me it speaks a lot about the values of Hormel Foods that art is important to life and about their vision in wanting to create a major public artwork to brand their headquarters and embody the company ethos” Gordon Huether said.

Once the design was determined the call went out for team members to send in all manner of forks “for a future surprise.” Nearly 20000 forks cover the surface of the sculpture one for every Hormel Foods global team member.

The 2000-pound 25-foot-tall fork sculpture was transported from Napa to Austin on an 18-wheel truck.

The sculpture and the Inspired People Plaza was dedicated at a company event on Thursday Sept. 15 on the front lawn of the Hormel Foods world headquarters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29kbWFya2V0LmNvbS9OZXdzL0EvMTIzNTE5Ny9Ib3JtZWwtRm9vZHMtVW52ZWlscy1UaGUtSW5zcGlyZWQtUGVvcGxlLVBsYXphLWFuZC0yNS1Gb290LVRhbGwtU2N1bHB0dXJlLWJ5LUdvcmRvbi1IdWV0aGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hormel Foods Unveils The Inspired People Plaza and 25-Foot-Tall Sculpture by Gordon Huether,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.foodmarket.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /News/A/1235197/Hormel-Foods-Unveils-The-Inspired-People-Plaza-and-25-Foot-Tall-Sculpture-by-Gordon-Huether (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952D0F730>, 'Connection to www.foodmarket.com timed out.

This strategic partnership is expected to reach up to 2 million acres by 2030 and represents a trailblazing effort by two global companies that share ambitious carbon reduction goals.

The companies' capabilities span the food and agriculture value chains creating a unique large-scale platform to support farmers' transition to regenerative agriculture while building their resilience to climate change.

The long-term agreement will initially enroll corn soy and wheat farmers across Kansas Minnesota Iowa Illinois Indiana and Nebraska with the opportunity for future expansion to increase visibility across the value chain and integrate a range of multi-year farmer-first regenerative agriculture initiatives including cover crops reduced tillage nutrient management diverse rotations and responsible pesticide use.

The companies plan to share resources and collaborate to create value throughout the supply chain by providing participants with technical and financial assistance offering access to peer regenerative farming networks hosting educational field days and tracking results using trusted third-party measurement systems.

Reaching the strategic partnership's goals could eliminate 1.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gasses – equivalent to the amount of electricity used to power 275000 homes per year – at the farm level while creating meaningful shared value directly for farmers.

""Building a better food system is essential to the future health of the earth and all of us"" said Jim Andrew Chief Sustainability Officer PepsiCo. ""At its core PepsiCo is an agricultural company working to spread regenerative agriculture practices that restore the earth and reduce carbon emissions to 7 million acres by 2030. This partnership with ADM marks a sea change in how PepsiCo engages with strategic partners and is expected to help us reach almost one-third of that goal. By enabling greater collaboration through strategic partnerships like this one we can strengthen the livelihoods and resilience of the farmers we work with while building a more sustainable future together.""

""Sustainability is fundamental to ADM: Our growth strategy is underpinned by demand for more sustainable products and our culture compels us to act"" said ADM Chief Sustainability Officer Alison Taylor. ""Last year we expanded on our Strive 35 sustainability goals with a commitment to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2035 and expanding regenerative agriculture practices – as we have with our recent strategic partnerships with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and Farmers Business Network – will be key to reaching that goal. Today's announcement is a major step forward as we work with a partner whose values align with our own to scale up regenerative agriculture in a way few other companies can. We're excited to take the next big step in reducing carbon and making our entire food system more sustainable.""",,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

HP Inc.

When the second HBCU Tech Conference gets underway this week the leadership staff and students of 102 Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the nation will have the opportunity to experience what’s next in higher education. And what’s next includes such tech trends as automation enhancing hybrid learning capabilities and teaching XR (extended reality) in classrooms.

This free virtual conference presented by HP is designed to offer a vision of what digital transformation looks like on HBCU campuses while simultaneously expanding students’ career horizons.

The four-day event will feature keynotes by HP executives including Chief Diversity Officer Lesley Slaton Brown and Global Chief Information Officer Ron Guerrier; as well as workshops product exhibitions from partners Intel and Microsoft and interactive symposiums. There are tracks offering professional development opportunities for IT staffers and faculty members and sessions to help college executives prepare their schools for the future.

The conference — created and spearheaded by HP account manager Boz Bell as an inaugural event last year — is a continuation of HP’s investment in HBCUs. HP joined the National HBCU Business Deans Roundtable as a founding member in 2017 and has since contributed to the organization’s mission to provide essential tools and resources for student success. And since 2017 HP has held its yearly HBCU Business Challenge to engage Black students considering careers in business and technology. These efforts reflect the values of the HP Racial Equality and Social Justice Task Force which aims to double Black and African American technical representation by 2025.

“As an African American female and a graduate of an HBCU Howard University with limited access to technology growing up I want the students to know they have opportunities to be leaders in a technology giant like HP” says LaTasha Gary director of the Sustainable Impact program management office at HP. “The tech industry is evolving at a rapid pace and we need smart people who know how to solve problems and adapt to a dynamic environment.”

Learn about past winners of the HBCU Business Challenge and register for the 6th annual challenge through September 27.

Focus on student success

The biggest development to unfold at this year’s event is the expansion of its student programming. More than 700 HBCU students are expected to take part in the Future of Work Academy (FOWA) a new program that will help them develop professional readiness skills and gain insight into such career paths as animation digital finance and web publishing. Registered students can listen to experts speak about topics like generational wealth social impact and sustainability and have face-time with industry leaders who are searching for new talent. There will also be jobs and internships at HP made available exclusively to conference attendees.

According to HP Global Education Impact Manager Tunde Agboke last year’s event — attended by 372 students — set out to “bring in all the HP heavy-hitters so students can know the lay of the land and see what the industry looks like.” By contrast this year’s student track will take a more hands-on technical approach with demos highlighting specific skills needed to navigate in-demand fields like automation and art and design. Students will then be given resources to help them hone their abilities with those skills.

“Our goal is for students to walk away from their experience with FOWA saying ‘I gained some type of skill that I can activate to help broaden the possibilities I have in front of me’” Agboke says. “We want to make sure they are ready for what the future holds.”

Collaborative competition to spur innovation

The Bot-a-Thon — an innovation incubator challenge in which students create a bot to solve an assigned real-world problem — is making a comeback this year alongside new competitions focused on esports health IT and marketing.

Chukudumebi Uzor a second-year graduate student at Texas Southern University’s Jesse H. Jones School of Business was one of last year’s Bot-a-Thon winners. Her four-person team developed a processor that automatically uploads course lists and syllabi into students’ digital calendars. She is set to reunite with her teammates at this year’s conference to present their winning processor and discuss their design process setbacks and breakthroughs.

Their prize packages included HP laptops and printers as well as Xbox gaming consoles. But for Uzor the connections she made with her fellow attendees was the best takeaway.

“What I learned from the conference was not only working from your headspace but also your heart space — cultivating relationships building bonds and learning to be adaptable” she says.

Agboke said this year’s challenge-winners will receive another invaluable prize — closed-door virtual meetings with HP leaders including president of Personal Systems Alex Cho global head and VP of marketing planning Tara Agen and LaTasha Gary who will discuss all things tech and engage with the students on a personal level about what it’s like to be in the minority while working in the tech space.

“Sharing my career journey from an individual contributor to an executive will hopefully motivate and inspire students to dream big” Gary says.

Expanding Future of Work Academy

Looking forward Agboke said he aims to introduce the FOWA framework to students at community colleges Hispanic-serving institutions Indigenous American-serving institutions as well as schools that primarily serve students with disabilities.

“My vision of what FOWA is and can be for HP” says Agboke “is this ecosystem that allows us to directly impact the life trajectories of the individuals that we’re engaging with. If we continue to create a future where not just HP — but all of our partners — have access to exceptional talent then we’re creating a more diverse tech industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmdsYXcuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLWFuZC1wcmFjdGljZS9ocC1oaXJlcy15YWhvby1nZW5lcmFsLWNvdW5zZWwtanVsaWUtamFjb2JzLWFzLW5ldy1sZWdhbC1jaGllZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Hires Yahoo General Counsel Julie Jacobs as Legal Chief (2),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.bloomberglaw.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business-and-practice/hp-hires-yahoo-general-counsel-julie-jacobs-as-new-legal-chief (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023951F264A0>, 'Connection to news.bloomberglaw.com timed out.

Rugged roadworthy and extremely accurate Siteprint is a super-quick layout tool.

The robot replaces the time-consuming manual process of site layout using a variety of different inks to place precise lines exact curves and faithful reproductions of complex shapes on all kinds of floors from porous surfaces like concrete and plywood to terrazzo vinyl or epoxy.

It doesn't require a perfectly smooth or clean floor – indeed it can handle a certain degree of surface irregularity and obstacles up to 2 cm (0.8 in) high. It runs built-in obstacle and cliff drop sensors for fully autonomous operation and will work around barriers even if they're not in the plans.

As well as layout lines it's capable of printing more or less whatever else you need on the floor too including text notes. Operators set it up using cloud-based tools for job preparation fleet management and tracking and can run it on site with a touch-screen tablet and a tripod-mounted ""totalstation.""

HP claims the SitePrint robot replicated seven hours of manual layout work in 45 minutes in testing with extreme accuracy HP

“The existing manual layout process can be slow and labor intensive” said Albert Zulps Director of Emerging Technology at Skanska - a global construction and development company currently using the SitePrint system for two of its US projects. ""Despite being done by specialists there is always the risk of human error which can result in costly reworks. Layout experts are a scarce resource who add a lot of value in terms of planning and strategy but often end up dedicating most of their time to manual execution. HP SitePrint lets us do more with less helping reduce schedules thanks to a much faster layout process and allowing senior operators to focus on other critical activities like quality control.”

While HP hasn't announced pricing we assume the printer robot itself will be surprisingly cheap but the ink's gonna be a killer. Yuk yuk.

After victories by a combined 100-10 over New Mexico State and Western Illinois coach P.J. Fleck's team enters today's game as a 27½-point favorite over the Buffaloes (0-2). The Gophers padded their stats in the first two games to the point where they lead the nation in total offense total defense and time of possession and now they'll see if they can continue that dominance against a team from a Power Five conference.

Colorado is in another rebuilding year under third-year coach Karl Dorrell whose team lost its opener 38-13 to TCU and fell 41-10 at Air Force last week. Dorrell is 8-12 at Colorado and the Buffaloes fell 30-0 to the Gophers last year in Boulder.

Here are some story lines I'm interested to see today:

Mike Sanford Jr. vs. Joe Rossi

Sanford the Gophers offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2020 and '21 now is in charge of Colorado's offense after being fired by Fleck after last season. He'll match wits with Gophers defensive coordinator Joe Rossi whose troops finished third in the nation in total defense and tied for sixth in scoring defense last season. Rossi knows the coaching styles of Sanford and Clay Patterson the former Gophers tight ends coach now with the Buffaloes but doesn't see a big advantage for either team. ""The guys that were here know our personnel because they saw them in practice every day. They see the scheme on fil'' he said. ""So there's a little bit more familiarity but you know we also have familiarity as well with being able to see some of the things that went on here in terms of scheme and some of the tendencies.''

Gophers offensive line vs. Colorado's defensive line

By playing a Power Five program the Gophers presumably will be facing bigger stronger and faster athletes than they did against FBS independent New Mexico State and FCS level Western Illinois. Colorado looks the part on the defensive line. Along with 6-7 290-pound defensive end Terrance Lang the Buffaloes feature interior linemen Na'im Rodman (6-2 305) Jalen Sami (6-6 325) and Tyas Martin (6-5 340) up front. Led by John Michael Schmitz the nation's highest-rated center by Pro Football Focus the line has played well so far paving the way for 302 rushing yards per game (second nationally) and not allowing a sack. Air Force gashed Colorado for 435 rushing yards with its triple-option attack so the Gophers could be primed for more success on the ground.

Gophers defensive line development

If the Gophers can get an early lead they'll likely force Colorado to pass and that's not a strength for the Buffaloes. J.T. Shrout and Brendon Lewis have combined to pass for 143 yards per game which ranks 121st of 131 teams nationally. The Gophers who have three sacks this season should have opportunities to pressure Shrout and Lewis and succeeding in that area would be a good sign as the team prepares for Big Ten play starting next week.

UPDATE

Gophers wide receiver Daniel Jackson and defensive lineman Austin Booker who missed the first two games of the season because of injuries participated in pregame warmups and appeared ready to return to action.

The induction took place early Friday evening in a club at Huntington Bank Stadium. The inductees also will be introduced to the crowd during the Gophers' football game against lowly Colorado on Saturday.

There was something of a coincidence this week between Gentil playing her first college match and current events.

The 2022 Gophers rated No. 6 nationally were upset by No. 22 Pepperdine in four sets on Thursday night in the Diet Coke Classic.

Twenty years ago Gentil and the Gophers started the 2002 season against preseason No. 8 Pepperdine in a tournament at the Pavilion.

Those Gophers rolled past Pepperdine in three sets. It was also the introduction of a new collegiate position — libero a defensive specialist who could stay in the back row.

The late Mike Hebert then Gophers coach sent his chief recruiter Brian Heffernan to find a libero and he targeted Gentil — playing club volleyball in Orlando by way of her hometown of Fortaleza Brazil a city of 3 million.

""I always had been an outside hitter"" Gentil said. ""That's the way most schools were recruiting me — to be a hitter.

""I give Mike Hebert and Brian Heffernan credit: They saw me as a great fit for libero. They also looked at the new position as being worth a full scholarship which wasn't the case with many coaches.""

It took only that opening upset over Pepperdine for Hebert to have his opinion confirmed.

""If anybody has any player that can dig like [Gentil] I'd like to know about it"" Hebert said at the time. ""She just pulls people with her. She is a real treasure.""

Game 1 of a college career and Hebert never had to change that scouting report.

Paula Gentil helped the Gophers win their first Big Ten title in 2002.

Gentil was a three-time All-America as a libero and remains the lone player to be a three-time winner as the Big Ten's defensive player of the year.

And more important … winning.

""We won the Gophers' first-ever Big Ten title in 2002"" Gentil said. ""We went to back-to-back Final Fours in 2003 and 2004. I wouldn't say we're the reason for all the improvements in facilities and equipment the volleyball program has today but we helped get it started.""

Gentil had a big personality to go with the volleyball skills.

The Gophers won the 2002 Big Ten title on the second-to-last weekend with a win over Indiana. On the first point of the first set Gentil went sprawling to the court and started grabbing a hip in pain. She stayed in the match of course and then was asked what happened?

""Ask my teammate"" said Gentil pointing at Erin Martin. ""She kicked me. She's a little clumsy.""

Martin said: ""She got in the way of my feet.""

Late in the 2004 season Gentil went flying after a ball vs. Penn State and landed on her head.

""I had a CAT scan"" she said. ""They found nothing except that I do have a brain. That was a relief.""

A very well-functioning brain as it turns out. She graduated from the U of M with bachelor's degrees in both genetics/cellular biology and physiology. She has a pair of MBAs including healthcare management.

In 2011-12 Gentil spent 18 months working with an Ernst & Young crew in Luanda Angola.

""They let us leave the hotel for one supervised meal a week"" Gentil said. ""We couldn't go out to buy a pack of gum. We'd be there three weeks fly across the Atlantic for a week at home and then back to Angola.""

She has lived for stretches in Brazil and also in the States. She has made an excellent career in what is described in her company bio as promoting ""true digital transformation in the healthcare business.''

Gentil is now the vice president for strategy operations and partnerships in the Office of Digital Innovation at Johnson & Johnson.

Yeah those folks.

Paula used her father's name Gentil when she came to the States. In Brazil she uses Jereissati her mother Magaly's name.

Gentil was in Sao Paolo a few years ago and met Priscilla. It turned into love and then marriage in December 2019.

""She's a great person"" Gentil said. ""She'll even ride on the back of my new motorcycle a KTM 1290 Super Adventure.

""Brazil … we love motorcycles race cars everything. When I was at school here at the U I was one of the first students racing between classes on those scooters with the tiny wheels.""

Gentil laughed slightly and said: ""I grew up 150 miles from the equator but when I came here on a recruiting trip I committed right away.

""Cold weather? Didn't bother me. Mike [Hebert] was a great coach and person my teammates were the best and the people here …

""I even had my 'Minnesota parents' in Cannon Falls — Pam and Carl Moberg. Pam never missed one of my matches. They made me part of the family.

""Pam died three years ago. That was so sad. Carl lives by Sioux Falls and he'll be here celebrating for me this weekend."""

According to a C-suite executive survey by the IBM Institute for Business Value 97% of enterprises have either piloted implemented or integrated cloud technology in their operations. Yet while enterprises have successfully migrated peripheral smaller workloads most mission-critical workloads are still on-premises.

CIOs have concerns around moving data to the cloud as the migration process can be resource and cost-intensive. C-suite executives also face concerns around concentration risk. If everything is on the same cloud and something happens (for example a data breach) exposure can be significant. And regulations for regulated industries can be complex and stringent.

Notwithstanding running mission-critical applications on a hybrid cloud infrastructure provides myriad benefits including increasing organizations’ flexibility and agility providing dynamic capacity and faster time to market. A modern infrastructure designed with a hybrid cloud strategy allows you to access and modernize mission-critical applications and data and respond quickly to changing market and customer demands. With an open hybrid cloud approach you can get a trusted partner to help with your cloud migration transformation end-to-end.

Let’s look at three companies that successfully migrated their mission-critical workloads. You’ll learn why cloud migration was a must if they were going to speed up business opportunities and processes. You’ll also learn how each client empowered their hybrid cloud future with IBM and SAP.

How Abou Ghaly Motors delivered financial reports 99% faster

Abou Ghaly Motors (AGM) is leading the change in Egypt with integrated mobility solutions for individual corporations. Several years ago AGM deployed SAP ERP to manage CRM-based sales services and marketing practices. However AGM embarked on a digital transformation and needed to move its SAP solutions to a cloud platform. Unfortunately infrastructure connectivity and scalability couldn’t keep pace with the integration of new capabilities.

In sourcing a cloud platform AGM decided on IBM Cloud to provide the efficiency scalability and security-rich features to support AGM’s enterprise-scale SAP workloads. Running on IBM Cloud and supported by the SAP HANA database corporate accounts can now execute complex financial reports up to 99% faster. Branch and service-center employees can access customer data in seconds and IT teams can focus on strategic initiatives rather than managing and maintaining on-premises infrastructure.

AGM was able to respond to market changes quickly with real-time insights by modernizing core ERP to SAP S/4HANA. “Moving to IBM Cloud has helped AGM fast-track our digital transformation” says Khaled Maddah Innovation and Technology Director at AGM. “This migration was an important milestone in our journey that with the support of IBM and SAP has been met.”

How Harry Rosen cut web platform development time in half

Harry Rosen Inc. a made-to-measure menswear store in Toronto’s Cabbagetown opened in 1954 and has since expanded to include 15 retail stores 3 outlets and a robust e-commerce platform. By 2015 the retailer had outgrown its existing IT infrastructure and undertook a digital transformation of their business. Aiming to keep the customer at the center of its business evolution the Harry Rosen company collaborated with IBM Garage™.

The company chose IBM Cloud for VMware Solution as its new public cloud infrastructure. Together the solution provided a flexible IT environment that enables Harry Rosen to swiftly adapt to shifting market demands in an increasingly fast-paced world. Since adopting IBM Cloud Harry Rosen has increased website performance by 100x and shortened the time needed to develop a new website platform by 50% using IBM technology.

“One of the advantages of IBM Cloud is that we no longer have to support the hardware in our IT infrastructure — we know our data is secure and accessible. IBM has provided that level of confidence” says Steve Warriner Chief Technology Officer at Harry Rosen Inc.

How Mondi Group boosted application performance by 20%

Headquartered in London England Mondi Group is a multinational packaging and paper group employing 26000 people at 100 production sites across more than 30 countries in Europe Eurasia North America and Southern Africa. The demand for last-mile delivery packaging has soared alongside the huge growth of home shopping. To capture the opportunities while meeting its rigorous sustainability targets Mondi Group engaged IBM to help move to the next-generation ERP SAP S/4HANA hosted on resilient high-performance IBM® Power Systems servers with IBM FlashSystem® storage.

The new solutions will allow Mondi to unlock new efficiencies even as business volumes grow helping to meet its sustainability goals. Rainer Steffl CIO at Mondi Group says “In partnership with IBM we converted 40 factories across 15 countries to the cutting-edge SAP S/4HANA platform — and the move went perfectly. Although our journey is just beginning we’ve already boosted end-user application performance by 20% empowering our employees to work more effectively than ever. We see that IBM Power Systems servers and IBM FlashSystem storage provide the perfect platform for demanding new analytics workloads in SAP S/4HANA which will help us enhance the efficiency and sustainability of our operations in the future.”

A new way to migrate mission-critical workloads

Many organizations rely on SAP ERP workloads to run front-office and back-office operations. A key value driver for them to move to SAP’s flagship ERP offering — S/4HANA — is to take advantage of the cloud deployment model. A cloud-based ERP solution allows organizations to rapidly adapt their operations to changing market conditions. More than 70% of organizations are planning to deploy S/4HANA on the cloud.

Moving to S/4HANA is a complex transformation and the cloud platform on which it is deployed impacts the time-to-value availability and the ability to continuously innovate. In 2021 IDC surveyed the organizations that moved to S/4HANA and found that clients who deployed on the IBM Cloud platform required the least amount of time to migrate all hyperscalers [1].

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a topical cream — Opzelura — to treat non-segmental vitiligo according to a statement by the manufacturer of the drug Incyte.

Vitiligo is a chronic skin condition where pale white patches develop. It's caused by the loss of melanocytes the cells that give skin its color. The patches can occur anywhere on the body but commonly on the face neck hands and in skin creases. In some cases they can cover large areas.

There is no cure for vitiligo but treatments like Opzelura may help improve the skin's appearance and restore pigment.

Continue reading to learn more about Opzelura how it works and what to expect from this topical treatment.

What is vitiligo?

Around 1.9 and 2.8 million adults in the United States have vitiligo. This chronic condition causes the skin to lose color in patches which often increase in size over time.

The two main types of vitiligo are:

Non-segmental or generalized vitiligo – This is the most common form of vitiligo. It typically results in pale patches on both sides of the body such as both hands. The loss of color may happen quickly and affect a large area.

– This is the most common form of vitiligo. It typically results in pale patches on both sides of the body such as both hands. The loss of color may happen quickly and affect a large area. Segmental vitiligo — This form of vitiligo is much less common and only affects one side of the body. It often affects young children progresses for 1 to 2 years and then stops.

Rarely vitiligo affects the whole body. This is known as universal or complete vitiligo.

Vitiligo happens when pigment-producing cells called melanocytes die or stop producing pigments.

Doctors are not entirely sure why it happens but it may be related to:

an autoimmune condition where the immune cells destroy melanocytes

a family history

a trigger event such as stress or skin trauma

Anyone of any age can develop vitiligo. Often symptoms appear before age 20 and may start in early childhood. It's also more common if you have an autoimmune disease such as psoriasis type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.

What is Opzelura?

Opzelura — active ingredient ruxolitinib 1.5% — was approved by the FDA in September 2021 for mild to moderate eczema (atopic dermatitis). It has now been approved for non-segmental vitiligo in adults and children 12 and older.

It's a selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that works by blocking two enzymes called JAK1 and JAK2. These enzymes are involved in several chemical pathways that contribute to inflammation.

Doctors typically prescribe oral JAK inhibitors for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Opzelura is the only topical JAK inhibitor approved in the US.

Why was it approved?

The approval was based on results from the TRuE-V clinical trial program that included two Phase 3 studies — TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2. Researchers assessed the safety and efficacy of Opzelura compared to a non-medicated cream in over 600 participants aged 12 and above with non-segmental vitiligo covering less than 10% of their bodies.

They used a tool called the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) to gauge the severity of the vitiligo and measure skin re-pigmentation on the face and body.

At 24 weeks around 30% of people using the 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily (BID) had significant improvements of at least 75% in their VASI scores. By comparison only 8% of those treated with the vehicle cream in TRuE-V1 and 13% in TRuE-V2 showed an improvement.

Furthermore more than 15% of those in the Opzelura group achieved over 90% improvement from baseline compared to 2% in the vehicle cream group.

Further data from a 28-week treatment extension showed that the cream continued its positive effects at 52 weeks.

Were there any side effects?

The safety data from the trial also looked good with only minor side effects reported. Up to 15% of the ruxolitinib users noted localized acne bumps. But most people were not concerned with these issues as their vitiligo improved and the bumps disappeared when they stopped the treatment.

Other side effects included:

Itching

Headache

Urinary tract infection

Swelling of the skin

Fever

Nasal cavity inflammation

Why is there a black box warning?

The FDA has placed a black box warning on Opzelura. This is the most serious type of warning meaning the medication may not be suitable for everyone.

The warning is due to data that shows oral JAK inhibitors cause a small increase in the risk of serious infections severe heart issues thrombosis or blood clots and cancer.

However using a topical JAK inhibitor differs from the oral form of the drug and Opzelura contains a far lower concentration of ruxolitinib. In the clinical trials of ruxolitinib the researchers did not observe any of these risks but the FDA is being cautious by including the black box warning.

If you're considering using Opzelura having a conversation with your doctor can help you decide if the benefits outweigh any potential risks.

How do I use Opzelura?

For non-segmental vitiligo apply a thin layer of Opzelura cream to the affected areas twice daily. You shouldn't use the cream on more than 10% of your skin and it's important to avoid your eyes mouth and vagina.

If you have any form of localized skin infection you shouldn't use the cream unless you check with your doctor first. It's also a good idea to check with your doctor if you can safely use Opzelura while taking other medications.

Conclusion

The US Food and Drug Administration has now approved Opzelura for non-segmental vitiligo. This topical cream contains the active ingredient ruxolitinib 1.5%. It is a JAK inhibitor that helps reduce inflammation and repigment skin.

Clinical trials have shown that Opzelura is safe and effective but the FDA has placed a black box warning on the medication. This is because oral JAK inhibitors increase the risk of some serious health conditions. However Opzelura contains a far lower concentration of ruxolitinib.

Anyone interested in taking Opzelura should discuss the benefits and potential risks with their doctor.

Key takeaways

The FDA has now approved topical Opzelura to treat non-segmental vitiligo.

Vitiligo is a skin condition that results in loss of pigmentation.

Ruxolitinib 1.5% is the active ingredient in Opzelura a JAK inhibitor that helps reduce inflammation.

That became less true beginning in the mid-2000s when the modern ""Core"" branding was created to emphasize the company's then-new multi-core processor offerings. But it was still sometimes about the Pentiums—Pentium and Celeron have both soldiered on into the modern era as brand names for low-end desktop and laptop CPUs.

But the labels may not be long for this world even in that diminished capacity. Intel announced today that its laptop chips will shed the Pentium and Celeron branding beginning in Q1 of 2023 to be replaced by ""Intel Processor."" The word ""Processor"" has a capital P so that you don't confuse an Intel Processor with an Intel processor.

Intel VP Josh Newman claims that unifying the Pentium and Celeron families together under one nondescript umbrella ""will simplify [Intel's] offerings so users can focus on choosing the right processor for their needs."" But this rebranding doesn't necessarily mean that the lineup is being simplified; Pentium and Celeron laptop chips are spread out across two distinct product families with two entirely different architectures one based on low-power Atom cores and another based on the same Alder Lake architecture as Intel's flagship CPUs. Assuming that Intel Processors still come with model numbers they will become even more important for people who want to know exactly which Intel processor they're buying.

We don't know how many Intel Processors are launching in Q1 of 2023 or which Intel processor architecture they will use. Intel also wouldn't tell us whether low-end desktop Intel processors will become Intel Processors in the future (a company spokesperson would only tell us that Intel has no low-end desktop CPUs slated to launch in Q1 of 2023). However Intel processors that currently use the Pentium and Celeron branding will continue to do so—they won't be rebranded as Intel Processors retroactively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1yZXRpcmVzLWNlbGVyb24tYW5kLXBlbnRpdW0tYnJhbmRzLWZvci1sYXB0b3Bz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's 'Intel Processor' to Replace Pentium Celeron Brands for Laptops in 2023,"Intel will decommission its legendary Celeron and Pentium brands used for basic notebook CPUs. Instead starting in 2023 they will be referred to as the rather humble ""Intel Processor"" name. The move will allow the company to sharpen its focus on premium Core Evo and vPro brands and sell more premium CPUs.

For now Intel will continue to use Celeron and Pentium brands for desktop and embedded applications. When asked how this branding change would affect desktops Intel told us ""Desktop has no new products in this segment slated for Q1 '23.""

Intel's notebook product stack today includes a variety of Core-branded processors for high-performance mid-range and entry-level laptops as well as Pentium and Celeron-badged CPUs for inexpensive essential systems. Starting from 2023 with notebooks Intel will unite its Pentium and Celeron product families under the Intel Processor umbrella and will continue to address respective market segments. The new brand leaves unchanged Intel's existing processors (they will sell under their own names) and the company's product roadmap.

""The new Intel Processor branding will simplify our offerings so users can focus on choosing the right processor for their needs"" said Josh Newman Intel vice president and interim general manager of Mobile Client Platforms.

While the merge may clear up some confusion between various Pentium and Celeron-branded laptop offerings it might also create some new puzzlements.

Intel's mobile Pentium Gold products are based on the company's designs featuring high-performance or high-performance and energy-efficient cores therefore offering an experience comparable to that of fully-fledged Core processors. For example the company currently offers Pentium Gold-badged Alder Lake CPUs with one high-performance Golden Cove and four energy-efficient Gracemont cores (8505).

Intel's mobile Celeron processors are also based on the company's designs with performance (6305) or performance and efficient cores (7305). However since they sit below mobile Pentiums they have lower clocks have smaller caches or lack certain features. Yet these are still quite capable chips for basic workloads.

Merging mobile Pentium Gold and Celeron product families into one Intel Processor lineup makes sense on the condition that model numbers accurately represent their performance and capabilities.

There are other Celeron and Pentium-branded processors for laptops too. Intel's mobile Celeron N and Pentium Silver processors are based on energy-efficient Atom-class cores and barely offer performance that is even slightly close to that of mobile Pentium Gold and 'vanilla' Celeron CPUs with high-performance cores. Intel did not update these product families this year as its Alder Lake-N design featuring only energy-efficient Gracemont cores is not yet here. But Intel is certainly prepping these system-on-chips for launch and they might address market segments of Celeron N and Pentium Silver.

We do not know whether or not Intel plans to add Alder Lake-N into the Intel Processor lineup for mobile PCs. But if it does pouring in designs based solely on energy-efficient Atom-class cores into the lineup with quite different chips will create a lot of confusion."

For one day the New York Stock Exchange was purple the day of the Horned Frog at one of the most iconic places in the world.

TCU took full advantage of its unique opportunity on Friday seizing a moment on center stage to showcase the university to a worldwide audience on the occasion of its forthcoming 150th birthday.

Horned Frog leaders including Chancellor Victory Boschini and Daniel Pullin the John V. Roach Dean of the Neeley School of Business ascended the platform overlooking the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange to ring the closing bell.

TCU's party both on the platform and those who watched from below began chanting ""TCU! TCU! TCU!""

“This is an exciting moment for TCU. For 150 years we have been educating students to lead in the global community” Boschini said in a statement. “We’re ready for the next 150 years as we continue to innovate and prepare the next generation of leaders. With this bell-ringing we recognize and celebrate the thousands of Horned Frogs working in business strategy and finance leading enterprise here on Wall Street on Main Street and around the world.”

Alumni students members of the TCU Board of Trustees and administrators were also present for the moment.

Among students Brandon Fox TCU’s Student Body president was representing. Others including Student Body president of the John V. Roach Honors College Marina Magnant Luke Savage and Jillian Johnson stood for interviews with the New York Stock Exchange’s archivist.

SuperFrog was there too. New Yorkers have seen everything but never a frog looking as if he had been dipped in purple roaming the streets of Lower Manhattan.

Before the bell ringing John Tuttle vice chairman and chief commercial officer of the New York Stock Exchange Group welcomed TCU's traveling party. Tuttle donning a purple tie for his special guests presented the TCU contingent with a history of the place where they stood and the significance of what they were about to do.

“In today’s global economy our graduates from the TCU Neeley School of Business have what they need — the academic background the ethical compass and the connections to drive success” Pullin said. “Texas is a growing hub for corporate leadership and our students are taking what they’ve learned here in Fort Worth and utilizing those skills and values across the globe. It is an honor to celebrate the Neeley School of Business TCU and all Horned Frogs on the national stage at the iconic New York Stock Exchange.”

This compares to earnings of $1.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.65%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30 delivering a surprise of -19.25%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

International Flavors which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $1.27 billion for the quarter ended September 2019 missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.61%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $907.55 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have lost about 9.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.43 on $1.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.19 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

IP,International Paper,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3doeS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXBhcGVyLXBhcGVyLXN0b2Nrcy1qdXN0LWNyYXNoZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why International Paper WestRock and Packaging Corp. Stocks All Crashed Today,"Paper companies look cheap -- and as it turns out there's a reason for that.

What happened

There was a sell-off in cardboard packaging stocks this morning with shares of International Paper (IP -3.16%) down 9.4% at 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday Packaging Corporation of America (PKG -0.54%) shares down 9.7% and the stock of WestRock (WRK -0.12%) down 9.8%.

So what

Shares of FedEx (FDX 1.40%) plunged more than 22% this morning after the company issued an earnings warning predicated on softening global volume. The volume FedEx referred to was the number of packages wrapped in cardboard and shipped to customers. And if that volume is down then it makes sense that the demand for cardboard around the world might be falling as well.

Investment bank Jefferies cut its ratings on each of the three paper stocks this morning. International Paper and Packaging Corp. both suffered actual downgrades to underperform (sell) with price targets set at $31 and $112 respectively. WestRock barely dodged the downgrade bullet being left at hold but its price target was cut 7% to $42 per share according to a report from The Fly this morning. And that's not even the bad news.

In announcing its downgrades Jefferies didn't say its decision was based exclusively (or even primarily) on FedEx's earnings warning but rather warned that there's a ""massive inventory glut"" in cardboard.

Orders for cardboard packaging are slowing down sharply the analyst says. Manufacturers like International Paper Packaging Corp. and WestRock are likely to slash prices in the fourth quarter. And because new cardboard manufacturing capacity is still coming on line Jefferies expects this situation to get worse in 2023.

Now what

That's miserable news for the paper companies and for investors who are still expecting paper profits to surge this year. Expectations are for 2022 earnings growth of 10% at International Paper 18% at WestRock and 30% at Packaging Corp. according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence with at worst modest retreats in profitability in 2023.

At present we don't know exactly how bad the damage might get only that Jefferies is expecting it to get really bad. But there's good news here too.

All three of these stocks still trade at rather modest valuations: just 11 times trailing earnings for WestRock 11.2 times for International Paper and 12.2 for Packaging Corp. And all three pay very respectable above-market dividend yields. International Paper the most recognizable name of the three has nearly the lowest P/E ratio and by far the greatest dividend yield at 4.7%.

But if I were in the market for a cardboard company and interested in taking advantage of today's sell-off to buy just one stock I think I'd go with Packaging Corporation of America. At 12.2 times earnings it's more expensive than the others but its 3.8% dividend yield is more than generous. And if hard times are coming Packaging Corp.'s $2 billion net debt load is the smallest and the easiest to manage giving it the best chance of emerging from this downturn unscathed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvc3RvY2tzLW1ha2luZy10aGUtYmlnZ2VzdC1tb3Zlcy1wcmVtYXJrZXQtZmVkZXgtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1wYXBlci11YmVyLWFuZC1tb3JlLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9zdG9ja3MtbWFraW5nLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LW1vdmVzLXByZW1hcmtldC1mZWRleC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXBhcGVyLXViZXItYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: FedEx International Paper Uber and more,"Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:

International Paper (IP) – The packaging and paper products company was downgraded to ""underperform"" from ""hold"" at Jefferies which pointed to decelerating orders and an inventory glut in the industry.

Galvanize wurde von der Risikokapitalgesellschaft für Biowissenschaften ATP (Apple Tree Partners) gegründet und aufgebaut ursprünglich als drei Unternehmen - Gala Therapeutics Galaxy Medical und Galvanize Therapeutics - die vor kurzem zu einem Unternehmen unter dem Namen Galvanize Therapeutics fusionierten. Die Finanzierungsrunde wurde von Fidelity Management & Research Company geleitet mit Beteiligung von Intuitive Surgical ATP und Gilmartin Capital.

Jonathan Waldstreicher M.D. founder and CEO of Galvanize Therapeutics and a partner at ATP

„Wir sind sehr erfreut über dieses Vertrauensvotum unserer Investoren in unsere Technologieplattform und unser Team da wir bestrebt sind Patienten auf der ganzen Welt transformative elektrochirurgische Therapien anzubieten"" sagte Dr. Jonathan Waldstreicher Gründer und CEO von Galvanize Therapeutics und Partner bei ATP. „Wir haben die anpassbare Aliya-Energieplattform entwickelt um Patienten in einer Vielzahl von schwierigen Krankheitskategorien zu helfen und die Integration unserer marktspezifischen Strategien und innovativen Produkte in Galvanize ist ein spannender Meilenstein in der Umsetzung unserer Vision. Wir investieren in erheblichem Umfang um die Sicherheit zu beweisen und verbesserte Ergebnisse bei unseren ersten klinischen Zielen zu zeigen und wir erforschen weiterhin zusätzliche Anwendungen der Plattform.""

Ausgehend von der Krankheitsbiologie und der Frage wie Energie die Zellphysiologie verändern kann entwickelte Galvanize die Aliya-Energieplattform zur Erzeugung von Hochspannung und hochfrequentem elektrischem Strom um die Zellfunktionen im Gewebe zu beeinträchtigen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Ablationsmodalitäten ist die Aliya-Energie nicht thermisch. Die elektrischen Wellenformen sind so konzipiert dass sie über einzelne monopolare Elektroden abgegeben werden um konsistentere und vorhersehbarere Behandlungszonen mit minimaler Muskelkontraktion zu ermöglichen die zuvor bei Hochspannungstechnologien auftraten.

Eine Kernplattform mehrere Ziele

Galvanize entwickelt und vermarktet seine Energieplattform für verschiedene Indikationen und passt seine Kerntechnologie für jede Anwendung an:

Chronische Bronchitis: Das RheOx®-System ist eine minimal-invasive bronchoskopische Therapie die die abnormen schleimproduzierenden Zellen in den Atemwegen von Patienten mit chronischer Bronchitis reduziert. RheOx besitzt das CE-Zeichen und wurde vor kurzem in ausgewählten Krankenhäusern in Italien der Schweiz Dänemark und Deutschland eingeführt wobei jede Woche neue Kunden RheOx einsetzen. Nachdem die US-Arzneimittelbehörde (FDA) RheSolve den Status „Breakthrough Device Designation"" zuerkannt hat werden derzeit in den USA und in Europa Patienten in die klinische Studie aufgenommen um einen Antrag auf Marktzulassung (PMA) für RheOx in den USA zu unterstützen.

Herzrhythmusstörungen: Das CENTAURI™-System unterbricht abweichende elektrische Signale im Herzen die Herzrhythmusstörungen einschließlich Vorhofflimmern verursachen. CENTAURI liefert eine neuartige proprietäre Wellenform und ist mit mehreren auf dem Markt befindlichen Kathetern und Mapping-Systemen kompatibel. CENTAURI hat das CE-Zeichen und wird derzeit in Europa eingeführt.

Weichteilablation: Das Aliya™-System hat vor kurzem die 510(k)-Zulassung der FDA für die Weichteilablation erhalten. Über eine einzige perkutane Elektrode die in das Zielgewebe eingeführt wird gibt der Arzt eine vorprogrammierte Energiedosis ab. Aliya wird jetzt in ausgewählten Krankenhäusern in den USA eingeführt.

Immuno-Onkologie: Die Aliya™-Energieplattform wird zur Behandlung von soliden Tumoren untersucht indem der PEF-vermittelte Zelltod mit der Bildung von Neoantigenen kombiniert wird um das Immunsystem des Patienten zur Aktivierung gegen den Tumor anzuregen. Galvanizes präklinische Daten und frühe klinische Daten aus der INCITE-ES-Studie die außerhalb der USA durchgeführt wurde haben Signale der Immunaktivierung gezeigt.

Verabreichung von Medikamenten: Ein System zur lokalen Verabreichung von therapeutischen Wirkstoffen befindet sich in der Entwicklung.

RheOx und CENTAURI wurden in den ATP-Portfoliounternehmen Gala Therapeutics (gegründet 2015) bzw. Galaxy Medical (gegründet 2020) entwickelt die nun beide Teil von Galvanize Therapeutics sind.

„ATP tätigt Investitionen um unglaubliche wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse in Behandlungen umzusetzen die Leben verändern können und ich glaube dass die Energieplattform Galvanize PEF ein Beispiel für die bemerkenswerten Durchbrüche ist die wir mit unserem einzigartigen Investitions- und Inkubationsmodell erzielen können"" sagte Dr. Seth Harrison Gründer und geschäftsführender Gesellschafter von ATP. „ATP hat über Jahre hinweg in den Aufbau einer anpassungsfähigen therapeutischen Geräteplattform investiert die in der Lage ist einige der hartnäckigsten medizinischen Probleme zu lösen für die es bisher noch keine Medikamente gibt und es ist erfreulich zu sehen dass diese Vision Wirklichkeit wird. Das Team von Galvanize hat geniale Lösungen für Patienten und ihre Ärzte entwickelt die sie nun tagtäglich in die Gesundheitssysteme einbringen.""

Doug Godshall Präsident und CEO von Shockwave Medical und Vorsitzender von Saluda Medical der zuvor Vorsitzender von Gala Therapeutics war wurde zum Vorsitzenden des Vorstands von Galvanize Therapeutics ernannt. Herr Godshall kommentierte: „Bei Gala konnten wir in den letzten Jahren beobachten welche lebensverändernden Ergebnisse RheOx bei geschwächten Patienten mit chronischer Bronchitis erzielen kann und ich freue mich darauf mit dem gesamten Galvanize-Team zusammenzuarbeiten wenn es seine Bemühungen ausweitet."" Er fügte hinzu:

„Galvanize ist einzigartig weil Jon und sein talentiertes Team eine einzige hoch entwickelte Technologie für drei einzigartige klinische Anwendungen entwickelt haben. Mit einem umfangreichen Portfolio an klinischen Studien die bereits laufen bin ich sehr beeindruckt von dem was das Team bisher erreicht hat und ich bin begeistert von den bedeutenden Auswirkungen die Galvanize für ein breites Spektrum von Patienten haben wird.""

The investors have submitted plans for 83000 sq ft of logistics space in Trafford as they continue building their last-mile warehousing portfolio.

Invesco Real Estate and Barwood Capital joined forces earlier this year to buy four acres off Neary Way from Peel L&P and announced plans to create a £300m industrial portfolio.

At the time Andy Rofe managing director at Invesco Real Estate Europe said the strategy was in response to “pressure on global supply chains”.

“We recognise the need for ‘edge of town’ distribution assets as many firms reshape their operations to address the challenges of the ‘just in time’ delivery model” Rofe said.

Four months on the joint venture has submitted plans to Trafford Council for 83000 sq ft of industrial accommodation across 11 units. The units will range in size from 2000 sq ft to 14300 sq ft.

Satplan is advising on planning and C4 Projects is leading on design.

The site is located next to the 143000 sq ft Trafford Retail Park which Peel L&P sold to UK Commercial Property REIT for £33m last September.

He called him our state's ""Johnny Appleseed."" Matthews after all spread his seeds of golf-course design all over the upper and lower peninsulas building courses in more than half of Michigan's 83 counties most notably during the golf boom of the 1990s.

Matthews who designed or renovated more than 200 courses and opened at least 90 courses in Michigan died Thursday shortly after being honored for his lifetime of work in the industry during a ceremony at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.

Bill Hobson of Michigan Golf Live posted about Matthews' death on social media. Matthews was 88.

""If you've played golf in Michigan you've likely played one of the great courses designed by this special humble brilliant man"" Hobson wrote in announcing Matthews' death.

""Thank you Matthews family for sharing Jerry with us for so long.""

Matthews son of golf-course architect Bruce Matthews was born in Grand Rapids in 1934 and got his first taste of the golf business at the age of 12 working at his father's Green Ridge Country Club which in the 1980s was sold off and became what now is Egypt Valley.

Jerry Matthews attended Michigan State earning a bachelor's in landscape architecture before joining his father's design business in 1960.

Bruce Matthews retired in 1979 and Jerry took over the business based in Lansing.

In the 1990s amid a golf boom when courses were opening pretty much everywhere across the country at a frantic pace — reaching its peak late in the decade after the emergence of Tiger Woods — Michigan was leading the pace and Jerry Matthews was front and center of it all.

""I like Michigan and I was really lucky to come along with my dad at that point in history"" Jerry Matthews once told NBC. ""There was so much work and I was learning so much.""

As for why he rarely ventured outside of Michigan he once said: ""I learned I'd rather be here than spending so much time in airports or on planes.""

In 1991 Michigan opened eight new courses and Matthews designed five of them according to NBC. From 1995-97 he opened 17 golf courses.

Among Matthews' notable designs: Timberstone in Iron Mountain The Majestic at Lake Walden Buck's Run in Mount Pleasant and Hawk Hollow in Bath. He also designed St. Ives at Tullymore and Sundance at A-Ga-Ming. Berry considers Sundance and Bucks Run as Matthews' 1-2 punch.

""If you play golf in Michigan chances are that you have enjoyed Jerry's work"" said Chris Whitten executive director of the Golf Association of Michigan. ""Michigan golf is better because of Jerry's passion effort care and friendship.

""We send our deepest condolences to the Matthews family.""

Said Jason Straka president of the American Society of Golf Architects: “Jerry’s legacy of course design and the impact of his service to ASGCA will carry on. And his commitment to teaching the next generation of golf industry professionals showed the value he placed on paying it forward.”

Matthews was inducted into the Michigan Golf Hall of Fame in 2005 and is a past president of the American Society of Golf Architects. While many golf-course designers try to build the biggest toughest and trickiest golf courses perhaps to collect all those ranking points from the golf publications Matthews had a reputation for creating understated layouts. He ""didn't overdo his layouts"" said former News sportswriter Lynn Henning a Matthews acquaintance and instead preferred to let the natural terrain dictate the layout. That helped him avoid ""bad"" holes Henning said. He passed his philosophy on to the younger generation of architects.

Matthews who also earned a master's degree in urban planning from Michigan State and taught at his alma mater was a mentor to many in the golf-course design business including nephew Bruce and Ray Hearn.

Hearn learned of Matthews' death Friday while on a work trip in Montana.

""Oh my goodness Jerry was by far one of the kindest guys in the golf-course design industry"" said Hearn who spent 10 years working for Matthews before branching off to his own firm and fondly recalls Matthews taking his employees to his cottage on the sun-rise side of the state for weekends of fly-fishing and spirited golf-design conversations. ""Jerry was what I would call a naturalist. Jerry liked to honor the land.""

Matthews' death is the latest among some of the best in the golf-course design business. Pete Dye died in 2000; Arthur Hills with quite the footprint in Michigan as well died in 2021; and Tom Weiskopf major champion-turned-designer died in August.

Matthews died at the hotel where he and wife Carol were married. Carol was on this week's trip with him as was course-design colleague Paul Albanese. The plan for a Friday golf outing was for Albanese to hit shots for the groups on the 12th hole while Matthews was to sit there in a rocking chair. The rocking chair was there still albeit empty following the death of Matthews 90 minutes after he was honored Thursday night.

Matthews by the way had some courses in the works — all of them in Michigan of course.

""He still had projects"" Hobson told The News on Friday morning. ""He brought plans with him.""

Hosting Johnny Bryan (J.B.) Hunt founder of what had become America’s third largest trucking company was then-Santa Fe President Michael R. Haverty (later CEO of Kansas City Southern and now retired).

As Haverty who earned entry with other railroad visionaries—including Alfred E. Perlman Louis W. Menk John W. Barriger III D. William Brosnan and W. Graham Claytor Jr.—into the National Railroad Hall of Fame recalls “J.B. was transfixed by other intermodal trains passing in the opposite direction.” As parallel-to-rail highways came into view Hunt took equal measure of the procession of 18-wheelers each requiring one driver.

A fourth-generation railroader who worked as a switchman and brakeman before earning an MBA and moving up the management ranks Haverty interspersed his sales pitch with explanations of rail operating practices and how UPS—idolized by Hunt for its operating efficiency and service reliability—had become Santa Fe’s biggest intermodal customer.

Within days Railway Age’s 2001 Railroader of the Year had convinced Hunt to ink a contract creating a dedicated premium-priced intermodal service on Santa Fe named Quantum growing to some 600000 loads annually by 2005.

Were today’s rail CEOs to shift from reading stock quotations at 30000 feet to inviting their labor union leaders to join them in inspecting the railroad at human-eye level disturbing scenes would appear quite different than what energized Hunt to shift his trailers from road to rail.

On rail-parallel highways between Dallas and Atlanta for example rail labor chiefs might see semi-autonomous trucks operating whose artificial intelligence is learning—and with federal subsidies no less—to navigate federally constructed and state maintained Interstate highways without drivers.

Evolving technology embraced by truckers threatens to reverse Haverty’s intermodal vision and visit on railroads and those dependent on them—including employees and their families—destructive long-term consequences.

In the Dallas-Atlanta demonstration project one driver monitors a lead tractor-trailer with a second 30 feet behind controlled autonomously—a second driver aboard only to operate the rig the first and last mile and otherwise rest to comply with hours-of-service regulations before switching places with the lead rig. The result is near round-the-clock equipment utilization. Should both drivers be eliminated and battery-operated tractors substituted truck operating costs will be slashed 30%. Grey heads may balk at driverless technology but not so impatient younger whiz bangs designing it.

The competitive challenge for rail is to match these cost reductions as trucking’s greater service capabilities require rail intermodal pricing to be below that of motor carrier rivals.

With the collapse of bedrock coal traffic intermodal now keeps rail earnings buoyant but that market similarly will evaporate if railroads are blocked from squeezing more productivity out of their own technological advancements such as Positive Train Control (PTC) which allows for redeployment of on-board conductors to more productive ground-based positions.

Productivity advances of rail rivals are making labor’s inflexible opposition to conductor redeployment toxic to future rail profitability—the golden goose funding job security and wage growth.

Labor-management collaboration is essential to determine the most productive use of train crews rewriting of safety rules and contractual improvements in conductor and engineer lifestyles—enrichments that include more predictable work schedules fewer off-hours away from home and furlough protection. That collaboration is necessary at the national level if seamless train operation over an interconnected and highly interdependent rail network is to be preserved.

With acknowledgment that rival trucking not management is the enemy of rail labor collaboration can extend to joint design of next generation train control and adjustments to Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) to correct its negative aspects while preserving PSR’s ability to improve asset utilization and deliver service reliability at lowest operating cost.

Failure to reason together in assuring more intelligent productivity enhancements as offered by PTC and PSR only ensures both rail labor and carriers will be devoured by the sword of greater motor carrier flexibility and its embrace of technological advancements.

Company President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Pragada will succeed him the Dallas-based firm announced on Sept. 15.

Demetriou will continue as executive board chair ""for a minimum of two years"" and Pragada will join the board the publicly traded firm said in the announcement. The succession will take effect on Jan. 23 the date of the firm's annual shareholder meeting.

As of Aug. 29 Jacobs adopted the new name for its parent company altered from Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. a change that ""more closely aligns with Jacobs' public identity as a global technology-forward solutions company"" the company said.

The firm reported revenue of $14.1 billion last year up from $13.6 billion in 2020 with 55000 employees.

""Steve Demetriou can be credited for the transformation of Jacobs making a number of strategic yet bold moves to re-rate the company"" said Jamie Cook lead industry sector analyst at Credit Suisse in a Sept. 15 note to investors also referring to his sale of Jacobs' energy chemicals and resources division to Worley in 2018 for $3.2 billion. It had 57600 employees at the time. Under Demetriou Jacobs also acquired major player CH2M in 2017 a key transformational move.

Cook added that through ""strategic acquisitions"" he ""pivoted Jacobs’ portfolio to higher margin growth markets. The re-rate was so successful many of [Jacobs'] peers have followed the same playbook.""

The CEO also pushed for new initiatives to diversify its executive ranks and board with the company saying they now are 67% and 50% diverse across gender and ethnicity He also added new corporate focus on climate change response and ESG according to Jacobs.

Jacobs reported on Aug. 9 net earnings for its fiscal third quarter from continuing operations of $196 million compared to $166 million for the same quarter in 2021. The company reported quarter revenue of $3.83 billion compared to $3.58 billion for the same period last year and $11.04 billion for the nine-month period compared to $10.51 billion for the same nine months in 2021.

About 27% of Jacobs' revenue comes from non-construction-related markets in health and life sciences (11%) and national security (16%). Another 11% falls under the category of space some of which involve facility construction for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with other revenue from consulting or engineering related to flight control and operations and equipment.

Cook added that Pragada ""has been instrumental in developing and leading the successful execution of Jacobs' strategy.""

Pragada joined Jacobs initially in 2006 as a vice president but left in 2014 to become CEO of The Brock Group Houston one of the largest U.S. industrial services subcontractors. He returned to Jacobs in 2016 as a group president. Pragada is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and began his career in the Navy as a civil engineer corps and construction battalion officer.

He was cited in 2021 by WashingtonExec magazine with its Chief Officer Award for a public company based on ""innovation expertise impact and thought leadership"" it said.

In sharing his view of the impact of inclusive leadership at ENR's Top Young Professional conference last year Pragada an Indian-American said Jacobs operates with inclusivity a key factor in its growth. He noted recently announced initiatives to increase use of minority and women suppliers and to invest $10 millon to support Black education.

The executive stressed the importance of accountability noting required inclusion and diversity goals for all Jacobs' managers “This is a walk the talk"" he said. ""We've made it part of our culture day in and day out. We are far from there but we hold ourselves accountable.""

Going forward Pragada said ""It is an exciting time for Jacobs. We have just launched our bold new strategy and are at the forefront of our industry.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZGFsbGFzaW5ub3ZhdGVzLmNvbS9qYWNvYnMtcmV2ZWFscy1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLXBsYW4tdG8tZW5zdXJlLWdyb3d0aC1vZi1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtc2VydmljZXMtY29tcGFueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dallas-Based Jacobs Reveals CEO Succession Plan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='dallasinnovates.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /jacobs-reveals-succession-plan-to-ensure-growth-of-professional-services-company/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395240AE60>, 'Connection to dallasinnovates.com timed out.

There are fears of gaps and missed opportunities.

The No. 18 company on the 2022 Washington Technology Top 100 is looking to mitigate that risk by announcing a CEO succession plan that takes effect in January 2023.

Jacobs Chairman and CEO Steve Demetriou is handing the chief executive title to current president and chief operating officer Bob Pragada. Demetriou will continue as executive chairman of the board.

The changes are effective Jan. 24 2023 -- the date of the company’s annual shareholder meeting.

“With a strong foundation and clear trajectory in place now is the right time to implement our succession plan"" Demetriou said in a release Thursday.

Demetriou has led the company for seven years during which the company has broadened its footprint in the government market beyond its roots as an engineering-and-construction firm: so much so that they in fact dropped that E&C label entirely.

A key element of Jacobs' reinvention was its 2019 acquisition of KeyW Corp. to gain portfolio of products and services for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance; space-based remote sensing; and so-called “mission IT” areas like cloud computing infrastructure and analytics.

Other acquisitions have followed: first the Buffalo Group in 2020 and then BlackLynx in 2021. Those built on the KeyW transaction by adding more cyber products and solutions and intelligence agency customers.

""We have just launched our bold new strategy and are at the forefront of our industry – anticipating the global trends most important to our clients and developing differentiated data-enabled solutions that meet their needs” Pragada said.

Demetriou will remain executive chairman for at least two years the company said.

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL21heW9yLWpvaG5zb24tZmlyc3QteWVhci1pbi1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayor Johnson on the record: The full Tribune Q&A as he approaches 1 year in office,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.chicagotribune.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2024/05/12/mayor-johnson-first-year-in-office/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952F398D0>, 'Connection to www.chicagotribune.com timed out.

The incident occurred as Harvard affiliates Cambridge residents and activists from other Boston-area universities gathered on Saturday at the Science Center Plaza to protest the Israeli offensive into Rafah and condemn Harvard placing student protesters on involuntary leaves of absence.

According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano the protest was attended by “persons not affiliated and affiliated with the University.”

“Officers believe the lock was intentionally cut by someone within the Yard to permit access to the Yard by approximately 150 protestors” Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson.

HUPD officers responding to a report of a cut lock found an abandoned bag containing bolt cutters inside the Yard on Saturday around 7 p.m. according to Catalano. Johnston Gate has been locked since late April as University leadership indefinitely closed the Yard to the public amid the ongoing pro-Palestinian encampment.

“There was no breach of the Yard” Catalano wrote in a follow-up email. “Officers immediately responded to the gate to secure it.”

Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine the student group that organized the encampment did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in a statement that “safety and security of the Harvard community remains the University’s top priority as we continue to manage the ongoing disruption resulting from the encampment.”

“The intentional step by what appears to have been someone inside Harvard Yard to cut a lock on the Johnston Gate during a protest is extremely concerning” Swain wrote.

While interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber ’76 previously said the University has a “very high bar” before it will resort to police action against the encampment the breach of a bolt lock during a large-scale protest outside Yard likely does not fall too far short of Garber’s threshold.

Interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber sits in a February interview in his office at Massachusetts Hall. Garber said he would not rule out police response to student protest but that it would need a high bar. By Marina Qu

HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay said in an April interview that while the University administration cannot simply request that the department arrest any individuals arrests may occur in the case of “significant property damage or physical violence at any level.”

The protest and the attempt to cut the lock comes amid rising tensions between protesters and administrators who have also taken disciplinary action against more than 60 students for participating in the encampment and placed more than 20 students on involuntary leave of absences.

Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine the group organizing the encampment said Friday they had rejected an offer from Garber to end the encampment and avoid being placed on involuntary leave. Hours later administrators sent letters to at least 20 students informing them they had been placed on leave and barring them from campus.

The encampment remained in the Yard as of Sunday evening despite a requirement that most undergraduates move off campus by midday Sunday. It remains unclear how administrators intend to deal with the encampment just days ahead of the University’s Commencement ceremonies.

During the Saturday protest Harvard Divinity School student Noa Sepharia said she would continue protesting despite being placed on leave.

“Hey Garber I’m still here — and I’m not going anywhere until Harvard divests from genocide” Sepharia said.

Swain wrote in the statement that there have been increasing reports from “frontline staff” of harassment by encampment participants.

“This behavior includes reports of staff being yelled at and encircled by protesters as they do their work as well as being confronted followed and subjected to audio and video recording” Swain wrote. “These reports are not only from staff carrying out ID checks and other work to enforce policies but also from staff while going about routine duties.”

Meanwhile the administrators have also attempted to film members of the encampment after they started to refuse regular ID checks. Dean of Student Services Michael Burke used his mobile phone to film protesters who used keffiyehs surgical masks and sunglasses to hide their identities.

The cut lock is the most recent instance of a breach of security into Harvard Yard. Since the start of the encampment the University’s security and facilities staff have reported multiple instances of attempts to breach gate locks and pry open the Yard’s gates according to Swain.

Last week police observed two College students passing supplies over a gate to the Yard to unidentified individuals whom they believed climbed over the wall.

In a separate incident verbal trespassing warnings were issued last Tuesday to four individuals who climbed over the 1870th gate according to HUPD police logs.

The Giants drafted the 6-foot-6 259-pound Johnson in Round 4 No. 107 overall. Can Johnson develop into a more productive NFL player than he was as a college player?

“It’s really exciting for me because I think I have a super high ceiling. I think I haven’t even scratched the surface of what I’m capable of. I’m really looking forward to proving every day that I’m out here” Johnson said Saturday after the second of two rookie mini-camp practices.

“I think I have tremendous room to improve. I think I can grow a lot more than where I’m at right now. I think that’s why I’m so excited. I’m coming in here with a learning mindset. I want to develop respect from my teammates and my coaches. I think that’s going to help me continue to grow and improve. But I’m super excited to get to work and get going here because I think I have a potential to be a really special player here.”

The Giants certainly hope so. They traded for veteran Darren Waller a year ago hoping he could be a difference-making tight end. After one mediocre season in which leg injuries limited his availability Waller might retire.

That likely is part of the reason the Giants drafted Johnson.

“I think the big thing for me is consistency. Being consistent” Johnson said. “I’ll flash a lot of really good things on tape but it’s putting all that stuff together every single snap that’s going to help me reach my potential.

“Consistency comes from repetition doing it a lot and then being very detail oriented. Being very honest with yourself when you’re watching film and then having a coach that’s going to hold you to that standard every single day and not let the little stuff slide. I think that’s a big part of having consistent technique.”

Johnson understands that tight end is not a simple position to play.

“Tight end is a lot even at the college level. You’re just asked to do so much and that’s why I think it’s a great position” Johnson said. “Everything you’re asked to do it’s very unique. It’s not just a one-tool guy. The best tight ends are able to do everything. I think that’s really cool for a guy like me that I feel like I have the potential to do all the things that you can ask a tight end to do and be a guy that you can’t take off the field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9qaW1teS1qb2huc29uLWxlZ2VuZGFyeS00OWVyLWhhbGwtMDI0MzA4ODI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jimmy Johnson legendary 49er Hall of Famer dies at 86,"May 9 (UPI) -- Former NFL legend Jimmy Johnson who spent his entire 16-year pro football career with the San Francisco 49ers and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994 is dead at 86 the Hall announced Thursday.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Jimmy Johnson was the 6th overall pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and made his presence felt right away in his rookie year with 5 catches in his first dozen games. He achieved Pro Bowl status from 1969 to 1972.

Johnson died Wednesday evening the Hall of Fame and 49ers announced.

Data centres play an ever more critical role in keeping the global economy productive while closer to home they support the conveniences of daily life — from working remotely to shopping online.

By digitalising aggregating and analysing disparate critical systems into a unified data lake the analytics produced by the on-premises Honeywell Data Centre Suite provides operators more holistic actionable information to help boost efficiency and decrease costs.

Based on the open architecture Niagara Framework it combines data from both operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) infrastructure to enhance situational awareness at site level as well as global fleet level and to enable condition-based maintenance to reduce downtime risk and operational expenses.

Given the exponentially increasing demand—as of April 2022 hyperscale operators planned to build 314 new facilities—data centre managers are often forced to do more with less while at the same time being pressured to improve uptime reduce costs and minimise energy consumption.

User-friendly tools that automate processes helps reduce the chance for human error the culprit behind major outages over the last three years among 40% of organisations surveyed by the Uptime Institute often driven by ignored or inadequate procedures.

It can also help improve a data centre’s overall efficiency.

The Honeywell Data Centre Suite’s tools include:

1. Data Centre Manager that integrates delivers situational site-level awareness of both OT (critical power and thermal assets) and critical IT assets data in a vendor-agnostic dashboard;

2. Portfolio View that enables data centre owners to monitor global network operations holistically via an on-premises tool across a fleet of data centres and make data-driven decisions to better achieve their uptime and sustainability goals; and

3. Honeywell Forge Digitised Maintenance a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that monitors data centre assets and detects early signs of anomalous intrinsic operations before it leads to potentially costly downtime.

“Honeywell is expanding its offerings in data centres to allow facility managers to derive actionable insights securely from their own data to help protect uptime manage maintenance reduce energy use and achieve scaling agility” said Honeywell vice president of offering management Chris McLaughlin.

Improve data centre situational awareness uptime and operational efficiency

The Data Centre Manager monitors and manages critical infrastructure by aggregating OT and IT data—which previously had to be collected manually from disparate systems—into a single source.

The solution helps operators diagnose alarms and root causes of issues execute workflows to triage situations improve response times and reduce human error potential.

Featuring a persona-optimised user experience to minimise the technician’s cognitive load it generates situation-specific recommendations to better preserve uptime and maintain service-level agreement (SLA) compliance. It also provides insights into the site’s energy and carbon use.

Monitor uptime and sustainability KPIs across a fleet of facilities

Portfolio View integrates with Data Centre Manager to allows users to monitor a global fleet of data centres.

It allows navigation from a fleet-level view down to individual sites generating a KPI-based score for each site that profiles metrics such as uptime critical sustainability KPIs such as power usage effectiveness (PUE) carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) and water usage effectiveness (WUE) space and capacity utilisation and energy consumption.

Farms too.,"Courtesy Jolanda Kirpensteijn/Unsplash

The Standing Rock Lakota Sioux Tribe began protesting a crude oil pipeline in 2016. This spurred legislation across the nation that criminalizes protests against fossil fuel infrastructure new research has found.

Listen

In 2019 Tennessee criminalized protests against oil and natural gas infrastructure in legislation that didn’t receive much attention at the time.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) was partially responsible. The conservative thinktank helped draft legislation in 24 states in response to visible efforts from Indigenous communities and environmentalists to oppose fossil fuel projects according to new research.

“We know these bills are directly related to these protests” said Emma Fisher of Climate Cabinet Education who helped author the report.

The highest-profile example of this was in North Dakota where the Standing Rock Lakota Sioux Tribe demonstrated against the Dakota Access Pipeline despite attack dogs and water canons. The protest slowed down the project and brought attention to pipeline companies.

In this case the company was Energy Transfer Partners which is involved in lawsuits regarding its operation against anti-pipeline activists. They also own the pipeline that leaked nearly 200000 gallons of crude oil into Tennessee this summer.

Those protests started around 2016. The first protest bill came in 2017 in Oklahoma. Tennessee quickly followed suit.

‘Intentionally vague and risky”

The Tennessee anti-protest bill was introduced by Sen. Frank Nicely R-Strawberry Plains in 2019. The legislation says that any unauthorized person or group that harm remove or “otherwise interrupt or interfere” with a pipeline or other fossil fuel infrastructure will be convicted of a Class E felony and could face up to six years in prison.

Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill into law. Today 17 states have such laws.

“The way they’re written is that harsh penalties and open-ended definitions create a situation for protestors that is intentionally vague and risky” Fisher said. “An example of that is that it conflates defacing property with destroying property.”

In other words a person holding a can of spray paint is considered in the same criminal box as someone with a bomb.

It was already illegal in Tennessee to interfere with “critical infrastructure” like telephone poles or electricity transmission lines. But the law explicitly expanded that definition to include oil and natural gas pipelines while changing established misdemeanor offenses to felony offenses.

The law was updated two years later to include farms or other agricultural operations like meat production which has already been shielded from public oversight by “gag laws” some written by the same group ALEC intended to prevent whistleblowers from releasing undercover videos.

In Tennessee’s law protestors are not the only people at risk: any person or group that gives “cause aid or coerce” to those engaged in conduct “concerning vandalism” are also subject to a Class E felony.

The report notes that this could make organizations wary of working with activists on issues of environmental protection and tribal sovereignty.

Following the anti-protest bill Tennessee has introduced other legislation that shelters the fossil fuel industry. The state was second in preempting a local government ban of natural gas in new construction in 2020 and first in effectively preventing bans by local government of new fossil fuel infrastructure this year – one in response to California cities banning gas in buildings and the latter in response to Memphis activists helping defeat a proposed oil pipeline.

Peaceful protests have led to violent arrests

Protests can be effective at blocking the business of fossil fuels. One report found that fossil fuel expansion projects halted by Indigenous-led campaigns represent 12% of annual U.S. and Canadian climate pollution or roughly 779 million metric tons of greenhouse gases.

In Louisiana Anne White Hat a member of the Lakota tribe was arrested and charged with two felony counts under Louisiana’s critical infrastructure law while protesting a project by Energy Transfer Partners despite having permission from the landowners to peacefully protest on their land. White Hat provided testimony to Congress during a hearing on Wednesday.

“A Louisiana state court later ruled that it was in fact the pipeline company Energy Transfer that was trespassing and yet we were the ones arrested by uniformed sheriffs’ deputies working privately for the pipeline company” White Hat said.

The hearing examined how the fossil fuel industry is “weaponizing the law to stifle First Amendment protected speech” and stall climate action by using Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participations (SLAPPS) and anti-protest laws according to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Tennessee has an anti-SLAPP law.

Indigenous communities are supposed to have a voice on projects in their territories. The United Nations says that governments must receive “free prior and informed consent” from Indigenous peoples before starting projects that could affect them or their territories.

“State legislators have a lot of power over the democratic process over people’s rights and over climate and environmental justice decisions” Fisher said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzkxMzIxMTgvY2FuYWRhLWVuZXJneS1jcmlzaXMtZ3d5bi1tb3JnYW4tZW5jYW5hLWxhbmRsb2NrZWQv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iYWxuZXdzLmNhL25ld3MvOTEzMjExOC9jYW5hZGEtZW5lcmd5LWNyaXNpcy1nd3luLW1vcmdhbi1lbmNhbmEtbGFuZGxvY2tlZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Europe’s energy crisis has Canada weighing future of oil and gas industry,"Send this page to someone via email

At 76 years old Gwyn Morgan is not one to sit still.

The former oil executive recipient of the Order of Canada and self-described “outdoors guy” remains a long-distance runner and led Global News on a jog through side streets and forest paths of Vancouver Island during an interview about his career — itself something of a marathon.

He says he got used to early mornings working alongside his father at a “hardscrabble” farm in Alberta. An engineer by trade he made his career in the province’s oil and gas industry from the 1970s to the ’90s. He would found EnCana known today as Ovintiv and reigned at the helm of the gas giant when it overtook Royal Bank of Canada as the country’s most valuable company in 2005.

Yet Morgan has been among the loudest voices chiding the Liberal government for not doing more to build new pipelines to get Canadian oil and gas to new markets.

He’s called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s policies towards Canada’s economically vital oil and gas industry a “fiasco” and has gone as far as to say that the decline of the sector has left him “ashamed” to be a Canadian in recent months.

When it comes to climate change Morgan says he’s “not a denier” and supports decarbonization efforts.

“There’s being an environmentally-aware and concerned person and understanding also what the realities are” he says. “It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be trying but we have to do it strategically.”

Morgan’s views might be at odds with climate activists and growing investor sentiment against fossil fuel production but experts caution against undervaluing the importance of Canada’s oil and gas sector to not only the domestic economy but to global energy security.

European energy crisis puts Canada in the hot seat

The devastating impacts of climate change and the dire timelines to control greenhouse gas emissions have long driven efforts to decarbonize and set clean energy transition goals.

But Russia’s war in Ukraine has put the world’s energy crisis in sharp focus.

Europe is bracing for a lean winter as Russia — the European Union’s primary provider of gas used to heat homes — stymies energy deliveries.

While Russia cites maintenance of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline as the primary cause for delay the west has accused President Vladimir Putin of crafting an energy war in an attempt to weaken support for Ukraine.

And if Russia is indeed using its vast resources as a weapon in the war on Ukraine critics such as Morgan charge Canada with loading the gun for Putin.

Experts including commodities analyst Rory Johnston say Canada is not currently in a position to meaningfully offset reduced oil and gas shipments from Russia.

While allies such as Germany have floated Canadian energy as a reliable replacement for Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) a project to get those resources overseas has not been approved and would not be ready in time to heat European homes this winter Johnston says.

That limitation butts up against political assurances that Canada will support Europe through their crisis.

“We have a political responsibility to do whatever we can to help them with this energy crisis that they are going through” said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Aug. 25.

But had Canada continued with pipeline-building policies forged under former prime minister Stephen Harper Morgan argues the country would be in a position to help.

“Our oil production would be at a level right now where Russia doesn’t have any power. … They wouldn’t be the swing producer. There’s no doubt about that” he says.

Pipeline building ‘extraordinarily’ slow in Canada

Canada’s pipeline progress in recent years has faced intense scrutiny.

The federal government purchased an expansion to the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018 for $4.5 billion in an effort to get the project to completion after Kinder Morgan threatened to kill it amid environmentalist opposition. But it continues to face hurdles.

The Keystone XL pipeline meanwhile faced back-and-forth approvals and blocks from successive U.S. regimes before President Joe Biden put a kibosh on the plan shortly after taking office.

Johnston tells Global News that even if Keystone XL were approved today it would take half a decade of investment and construction before a meaningful amount of Canadian resources made land in Europe.

“Unfortunately part of the stability of our industry comes from the fact that we move extraordinarily slowly” he says.

But Johnston notes that even after the war in Ukraine ends European allies will likely never again be comfortable relying on Russian energy to the degree they did before — opening an opportunity for Canadian oil and gas to play a role in global energy security in years to come.

“I think it’s important not to think about always what we can do immediately but how we can prepare for the next crisis. Because this will not be the last one” he says.

Canada’s status as a resource-rich but increasingly difficult place to get pipelines built has not only affected the country’s reputation as a key energy supplier but as a trusted ally on the global stage Morgan says.

“Canada became well-known as a place where you simply can’t get anything done. That is probably the worst kind of reputation you could have” he says.

“Right now we’ve got people dying and a war going on. And that is when I said ‘I am ashamed to be a Canadian.’”

Oil and gas still the ‘backbone’ of Canadian economy

Despite setbacks in Canadian pipeline building the oil-and-gas sector remains a “backbone” of Canada’s economy says Tu Nguyen economist and director of environmental social and governance at RSM Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

At just under 10 per cent of Canada’s annual GDP oil and gas is “one of the largest contributors” to the national economy she says.

Much of this output revolves around the Albertan oil sands the fourth-largest reserve of oil in the world and the largest such source outside of the powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The oil-and-gas sector usually makes Alberta an outsized contributor to the Canadian economy — it feeds more into the federal budget than it receives in other words. This had been the case since the mid-1960s until the COVID-19 pandemic saw Albertans receive more from the feds than usual due to emergency response benefits in 2021 per a report from the National Post.

Alberta seems to have bounced back to form in 2022 however with a ranking of the 30 top-performing companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange released this week showing half were headquartered in the province and the oil and gas sector comprising the bulk of the list.

But investments in the oil sands — a particularly high-emissions source of fuel — have waned in recent years.

2:20 Justin Trudeau comment on phasing-out oil sands ignites anger in Alberta

Nguyen says that oil extraction projects have lost favour in both the court of public opinion and the investment community in the past five or so years as investors realized that economic development would have to shift away from fossil fuels to foster a “liveable” future.

“That leads to hesitation in investing in the oil and gas industry” she says.

Many Canadians who live outside Alberta may not realize the impact the oil sands have on their daily lives says Johnston.

Prices soaring past $2-a-litre at gas pumps across Canada earlier this year could mark a wake-up call for many Canadians previously unconcerned about investment in the oil sands.

The Canadian dollar has historically performed well when gas prices rise giving consumers a “safety blanket” that protects their purchasing power and mitigates pain at the pumps Johnston says.

But a lack of investment in the oil sands has “weakened the relationship between oil prices and the Canadian dollar” he says. Canada’s dollar value did not experience traditional highs even as a tight supply of gas worldwide sent prices soaring this past spring and early summer.

“That’s the issue that a lot of Canadians don’t fully understand is that just because they’re not personally affected by the changes in investment out west they’re still fundamentally very personally affected by the changed relationship between the price of oil and the Canadian dollar” Johnston says.

Governments industry players and markets worldwide have recognized “the existential importance of decarbonizing our economies” Johnston says and have adopted emissions targets and policies to accelerate transitions to renewables and technology like electric vehicles.

But fossil fuel use could prove sticky because of the enormous role it plays in sectors such as transportation — long-haul trucking and air travel are two major sources of oil demand that will be “much harder to replace” he says.

With increasing attention paid to global carbon emissions pressure will be intense on oil sands producers in the next few years to clean up and reduce emissions tied to fossil fuel extraction he says.

Canada’s status as a politically-reliable source of fuel makes it an attractive target for investment to meet future energy needs Johnston says even as he projects global oil demand could peak around 2030.

“This is not going to be a smooth transition. It’s going to be bumpy” Johnston says.

“While I do believe that governments and policymakers should continue to press down on reducing demand for these fuels this entire kind of connected suite of crises are highlighting how important it is to have a reliable supply when you need it.”

Where to go with oil and gas?

Climate scientists could not be clearer that the status quo on greenhouse gas emissions is not good enough. Current policies have Canada on a trajectory for hundreds of billions of dollars in damages tied to wildfires on the west coast and lost revenue from reduced seafood harvests in the east according to a February report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Yet oil and gas remains the lifeblood of Canada’s economy. It’s a critical source of funding for government services like health care. It has insulated Canadian households against economic downturns before and it’s become a front in Russia’s war on Ukraine.

“When we look at how much oil and gas really contributes to our domestic economy how are we going to decarbonize without hurting our economy? And that is I think that’s a difficult question” says Nguyen.

Walking along Bay Street in Toronto the epicentre of the country’s financial activity Nguyen tells Global News she sees a possible path to reconcile these seemingly opposing forces pressing on Canada’s energy sector and a future economy that doesn’t rely on “volatile” oil and gas.

She notes that some traditional oil companies have already rebranded themselves as “energy companies” sensing the need to shift their long-term focus.

Shell for instance announced this week that it would replace its CEO with the head of the oil giant’s renewables program after years of criticism that it was not investing enough in the clean energy transition.

If Canada is going to protect its economy while keeping its energy industry relevant Nguyen suggests that these corporations are best equipped with the talent to understand the industry and the world’s energy needs.

“If we want to move forward and decarbonize we need to consume less fossil fuel. In order to do that we need to transition to more renewables” she says. “And it so happens that oil and gas companies just have a lot of expertise have a lot of capital and human capital in order to invest in renewables as well.”

At the start of 2022 Morgan says he might have agreed with industry observers who had said oil and gas was “sunsetting.”

But he says the war in Ukraine and resultant energy crisis has put the question into a harsher light that could see Canadian oil eventually wrest some power from Putin’s hands and enable the global transition to a cleaner energy future."

The restrictions are a tactical foreign policy and national security move to safeguard the US advantage in the race to develop artificial intelligence technology. How will this regulatory shift affect the AI chip industry in the short term and the long term?

These new restrictions do not completely cut off the flow of AI chips from US companies to China. Rather they focus on advanced products with powerful computing capabilities specifically the Nvidia’s A100 and H100 GPUs. Nvidia addressed the new licensing requirements in its 8-K released on August 26. The company reported that $400 million in potential sales to China could be affected by the new license requirement.

The new restrictions affect AMD’s M1250 chip according to the Reuters report. Both Nvidia and AMD took hits in the stock market following the news of the restrictions.

Nvidia and AMD are not the only US-based companies developing powerful AI chips. “The new limits may have a substantial effect on other tech firms in addition to Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Inc. including Intel Corp. Dell Technologies Inc. Super Micro Computer Inc. Hewlett Packard Enterprise KLA Corp. Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc.” says Emmanuel Ekwedike PhD an AI research scientist and engineer.

The Impact to China

China accounts for one-quarter of the global AI chip market according to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Restricting US companies’ sales to that market will impact their revenue and market share. “In the short term they'll feel some pain because they'll sell less chips. But in the long term it will inhibit China from advancing as quickly to be a prime competitor to those chip companies” Jack Gold president and principal analyst with industry analyst firm J. Gold Associates contends.

Nvidia will be allowed to continue the development of the H100 chip in China and it will be able to continue shipping AI chips out of its Hong Kong facility through September 2023 according to CNBC.

“We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren’t sufficient. The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100 H100 and systems such as DGX that include them” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.

The ultimate goal of these restrictions is to preserve the US’s global competitive advantage in the AI market. Military applications for powerful AI chips are also a consideration. “There is a growing concern that the new highly capable AI chips could be utilized (misused) for military reasons as evidenced by the fact that the new limits only apply to specific chips with specific performance capabilities” Ekwedike says.

Restricting AI chip exports may slow China down in the AI race but they will not put an end to the competition. “We're reducing the speed and ease at which new big models can be developed but customized applications actually don't necessarily depend on these really high performance [chips] like Nvidia’s A100 and H100 type systems” explains Bob Rogers PhD CEO of Oii an AI supply chain management software company. Rogers also cautions that these restrictions could cause China to ramp up efforts to manufacture its own AI chips.

These restrictions seem to herald the beginning of further government scrutiny of the AI chip industry. “A wider export ban is probably on the horizon a wide campaign … limiting the availability of specific advanced chipmaking machinery and specific items that make use of the targeted advanced AI chips” Ekwedike suggests.

Already the US government is planning further AI chip export restrictions which will affect KLA Corp. Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. according to Reuters. The companies will need to obtain licenses from the Commerce Department in order to export chipmaking equipment to China.

Oil and gas companies including Britain’s Shell and BP were urged to “stop their deception” this week as the US House committee on oversight and reform released documents showing that oil industry executives privately downplayed their public messages on efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

The memo claimed that internal BP documents highlighted how carbon capture and storage (CCS) – a nascent technology that involves inserting CO 2 emissions into underground rock formations – could “enable the full use of fossil fuels across the energy transition and beyond”.

Congressional investigators also unearthed an internal Shell email discussing carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) in which an executive said: “We want to be careful to not talk about CCUS as prolonging the life of oil gas or fossil fuels writ large.”

The committee said internal Shell messaging guidance – developed to “insulate Shell” from lawsuits about “greenwashing” and “misleading investors” on the climate crisis – calls on employees to emphasise that net zero emissions is “a collective ambition for the world” rather than a “Shell goal or target”.

The guidance tells employees: “Please do not give the impression that Shell is willing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels that do not make business sense.”

In separate documents the oil companies Exxon and Chevron appeared to ask the industry-led Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) to “remove language that potentially commits members to enhanced climate-related governance strategy risk management and performance metrics and targets” and to avoid any “explicit commitment for OGCI companies to align their advocacy with their climate related positions” – including advocacy for the 2015 Paris agreement.

Climate campaigners and some investors have pushed energy companies to commit to more ambitious emissions reduction targets. The activist investor Follow This has tabled resolutions at shareholder meetings in an attempt to get companies to agree to targets in line with the Paris accord.

Shell lost a landmark ruling in the Dutch courts last year when a judge ordered it to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. Campaigners hope the incoming chief executive Wael Sawan whose appointment was announced on Thursday can increase the company’s investment in green energy.

The committee said that after Shell posted on Twitter asking others what they would do to reduce emissions a communications executive wrote privately that he agreed this could be seen as “gaslighting” the public. “We are after all in a tweet like this implying others need to sacrifice without focusing on ourselves” he said.

Carolyn Maloney the chair of the House committee on oversight and reform said: “As we face more deadly extreme weather around the globe fossil fuel companies are reaping record profits and ramping up their misleading PR tactics to distract from their central role in fuelling the climate crisis.

“My committee’s investigation leaves no doubt that in the words of one company official big oil is ‘gaslighting’ the public. These companies claim they are part of the solution to climate change but internal documents reveal that they are continuing with business as usual. I call on the big fossil fuel companies to stop their deception and cut their emissions now – before it is too late.”

Jamie Peters a campaigner at Friends of the Earth said: “Big oil firms like Shell Exxon and Chevron can try to gloss over their murky PR image as much as they like as we’ve seen in the millions of dollars pumped into disingenuous greenwash campaigns by the industry. But though unsurprising this bombshell disclosure confirms what remains utterly transparent about big oil. That it has every intention to keep on extracting in pursuit of profit rather than transforming how it operates for the sake of our communities and our planet.



“Millions are already experiencing dangerous climate breakdown in extreme heatwaves and devastating floods like those in Pakistan as the world’s biggest polluters continue to shirk their responsibilities. They’ll continue to act only in the interests of their shareholders unless governments intervene.”

The Guardian revealed last month that BP has spent more than £800000 on social media influence ads in the UK this year that champion the company’s investments in green energy.

A Shell spokesperson said: “Of the nearly 500000 pages provided to the committee the small handful they chose to highlight are evidence of Shell’s extensive efforts to set aggressive targets evolve its portfolio and meaningfully participate in the ongoing energy transition.”

An Exxon spokesperson said: “We have supported the Paris agreement from its start in 2015 and continue to support the US government’s participation in the framework. The selective publication of dated emails without context is a deliberate attempt to generate a narrative that does not reflect the commitment of ExxonMobil – and its employees to address climate change and play a leading role in the transition to a net zero future.”

Kroger Delivery Explained

The expansion to Birmingham represents an extension of a partnership between Kroger and Ocado Group a world leader in technology for grocery e-commerce. In 2018 the companies announced a collaboration to establish a delivery network that combines artificial intelligence advanced robotics and automation in a bold new way bringing first-of-its-kind technology to America.

The delivery network relies on highly automated fulfillment centers. At the hub sites more than 1000 bots move around giant 3D grids orchestrated by proprietary control systems. The grid known as The Hive contains totes with products and ready-to-deliver customer orders. As customers' orders near delivery times bots retrieve products from The Hive and present them at pick stations for items to be sorted for delivery a process governed by algorithms that ensure items are intelligently packed. For example fragile items are placed on top bags are evenly weighted and each order is optimized to fit into the lowest number of bags reducing plastic use. Bags are also recyclable reflecting Kroger's commitment to its Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment to rid its communities of hunger and waste.

Kroger's end-to-end cold solutions keep groceries fresh once loaded into customized refrigerated delivery van which can store up to 20 orders. Powerful machine learning algorithms optimize delivery routes considering factors such as road conditions and optimal fuel efficiency. Vans may travel up to 90 miles with orders from the hub and spoke facilities to make deliveries. Associates at the spoke facility will deliver orders within their service area adding ZIP codes as demand grows.

Kroger currently operates customer fulfillment centers in Monroe OH Groveland FL Forest Park GA (Atlanta) Pleasant Prairie WI Dallas TX and Romulus MI (Detroit) with additional customer fulfillment centers slated for California Frederick MD Phoenix AZ Cleveland OH Charlotte NC Aurora CO (Denver) as well as South Florida and the Northeast.

Kroger said Friday that the roughly 50000-square-foot spoke will support its Ocado-powered customer fulfillment center (CFC) in Forest Park Ga. The 375000-square-foot CFC “hub"" which officially opened in February following a soft launch in December serves the Atlanta market and can fill thousands of online grocery orders daily.

The Kroger Co. The spokes serve as last-mile cross-dock sites for e-grocery delivery and lengthen the service radius of the bigger customer fulfillment center (CFC) hub locations.

“For people who live in food deserts getting groceries can be a real challenge. Eliminating the distance to the grocery store from the doorstep can positively impact our citizens who are most in need of healthy food options” commented Cornell Wesley director of the Department of Innovation and Economic Opportunity for the city of Birmingham. “As a community we are excited about Kroger choosing Birmingham for this expansion and are eager to partner with them in exploring more ways to solve for food deserts.”

Overall Kroger has announced 12 Ocado-automated spokes of 40000 to 80000 square feet. The spokes serve as last-mile cross-dock sites for e-grocery delivery and lengthen the service radius. Besides the Birmingham site spoke facilities are now operational in Nashville Tenn. and Maywood Ill.; Miami Tampa and Jacksonville Fla.; Lockbourne Ohio; Indianapolis; Louisville Ky.; and San Antonio. Other spokes are slated to open in Oklahoma City and AustinTexas.

The Oklahoma City spoke will bring Kroger into its 36th state Oklahoma where it doesn’t operate any brick-and-mortar stores. The 50000-square-foot facility will support a 350000-square-foot CFC in Dallas. According to Kroger the Oklahoma City spoke will extend the reach of Kroger Delivery service from the Dallas CFC to customers up to 200 miles away.

In May 2018 Kroger unveiled an exclusive U.S. partnership with U.K.-based online grocery specialist Ocado to identify sites for about 20 automated CFCs over the ensuing three years. The high-tech CFCs use Ocado’s vertical integration machine learning and robotics to fill e-grocery delivery orders and extend Kroger’s reach to a larger geographic footprint including areas where it doesn’t operate physical stores.

So far Kroger has announced 17 CFCs — ranging from 135000 to 375000 square feet — and six are now open. Kroger opened its first Ocado CFC a 375000-square-foot automated warehouse in April 2021 in Monroe Ohio. That was followed by 375000-square-foot CFCs in Groveland Fla. in June 2021 and in Forest Park Ga. this past February and a 340000-square-foot CFC in Pleasant Prairie Wis. in June. Most recently CFCs of 135000 and 350000 square feet went operational in Romulus Mich. and Dallas respectively. The Groveland locations marked the first CFC opening in a state where Kroger doesn’t have physical stores (except for one Harris Teeter store in Jacksonville Fla.).

“Long term one of our visions is to serve America because we think everybody deserves fresh affordable food” Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen told Supermarket News in a recent interview. “[The Ocado partnership] allows us to go into new markets with something different than what is already there and do it in a way that’s efficient. And you can scale off of it over time. So that’s one more way of taking care of customers and supporting communities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYW5kdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ncmFudC1saW5lLWtyb2dlci1sb2NhdGlvbi1pbi1uZXctYWxiYW55LXRvLWNsb3NlL2FydGljbGVfMjk5NWI1ZTQtMzVlMS0xMWVkLWIxMzItNWJkYzhjOTQ0NDY5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grant Line Kroger location in New Albany to close,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.newsandtribune.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/grant-line-kroger-location-in-new-albany-to-close/article_2995b5e4-35e1-11ed-b132-5bdc8c944469.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950D2A920>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYW5kdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ncmFudC1saW5lLWtyb2dlci1sb2NhdGlvbi1pbi1uZXctYWxiYW55LXRvLWNsb3NlL2FydGljbGVfMjk5NWI1ZTQtMzVlMS0xMWVkLWIxMzItNWJkYzhjOTQ0NDY5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9rcm9nZXItd29ya2Vycy1pbi1vaGlvLWF1dGhvcml6ZS1zdHJpa2UtYWZ0ZXItcmVqZWN0aW5nLXRlbnRhdGl2ZS1kZWFsLzY5NDk4NTI3MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kroger workers in Ohio authorize strike after rejecting tentative deal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dispatch.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /story/business/2022/09/16/kroger-workers-in-ohio-authorize-strike-after-rejecting-tentative-deal/69498527007/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950D29FF0>, 'Connection to www.dispatch.com timed out.

The debut of a new U.S. missile defense system will have to wait.

SpaceX's forecasted launch of the first part of anti-satellite weapon tracking system called Tranche 0 will push from late September to December at the least due to supply chain problems and the aftereffects of bid protests according to reports.

Tracking hypersonic weapons such as those being developed by China and Russia is a priority of the Department of Defense but the director of its acquisition arm for Tranche 0 told reporters at a Washington D.C. conference that the launch timeline was optimistic.

""It's more of an ego hit to us than anything"" Derek Tournear director of the Space Development Agency said at the Washington Space Business Roundtable according to Defense News.

The news comes amid numerous recent developments in U.S. hypersonic weapons (generally defined as those that fly at speeds of at least Mach 5). New U.S. military work includes flight tests of hypersonic air-breathing weapon concepts and new prototypes for hypersonic weapon defense. In addition to Tranche 0 the United States has also launched six satellites to make up its new Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (SBIRS GEO) constellation.

SDA planned the first of two launches of its 28 satellites in about two weeks including 20 communications payloads from Lockheed Martin and York Space and eight missile-tracking infrared sensor satellites from SpaceX and L3 Harris according to SpaceNews.

Tournear principally blamed supply chain issues in microchips referring to a COVID-19-induced shipping issue that has hurt industries ranging from gaming consoles to car manufacturing. (The U.S. is counteracting that by seeking to manufacture more microchips domestically under the CHIPS Act just signed into law last month.)

The SDA director also pointed to a delay in starting Tranche 0 after bid protests from Raytheon and Airbus contesting the awards to L3Harris and SpaceX along with software development issues. But everything likely would have been on track absent the supply chain issues he noted.

""The longest pole in the tent that caused those satellites to slip was actually component delays primarily stemming from microelectronics"" he said in the SpaceNews report. ""It was very difficult for us to get microelectronics especially space qualified microelectronics for components such as radios.""

This upgrade comes as part of a $265.3 million contract the DOD awarded TAS in July under the ARTEMIS program. ARTEMIS stands for Avionics Reconfiguration and Tactical Enhancement/Modernization for Inventory Standardization. It tasks TAS with upgrading the U.S. Navy/Marine Corps fleet of F-5 Tiger II Adversary aircraft including 16 F-5E and six F-5F Tiger II aircraft among others.

In a statement Carl Wolf Garmin’s vice president of aviation sales and marketing said having the G3000 selected for the ARTEMIS contract was an “honor” especially since the OEM also announced recently it had deployed its integrated flight deck technologies now on more than 25000 aircraft.

Garmin and TAS first partnered in 2018 when the defense contractor chose the Garmin G3000 for its F-5 adversary aircraft training fleet. The supersonic tactical fighter and attack aircraft are used for air-to-air combat training close air support and tactical development support.

Meanwhile Tactical Air CEO Rolland “RC” Thompson said “the Garmin integrated flight deck gave us an outstanding commercial-off-the-shelf solution to the Navy and Marine Corps’ recently purchased fleet of F-5 aircraft to make them an even more capable adversary fighter for our aviators to train against.”

Here’s What F-5 Pilots Can Expect

When the G3000s are integrated into the F-5 Tigers they will be configured with one large area display and two touchscreen controllers. Pilots will then use the aircraft in an aggressor training role. Implementing the new avionics into the fighter jets should not be difficult because of Garmin’s commercial-off-the-shelf open architecture for the G3000.

Like many of Garmin’s other commercial avionic products the G3000 integrates with a wide range of mission equipment including military sensors helmet-mounted displays and advanced electrically scanned radar systems.

Garmin said that the G3000s would integrate and interface easily to the F-5’s existing mission computer enabling advanced mapping tactical radio capabilities and radar display. Tactical Air integrated the L3Harris ForceX mission computer and a wide range of military sensors communications equipment and weapons systems into the G3000 touchscreen HMI.

The G3000s would offer pilots great situational awareness through features like its Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B IN) traffic. For nighttime the G3000 is compatible with night vision goggles and even has synthetic vision technology for low-visibility operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGRiYW5uZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy93aXRuZXNzLWx1Y2FzLWVzY2FsYXRlZC1pbmNpZGVudC10aGF0LXJlc3VsdGVkLWluLXByaWNlLXMtc2hvb3RpbmctZGVhdGgvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMGE3YjdjNC0zNjA4LTExZWQtODVjYi02N2FiZDJjM2Q4YTUuaHRtbNIBqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGRiYW5uZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy93aXRuZXNzLWx1Y2FzLWVzY2FsYXRlZC1pbmNpZGVudC10aGF0LXJlc3VsdGVkLWluLXByaWNlLXMtc2hvb3RpbmctZGVhdGgvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMGE3YjdjNC0zNjA4LTExZWQtODVjYi02N2FiZDJjM2Q4YTUuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Witness: Lucas escalated incident that resulted in Price’s shooting death,"Greenville TX (75401)

The restrictions are a tactical foreign policy and national security move to safeguard the US advantage in the race to develop artificial intelligence technology. How will this regulatory shift affect the AI chip industry in the short term and the long term?

These new restrictions do not completely cut off the flow of AI chips from US companies to China. Rather they focus on advanced products with powerful computing capabilities specifically the Nvidia’s A100 and H100 GPUs. Nvidia addressed the new licensing requirements in its 8-K released on August 26. The company reported that $400 million in potential sales to China could be affected by the new license requirement.

The new restrictions affect AMD’s M1250 chip according to the Reuters report. Both Nvidia and AMD took hits in the stock market following the news of the restrictions.

Nvidia and AMD are not the only US-based companies developing powerful AI chips. “The new limits may have a substantial effect on other tech firms in addition to Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Inc. including Intel Corp. Dell Technologies Inc. Super Micro Computer Inc. Hewlett Packard Enterprise KLA Corp. Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc.” says Emmanuel Ekwedike PhD an AI research scientist and engineer.

The Impact to China

China accounts for one-quarter of the global AI chip market according to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Restricting US companies’ sales to that market will impact their revenue and market share. “In the short term they'll feel some pain because they'll sell less chips. But in the long term it will inhibit China from advancing as quickly to be a prime competitor to those chip companies” Jack Gold president and principal analyst with industry analyst firm J. Gold Associates contends.

Nvidia will be allowed to continue the development of the H100 chip in China and it will be able to continue shipping AI chips out of its Hong Kong facility through September 2023 according to CNBC.

“We are working with our customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren’t sufficient. The only current products that the new licensing requirement applies to are A100 H100 and systems such as DGX that include them” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.

The ultimate goal of these restrictions is to preserve the US’s global competitive advantage in the AI market. Military applications for powerful AI chips are also a consideration. “There is a growing concern that the new highly capable AI chips could be utilized (misused) for military reasons as evidenced by the fact that the new limits only apply to specific chips with specific performance capabilities” Ekwedike says.

Restricting AI chip exports may slow China down in the AI race but they will not put an end to the competition. “We're reducing the speed and ease at which new big models can be developed but customized applications actually don't necessarily depend on these really high performance [chips] like Nvidia’s A100 and H100 type systems” explains Bob Rogers PhD CEO of Oii an AI supply chain management software company. Rogers also cautions that these restrictions could cause China to ramp up efforts to manufacture its own AI chips.

These restrictions seem to herald the beginning of further government scrutiny of the AI chip industry. “A wider export ban is probably on the horizon a wide campaign … limiting the availability of specific advanced chipmaking machinery and specific items that make use of the targeted advanced AI chips” Ekwedike suggests.

Already the US government is planning further AI chip export restrictions which will affect KLA Corp. Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. according to Reuters. The companies will need to obtain licenses from the Commerce Department in order to export chipmaking equipment to China.

Find the technical paper titled ” FP8 Formats For Deep Learning” here. Published Sept 2022.

Abstract:

“FP8 is a natural progression for accelerating deep learning training inference beyond the 16-bit formats common in modern processors. In this paper we propose an 8-bit floating point (FP8) binary interchange format consisting of two encodings – E4M3 (4-bit exponent and 3-bit mantissa) and E5M2 (5-bit exponent and 2-bit mantissa). While E5M2 follows IEEE 754 conventions for representation of special values E4M3’s dynamic range is extended by not representing infinities and having only one mantissa bit-pattern for NaNs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the FP8 format on a variety of image and language tasks effectively matching the result quality achieved by 16-bit training sessions. Our study covers the main modern neural network architectures – CNNs RNNs and Transformer-based models leaving all the hyperparameters unchanged from the 16-bit baseline training sessions. Our training experiments include large up to 175B parameter language models. We also examine FP8 post-training-quantization of language models trained using 16-bit formats that resisted fixed point int8 quantization.”

Aquí nuestras 6 particulares recomendaciones de los que consideramos que todo fan debería leer

Batman es uno de los personajes más icónicos del mundo del cómic y uno de los superhéroes bandera de la editorial DC Comics desde el nacimiento del personaje hace nada menos que 76 años en todo este tiempo se han publicado obras excepcionales en las que han participado una infinidad de artistas y guionistas y aunque es imposible enumerarlas todas aquí os dejo mis cinco cómics favoritos del murciélago y que de alguna manera estas historias han servido para definir la personalidad del personaje y han sido determinante en las siguientes historias que se publicaron a partir de ellas.

Número 27 de Detective comics

Empezamos como no con la primera aparición del murciélago en mayo de 1939 en el número 27 de Detective comics lo que hoy conocemos como DC. El personaje fue creado por Bob Kane y Bill Finger aunque a este último nunca se le reconoció como creador del mismo.

De la primera historia de Batman El Caso del Sindicato Químico Finger declaró que el argumento pertenece al género pulp de las revistas populares una evidente influencia que se halla implícita en la personalidad del personaje: sentir poco remordimiento a causa de sus asesinatos cometidos sin involucrar ningún arma de fuego. El éxito de su publicación le reportó la creación de su propia revista (Batman) en 1940 mientras seguía apareciendo en Detective Comics. En ese entonces National Publications era la empresa líder en las ventas de historietas siendo considerada como la más popular y reconocida en la industria; Batman y Superman se habían convertido en sus «héroes estelares». A finales de 1940 se introdujo a ambos personajes en la nueva serie World’s Finest Comics en la que Jerry Robinson y Dick Sprang trabajaban como colaboradores.

El regreso del caballero Oscuro (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns)

Seguimos con nuestro repaso con El regreso del caballero Oscuro (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns) de Frank Miller toda una obra de culto en el mundo del cómic esta genial obra maestra supuso el resurgimiento del personaje tras años de declive y no solo ha sido adaptada en forma de película animada (También muy recomendable) sino que también ha servido a Zack Snyder como inspiración para su ‘Batman v Superman: El amanecer de la justicia’.

El maestro Miller describe un futuro alternativo de Batman donde Bruce Wayne ha abandonado el manto del murciélago tras vivir varias desgracias personales. El regreso del Caballero Oscuro ahonda en los motivos que llevan a Bruce a volver a enfundarse el traje que tanto le costó dejar ayudado por una nueva Robin que interrumpe en su vida. A su vuelta le sigue de forma inevitable el regreso de villanos como Joker y Dos Caras que sirven como antesala al enfrentamiento final contra el propio gobierno de Estados Unidos y hasta el mismísimo Superman.

Batman Año: Uno

Batman Año: Uno. En 1987 y tras el enorme éxito de The Dark Knight Returns de nuevo Frank Miller junto al dibujante David Mazzucchelli nos trae otro de los títulos imprescindibles del personaje una reinterpretación del origen de Batman: quién es y cómo llegó a serlo. Año Uno establece el escenario para una nueva versión de un personaje legendario. El cómic también llegó en forma de película animada producida por Bruce Timm y dirigida por Lauren Montgomery y Sam Liu. Christopher Nolan se inspiró en Batman Año: Uno para su primera película del murciélago.

El largo Halloween

Una obra maestra a los lápices del recientemente fallecido Tim Sale con guion de Jeph Loeb. En El largo Halloween no encontramos al cruzado de la capa mostrando sus habilidades detectivescas tratando de descubrir la identidad de Festivo un misterioso homicida que aprovechando fechas señaladas del calendario para cometer sus asesinatos. Con las familias criminales de Gotham en pie de guerra Batman tan solo contará con la ayuda de James Gordon y Harvey Dent para resolver este caso.

Esta serie de cómics fue utilizada como fuente de inspiración por el director y guionista Matt Reeves para escribir su película The Batman con Robert Pattinson como protagonista. También podemos encontrar una adaptación de El largo Halloween en forma de película animada dividida en dos partes. También muy recomendable.

La broma asesina (The Killing Joke)

La broma asesina (The Killing Joke). Publicado en 1988 con guion de Alan Moore y dibujos de Brian Bolland es sin duda y a pesar de ser una historia dedicada al archi enemigo de Batman uno de los comics imprescindibles de toda biblioteca y por ende de cualquier seguidor del universo Batman. En él Alan Moore cuenta a modo de flashbacks un posible origen del Joker como un triste ingeniero/comediante y padre de familia que perdió todo en unas pocas horas llevándolo a enloquecer. Este origen está basado en el cómic El hombre de la capucha roja (Detective Comics Nº 168 febrero de 1951). Añadir que La broma asesina también conocerá una adaptación en forma de película animada y que Jared Leto que interpreta a Joker ha hecho una infinidad de guiños al cómic durante el rodaje de la película Suicide Squad de David Ayer.

Batman a Death in the Family (Una muerte en la familia)

Sin duda los 80 fueron una de las mejores etapas que ha conocido el personaje de Batman a lo largo de su historia. En 1988 DC comics avalada por los enormes éxitos cosechados pública Una muerte en la familia y decide realizar un experimento donde los lectores debían decidir la suerte de Jason Todd (el segundo Robin) tras un encuentro con el Joker. En ella debían decidir nada más ni nada menos si Jason Todd vivía o por el contrario moriría en manos del JOKER; la suerte no estuvo del lado de Todd donde 5.343 lectores bajaron el dedo cual circo romano decidiendo así su destino. Este hecho tuvo un gran impacto en el personaje de Batman tanto como la muerte de sus padres.

En 2005 el personaje de Jason Todd regresaría al universo de DC como héroe que combate el crimen de forma violenta convertido en Capucha Roja (curiosamente la identidad que tuvo su verdugo antes de convertirse en JOKER). Una recomendación no dejéis de ver el largometraje de animación Batman: Under the Red Hood.

El cómic contó con el guion de Jim Starlin y dibujo de Jim Aparo. En la trama Jason descubre que su verdadera madre está viva y comienza su búsqueda por el Medio Oriente donde se reúne con Batman quien está tras la pista del Joker. Jason conoce a su madre quien está involucrada en negocios con el Joker pero éste finalmente la traiciona golpea a Jason hasta dejarlo moribundo y los deja a ambos encerrados con explosivos.

Batman: Knightfall

Y para finalizar este repaso no podemos dejarnos en el tintero Batman: Knightfall publicado en 1993 con guion de Chuck Dixon y Doug Moench con las ilustraciones de Jim Aparo Norm Breyfogle Graham Nolan y Jim Balent. En El Caballero Oscuro: La leyenda renace no solo podemos ver a Bane sino que Christopher Nolan hace guiño a este cómic incluyendo la famosa escena de Bane quebrando al murciélago.

En Batman: Knightfall (La Caída del Murciélago) Batman termina paralitico tras su enfrentamiento con Bane. Un nuevo personaje Azrael sustituye a nuestro héroe durante su recuperación para combatir el crimen pero este atraído por el poder de Batman termina convirtiéndose en una amenaza. Una vez recuperado Bruce Wayne debe enfrentarse a Azrael y volver a ocupar el sitio que le pertenece.

Y gracias a esos esfuerzos por renovarse y reinventarse vuelve a captar la atención de los usuarios (y de los guionistas de series y películas juveniles).

Y con este continuo esfuerzo por hacer crecer las diferencias con respecto a su competencia fue a mediados del pasado mes de julio cuando dieron un paso muy importante lanzando su versión web que hasta ahora se ha ido manteniendo disponible exclusivamente para los suscriptores de Snapchat+.



Cabe recordar que Snapchat+ es la opción por suscripción que permite a la compañía tener ingresos adicionales a la publicidad y más cuando iniciativas como el sistema anti-rastreo integrados en los iPhone han ido en declive de los ingresos publicitarios como muchas veces suelen indicar desde compañías como Meta.

Los suscriptores de Snapchat+ tienen acceso exclusivo a una serie de prestaciones adicionales si bien no se libran de los anuncios publicitarios. Ahora bien el acceso a la versión web ya deja de estar disponible de forma exclusiva para los suscriptores porque desde hoy está disponible para todos los usuarios en general.

Un cambio que beneficiará a todos los usuarios

La compañía ha realizado el anuncio de forma escueta como parte de las novedades de Snapchat para otoño donde se incluye además los nuevos widgets para iOS 16 con un conjunto de posibilidades los nuevos accesos directos de chat en la parte superior de la pestaña chat para cosas como «detectar Snaps y chats no leídos de amigos ver llamadas perdidas y responder historias» así como la llegada de las etiquetas adhesivas de preguntas para fomentar las interacciones desde las historias efímeras.

Gracias a su disponibilidad en la web los usuarios podrán mantener conversaciones mediante chats de textos y videollamadas aprovechando el mayor espacio de pantalla que supone usar la versión web en dispositivos de escritorio.

Esta es la novedad más destacada que como señalan llega justo cuando se está iniciando un nuevo curso escolar. No sabemos si pretenden que los usuarios escolares la usen en los dispositivos escolares a escondidas o sirva de puerta de entrada por si en un futuro se les ocurre traer funciones educativas aprovechando las capacidades de realidad aumentada que permita ir más allá de la diversión y el contacto con amigos.

The school is one of three that will participate in the district’s 21st Century Schools Model initiative where students will pursue workforce training in specific fields related to local needs and interests.

Starting next year students at three neighborhood Philadelphia high schools will be able to pursue workforce training in specific fields related to local needs and interests.

Students at Overbrook High School will be able to get certifications and internships in the entertainment industry. At nearby West Philadelphia High School the focus will be urban development and real estate. And at Bartram High School in southwest an area of the city lined with car dealerships and repair centers on the main road to Philadelphia’s airport students will concentrate on the automotive logistics and transportation industries.

They will do this through partnerships with local organizations and companies. Teachers will also be trained to augment the curriculum with “blended instruction” activities and hands-on experiences in the areas of focus. The district’s aim is to help students see and create closer connections between the work they do in schools and their postsecondary careers.

The program called the 21st Century Schools Model will provide “life-changing opportunities and life-changing outcomes for students and their families” Superintendent Tony Watlington said during a Thursday press conference at Overbrook.

Watlington described the initiative as a key part of achieving his goal to make Philadelphia the fastest-improving large school district in the nation regarding student achievement. Watlington noted that the district’s open enrollment policy allows students outside the schools’ catchment to enroll if this pathway interests them.

“Schools share the responsibility to help companies recruit onboard support and develop the talent namely our students” he said. “In order to build a healthy diverse and more equitable pipeline of skilled labor that supports both our local economy and economy of the future we need pipelines like this that provide our young people with the instruction awareness exposure and experience to support whatever pathway they choose when they graduate.”

However he added while he believes that talent is equally distributed among Philadelphia students “access and exposure to resources are not equitably distributed.”

The district also wants to eventually expand the program to other neighborhood high schools in the city he said.

Officials at Thursday’s press conference did not provide a price tag for the 21st Century Schools Model. They also stressed that students participating in the new model will still need to accumulate the 23.5 credits required for high school graduation and the goal is for all of them to be ready for college as well as careers.

Ali Robinson-Roberts the district’s deputy chief of postsecondary readiness said the program allows students to make a closer connection between the work they do in school and their future careers combining “student engagement with academic rigor.”

Overbrook Principal Kahlila Johnson herself a 1989 graduate of the school said that Overbrook — the actor Will Smith’s alma mater — already has partnerships with several local companies and organizations. These include DASH a nonprofit that exposes students to the entertainment industry; Live Nation and Live Nation Urban which run entertainment venues; and the Mann Center for the Performing Arts.

The new model she said would help the school seek out and develop more such partnerships.

Johnson said experiences Overbrook already provides also increase students’ desire to attend school which has a “rich history” in music and the arts and is a beacon for the community looking to provide students access to those fields.

Students will also be able to attain various industry certifications through 21st Century Schools such as Apple Logic which can turn an Apple computer into a recording studio. (Thursday’s press conference was held in Overbrook’s digital media lab.) Such opportunities will help industries to look at students as assets to their work once they graduate Johnson said.

Through this new program “We will be exposing students to more facets of the entertainment society in hopes of closing the opportunity gap here in West Philadelphia” Kahlila Johnson said.

Philadelphia has a tiered system of high schools that includes neighborhood schools citywide admission schools and selective admission or criteria-based schools that have admissions requirements.

Some of the selective admission and citywide admission schools focus on certain fields such as the High School of Creative and Performing Arts and the George Washington Carver High School of Engineering and Science.

The district has made previous efforts to expand its technical education offerings and workforce training programs into neighborhood schools. Swenson Skills Center is connected with Lincoln High School and Benjamin Franklin High School in North Philadelphia has an advanced manufacturing program.

The citywide admission schools include Mastbaum Dobbins and Randolph which were created as vocational/technical schools focusing on skilled trades that have since evolved to expand and modernize their offerings to meet local industry needs.

This year for the first time the district also opened up summer job opportunities to seventh and eighth graders in fields like construction to introduce them to possible pathways in high school.

Altogether there are 43 workforce specialization areas in schools around the city including culinary arts digital media production sports marketing and automotive technology.

The 21st Century Schools Model initiative is separate from the district’s main career and technical education infrastructure officials said.

West Philadelphia Principal Marla Travis who was once a guidance counselor said that students in her school had asked about career options that don’t require four years of college such as real estate which was adopted as her high school’s focus.

And Bartram Principal Brian Johnson emphasized that the focus in his school on the automotive transportation and logistics industries will go far beyond the traditional offerings in vocational programs such as car repair.

“We have a variety of logistics and automotive industries right outside of our walls so having this type of advanced pathway in our school provides students with the option of securing work in these fields” Brian Johnson said.

Watlington said the district developed the 21st Century Schools Model with the help of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers although no union representatives showed up at Thursday’s press conference. PFT president Jerry Jordan later issued a statement calling the model “an important opportunity to provide students with resources and services” and said the union negotiated “different instructional models” within the program.

Morgen’s previous films—including The Kid Stays in the Picture (about maverick Hollywood producer Robert Evans) and Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck—have demonstrated his interest in exploding the conventional form of the documentary. Prior to Bowie’s death in 2016 he had met with the singer to present an idea for a sort of alternate-reality biopic; while Bowie didn’t take the bait at the time after his passing his manager approached the director and granted him unprecedented access to the artist’s vast archives. Morgen spent the next five years sifting through more than five million assets including unseen paintings drawings recordings photographs films journals and 16mm and 35mm performance clips.

The choice he made for Moonage Daydream for better and for worse was to avoid a linear narrative to create something that is ultimately about experiencing David Bowie rather than explaining him. The movie is an immersive sometimes assaultive event a kaleidoscopic time-jumping ride through Bowie’s life and work. Other than the occasional question from a television host (some thoughtful some ridiculous but Bowie is unfailingly polite and charming regardless) we hear only from the singer himself—no talking heads nothing from his collaborators no commentary of any kind. Not so much as a single album title is mentioned much less anything from the wild range of Bowie’s biography from the troubling (his flirtations with fascism and undoubtedly related his drug abuse) to the transcendent (the incredible renaissance of his final years culminating in the brilliant Blackstar album coming out the same weekend he died).

Michael Putland // Getty Images Bowie as Ziggy Stardust 1973.

It’s easy to understand this decision; there are a shelf full of Bowie books and a number of more straightahead documentaries including a trilogy of BBC films directed by Francis Whately. But knowing what you want to avoid is different from knowing what you want to say and by rejecting any sort of context Morgen’s meditation on this complicated monumental creator (Bowie was recently named Britain’s most influential artist—in any medium not just music—of the last 50 years) is largely one-dimensional and repetitive.



No question Moonage Daydream is visually and sonically stunning. The footage whether on-stage or private and intimate is consistently mesmerizing. At its best the high-velocity non-stop cutting offers its own kind of insights as we bounce between Bowie in concert in full Ziggy Stardust regalia—a gender-bending space alien come alive—to shots of him in the most mundane of settings standing in the customs line at an airport. The pace often feels frantic though a few recurring shots and scenes (Bowie painting in his studio ascending a neon-lit escalator drifting along rivers and side streets in Asia) offer the chance to catch our breath. (This may also be the loudest movie I’ve ever seen; at the screening I attended the person next to me literally covered his ears several times.)



Bowie describes his work as “a pudding of new ideas—we’re inventing the 21st century in 1971” and this sense of ambition improvisation and vision sits at the core of the film. He refers to his “inexhaustible supply of extracurricular thoughts.” Of course it was Bowie’s commitment to constant creative change and perpetual reinvention that was his most important contribution to pop music and to the culture in general. But this is also the one thing we all know about Bowie and by presenting everything in the subject’s own voice Morgen gets stuck on this single idea. We hear Bowie muse on his need to evolve over and over without any other perspective that might illustrate what was so radical about this attitude how it actually manifested in his work why he went certain directions. It not only dulls the impact but over the course of 140 minutes it risks becoming boring—something Bowie could never be accused of being.

In a few spots Moonage Daydream slows down enough to explore a specific moment in Bowie’s life and things snap into focus. Addressing his childhood he speaks of his distant relationship to his mother and his fear of following his half-brother whom he idolized into mental illness. He speaks of hitting a creative wall and wanting to invent a “new musical language” which leads to his relocation to Berlin and the release of three groundbreaking albums in the ‘70s. A simple slide show of Bowie’s paintings is a moving moment a quiet insight into his work that purposefully utilizes the archive to reflect on one aspect of his enormous accomplishments.

But after these glimpses Morgen returns to frenetically stacking and layering material often seeming like he’s just trying to cram in as much stuff as possible; Bowie talking over Bowie singing over added sound effects. (Inserting clips from sci-fi movies into a riveting performance of Moonage Daydream’s title track is so obvious it’s kind of insulting.) One of the movie’s themes is Bowie’s use of his art as a way to search for himself—“I’ve never been sure of my own personality” he says elsewhere noting that “I’ve always dealt with isolation in everything I write”—but there’s nothing revealed by simply piling up sounds and images no sense of how this artist’s intent was different from any other artist or why the screaming crying fans responded to him so powerfully.

Even when it’s unnecessarily interrupted though the performance footage is what ultimately matters and what stays with you after the film’s two hour-plus runtime expires. Bowie was never less than spellbinding onstage; one of the most striking scenes is a montage of him dancing cut to “Let’s Dance” and it’s a reminder of how under-appreciated his pure movement was. A few songs are allowed to stretch out—a slow-burn version of “Heroes” a pummeling rendition of “Hallo Spaceboy” from the 1995 tour with Nine Inch Nails—and time stands still.

Especially with enhanced video and audio quality (the music was remixed by longtime Bowie producer Tony Visconti) this material is simply irresistible. But as dazzling and watchable as it is Moonage Daydream needed to either tighten its focus or open up its lens—the ride it offers is too familiar for longtime fans too vague for Bowie newcomers. And experimental and exploratory as he was David Bowie always had a canny sense of who was watching. “Every artist” he said “is a figment of the audience’s imagination.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbG91ZHdpcmUuY29tL3RvYmlhcy1mb3JnZS1rZXktaG93LWdob3N0LWJlY2FtZS1hcmVuYS1iYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tobias Forge Reveals the Key to How Ghost Became an Arena Band,"Who will be the next generation of acts to pack arenas? In a broader ranging article the Wall Street Journal cites Ghost among a group of acts from multiple genres that look to be the successors to elder music acts such as the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen in keeping the arena music experience alive for years to come. And within the article Tobias Forge discusses some of the keys that helped them graduate to their current arena rock status.

Ghost's ascension didn't happen by luck or by accident. Forge actually took steps toward the goal of graduating from clubs to arenas. Looking to bands he admired such as Metallica and Iron Maiden the singer says “I sat with a map and just mapped out how they traveled. So for me it’s always been if you want to make it big if you want to be a musician you need to tour all the time. And you need to do like five shows in Wisconsin.”

There was also another key to the band's ascension as Forge reflects on getting to this stage. “If it wasn’t for the fact that we had a very strong merch situation I don’t think we would ever be able to tour the way that we have done over the last 12 years"" pointing to the band's strong artistic visual approach as well.

Having played clubs in 2012 the band will headline New York's UBS Arena next month with an 18500 person capacity.

“There is such a long list of new artists that have emerged and developed over the last 12 years that are selling out arenas and stadiums around the world” said Arthur Fogel president of global touring at Live Nation Entertainment. “It’s a regeneration cycle—not only of artists but of fans.”

As for the arena experience continuing beyond rock's elder statesmen Forge feels confident that eventually the torch will be passed down as music fans ""look to someone else."" He added “I wouldn’t be too worried about arena rock or stadium rock dying.”

The government of Australia have awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.18 billion contract to establish the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SouthPAN) to enhance precision. The system is expected to be fully operational by 2028 and will be provided as a service for 19 years with an option to extend.

The program will use a unique Lockheed Martin-developed Second-Generation Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) broadcasting on two frequencies to augment signals from two Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the European Union’s Galileo system.

The SouthPAN contract will expand Lockheed Martin’s investments toward sustainable business growth in Australia. Currently Lockheed Martin programs support around 4000 Australian jobs in advanced manufacturing and technology industries. This contract will grow that footprint with additional jobs in at least four States.



What is SBAS?



“I’ve got a GPS signal” is a common exclamation from the average user of the widely-used satellite based navigation system.

However certain industries which demand greater “integrity” – an industry term for higher positioning confidence from a GNSS receiver – use terminals capable of receiving both GNSS signals and augmented signals which refine and provide a more precise position.

The defense giant developed the laser under the Pentagon’s High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative (HELSI) an effort by the department to strengthen the directed energy industrial base and improve the quality of laser beams.

The Pentagon selected Lockheed in 2019 to “scale its spectral beam combined high energy laser architecture to the 300 kW-class level” as part of the HELSI effort according to the release. The release also notes that company completed the task ahead of schedule.

“Lockheed Martin increased the power and efficiency and reduced the weight and volume of continuous-wave high energy lasers which reduces risk for future fielding efforts of high power laser weapon systems” said Rick Cordaro vice president Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions.

The Defense Department is particularly interested in directed energy systems — high energy lasers and high-power microwave — to protect military personnel and installations from aerial threats including short-range air defense and against drones rockets mortar and artillery.

According to the release the laser will support demonstrations of the Army’s Indirect Fires Protection Capability-High Energy Laser (IFPC-HEL) which is scheduled for lab and field testing this year. The IFPC-HEL program is one of the Army’s 35 signature modernization priorities. The program falls under the service’s air and missile defense priority area but is managed by the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office.

Lockheed Martin also recently delivered a 60+ kW-class laser to the Navy as part of a program called High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-Dazzler and Surveillance.

“This recent HELSI delivery milestone also exemplifies Lockheed Martin’s commitment to 21st Century Security developing advanced technologies that provide speed agility and mission solutions that help ensure the U.S. and its allies are always prepared for what’s ahead” the Lockheed statement said.

Under another RCCTO program a Boeing-General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems team are building a 300-kW laser.

The service is delivering a Stryker-mounted 50-kilowatt laser to soldiers soon as part of the Directed Energy Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense program another signature modernization priority. Additionally the service is working to integrate a 20-kilowatt laser on an Infantry Squad Vehicle a new program called the Army Multi-Purpose High Energy Laser.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L2xvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1maWdodGVyLWRyb25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin Investing $100M in Fighter-Controlled Combat Drones,"Lockheed Martin is investing $100 million of its own money to develop a sophisticated manned-unmanned teaming capability involving F-35 fighter jets and combat drones.

Dubbed “Project Carrera” the initiative would see an F-35 pair up with “a network” of Speed Racer drones to conduct various missions.

It will focus on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) upgrading the F-35s and developing novel communications technologies to allow fighter pilots to operate drones in flight.

Under the project Lockheed will also determine the advantages of drones for pilots and how to establish trust between human operators and the AI guiding the unmanned systems.

“This is not going to be a one-off stunt where ‘Hey look we’ve connected an F-35 to this uncrewed system and we passed a track and yay success we now have a media headline that says that we did crewed-uncrewed teaming’” company official John Clark said.

“What we’re really focusing on is a systematic build up where we can evaluate that human and uncrewed system interaction and understand how those behaviors build up over time.”

Foreseen Advantages

As part of the project Lockheed wants small expendable drones dropping from a C-130 aircraft to fly toward a formation of F-35s in future battles.

F-35 pilots who are heading towards their targets can command the drones to collect data or go forward to draw fire.

The drones can also be tasked to find the target or map an alternate route to make the operations safer for pilots.

“If you’re playing chess you don’t want to put all your pawns on the back row and leave the king and the queen exposed on the front row” Clark explained.

“Just following fighters around is not an effective way to defeat a near peer adversary. You really have to have that ability to push in front of the fighters to either stimulate the integrated air defenses of the adversary or you have to be providing information.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzIxODItbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLXByZXNlbnRzLWxveWFsLXdpbmdtYW4tZHJvbmUtZm9yLWYtMzXSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzMyMTgyLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1wcmVzZW50cy1sb3lhbC13aW5nbWFuLWRyb25lLWZvci1mLTM1L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin presents loyal wingman drone for F-35,"Lockheed Martin reveals more details about the Speed Racer: a project to create a multirole drone tailor-made to accompany the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet.

The drone first announced in 2021 is going to be air-launched and modular performing the roles of reconnaissance and electronic warfare platform or acting as a decoy depending on the mission.

Developed under Project Carrera it is intended to finish development faster and enter service sooner than other comparable aircraft.

A video by Lockheed Martin posted on September 15 2022 portrays what appears to be a preliminary design of the drone complete with foldable wings and stealth coating.

The main focus of Project Carrera is manned-unmanned teaming with what the company calls “human-centric” design receiving particular attention emphasizing ease of control and interaction with the drones.

Breezes flow freely through the open windows of the 1950’s ranch house pulling you past the kitchen island where Jessie arranges a salad straight to the backyard where Brian harvests avocados from their giant tree.

It’s magic hour at the De Lowes–that time of day when the sun is glowing and just about to set and there’s a hazy light that makes everything gorgeous. The home dubbed Four Feathers Farm House is their most recent passion project. Purchased during the pandemic it has views of the canyons and the ocean and they completely transformed it into a true paradise for their family. Their days in Montecito are defined by beach walks and picnics with their daughters 4-year-old Amelie and 1-year-old Lucia–and there’s a palpable gratitude for the life they’ve created here for their family.

Jessie is a manifestation coach and founder of popular wellness platform How You Glow. Her background in art therapy and yoga is evident in both her blissed-out demeanor and creative approach to life. Brian’s warmth and hospitality is no surprise–as co-founder and president of Proper Hotels he spends his working hours creating some of the most welcoming and visually-arresting spaces (and my personal favorite places to stay.)

To spend time with Jessie and Brian is to feel like family–you’re invited to kickoff your shoes grab a drink and get cozy in this slice of paradise they’ve manifested here in Montecito. Scroll on for my interview with one of my favorite couples and all the details from the magic hour gathering they hosted for friends at Four Feathers Farm House.

About their home and life in Montecito

Tell us about your incredible home–how did Four Feathers Farmhouse come to be?

We had been renting in Montecito and looking for a place for our family to settle–and when we saw Four Feathers Farm House we knew how special the property was. We felt the good energy of the property immediately while touring.

There were 6 gorgeous chickens free ranging in this bountiful lush garden that felt like Hawaii or Costa Rica. The property is full of abundant avocado trees passion fruit persimmons plums figs citrus bananas… it really has it all.

We were sold on the outside but the inside was not as inspiring to us however the bones were amazing. We took the opportunity to design our dream home with the help of House of Honey over 7 months or so. We moved in while it was still under construction towards the end but thanks to the indoor-outdoor nature of the house we didn’t feel too restricted.

What are some of your go-to weeknight meals to eat at home?

Roasted salmon and veggies linguine with clams and garlic little gems salad

What’s your typical breakfast?

Brian makes the most delicious decaf oat milk lattes and brings it to me in bed every morning. My friend recently brought over some homemade collagen marshmallows that I’ve been putting on top which really takes it to the next level!

Recently we have been intermittent fasting and waiting to eat until after we work out so the first meal is typically around 11AM – sometimes we have breakfast but other times we go straight to lunch. Ideally a big salad with some protein and then some granola with berries and yogurt for dessert.

Walk us through a typical weekend for your family.

We have the coziest cuddle session in bed first thing in the morning. Amelie and Lucia watch cartoons while Brian and I relax drinking our coffee. Then we head over to the farmers market to shop for the week. We run into so many friends here as Santa Barbara truly is a small town dance to live music and just enjoy the amazing energy.

Then we head to Oat Bakery to pick up some of their delicious hygge buns charcoal sesame sourdough bread and whichever seasonal loaves they have that day. If we’re feeling ambitious we will hit up the Santa Barbara fish market to grab some seafood for dinner. We usually pick up breakfast burritos to take home with us from Corazon and bring them home to have a picnic outside in our garden while Lucia naps.

In the afternoon we’ll take an e-bike ride (our girls are absolutely obsessed with e-biking!) and meet up with friends to drink wine and eat while the children play together. In the evening Brian and I will either go for a date night (we love getting a drink at San Ysidro Ranch for sunset and then splitting a burger and fried chicken sandwich at Honor Bar) or have a family dinner at home and invite friends over to join us.

On food and cooking

Jessie how did you learn to cook?

My mom is a professional cook cooking teacher and cookbook author so I learned everything by osmosis. Watching her in the kitchen and just growing up in a family that is so obsessed with and focused on food definitely rubbed off on me. Cooking is such an amazing way to make guests feel welcome appreciated and to express love.

What informs your approach to food?

Living in Santa Barbara is such a gift because we have year round access to the most incredible produce and seafood! My approach is to focus on what’s fresh in season and really let the ingredients shine. I love a colorful plate of food…I find that the more colors I include on a plate the more excited my kids are to eat it.

What’s your must-have cooking tool?

I’ve been adding a lot of lemon to my cooking and salad dressings so the lemon squeezer has been used quite a bit recently.

Tell us a few things we’ll always find in your refrigerator?

Pickled veggies many different cheeses little gems lettuce baby arugula apples eggs oat milk kimchi berries

How they gather

What does a great gathering look like for you?

A great gathering means there is vibey music playing friends are laughing eating and drinking while feeling relaxed and at home.

What scares you about entertaining?

Timing everything correctly! I don’t want to burn anything but also want to be present and attentive to guests so I try to make dishes that can be prepped ahead of time and assembled when it’s time to eat.

What are your signature dishes for gatherings?

I always make a large charcuterie board for guests to graze on. I make sure to have something for everyone on there and make it really visually pleasing by adding lots of color and beautiful flowers. A big crusty loaf of sourdough bread on the side is always a good idea.

I make a big salad with whatever is fresh from the market. I make sure to always include some toasted nuts for a crunch and some fruit for sweetness.

Lately I’ve been obsessed with the Farro Salad from Charlie Bird and have been making that on repeat.

What’s one tip for someone who wants to host a gathering on a budget?

Make it a potluck!

Favorite conversation starter or question to get to know someone?

What have you been thinking about lately?

The perfect dinner party playlist includes:

Nicola Cruz and Jorge Drexler

Go-to centerpiece:

Flowers and citrus fruits from the garden. Also the cheeseboard can be a beautiful centerpiece!

What is your no-stress party rule to live by?

Guests are only as relaxed as their hosts!

Dream dinner guests?

Our parents. It’s always such a treat to have them here.

Sentence Finishers:

A perfect meal should be… enjoyed outside and barefoot.

It’s not a dinner party without… a mid-meal performance from our daughter Amelie.

Redoing the floors in your home is a major renovation and can get pretty costly depending on the size of the room and the material you choose. You also have to factor in the price of installation as well (unless you plan on doing the job yourself). In this case with professional installation the average price of laminate floors is between $1500 to $3500 for a home says Fixr.

When shopping for the best deals for renovation and remodeling projects you're probably looking at both Home Depot or Lowe's two of the biggest home renovation stores out there. Home Depot has eight options from brown tones to rustic finishes. Lowe's has several selections as well including water-resistant and with attached padding.

On Thursday the billionaire founder of Lululemon Athletica Chip Wilson announced plans to make his biggest-ever philanthropic gift to preserve land in Canada’s rugged British Columbia.

The donation of $100 million in Canadian dollars or about $76 million U.S. will be made via the Wilson 5 Foundation the Wilson family’s philanthropic organization.

When asked about the impetus for the donation Wilson said that it came after recognizing how far the money could go in the province. “We keep coming back to B.C.” he said during an interview on Bloomberg television noting his family’s penchant for taking hiking-related vacations. “We’ve got a province twice the size of California and we just recognized that so little of it is inhabitable and it’s so rugged and it’s so beautiful and it’s relatively inexpensive” he said.

Because of the low price tag his donation could translate to “massive swaths of land” becoming parks said Wilson the 13th wealthiest person in Canada with a fortune of over $5 billion. The B.C. Parks Foundation has already noted three areas within the province it hopes to protect using the funds which represent the biggest private donation in Canadian conservation history.

British Columbia home to over five million people contains seven Canadian national parks. Lululemon was founded in Vancouver the province’s most populous city in 1998.

Wilson revealed the donation a day after Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard announced his decision to give away his entire fortune by transferring the company to a nonprofit with the explicit goal of using all of its profits to combat climate change.

“Hopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn’t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people” said Chouinard in an interview with the New York Times.

Chouinard has been a longtime critic of excessive wealth and described himself in the interview as being “pissed off” about being listed as a billionaire in Forbes. “Truth be told there were no good options available” he said in a statement. “So we created our own.”

Wilson’s and Chouinard’s philanthropic decisions come as climate-change-related catastrophes become more pronounced across the world with some scientists arguing that Earth is approaching climate “tipping points” earlier than expected.

Europe continues to endure extreme heat that has exacerbated an energy crisis and damaged valuable harvests. Parts of China and the U.S. are facing similar issues.

But while in Brazil the development of the system was spearheaded by the Central Bank (and imposed on big banks) Colombia and now Peru have opted for the private route.

Peruvian clearing house Cámara de Compensación Electrónica (CCE) an organization owned by 15 financial institutions and responsible for all bank-to-bank electronic transactions in the country has been making partnerships with major global financial providers to take its infrastructure to the next level.

Prior to the inception of the CCE in 2000 the Peruvian Central Bank (BCRP) managed the clearance of checks transfers debits and bills manually. Entrusting the work to a corporation that has the country’s largest financial institutions as shareholders was the fastest way the monetary authority found to digitize these transactions and reach international standards.

In 2018 CCE signed a major partnership with Mastercard subsidiary Vocalink to transform its servers — previously limited to operating on working days — into 24/7 payment rails. The company was chosen for its experience in developing rapid payment structures in the United Kingdom and U.S.

Last year another partnership was signed with Vocalink to further develop CCE’s Immediate Interbank Transfers (IIT) created in 2016. This time another global payment provider ACI Worldwide was also brought in as part of the agreement. It is through ACI that partner banks can access Mastercard’s instant payment service.

e announcements took place in the o£ﬁcial launch event at their Headquarters where the card was unveiled. Labeled “ e Better Card”- the Eyowo debit card is a numberless Mastercard which gives cardholders access to a safer and seamless payment experience that eliminates the risk of card fraud by safely storing their payment credentials in the Eyowo X mobile app.

Omoseindemi Olubayo CEO of Eyowo in his keynote a£ﬁrms that this is one of the major strides the company has made to provide banking services that

prioritize the relationship Nigerians and Africans have with money. Customers will also receive an innovative physical card which doesn’t contain sensitive information such as the card number and expiration date providing ultimate protection for the theft of personal and ﬁnancial information.

In a session explaining how the card works Nimide Fala Eyowo's Chief Marketing O£ﬁcer gave a short demo of e Better Card. e card's PAN and expiry date are stored digitally on the bank app. Another interesting thing that can be done with the Eyowo App is freezing spending or creating spending limits on the card.

Giving insights into Mastercard’s partnership Kari Tukur MasterCard SSA Vice President mentioned that at MasterCard they believe in enabling end-to-end digital access from the point where a new consumer is onboarded to the point of transaction. She said it's one of the principles on which the MasterCard Digital First

programme is built which was why it was easy to work on e Better Card project with Eyowo.

is has been a three-year project for the Eyowo Team whilst pursuing and putting better user-security at the core of their minds. Eyowo documented the creation process of # eBetterCard to walk you through the journey of how and why the sleekest safest and most inclusive debit card was made.

But is that a good thing?,"You could argue that almost three decades of American dysfunction began at The Belfry. At the next Ryder Cup at Muirfield Village in the U.S. home captain Jack Nicklaus was incredibly frustrated that the American fans were not at all partisan. They hadn't gotten the memo and despite his best efforts (Nicklaus even bought them all miniature flags) they were still the same polite bunch who applauded shots from both teams. Only when 1991 came around and Dave Stockton the U.S. captain brought a military theme to the Cup that became known as ""The War By the Shore"" had the American fans caught on. Since then like clockwork the European players and their families complain every Ryder Cup about the surly U.S. crowds. If you don't believe it here are some links from the last six U.S. Ryder Cups including two the home team lost: 1999 2004 2008 2012 2016 and 2021. The narrative never fails.

With both Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Ramkumar Ramanathan losing their respective singles matches to world No. 2 Casper Ruud and Viktor Durasovic respectively on Day 1 India entered Day 2 needing to win all their three matches to salvage the tie.

In the first match of the day a doubles contest Yuki Bhambri and Saketh Myneni paired up to look for the win which would keep India in the tie but lost 3-6 6-3 3-6 to Casper Ruud and Viktor Durasovic at the Hakons Hall in Lillehammer.

Yuki Bhambri and Saketh Myneni both doubles specialists were expected to put up a stiff challenge considering the duo is coming off a successful 2022 season which saw them win five ATP Challengers and two Futures events.

However the Indian pair found themselves on the ropes early as they failed to hold their serve in the second game. Bhambri and Myneni immediately broke the Norway pair and levelled up the score at 2-2 in the first set but Ruud and Durasovic seemed more comfortable on home turf and cruised to a 6-3 win in the first set.

Yuki Bhambri and Saketh Myneni put up a much better challenge in the second set and finally broke through the norway pair’s serve in the sixth game. The Indians held on to reverse the scores from set one and forced a third set.

With everything riding on the final set the Indian pair started well but faltered in the fourth game to go 3-1 down. Ruud and Viktor Durasovic stayed solid from there on out to close out the match in just under two hours.

With Norway 3-0 up in the five-match tie the remaining two singles matches became dead rubbers.

Sumit Nagal playing for the first time in the tie finally registered India on the scoreboard with a 6-2 6-1 win over Lukas Hellum Lilleengen and made it 3-1.

As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields.

McDonald’s is rolling out a cheese Danish which was last on menus in the 1980s. The flakey pastry is filled with a sweet cream cheese and topped with streusel and a vanilla drizzle.

Wendy’s is adding to its Made to Crave menu with the reintroduction of the Pretzel Bacon Pub Cheeseburger after it left menus in 2021.

Piled on a pretzel bun a quarter pound of beef is topped with Muenster cheese applewood smoked bacon as well as a smoky honey mustard beer cheese sauce crispy-fried onions and pickles.

“Our Made to Crave menu is a place for our culinary team to experiment with new concepts and introduce fans to latest flavor trends in a familiar yet unique-to-Wendy’s way” said John Li vice president of culinary innovation for the Wendy’s Co. “But sometimes when you land on a hit like the Pretzel Bacon Pub the culinary magic lies in bringing items back to the menu instead of creating a new flavor profile. With flavor combinations like beer cheese sauce and honey mustard — the Pretzel Bacon Pub Cheeseburger creates an elevated cheeseburger experience you’ll want to try again and again.”

Panda Express is taking things in a plant-based direction with its Beyond The Original Orange Chicken. Made with Beyond Meat’s chicken the plant-based alternative is tossed in the company’s signature sweet and spicy orange sauce.

“We are thrilled to offer Beyond The Original Orange Chicken to consumers nationwide for the very first time” said Dariush Ajami chief innovation officer at Beyond Meat. “By partnering with Panda Express to introduce new and innovative plant-based options that deliver the delicious taste and experience of their iconic menu items we’re enabling people to enjoy their favorite dishes with the upsides of plant-based meat.”

Nevertheless we know that our readers all have their own perspectives so we are always looking at the latest trends in value growth and momentum to find strong picks.

Looking at the history of these trends perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.

Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.

One company value investors might notice is McKesson (MCK). MCK is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.62. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.91. Over the past 52 weeks MCK's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.11 and as low as 9.58 with a median of 12.67.

MCK is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.36. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MCK's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.69. Within the past year MCK's PEG has been as high as 1.52 and as low as 0.96 with a median of 1.25.

Finally investors should note that MCK has a P/CF ratio of 21.77. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 21.99. Within the past 12 months MCK's P/CF has been as high as 24.50 and as low as -10.53 with a median of 18.63.

These are just a handful of the figures considered in McKesson's great Value grade. Still they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook and we can clearly see that MCK is an impressive value stock right now.

The medtech giant’s next-generation TAVR won FDA approval in 2021 followed by a limited roll out earlier this year. Edwards Lifesciences —Medtronic’s major U.S. competitor in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement space — announced the launch of its next-gen Sapien 3 Ultra Resilia heart valve earlier in the week.

The Evolut FX system incorporates design changes. For example it includes gold markers built into the frame to provide implanters with direct visualization of commissure alignment.

There’s also a redesigned catheter tip for a smoother insertion profile. Delivery system flexibility features include an optimized stability layer for a more stable predictable deployment. As with its Evolut Pro+ predecessor there are four valve sizes — a large indicated patient treatment range. Medtronic says the Evolut FX has the lowest delivery profile currently on the market.

“This represents a milestone for our structural heart business as we look to set new expectations for TAVR delivery systems and optimize outcomes for patients. These innovations will equip physicians with improved implant predictability ultimately improving the overall reliability of the procedure” said Dr. Jeffrey Popma VP and chief medical officer for the Structural Heart & Aortic business which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic.

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

Facebook Instagram and TikTok are now pulling back from social commerce after betting big on it booming following a pandemic-induced spike in online sales. Don’t call it a complete U-turn though these moves are more of a rethink of what social commerce means moving forward.

Here’s the rundown on how and why each platform has pulled back from social commerce and whether this feature will ever catch on with advertisers.

What is actually happening?

Meta will shut down Facebook’s live commerce shopping program next month after sister site Instagram axed its affiliate commerce program in August.

It seems one of the biggest issues which drove this decision was the changes Apple made to iOS 14 with the depreciation of its IDFAs. “That caused a drop in attributed performance on Meta and resulted in a lot of brands reassessing the role of Meta’s platforms in their campaigns” said Mudit Jaju global head of e-commerce at Wavemaker Global.

Then there’s TikTok. While not totally pulling the ripcord on social commerce the short-form video app has announced its plan to streamline its commerce solution by creating three new advertising formats with the aim of simplifying the process for marketers leading up to the busy Q4 holiday period of 2022. This came after The Financial Times reported the app had abandoned its social commerce expansion plans in Europe and the U.S.

“TikTok is innately built for a more immersive experience which enables brands to merchandise themselves better than they could on Meta’s platforms” added Jaju. “Facebook Shops for example was the equivalent of popping a catalog on the internet whereas TikTok is more like incorporating a home shopping channel on the platform. It’s a meaningfully different experience.”

Why aren’t consumers and marketers buying it?

According to Jaju the reason consumers haven’t yet bought into social commerce is down to the clunkiness of the experience irrespective of the platform. “The process of selecting the product and building your basket isn’t seamless” he continued. “The platforms haven’t made it easy for a manufacturing brand or retailer to do things so they don’t end up doing it because the juice is not worth the squeeze.”

Also the industry still hasn’t come to grips with transactional buying on social media just yet.

“It feels like the industry has moved a bit too quickly and we’re trying to force the customer down that route when actually the level of comfort a customer has with purchasing in that way isn’t there yet” said Sarah Penny content & research director at Influencer Intelligence.

Another issue is these social commerce moves were expected to thrive at a time of economic turmoil. In the U.K. for example households are embroiled in a cost of living crisis and more broadly there is the risk of a global recession. In other words it’s bad timing. “If we’re launching new ways of purchasing online and we’re heading into a UK cost of living crisis and risks of global recession it’s not going to be easy for any industry to be buying particularly when it’s a new journey for purchase” Penny added.

As for why marketers haven’t fully jumped on the bandwagon many are still figuring out whether it’s a worthwhile endeavor.

“Some think of it as purchasing everything in-app some consider it as live streaming with an influencer selling products while others believe social commerce is having shoppable tags on their content” said Penny. “When we can’t fully define what we mean by it because it’s so new it shows there’s real nuance within the industry that needs to enable all brands to catch up to be able to provide that uniformity.”

The challenge with purchasing outside social apps is advertisers’ inability to form consumer profiles. Rachel Tipograph founder & CEO of MikMak believes many social platforms have been trying to own first-party data and thought they could monetize it by figuring out how to get consumers to complete their purchases within the social apps. But the native checkout hasn’t come to life in the way they thought it would.

Don’t call it a pull back

Despite so much uncertainty over the immediate future of social commerce it’s clear that the platforms aren’t done with it. There’s too much money at stake.

Business consulting firm Grand View Research’s latest report stated the global social commerce market reached $584.91 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 30.8% between 2022 and 2030. Moreover TikTok’s Chinese counterpart Douyin’s social commerce business has been going from strength to strength. In fact in-stream commerce is the platform’s biggest money maker. According to Chinese publication 36Kr Douyin achieved ¥22 billion ($3.15 billion) in gross merchandise volume for H1 2022 already surpassing its yearly goal of ¥20 billion ($2.87 billion).

“I think that audience was primed to do in-app shopping because they’ve grown up with the likes of WeChat where social commerce has been fundamentally intertwined in a way it hasn’t in platforms in the Western world” said Jaju.

So while it seems these social giants are pulling the rug from under social commerce it’s instead a chance to refine and rethink.

“The Chinese market is so critical to social commerce because it shows there is an opportunity there” added Penny. “It accounts for billions of pounds of revenue every year. With these platforms getting cold feet they need to give it a chance and let the industry mature and professionalize to get the right objectives. Everything’s happened so quickly the customer sentiment needs to catch up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL3VzLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtcnVsZXMtYWdhaW5zdC1iaWctdGVjaHMtYWJpbGl0eS1yZWd1bGF0ZS1vbmxpbmUtc3BlZWNoLTIwMjItMDktMTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. appeals court rejects big tech's right regulate online speech,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL3VzLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtcnVsZXMtYWdhaW5zdC1iaWctdGVjaHMtYWJpbGl0eS1yZWd1bGF0ZS1vbmxpbmUtc3BlZWNoLTIwMjItMDktMTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023952F1E410>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

David Becker/Las Vegas News Bureau

It could be argued that every weekend in Las Vegas is a party but this weekend is extra special and annually is one of the heaviest for visitor traffic.

That’s partly because Mexican Independence Day is being celebrated all over the Las Vegas Valley with sporting events concerts and more.

Mexicans around the world celebrated the holiday — known by many as “El Grito de Dolores” or “El Grito” — on Friday though different festivities and events will take place all weekend.

Perhaps the most anticipated event is tonight at T-Mobile Arena where superstar Mexican boxer Canelo Alvarez will battle Gennadiy Golovkin in the third meeting between the rivals.

And then Sunday the Las Vegas Raiders — one of the most popular U.S. pro sports teams within the Hispanic community — host the Arizona Cardinals for the team’s home opener at Allegiant Stadium.

On Friday the Raiders posted a Tweet with the Mexican flag and the message “viva Mexico” to mark the holiday.

“This is going to be a huge weekend in Las Vegas” said Paul Davis senior vice president of entertainment booking for MGM Resorts International which is a partial owner of T-Mobile Arena. “This is an important holiday for our resorts and a big few days for Las Vegas which has come back roaring (from pandemic closures in 2020).”

In 2019 the last calendar year not disrupted by the pandemic Las Vegas welcomed over 42 million visitors or about 3.5 million per month according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Last year the city welcomed close to 2.7 million visitors per month though it’s widely expected that the visitor total for 2022 will be closer to the 2019 figure.

Through July according to LVCVA statistics Las Vegas has attracted just over 22 million visitors so far in 2022. If the city continues welcoming visitors at that pace through the end of the year it would record over 37 million tourists for 2022.

The occupancy rate is high at hotels this weekend and whatever rooms that are left aren’t cheap. As of Friday the most affordable room in downtown was $333 at Four Queens; on the Strip it’s $399 at New York New York.

Davis said the big fight “adds to the buzz” around Mexican Independence Day this year in Las Vegas but there are plenty of additional events around the valley.

Among many different concert offerings in Las Vegas this weekend international superstar Enrique Iglesias will finish his two-night concert stand tonight at Resorts World and Mexican singer Alejandro Fernandez will play tonight at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Mexican-born rocker Carlos Santana a longtime Las Vegas resident artist is set to play at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay and Christian Nodal will rock out Sunday at Grand Garden Arena.

Mexican band Bronco is set to entertain tonight at The Theater at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

Mexican tourists have always been important for Las Vegas’ tourism.

In 2019 the year before the COVID-19 pandemic showed up in America Las Vegas welcomed 1.1 million visitors from Mexico according to the LVCVA.

That was slightly down from 2015 and 2016 which each saw about 1.2 million travelers from Mexico show up.

“Mexico has long been one of Las Vegas’ top international markets and we’re delighted to once again welcome visitors to celebrate the Mexican Independence Day holiday as well as Hispanic Heritage Month” H. Fletch Brunelle vice president of marketing for the LVCVA said in a statement.

Brunelle said there were 40 weekly nonstop flights from Mexico City Guadalajara and Monterrey into Las Vegas.

“The resorts do a fantastic job of celebrating Mexican Independence Day through concerts comedy and sports events featuring Latin America’s top talent” Brunelle said.

It’s not just on the Strip where Mexican Independence Day is being celebrated.

Clark County officials hosted a gathering Friday which was attended by Commissioner Jim Gibson and the occasion will be marked all weekend at the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian with performances by mariachi bands dancers and Latin-themed artists.

Las Vegas attorney David Lopez-Negrete who sits as a director on the Nevada Latino Bar Association board called the celebration of Mexico’s independence “hugely important” for Mexican Americans living in Southern Nevada.

Lopez-Negrete was born in Mexico but his family later came to the U.S. where he established citizenship.

“This is our home even though lots of us have immigrant roots” Lopez-Negrete said. “We’re a huge part of the community here in Clark County. In Nevada Mexicans comprise about 40% of all immigrants who come to the state so this is a big opportunity for the Mexican community to celebrate our heritage.”

Lopez-Negrete said he proudly celebrated both the Fourth of July and Mexican Independence Day.

“I love how all the properties on the Strip host all these different events from concerts to food and just the celebration of culture” Lopez-Negrete said. “I know lots of people not just Mexicans are excited about Mexican Independence Day and Hispanic Heritage Month.”

The Mexican Independence Day celebration isn’t all that’s bringing visitors to town this weekend.

The three-day Life is Beautiful festival in downtown Las Vegas is expected to bring 170000 attendees officials said. The festival includes musical acts art exhibits comedians and culinary talent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2JjYW1lcmljYXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvd3lubi1odWRzb24teWFyZHMtbnljLWNhc2luby1wcm9wb3NhbC_SAU1odHRwczovL3NiY2FtZXJpY2FzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3d5bm4taHVkc29uLXlhcmRzLW55Yy1jYXNpbm8tcHJvcG9zYWwvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wynn Will Propose An NYC Casino At Hudson Yards,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='sbcamericas.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/09/16/wynn-hudson-yards-nyc-casino-proposal/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FD51810>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2JjYW1lcmljYXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvd3lubi1odWRzb24teWFyZHMtbnljLWNhc2luby1wcm9wb3NhbC_SAU1odHRwczovL3NiY2FtZXJpY2FzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3d5bm4taHVkc29uLXlhcmRzLW55Yy1jYXNpbm8tcHJvcG9zYWwvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Growing up like many other kids I just wanted to be a pilot! The idea of being able to control a flying machine the size of a building and to be able to travel the world and take people across continents just seemed too good to not pursue! But naturally as I grew older my passions diverged and my career objectives morphed but they always revolved around building creating or innovating! In other words “Engineering”! So I went on to get my BS in manufacturing engineering followed by an MBA to connect the technical to the real-life business aspects.What always fascinated me about engineering is that there is far more to know than what we discover engineer and learn in a lifetime. And that curiosity passion to re-engineer myself every day my skills my work and to be the best version of myself landed me the opportunities and growth that I couldn’t have dreamt of as I started out.I always ran towards the fire. I picked projects that were out of my comfort zone and challenging to execute. I had not foreseen that I would be managing one of Boeing’s largest engineering and technology centres outside the US working with a 4000+ diverse and talented team of engineers and technologists in India. These opportunities come when we dare to enter the unknown – and no one exemplifies this attitude better than us engineers.We are always solving and engineering the unknown – so why not ourselves? My piece of advice to young engineers is: The time is right and the time is now – do what others shy away from doing. Learn to go beyond what you know. Grow your skills read widely not just about your subject. Listen carefully ask questions learn and volunteer challenge yourself. Most importantly be positive and have fun. Engineering has a serious side often dealing with situations where failure can yield catastrophic results. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t enjoy what we do every day.Remember every door opens for a reason – take a peek if not enter. I may not be a pilot but today I am making airplanes and have a job that has taking me all over the world on those same airplanes I helped create. I may not be an inventor but I work with the team that is inventing round-the-clock. Be on the lookout!Technology is one of the areas that encourages diverse talent and welcomes people who embrace multiple identities of gender ability etc. From the vantage point of my two decades of experience I can safely say that there hasn’t been a better time (yet) to be a woman in technology or anyone from a historically under-represented segment.From my initial days as a product owner with a product company then working with contact centre technologies and later in retail product development and now with infrastructure technologies I have witnessed change from the frontlines.From being the rare woman on the team in my early days I see the younger workforce taking for granted and indeed expecting to be part of a diverse team that embraces multiple identities. Gen Z and millennials already form a significant proportion of the workforce and they bring in a refreshingly equitable ethos.The pandemic further accelerated flexibility and pushed companies to fully embrace the agility that technology provided workforces. With more options for part-time and remote work people can take breaks to accommodate life events and also no longer worry about skills becoming obsolete as training is available online.The technology workplace of course is not idyllic or ideal and there are many things to fix. But just as there is no perfect or immutable code as long as we continue to engineer solutions and make things a little better every day the world is a slightly better place for that.Sarada Vempati EVP and Head of Enterprise Functions Technology Wells Fargo India & PhilippinesGrowing up I have watched my parents find clever ways to make life around the house convenient and remove or fix obstacles by using ingenuity always ensuring that the solution worked towards saving time effort or money.My formative years therefore was a lived experience in terms of identifying problems defining solutions testing ideas implementing the best options and measuring outcomes. This approach transferred easily to my studies as I began to explore and understand more complex problems in mathematics and physics and how specific solutions had been arrived at. My work has taken me across the globe and I have worked with many cultures but a science-based first principles approach is universal. Much like musicians who can read notations and understand music theory it is almost like having a common language to approach problems.Today I work at Micron where I use some of the same principles as we build the foundations of the digital age. Our work at the hardware level of the world’s information and data helps enrich lives and solve some of the biggest challenges facing humanity today. While theoretical knowledge and context is foundational look for everyday uses of these concepts to make life just a little better for you or your community. Discuss these ideas with a trusted pier group allow them to build on your thoughts and arrive at entirely new solutions. This to me is the heart of what it means to be an engineer.",,,

Few Microsoft partners have a single business model 85 percent of partners expect a revenue increase and partners who co-sell with Microsoft and develop their own intellectual property grow faster. These are some of the findings from a report Microsoft published Thursday weeks ahead of the Redmond Wash.-based tech giant’s annual Ignite developers conference. “Our work with partners impacts every facet of what we do; from conception of ideas with our customers to how we inspire and design and how we execute in the field and drive deals together” Nicole Dezen Microsoft’s chief partner officer and corporate vice president of global partner solutions wrote in a blog post announcing the report. “And most importantly it impacts how we help customers realize the value of our technology.” [RELATED: Microsoft Partners At A Crossroads: Radical Changes Rattling The Channel] CRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment. Part of the report was a survey of 765 Microsoft partners worldwide and interviews with 12 partners. All surveyed partners offer cloud software as part of their business according to the report. The 12 partners were Accenture Annata Crayon Duck Creek Exceedra Flintfox Palo Alto Networks PROS SAS Softchoice Tata Consultancy Services and TD Synnex. Here’s what you need to know from the study.

Most Partner Revenue From Horizontal Solutions The Microsoft study showed that 57 percent of partner revenue comes from broader horizontal services without regard to industry. The remaining 43 percent of partner revenue comes from industry-specific services according to the survey. “Microsoft partners are diversifying their business models with a focus on building and selling their own services (including project-based and managed services) and software” according to the survey. “This is a broad-based trend for Microsoft partners and is validated by business models that tend to differ by the ratio of revenue from specific activities and differentiated approaches to the market.”

Few Partners Have A Single Business Model A majority of partners surveyed about whether they only engage in reselling selling services or selling their own software responded that they engage in multiple business models. Only 20 percent said they engage in one business model – although the study didn’t break out which business model was most popular among that 20 percent. The remaining 80 percent surveyed said they engage in at least two of the three models with 25 percent engaging in all three.

Software-Led Partners Lead In Revenue Multiple Growth Speed The survey determined that for every dollar of Microsoft revenue partners who derive most of their revenue from selling their own software received the highest multiple in their business based on activities or share at $10.11. Services-led partners made $7.63 for every $1 of Microsoft revenue. The survey did not break out the multiple for resale-led partners. Software-led partners also expect to grow their business at 46 percent in 2022 higher than the 23 percent services-led partners expect and the 21 percent resale-led partners expect. Partners who mostly sell their own software also have higher gross margins at 51 percent. Services-led partners have a 45 percent gross margin. Resale-led partners have a 24 percent gross margin according to the study.

85 Percent Of Partners Expect Revenue Increase Microsoft partners saw 19 percent revenue growth on average for their Microsoft business in 2021 according to the survey. They expect 26 percent growth in 2022. Last year 74 percent of partners increased their Microsoft-related revenue. About 20 percent maintained their revenue and 4 percent saw a decrease. Eighty-five percent of partners expect an increase in Microsoft-related revenue this year while 13 percent expect it to stay consistent. Only 2 percent of partners expect a decrease in Microsoft-related revenue in 2022 according to the survey.

Partners Engaged In More Solution Areas Grow More Partners who focused on all six of Microsoft’s “solution areas” – modern work security Azure core digital and application innovation data and artificial intelligence (AI) and business applications – grew faster than partners with a specialty in one area according to the study. Six-solution-area partners saw 26 percent revenue growth in 2021 compared to 15 percent growth for specialists. This year six-solution-area partners expect 47 percent growth compared to 25 percent for single-solution-area partners. “Breadth of partner engagement across Microsoft Cloud is one of the distinguishing characteristics of partners that bet on Microsoft” according to the survey.

Co-Sell Partners Grow Faster Partners who co-sell with Microsoft – that is the partner works with Microsoft on building demand sales planning sharing sales leads and delivering services though Azure Marketplace and AppSource – grow revenue faster than partners who don’t according to the survey. In 2021 co-sell partners grew Microsoft business revenue by 29 percent according to the survey. Partners who don’t co-sell with Microsoft grew 15 percent. Co-sell partners expect to grow their Microsoft business revenue 39 percent in 2022 according to the survey. Partners who don’t co-sell expect 20 percent growth. “Co-selling with Microsoft is often a critical part of partners’ growth strategies” according to the survey. “Co-selling enables partners to work with Microsoft’s field-sales teams to generate and share opportunities as well as to expand and extend their customer engagements. … Co-selling also provides partners with access to enterprise customers and strengthens their credibility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvZ29vZ2xlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1jYW4tZ2V0LXlvdXItcGFzc3dvcmRzLXZpYS13ZWItYnJvd3NlcnMtc3BlbGxjaGVjay_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L2dvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtY2FuLWdldC15b3VyLXBhc3N3b3Jkcy12aWEtd2ViLWJyb3dzZXJzLXNwZWxsY2hlY2svYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Microsoft can get your passwords via web browser's spellcheck,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvZ29vZ2xlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1jYW4tZ2V0LXlvdXItcGFzc3dvcmRzLXZpYS13ZWItYnJvd3NlcnMtc3BlbGxjaGVjay_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L2dvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtY2FuLWdldC15b3VyLXBhc3N3b3Jkcy12aWEtd2ViLWJyb3dzZXJzLXNwZWxsY2hlY2svYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000023950F9C100>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Brad Sarsfield wouldn’t be the first mild-mannered tech worker to transform into a bit of a screaming lunatic when mixing with the “12s” and cheering for the Seattle Seahawks. Football and fandom does weird things to ordinary people.

But the longtime Microsoft software engineer is a somewhat unique bird among Hawks fans. He’s one of those people who needs more than a team jersey or a foam finger to express enthusiasm and allegiance on game day.

Sarsfield a 44-year-old father of four from Gig Harbor Wash. returned to work on Monday after a 12-week parental leave from Microsoft. He left early to attend the Seahawk’s season opener against the Denver Broncos and Russell Wilson on “Monday Night Football.”

Between work and Lumen Field he became HawkMan.

The inspiration for Brad Sarfield’s HawkMan costume came from an illustration on Reddit left. The get-up features a number of superhero modifications including a Wonder Woman helmet and Batman chest plate. (William Sabato Image left and photo courtesy of Brad Sarsfield)

“To keep myself busy to get off the computer to do something physically creative I started to build this costume” Sarsfield said of the project he took on over the summer.

Already parents to kids ages 7 9 and 11 Sarsfield and his wife are fostering a 1-year-old boy which made Sarsfield eligible for Microsoft’s parental leave benefit. After more than 20 years at the tech giant he began his time off in June after his kids got out of school.

“I put the kids to bed and I’d spend three or four hours every night” he said of his costume construction. “Part of it was decompression therapy. I love figuring out how to do new and weird things and it was a chance to learn a skill that wasn’t on the keyboard.”

Sarsfield said he normally lives at the intersection of data and mixed reality working on the next iteration and generation of computing. He’s worked on Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality and robotics.

“You kind of get to invent the future” he said of his work. “That’s the thing about tech. It necessitates a level of creativity. When you fix and work on virtual things all day long it’s nice to have something that you can feel and touch and see.”

A longtime Seahawks fan Sarsfield was on the team’s Blue Pride waitlist for 10 years and just got season tickets with a friend in the south end zone at Lumen Field. The seats on the field are where a number of more energetic and well-outfitted fans sit.

“There’s a ton of superfans around there” he said. “Mr. and Mrs. Seahawk sit over my left side. They’re awesome. And the guy who sits beside me is Captain Seahawk. … It’s cool. They’ve got the TV cameras in your face.”

HawkMan is a mashup of Seahawks pride and superhero influence and it’s Sarsfield’s first foray into cosplay. He got the idea from an illustration he saw on Reddit by a user named William Sabato who draws other NFL team caricatures.

Some details of the get-up include:

A modified Wonder Woman Golden Eagle helmet made out of EVA craft foam like those sold on Etsy. He learned how to paint and seal it on YouTube.

A Batman cosplay chest plate also made of foam and modified with a Seahawks front-facing logo.

Batman Dark Knight forearm guards painted Seahawks blue and green.

Feather detailing on his right shoulder pad and Lumen Field’s roofline on his left.

Knockoffs of the Nike MAG sneakers from “Back to the Future” also painted to Seahawks specs.

Sarsfield said the hardest item to track down was a pair of uniform pants like the players wear. He ended up buying actual pants worn by ex-Seahawks linebacker KJ Wright off the team’s charity auction site.

“It was fun to show up in this thing” Sarsfield said of Monday’s much-hyped game in which more than 68000 fans filled the stadium. “Kids wanted pictures … tons of high fives.”

His location in the stands and the reputation of the 12s making for good loud TV made Sarsfield an easy lock for showing up on the ESPN broadcast and again in a Seahawks social media hype video after the win.

Sarsfield called it a “top five” Seahawks experience and one of the loudest games he’s ever attended. His ears were ringing and the next day on Microsoft Teams his voice was shot. But no one recognized him as HawkMan.

“No one at work knows” he laughed. “I haven’t even posted it on my Facebook yet. It’s sort of like my secret identity.”"

Covid vaccine producer Moderna has sued fellow vaccine maker Pfizer for patent infringement. The company pledged in 2020 not to enforce its patents as many companies raced to develop a vaccine. But in 2022 it amended this pledge saying it may start enforcing its patents in higher-income countries. Wall Street Journal reporter Peter Loftus the author of a book on Moderna is not surprised by this move and says it is a signal of a return to business as normal in the biotech industry.

For many of its Hollywood studio partners it was almost a relief. “Look back to the late ’90s early 2000s” MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler says. “History has shown us it is unwise for theater operators to over-leverage their balance sheets. In a mature industry it leaves companies in a precarious position in the event of a shock.” In this case that shock was the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the box office made a notable recovery this summer — although not to pre-pandemic levels — the debt-laden Moshe “Mooky” Greidinger-run Cineworld which operates 747 sites and 9139 screens in 10 countries warned Aug. 17 that it was struggling to get through the summer doldrums for Hollywood tentpoles amid a dearth of new releases. “Cinema operators are distributors with weak profit margins and high fixed costs” says Moody’s analyst Fiona Knox. “Typically businesses with such characteristics are not able to sustain high debt levels.”

Investors seemed to hit the panic button for the broader exhibition sector when Cineworld warned about a likely restructuring sending the stocks of its peers lower as well. “The cinema operators globally with the possible exception of Cinemark are debt-burdened having been acquisitive prior to the pandemic and have undergone constant [capital expenditure] programs to upgrade to meet the demand for the state-of-the-art cinematic experience in terms of screens sound and seating” says Knox. “More challenging is the fact that the operators for the most part lease the cinema sites — possible under master lease agreements — and the lease liabilities are capitalized thereby forming by far the larger part of the debt burden.”

But others see most U.S. publicly traded exhibitors in a better position than Cineworld. “While we acknowledge the relatively weak film slate cited by Cineworld is something that all exhibitors are facing with a major slate gap between mid-August and late October we view Cineworld’s balance sheet concerns as a company-specific issue” B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold wrote in a late August report. Adds a veteran studio executive about the evolving bankruptcy situation and its impact on the theatrical business: “On a scale of one to 10 this is a three.”

Not that AMC Theatres led by Adam Aron doesn’t also have a big debt burden. Cineworld’s net debt stood at $8.9 billion as of the end of 2021 or $4.8 billion excluding lease liabilities. AMC’s debt load amounted to about $5.5 billion as of this summer. However AMC has been able to leverage its unique meme-stock standing with retail investors to avoid a debt crunch. “AMC has an over-levered balance sheet but they got a gift from the heavens with the unexpected and incredibly passionate support of retail meme-investors” Handler says. And in August AMC went “APE” with a special stock dividend of AMC Preferred Equity giving the firm the option to raise more cash in the future. “The APE shares provide an equity lifeline now for the business” the Wall Street analyst notes.

In a bankruptcy filing Cineworld vented its frustration about not having had so much luck despite exploring “other potential opportunities in addition to its primary focus on raising incremental financing” throughout 2021 and 2022. Concluded the company’s leadership in the filing: “While Cineworld would of course have welcomed the liquidity of becoming a ‘meme stock’ like AMC we were never so lucky!”

One challenge in restructuring is that Cineworld “will exit the pandemic with a heavier debt burden and a much higher cost of debt because it raised expensive debt during the pandemic” S&P Global analyst Eugenia Armas wrote in an Aug. 16 report. “It will also have significant deferred lease payments which will continue to stress its cash flows for up to three years after the pandemic ends. Therefore we consider that Cineworld still needs to considerably reduce debt and interest burden or its capital structure will remain unsustainable.”

It is no wonder then that Cineworld has mentioned that it would “pursue a real estate optimization strategy in the U.S.” to renegotiate its lease terms. The company could also give up some cinemas allowing rivals to potentially swoop in. “Given this will give Regal/Cineworld an opportunity to break some leases that may be unprofitable or borderline well ahead of any normal timeframe you could see some closures take place” Wold says. “If those are unprofitable theaters and not attractive enough to operate it is probably unlikely that someone would want to step in and acquire them. However if there are any attractive assets that are unloaded by Cineworld I think all of the other exhibitors will need to take a look.”

On Sept. 13 Regal emailed Hollywood studio distributors to notify them of a dozen theaters that would close at the end of business a day later says a source with access to the email. They include three in the greater Los Angeles and Orange County areas: Anaheim Hills 14 Calabasas Stadium 6 and Westpark 8 in Irvine. The other theaters are in the greater markets of Philadelphia; San Jose; Seattle-Tacoma; Cleveland-Akron; Portland; Fresno-Visalia; Greenville North Carolina; and Amarillo Texas. All are underperforming locations.

Studios are confident that most of Regal’s locations will stay in operation although they aren’t ruling out further closures for sites that aren’t doing big business. And there’s always a chance that another cinema operator could take over some Regal locations.

And filing for Chapter 11 means that it is business as usual for major studios in terms of getting their take of every ticket sold because they are deemed “critical” vendors in bankruptcy parlance. If some studios had to endure delayed payments over the summer that ended the day Cineworld began restructuring sources say.

Of course terms such as “literalism” and certainly “fundamentalism” have their origins in certain debates within American Protestantism but that doesn’t stop people from applying them to Orthodox Judaism. Such usage has always bemused me since a major tenet of rabbinic Judaism is that the Bible is not to be taken literally. Ancient and early medieval rabbis quite consciously saw this as what distinguished them from rival Jewish sects.

That might surprise some readers but one need not know much about Judaism to know that it is true. Two examples will suffice: the Talmud and other contemporary works insist that the lex talionis—“an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth . . .”—refers to monetary compensation. Nobody’s eye should be gouged out; rather like American courts today rabbinic judges were supposed to assess the cost to the plaintiff of the injury through a set of formulas and compel the tortfeasor to pay accordingly.

A second example is the biblical injunction “Thou shalt not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.” Straightforward though it sounds the rabbis take this to prohibit any consumption of meat and milk together (even if they come from different species let alone unrelated animals) to mandate the use of separate dishes for meat and dairy and so forth. This is hardly the sort of reading that liberal Protestant theologians who reject literalism would come up with but it is by no means a literal interpretation. When it comes to more arcane cases of sacrificial ritual the talmudic rabbis are quite explicit that their readings differ from the more literal interpretations of the Sadducees—and record intense strife over these issues.

Why this is so and how the rabbis justified their sometimes radical readings of Scripture are worthy questions but I’d like to focus on the questions that bothered me when I was a college student drawn to Orthodox Judaism and have stuck with me since. What is an intellectually sophisticated believer supposed to think about the Bible’s depiction of the Garden of Eden? Could they be taken as allegory? Are they true in a more concrete sense? And most importantly were there answers to these questions that I found both satisfactory and intellectually honest? And could I really become committed to a religion if it did not have such answers?

I first started making some headway on these questions when my embrace of Orthodoxy led me to spend a year (the first of several) in yeshiva. We were studying the opening chapters of Genesis and someone asked the rabbi if the Garden of Eden was a real place. The rabbi didn’t say “Yes of course” but instead answered the question by showing us a passage from the writings of Rabbi Moses Ḥayyim Luzzatto known in rabbinic circles by the acronym Ramḥal.

Only much later would I learn that Luzzatto was one of the most interesting and controversial figures in 18th-century Jewish thought. He received a robust humanistic education in his native Padua as well as a thorough rabbinic one and authored plays and poetry in Hebrew along with extensive writings on kabbalah. In the wake of the disastrous career of Shabbetai Tsvi the failed messiah whose antinomian mysticism and eventual conversion to Islam shook the foundations of 17th-century Jewry Luzzatto’s kabbalistic speculation fueled suspicion that he was a heretic as well. The Italian Jewish community eventually forced him out of the country and he ultimately settled in the Land of Israel where he died in 1746 or 47.

Since then the controversies concerning Luzzatto faded and his work became part of the canon of thinkers venerated and studied in the world of the yeshiva. At the time I was simply aware of him as the author of The Path of the Just a guide to personal spiritual development today known to every yeshiva student and often read in preparation for the High Holy Days.

The passage the rabbi showed us regarding the Garden came from another book Da’at T’vunot a title usually translated as “The Knowing Heart.” Drawing more deeply on mystical influences it is a dialogue between the soul and the intellect that covers a number of key issues in Jewish thought such as the problem of evil. Here is my translation:

This is the general idea of the two trees the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. Certainly Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning: the trees were trees the fruits were fruits and the eating was eating. But the fruits were ethereal [dakim literally “thin”] and the eating was ethereal [dak] in a way that our thoughts cannot conceive because they can only conceive of corporeal things.

For Luzzatto the trees in the Garden of Eden were real but they were not physical. What’s most surprising about this very non-literal reading is that he justifies it with the rabbinic principle “Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning.” To make sense of Luzzatto’s invocation of this principle we must unpack the operative term namely p’shat or “plain meaning” and try to understand its history. Deriving from the word meaning “simple” or “laid bare” it is traditionally contrasted with d’rash (from the word meaning “to seek”) or exegetical reading—the sort of interpretation that gives us separate pots for meat and dairy and the vast corpus of narrative elaborations on the scriptural text known as midrash.

The golden age of d’rash was the talmudic and post-talmudic era from about 100 to 600 CE during which rabbis used the text as a springboard for their daring interpretations. What is curious is that serious interest in p’shat came later. Between about 900 and 1300 CE rabbis began focusing on basic questions about the meaning of words the parsing of unclear sentences and so forth developing more literal alternatives to what they found in Talmud and midrash. The greatest exemplar of this period was Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac or Rashi (France 1040-1105) who drew heavily on the traditions of d’rash but made a point of presenting the p’shat alongside it when he saw the two as deviating. His successors the Spanish exegete Abraham Ibn Ezra and his own grandson Shmuel ben Meir assailed him for straying too far from the p’shat to which they sought to adhere carefully even when it led them to readings that ran counter to standard rabbinic interpretations. And then there was Moses Maimonides writing in 12th-century Egypt who was deeply troubled by those scriptural passages that when read literally depicted God in anthropomorphic terms—which to him was philosophically unacceptable. He thus devoted many chapters of his Guide of the Perplexed to explaining why such phrases as “the hand of God” must be read as metaphors.

But before this p’shat revolution during rabbinic Judaism’s formative centuries Jewish exegetes did not focus on finding Scripture’s literal meaning. Mordechai Cohen a professor of Bible at Yeshiva University argues in his recent book The Rule of Peshat that this new approach to reading sacred texts was a response to specific intellectual challenges to Judaism:

Although the notion of p’shat solidiﬁed late in the Middle Ages acquiring connotations that it would retain well into the modern era the formative period from the 10th to the 13th centuries produced a number of p’shat models that responded in varied ways to Muslim and Christian interpretation of Scripture. The medieval quest to define the “p’shat of Scripture” was not simply about what the sacred text “really says”; it was rather a medium through which readers in diverse cultural contexts encountered and made sense of Scripture intellectually and religiously.

Against this backdrop Luzzatto seems to pull the text in two contradictory directions. He embraces the supremacy of p’shat and writes that Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning. The trees were trees and the fruit was fruit. But then he pivots and says they were not physical trees. In what way is this not a departure from the plain sense?

Let me answer this question with a story. There were once two rabbis debating who was the greatest scholar in their generation. A simple man overheard the conversation and chimed in with a way to resolve the debate: weigh them both on a scale and whoever weighs more is bigger.

In other words a description like “this rabbi is big” could be talking about physical size or intellectual achievement. In Hebrew then as now the same word means both “great” and “big” so that a rabbi of outstanding erudition would be described as a ḥakham gadol a big sage. In using the word “big” to describe something like character or intelligence we are borrowing the physical concept of “bigness” to communicate an abstract quality. The same word can be used in very different contexts because we sense at some intuitive level a connection between the physical and nonphysical uses of the word.

Luzzatto is saying that the same is true for a word like “tree.” It can refer to a physical tree and a nonphysical tree. Our only way of understanding the nature of a nonphysical tree is to look closely at a physical one and try to understand its essential qualities. Armed with some understanding of what the essence of a tree is and what the essence of eating is we can use those reflections to make sense of what the Torah is trying to tell us.

But why is Luzzatto who seems to be pushing for an allegorical interpretation using the talmudic phrase that became the slogan of the medieval partisans of p’shat? It would be one thing if Luzzatto were saying that in addition to real physical trees the Torah is also talking about spiritual trees. Then we could say the plain meaning of the text refers to physical trees and on another level of interpretation the text is also referring to spiritual trees. But he seems to be saying the Torah is only talking about spiritual trees and that he’s adhering to the p’shat.

Luzzatto is in fact telling us something not just about the Garden of Eden but also about the parameters of the “plain meaning” of the text. Much as you could never hope to make sense of a newspaper article or legal contract or historical document by taking the words out of context so too any word or phrase in Scripture must be read in its own context. Put differently the plain meaning of Genesis 2 and 3 to Luzzatto refers not to literal trees but incorporeal ones.

By insisting that his reading is p’shat Luzzatto is trying to make clear that these trees may be metaphysical but they are not allegorical. An allegorical reading of the Garden of Eden story would see the trees as a tool for communicating a set of ideas and nothing more. Take for example George Orwell’s Animal Farm: if someone reads it and then asks if he can visit the farm today we would rightly say that he missed the point. The farm is simply the setting of an allegory meant to convey a set of ideas about politics. If the Garden of Eden were this kind of allegory asking if it were a real place would make as much sense as asking to visit the farm where Animal Farm happened.

The difference is subtle but important. Luzzatto certainly believes that the story is communicating ideas—he goes on to say that ingesting the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge caused man to internalize a new perspective on reality—but not as allegory. His radical and highly unintuitive reading depends on his peculiar metaphysics which posit the existence of incorporeal trees and fruits that are every bit as real as the corporeal kind. They are not mere symbols even if they are a kind of analogue for phenomena that don’t fit into our everyday experience. Another way to put this is with the talmudic dictum “The Torah speaks in the language of man.” The text according to Luzzatto describes the experiences of Adam and Eve in everyday terms to make them understood.

Luzzatto is thus adhering to the general principles of the talmudic rabbis who firmly rejected the allegorical approach to Scripture of Jews like the Hellenistic philosopher Philo of Alexandria and some early Christian thinkers—an approach that shares much with the allegorical readings of Plato and other ancient texts by pagan philosophers of the era. In all the rich expanse of its midrashic readings the Talmud never tries to reduce the Tanakh to mere abstractions.

Where does this leave us 21st-century Jews trying to make sense of our sacred text? To borrow and slightly adjust Leon Kass’s elegant formulation from The Beginning of Wisdom the first chapters of Genesis are not about what happened so much as they are about what is always happening in the metaphysical spiritual and moral dimensions of human life.

Addressing the problems of the relationship between Genesis and modern knowledge of science and history—as vexing to us now as whatever philosophical questions vexed Maimonides or Luzzatto—Kass one of the most insightful Bible interpreters today writes:

[I]f the major intention of the first chapter is not historical but ontological ethical and theological Genesis is not the sort of book that can be refuted—or affirmed—on the basis of scientific or historical evidence. This is I repeat not because it is myth or poetry but rather because its truths are metaphysical and ethical not scientific or historical because it teaches mainly about the status and human meaning of what is rather than about the mechanism by which things work or came to be.

Kass favors a form of p’shat that is very different from strict literalism. The advantage of reading Scripture this way is that it makes it possible to approach the text with maximum seriousness—each word is true and real—but to avoid getting bogged down in the often futile attempts to read modern scientific knowledge back into the text. To me especially in my youthful searching for my place in Judaism it always seemed easier to unwind the Torah from science than to try to weave them together in the text itself.

Both Luzzatto and Kass like their numerous predecessors wish neither to reduce the Torah’s stories to fairy tales or myths nor to read them as absurdities through obsessive literalism like the village atheist who discovers that Jonah was swallowed by “a big fish” and is excited to point out that a whale is in fact a mammal.

This brings us back to Mordechai Cohen’s observation that what he calls “the medieval quest” to find Scripture’s p’shat wasn’t about what the text “really” said but about how readers “made sense of Scripture intellectually and religiously.” This is as true for us today as it was in the Middle Ages.

Yet this quest can only be fully understood in relation to its motivations and here it’s worth citing Luzzatto’s much better-known work The Path of the Just:

We notice at all periods and at all times between all lovers and friends—between a man and his wife between a father and his son in fine between all those who are bound with a love which is truly strong—that the lover will not say “I have not been commanded further. What I have been told to do explicitly is enough for me.” He will rather attempt by analyzing the commands to arrive at the intention of the commander and to do what he judges will give him pleasure. The same holds true for one who strongly loves his Creator for he too is one of the class of lovers.

Luzzatto’s uses of the word “commanded” in a comparison to a conversation between lovers may jar us. But like Isaiah and Hosea he understands the relationship between God and His people as a romantic one and his point is that lovers are never satisfied with a purely concrete understanding of each other’s words. They always seek the unspoken. Looking at the vast edifice of legal and ethical rabbinic commentary stretching from the Talmud to our own day it is easy to lose the forest for the trees (including the metaphysical ones). We are prone to forget that we are looking for God between the lines of all of our interpretive efforts.

A combination of BNB Beacon Chain (previously Binance Chain) and BNB Smart Chain (previously Binance Smart Chain) BNB Chain is the largest smart contract blockchain in terms of transaction volume and users in Web3. The blockchain currently has more than 1300 active decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple categories like decentralized finance (DeFi) metaverse blockchain games and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in its ecosystem.

Start-ups leveraging BNB Chain’s blockchain infrastructure will be able to build on Google Cloud’s scalable infrastructure. Additionally these BNB Chain projects can tap Google Cloud services for on-demand analysis of on-chain data and the encryption of data during processing.

As part of the collaboration the company will facilitate accelerated access to the Google for Start-ups Cloud Program for eligible Web3 builders which will provide Google Cloud credits each year for up to two years to aid start-ups in establishing and growing their businesses.

James Tromans director of Web3 Google Cloud said: “We look forward to collaborating with BNB Chain to provide Web3 builders with the cleanest cloud infrastructure on which to develop and scale their applications. This builds on our existing work to support our customers’ needs in developing transacting storing value and deploying new products on blockchain-based platforms.”

Gwendolyn Regina investment director at BNB Chain said: “At BNB Chain we have been focusing on identifying and supporting innovative Web3 builders and now by collaborating with Google Cloud we can help these builders access the open secure and carbon neutral cloud infrastructure that’s needed to strengthen and scale their businesses.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2oubXkvMTI1MjE0LzE1MDAteGF2ZXJpYW5zLXRvb2stcGFydC1pbi10aGUtYW5udWFsLXN0LXhhdmllci1ydW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1500 Xaverians took part in the annual St Xavier Run,"Penang chief minister Chow Kon Yeow flagged of the St Xavier ‘s Institution (SXI) Run in Farquhar Street to raise money for the school today.

Some 1500 Xaverians took part in the annual St Xavier ‘s Institution (SXI) Run in Farquhar Street George Town to raise money for the school today.

Besides the charity SXI Run a Canteen Day was also held at the school premises to celebrate the school’s 170th anniversary.

Penang chief minister Chow Kon Yeow flagged off the three categories of the run.

Chow praised the school’s many old boys and girls for stepping forward to help their alma mater to give back to St Xavier’s.

“This is the community spirit we are looking for in our schools and I am happy St Xavier’s is taking the lead in showing the way.

“Besides concern for the poor having an event like the Charity Drive would also teach an inclusive community amongst the students in this school. Such values will stay on with them when they step into the real working world.

“And today they are the Xaverian alumni in the industry from Motorola Solutions Malaysia (500 participants) and Jabil Penang (100 participants) who are back in the school with us this morning. Well done to all of you!

“I hope more industries in Penang will come forward to celebrate with your old schools so that students in schools will know that our much beloved Penang is an advance and vibrant place not only for study but a workplace as well.

Chow said concern for the poor and social justice are among the five core Lasallian principles and the SXI Run clearly defined the principles practised by the Xaverian family.

The tradition he said has been carried out for the past 70 years by SXI. It started in the beginning to help raise funds for the needy such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. It is an annual Charity Drive event to help poor NGOs and assist needy students.

Ow Yang Jin Kuang and Yee Pei Yi won the Men’s Open and Women’s Open respectively. Bernd Echmann took the Men’s Veteran title (37:44.0) and Jeremy Tan emerged as the SXI Charity Run winner.

However regional divergences in how these climate stress tests are implemented limit their usefulness in assessing and comparing individual institutions’ exposures to climate-related risks.

Addressing data gaps on value-chain emissions and climate targets of the institutions’ customers will be critical to maximizing the value of climate stress test results for supervisors and investors.

When institutional investors and financial supervisors seek to understand climate risk exposures of banks and insurers they look to climate scenario analysis. In particular many central banks and supervisors look to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to develop a harmonized system for climate scenario analysis. At least 31 central banks and supervisors have completed are conducting or are planning bottom-up or top-down climate scenario analysis exercises with a minimum of 22 leveraging the baseline NGFS Reference Scenarios.1 NGFS has recently published the third version of these scenarios which encourage comparability of results across borders and are useful for investors and supervisors alike.

The problem however is that these stress tests are inconsistently applied across regions potentially limiting the value of their results. Over time addressing gaps in data on value-chain emissions and climate targets of financial institutions’ customers will be critical to making these analyses more useful.

Different approaches to climate stress testing

One major difference is how supervisors view the balance sheets of financial services companies. Balance-sheet assumptions remain important providing investors with insight into the possible strategic investments and divestments a financial institution may make to adjust its exposure to climate-related risks. The Bank of England (BoE) Bank of Canada (BoC) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) assumed a static balance sheet under which the size composition and risk profile does not vary over the stress testing time horizon. But several other jurisdictions have used a hybrid approach assuming a dynamic balance sheet for certain long-term horizons.

Another difference is the type of climate risk supervisors have assessed in their climate stress tests. The BoC has focused on testing for transition risks2 while the European Central Bank (ECB) BoE Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Resolution (ACPR) HKMA and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) focused on both transition and physical risks (see exhibit below). These differences may hamper investors’ ability to compare the full suite of climate-related risks faced by all institutions.

Key features of climate stress testing programs — a global comparison

“Financial risk types covered"" refers to the types of exposures participants were asked to consider through either quantitative projections or qualitative questionnaires.

NGFS scenarios serve as a common baseline but divergences exist

Another key difference is that some financial supervisors changed the timeframes over which risks are projected to materialize and implemented region-specific low-carbon strategies (see exhibit below). While these adjustments may help provide better assessments to local conditions they also run the risk of complicating an investor’s interpretation of a financial institution’s resilience to plausible climate outcomes.

Differences in assessing climate transition risk globally

This exhibit focuses on select jurisdictional overlays representing key divergences from the NGFS scenarios. Notice the difference between the definition of “short term” between the various supervisors: e.g. the ECB defines short term as three years while the HKMA and ACPR defines it as five years.

Looking ahead

The NGFS has noted that while alignment with its reference scenarios is desirable systemic limitations including linking NGFS scenarios with domestic macroeconomic models make consistency among supervisors difficult.3

While these problems are significant the elephant in the room is the lack of available data for many financial institutions.4 Financial supervisors have noted that data gaps in emissions and climate targets of insurance and bank-loan-associated counterparties have curbed meaningful and comparable results across institutions and markets. Only 34% of constituents of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI) reported some type of climate target data and only 14% reported progress against those targets as of Aug. 31 2022

Regulators also have noted that financial institutions will need to fill data gaps for value-chain emissions (Scope 3) to obtain better estimates of portfolio climate risks and to evaluate counterparties through the low-carbon transition. Though the materiality of Scope 3 emissions will need to be determined disclosure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in the MSCI ACWI IMI is currently limited with only 27% of constitutents currently disclosing one or more of the 15 categories forming Scope 3 (see exhibit below).

However it’s still early days for climate stress tests for financial institutions. Though regional divergences are expected to persist the practice may lead to more climate-related information and empower more informative results for investors as financial regulators increasingly mandate these exercises.

At 2.10 p.m. Sensex was down 1050.03 points or 1.75 per cent at 58883.98 and Nifty was trading 326.56 points or 1.83 per cent lower at 17550.85.

Mahindra & Mahindra Tech Mahindra Ultratech Cement TCS Infosys Wipro were major losers during the afternoon trade on Sensex.

Nifty IT and BSE IT index were down 2.91 per cent and 2.69 per cent respectively. Nifty PSU Bank index was down 2.79 per cent and BSE Auto was down 3.25 per cent.

“Indian equity markets are witnessing some selling pressure after a long period of resilience. Global cues continuously remain weak as there is a sharp surge in the dollar index and US bond yields post US inflation numbers. We may continue to outperform but we can’t remain in isolation for a long time. Global markets are looking nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting because there is talk of a 100 basis rate hike while a 75 basis rate hike was already discounted” said Santosh Meena Head of Research Swastika Investmart Ltd.

Asian markets remained weaker on Friday due to growing fears of a global recession after the warnings by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 per cent. Australian shares were down 0.94 per cent on Friday while Japan’s Nikkei stock index slipped 1.2 per cent.

The world may edge towards the global recession in 2023 as central banks across the world simultaneously hike interest rates to combat persistent inflation the World Bank said.

The economies of the US China and the euro zone were slowing and a slight hit to the global economy further would lead to recession.

“Technically Nifty is facing resistance at the 18100 level and it has slipped below its 20-DMA of 17700 which may lead to some more selling pressure where 17470-17400 is an immediate demand zone then 17150 is a sacrosanct support level. Bank Nifty is outperforming but yesterday it ended at a day’s low after hitting a fresh all-time high which is a little disappointing. On the downside 40900-40700 is an immediate demand zone; below this 40270 is the next important support level” Meena added.

But we still have a long way to go to create the robust domestic manufacturing sector and supply chains that firms will need to qualify for the maximum tax credits in the law.

The ink was barely dry on President Biden’s signature before the deal announcements started coming.

As First Solar announced $1.2 billion for more U.S.-based solar panel production the CEO of the Arizona-based solar manufacturer said because of the IRA ""solar’s going to be investible again"" in the United States. Hanwha Q Cells of South Korea is also scaling up here with more announcements expected from the Chinese solar leaders.

Honda Motor and LG Energy Solution said Aug. 29 they would spend $4.4 billion on an EV battery factory. That matched Tesla and Panasonic’s commitments to put a $4 billion EV battery factory in Oklahoma and another in Kansas.

Importantly it has emerged since the Act was passed that it fixes the Supreme Court’s ruling nullifying the Obama-era Clean Power Plan as a regulatory overreach. Greenhouse gasses are now defined in the Act as an industrial pollutant accomplishing what the Court requested: that Congress make itself clear on its desire for net-zero solutions.

The IRA ushers in a new phase in U.S. energy production laying a runway for renewable energy to take off with clear goals of reaching net-zero in the future. “Defining CO2 and other greenhouse gasses as pollutants instills confidence in the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to support a net-zero future through this energy transition” said Climate Commodities Co-Founder Julian Tung. “It ensures a legal landscape that promotes positive commitment from the energy industry and promotes investment in the green economy”

However the Act also raises the bar on the cleantech industry: to get the maximum tax credits in several sectors not only must manufacturing occur in the U.S. but also an increasing percentage of the raw materials must be sourced here or from a free trade agreement partner nation. Along with their new factories in Ohio and Georgia First Solar and Hanwha and other panel manufacturers are busy looking for qualifying sources of aluminum and zinc.

For the next few years there is unlikely to be enough domestic content available to meet these requirements so special waivers may be issued in the short term for companies increasing their percentage of domestic inputs. The U.S. Geological Survey’s periodic Mineral Industry Survey reports the “net import reliance” for various minerals each year. In 2021 the U.S. produced 55% of the copper it consumed and 52% of the nickel but only 24% of zinc and cobalt and none of the graphite. These numbers are likely to increase over time but it will be a path of gradual accumulation.

In a federal filing to the White House interagency working group (IWG) on mining reform the National Mining Association expressed similar concerns: ""Despite being home to extensive and varied mineral resources the United States is facing grave mineral supply chain challenges. Our import reliance has been a well-documented and increasingly problematic issue for decades and has now become a crisis exacerbated by pandemic-and war-related challenges and the electrification of our economy.""

As Simon Moores chief executive of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence put it “Considering it takes seven years to build a mine and refining plant but only 24 months to build a battery plant the best part of this decade is needed to establish an entirely new industry in the United States.”

Domestic hydrogen production will get a major boost from the new law which creates incentives for production of both blue hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels with carbon capture) and green hydrogen (produced from water using renewable energy). The production tax credit increases in tiers based on the lifecycle carbon emissions per kilogram of hydrogen produced.

Blue hydrogen producers capturing most of their carbon emissions will see benefits from the lower tiers while the credit for green hydrogen producers will increase to as much as $3/kg if they also meet wage requirements.

These wage requirements stipulate that any laborers and mechanics employed in the construction of their projects are paid prevailing wages in the locality of their projects as determined by the Secretary of Labor. Qualified facilities must also ensure no fewer than the “applicable percentage” of total labor hours are performed by qualified apprentices. The applicable percentage is 10% for projects beginning construction before 2023 12.5% before 2023 and 15% for 2024 onwards. Each contractor and subcontractor who employs four or more individuals to perform construction must employ at least one qualified apprentice.

Following the lead of many state-level solar programs the IRA places a much-needed emphasis on community benefit while creating additional financial incentive for solar projects less than 5 megawatts. “The expansion of the solar investment tax credit will spur historic investment into low and moderate income communities as it will financially incentivize developers to construct vital infrastructure in those communities that have been hit hardest by the shift away from fossil fuels” said Adam Woda Community Solar Lead at EDPR NA Distributed Generation.

He also noted that “The added focus on distributed generation will help to facilitate an expedited rollout of renewables onto the grid and transmission system with the full backing of the tax equity market since investors can now monetize a full suite of new incentives geared towards this segment.”

The new law also allows taxpayers receiving credits for clean hydrogen CCS and advanced manufacturing to opt into a direct pay program immediately funding projects without needing to wait for an eventual tax refund. Although direct pay only covers the first 5 years after the project comes online the bill should also help to support growth in the tax equity market by allowing credits to be sold; currently companies without tax liabilities are unable to take advantage of credits.

The U.S. has a long way to go to achieve the emissions targets we have committed to but this bill creates a framework which will hopefully bring us much closer over the next few years while promoting investment in domestic cleantech production.

This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

See our latest analysis for Heartland Financial USA

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Heartland Financial USA

In the last twelve months the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President Bruce Lee bought US$92k worth of shares at a price of US$45.90 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$44.37. Their view may have changed since then but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Bruce Lee.

Insider Ownership

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Heartland Financial USA insiders own about US$188m worth of shares (which is 10.0% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.

So What Do The Heartland Financial USA Insider Transactions Indicate?

It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership these factors suggest Heartland Financial USA insiders are well aligned and quite possibly think the share price is too low. That's what I like to see! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Heartland Financial USA. In terms of investment risks we've identified 1 warning sign with Heartland Financial USA and understanding it should be part of your investment process.

(Nasdaq: IPAX IPAXU IPAXW) (“Inflection Point”) a special purpose acquisition company today announced that they have signed a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Intuitive Machines becoming publicly listed.

Upon the closing of the transaction the combined company will be named Intuitive Machines Inc. and its securities will be listed on Nasdaq.

“As the United States plans its return to the Moon after a 50-year absence Intuitive Machines is excited to play a critical role in providing technologies and services to establish long-term lunar infrastructure and commerce” said Kam Ghaffarian Ph. D. Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Intuitive Machines. “What’s different this time is that the U.S. government has astutely chosen to utilize partnerships with the private sector to accomplish its goals more quickly and more cost-effectively” he said.

“The objective is to create a thriving commercial ecosystem for space for the benefit of civilization” said Dr. Ghaffarian. “This has created a massive secular growth opportunity for space as an industry. We have already seen companies such as SpaceX seize this moment and achieve fantastic results and we are all still in the very early days of this new phase of space exploration with tremendous growth potential ahead.”

Intuitive Machines is developing advanced space technologies including propulsion systems lunar mobility vehicles power plants and human systems. The Company’s technical capabilities support four distinct business units:

Lunar Access Services which will utilize the Company’s proprietary lunar lander to fly scientific commercial and infrastructure equipment and systems to the lunar surface for both government and commercial clients. Lunar Data Services which will leverage its six strategically positioned ground stations across Earth and a planned lunar constellation to facilitate the provision of secure lunar communications navigation and imagery. Orbital Services which will operate missions and develop technologies enabling space logistics including satellite rideshare repositioning refueling and orbital debris removal. Space Products and Infrastructure which will develop and provide propulsion systems navigation systems specialty engineering services lunar mobility power infrastructure (Fission Surface Power) and human systems.

The U.S. government is heavily committed to space – the NASA budget for 2022 is $24 billion and the U.S. Space Force saw a 26% year over year increase in its projected 2023 budget to $24.5 billion. The accessible Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Intuitive Machines is approximately $120 billion over the next decade with approximately $105 billion in lunar services (2021-2030) according to the 2022 Moon Markets Analysis by Northern Sky Research (NSR) and approximately $14 billion in earth orbital services (2022-2031) according to NSR’s IoSM reports in 2021 and 2022.

“We are in a leading position in the development of lunar space to be for the Moon what steamships toll roads and rail companies were to Earth economies” said Steve Altemus Co-Founder President and Chief Executive Officer of Intuitive Machines. “Each successive mission will allow us to extend our advantage as we deliver satellites to lunar orbit deliver systems to the lunar surface and collect critical scientific and engineering data. We expect this will create an incredibly strong competitive position for the Company in just a few years and be a foundation of U.S. space exploration a national asset.”

The Company forecasts annual revenue of $102 million for 2022 rising to $291 million for 2023 underpinned by a material contract backlog of $188 million as of June 2022 the majority of which is with the federal government.

“We are building on a nearly 10-year operating history a solid foundation of contracted business a highly capital efficient model and fiscal discipline hallmarks we intend to continue” said Erik Sallee CFO of Intuitive Machines. “We believe we are positioning ourselves to continue to aggressively grow our already significant book of contracted business by going where the customers are today to deploy our high reliability space systems and expand our product offerings to the commercial market. As we increase our commercial business mix over time and provide more services based offerings we see a clear path to industry leading margins within a three year time horizon. ”

The combined company has secured $55 million of committed capital from entities affiliated with Inflection Point’s sponsor and from a founder of Intuitive Machines in addition to a $50 million equity facility provided by CF Principal Investments LLC an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. which the Company expects will fund the business plan to profitability over the next 2-3 years.

“We are proud to be partnering with Intuitive Machines at a pivotal point in the Company’s history” said Michael Blitzer Co-CEO of Inflection Point. “This transaction will provide the capital to execute on the rapidly growing demand for the Company’s proprietary technologies and services with key government and commercial customers.”

“The history of commercial technological innovation is that great companies dominate their markets and then extend into and lead new ones” said Guy Shanon Co-CEO of Inflection Point. “This is what Intuitive Machines is doing” he explained. “The Company already has a sizable opportunity just from government contracting activity. We believe the upside from what is to come as the Moon becomes more traveled and better understood as a strategic defense asset and a basecamp for exploring the rest of the solar system is a generational opportunity.”

A revolution is happening in the chip design industry. A revolution that allows projects to finish earlier with fewer bugs while budget stays in control.

In this article I’ll share my personal view on a few related bottlenecks that directly affect time to market and the quality of the silicon. I’ll also touch on EDA licenses utilization engineering headcount and discuss the compute solution that is already at your grasp a few clicks away.

But before diving into the cloud world let’s explore a few real-life examples.

What are users saying about boosting chip-design productivity

You don’t have to read them all… feel free to jump to the next paragraph if you “got the idea”…

Arm was able to see “8x to 10x improvement turnaround time when running EDA workloads in the cloud”. Freeing up engineering teams to innovate was a key issue.

Anupama Asthana Director of Grid Solution Engineering at Qualcomm saw similar results. In this video she talked about the performance boost and hybrid flexibility in static timing analysis of up to 27%.

Sanjay Gajendra Chief Business Officer at Astera Labs shared that the company completed their PCIe5 design in less than a year on AWS compared to the years it would have taken using an on-premises HPC environment.

There are other semiconductor companies enjoying the fruits of this revolution. Not all of them are publicly talking about the edge they are gaining from using AWS.

Well not every workload would be ~50% faster as NXP’s circuit simulations but you’ll be able to experiment what works best for you.

How fast “new” becomes “old”

If you’re in R&D compute may be IT’s responsibility. Right? After all you’re “Just” the user.

However a couple of important points that directly affect every day work directly and frames the picture:

On-premises servers (i.e. in-house IT infrastructure) refresh rate is 2-4 years on average . Hardware gets outdated. FAST!

Compute refresh cycles are affected by operation’s yearly budget. But new servers supply time is un-certain even when budget is available. If you need more NOW you may have an issue.

The variety of on-premises compute may not provide the best resource for the job (I’ll explain why shortly).

We all witness the pace of innovation. The process technology keeps shrinking allowing more CPUs on a die more dies packed together. The compute capabilities are getting better and faster every year. Running on last year’s server a three years old server (or even older) cannot compete with the latest generation compute that came out this year. Cutting runtime getting results faster at scale with more cycles a day overnight runs with results ready to be debugged the morning after instead of the next day will all have huge impact on the quality of the silicon and time to market.

But there’s another angle

When your company made the decision which servers to acquire what was the compute variety? Was Intel hardware selected? AMD? ARM? Other? Accelerators? How much memory defined in the purchase order? How many CPUs per machine? Lots of decisions that were made by guesstimating the needs a few months in advance.

The point is – If you limit yourself to a few types of machines/vendors you’re missing the others. What if… a workload runs much faster on different CPU type or architecture that you have access to? Would you be able to measure the difference on premises? How easy would it be to experiment? (Spoiler Alert… it’s VERY EASY to do in the cloud… in minutes…reducing CAPEX and margin of error).

In my previous role I experienced cases where I had business-critical place & route runs. Timing closure was a challenge and the team had to try multiple parallel runs. Each run took around three days. We had to close timing ASAP… or… lose the business. The discussion with IT went like this:

(Based on a true story… names have been changed to protect the innocent)

Me: We need more compute capacity ASAP (I gave a number…). This directly affects time sensitive multi-million dollar business opportunity.

IT: We already used this year’s budget. You can work with management to fund H2’s operation plan budget. We’ll be happy to look into that next year.

Me: But we need it NOW!! The business wouldn’t wait for us!

IT: Sorry no budget left. But even if we had the budget there’s a shortage in supply chain we could have gotten some hardware installed four months from ordering. How about taking a couple of machines from another project and secure it for you now would that do?

Me: I’ll take everything you got. (Beggars can’t be choosy) but it is far…far… from what we really need.

IT: Sorry…

Me (Thinking to myself): “If there was just a simple way to get compute on demand in minutes…mmm”

Every design or verification task has different compute needs

A typical project requires a variety of compute tasks through the design cycle validation front-end backend etc…. Each flow would work best with different compute specific storage I/O access and different amount of memory.

Let’s talk again about the compute pool that your company has. Let’s assume for the sake of the discussion that it is compute farm is new and park the scenario of running on old/slow compute that hasn’t reached refresh cycle.

Now let’s analyze some chip design flows:

Verification

For verification you may want fewer CPUs running as fast as possible. Regressions start slim as you’re building up the environment (less compute is required – so on-premises paid for machines are staying idle) and as the project progresses you need more and more compute (beyond what you actually have onsite). What do you do today? Has your company acquired compute for the maximum peak? Average peak? What happens if you need more compute resources? Imagine needing 20 additional high memory servers for timing analysis and having them available in seconds funded by the money you saved by potentially shutting down idle compute nodes.

We talked about new HW vs old one. Another aspect is HW that is challenging to own for short durations. Think about special accelerators or special servers with CPU overclocking that you can’t just buy in the open market. For verification if the CPU is overclocked to run 30% faster you’ll get the results faster.

Formal is another verification topic – proving multiple properties. Every property could be run with multiple engines in parallel and therefore you can uncover more bugs upfront…

If you use more compute you finish your project design and verification faster. And by more there are already examples of tens of thousands of jobs running in parallel for a short period of time and getting JasperGold results faster (tens or thousands of times faster…).

Backend / Analog

For place & route you will want to use multicores with high memory per core machines and high throughput to storage.

EDA vendors now have AI features. Multiple automatic Place & Route runs would be invoked in order to get best PPA (Power/Performance/Area) but those runs require a lot of parallel high-end servers. What’s the impact of taking these servers from your project’s server pool? Would you need to sacrifice other runs for that?

Remember that these are not the same servers you will use for verification. You’ll want the runs to finish ASAP when those runs are on the critical path of the project. What about equivalence checking? Characterization? Analog runs? Different machines here again…

You get the idea…

Changing the way we think about hardware

We are traditionally taught to forecast the compute we need in advance plan for the average plus and cope with shortage. We’re taught that we only have the servers pool on our compute farm (oh… and BTW you can’t take the stronger ones now because a peer project is more urgent and those are allocated to them…).

The cloud revolution turns the cards and changes the game entirely. You have virtually no compute limitations. Take as many as you need. Take new hardware. Take faster/stronger machines when you need those or more mainstream ones when you’re not on the critical path of the project. Experiment what works for you best. Optimize for cost or performance – the options are nearly limitless.

Some semiconductor companies are operating ONLY in the cloud. Others that already invested in on-premises compute are going hybrid – leveraging the cloud for peak usage or for special compute that’s inefficient to own throughout the entire year.

The trend is clear. The benefits are clear. There’s no reason to stay behind when it’s so simple to get actual compute needs fulfilled.

Hmm… so is cloud more expensive than on-premises?

With all the benefits discussed you would ask yourself – is cloud more expensive?

But the real answer is “it depends”. It’s all in your control.

You can probably pay less or be on par if you match the same workloads and reduce the time of idle licenses. Some customers started the journey to the cloud because of cost reduction. But… you also have the option to choose… do you want better compute for a specific workload today? Are you willing to pay a bit more for runs to end in a week rather than two months? You decide the cost/performance tradeoffs for the current stage.

Apples to apples

The correct way to look at cost is on the project level.

The real cost for taping out a chip is heavily leaned on cost of engineering (people) and licenses then cost of compute (including rent space taxes per meter electricity on-going maintenance: backup/restore/sw updates… etc).

A wrong way to run a calculation would be to compare the price of on-premises server for the refresh cycle period then you compare it to same period of on-demand pricing. This is far from the real cost.

Moving to the cloud you are neutralizing: rent electricity physical security maintenance of the HW… All these are being taken care of for you. You’re also not paying for compute when you don’t use it you pay by the second only when you running simulations (on demand model).

Chip designers can experiment with multiple compute types in minutes the right compute for the job without having to order physical HW. Without waiting months for installing just to find out it’s not what you need. The innovation speed increases dramatically.

The above chart is a graphical representation of predicted (guessed…) on-premises capacity vs actual use. The blue line represents refresh cycle investments over time. As project starts compute may be underutilized and you paid for compute you do not need but as project progresses you might not be able to handle peaks. That can be business critical as discussed earlier.

“Hidden” project costs

We discussed few ways to pull in schedule. Using high end compute at scale.

If you’re the first to market it can make a vast difference. (or the other way around… if you’re second or third – you may be losing the market).

By pulling in two months of your project taking into account a chip-design team that consists of 50 engineers (with SW it is probably more…). You are looking at an immediate cost saving of ~$1M (based on average chip design salary – Glassdoor 2022 report).

You may also be able to save project cost by pulling in schedule (engineering headcount cost) and licenses when those could be released for your next project earlier.

While some companies specifically discussed the schedule pull in others claim they will not cut the project time even when it is technically possible. For those companies the benefit of getting things done better and faster is quality: a cleaner tape-out database.

According to Semiengineering / IBIS – taping-out in 16nm costs $106M 7nm costs $297M 5nm $542M. Actual cost may be different for your chip. Whatever the number is it is not negligible.

Major bugs might require another tape-out…

This has huge cost implications. The team will not work on the future generation as debugging takes an enormous toll and then FAB costs waiting again for FAB production packaging … forget the engineering and manufacturing cost but you could lose the market.

Let’s say it all gladly went well well… you should still want to analyze wafers to improve yield. Improving yield is money on the table. AWS offers methods to analyze huge datasets with AI to get the insights for yield improvement.

How about security and licenses?

Take a look at the banking industry defense industry automotive industry chip design industry…

The list goes on… (look for the public use cases at the bottom of the linked pages). If those industries don’t have security issues working with the cloud why would you think you do?

Security is a solved problem for EDA and other industries. Cloud alliance was formed so FABs and EDA companies could collaborate and allow smooth cloud based tapeouts. When you provision the compute environment with AWS you have full control over the data over the location of the data is stored the encryption and who has access to it.

EDA Licenses are no different for on-premises or cloud. It doesn’t really matter where your license server is located. We do see EDA companies offering special cloud licensing models as Synopsys (FlexEDA) and Cadence (Cloud Passport) but that’s an article for a different time.

ARM NXP Qualcomm Annapurna and many others already enjoy the increased productivity.

Summary

Starting with cloud compute doesn’t mean you have to throw away what you already have. Engineering doesn’t have to feel a change in their working environment. Hybrid models allow using local resources and expand to the cloud when you need it.

This is a paradigm shift. You can start as small or as big as you wish. Staying behind shouldn’t be an option – If you want to get projects out faster and cleaner potentially at a lower cost drop us a note below in the comments section. Our team will be happy to assist.",,,,,,

Back then in the early aughts you could scroll through a list of films and order them straight to your door. Shipping took around three days and all you had to do was mail the discs back in their paper packaging when your rental period was over. Who knew! I can still remember my parents' joy when they discovered Netflix as an alternative to Blockbuster. (“Three-day shipping?! How quick and convenient!”) What a simple time.

Fast-forward 15 years or so and things are much different. When Netflix expanded its platform into a streaming service it promised even more convenience. Honestly? It delivered. Nowadays there are thousands of options to choose from including an impressive collection of Netflix originals. But with so many options at our disposal picking a movie nowadays has become a bit taxing.

""Get Smart with Money"" is a new money-focused documentary on Netflix.

It shares four money transformations over a year with the help of different financial coaches.

It showcases how money can affect our lives and how we feel — spoilers ahead.

Netflix recently debuted a new documentary about personal finance aptly titled ""Get Smart With Money"" directed by Stephanie Soechtig. Over the course of 90 minutes we follow four stories about people struggling with different money issues — debt living paycheck-to-paycheck lack of income and not knowing how to invest and rising expenses while trying to pursue early retirement (FIRE).

The four main characters are paired with a financial coach — Paula Pant from Afford Anything Ro$$ Mac Tiffany ""The Budgetnista"" Aliche and Pete Adeney who is often referred to by his moniker Mr. Money Mustache.

Aside from being a good watch ""Get Smart with Money"" shares six smart lessons anyone can use to improve their finances.

1. A high income doesn't mean much if you don't know how to save and invest

Everyone dreams of earning a ton of money. That was the case for Teez who says he knew that one way he could earn a lot was through football. Reaching success at the early age of 21 the film states he originally earned $1.6 million. That number quickly went down after paying taxes buying a home for his family and one for his mom and taking various trips.

When Teez meets with coach Ro$$ Mac he has approximately $280000 left of his original sum. Teez doesn't have money invested for the future and is worried about the longevity and stability of his career and providing for his family.

Watching this story it's clear that high earnings are not the only goal and route to financial success. Keeping those funds and putting them to work for your future is key. Ro$$ Mac teaches Teez about opening a brokerage account and investing in the stock market.

2. Your circumstances can change at any time

When you make good money it's easy to think it'll always be that way. But through Teez's story we hear about how he made good money through football but then got released and then injured. Suddenly he had nothing coming in.

Hence the sense of urgency with making the remaining $280000 last as long as possible. No one likes to think about the next job loss or health scare that can drastically impact one's finances. But it's something we should all be prepared for just in case.

Not having money coming in is a scary reality for everyone with different degrees of difficulty. An emergency fund and disability insurance can help shore up your personal finances and ensure you're able to weather this kind of storm.

But just as your circumstances can change for the worse they can eventually change for the better. We see Teez eventually get to play football again and earn an income.

3. Paying off debt can change your future

Debt is a monthly payment that can keep you in the past. But paying off debt can change your future too. In the documentary we meet Ariana who identifies as an emotional spender and admits to being afraid of money.

She recalls growing up and having parents who taught her ""we deserve this"" whenever they spent money. That mentality led to spending more than she could sustain.

Ariana is in credit card debt and has over six figures in student loan debt. We see the shame and guilt erupt on her face as she tries to cope with paying off debt while raising two children. She mentions how her husband covers the bills and works overtime so half of her income — $2000 — can go toward monthly debt payments.

At one point Ariana describes taking out a personal loan to pay off credit cards. But once those limits were freed up she got back into the debt cycle.

Tiffany Aliche AKA The Budgetnista works with Ariana to come up with a plan to divide her check and budget for all her obligations through automation.

On top of that The Budgetnista shares a rubric of questions to help rein in Ariana's spending:

Do I need it?

Do I love it?

Do I like it?

Do I want it?

Ideally we want to focus on ""needs"" and ""loves."" Throughout the documentary we see how much Ariana wants to change her financial situation not for herself but for her family. Not working all the time limiting stress and going on vacation — one of the dreams she shared with Tiffany when thinking about what she'd love to do with her money. It's clear that paying off debt can change her future.

4. Starting a small business can help lower-wage workers

We meet Lindsey who is living paycheck-to-paycheck despite working 50 hours a week with two jobs. As a bartender/waitress her wages simply don't cut it. Her food spending on takeout is also high because she's tired from working so much and being in the food industry.

One poignant part of her story is not having the necessary health insurance coverage to treat her depression and anxiety.

When she meets with coach Paula Pant she shares that she wants to break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and pursue her dreams as an artist. Paula encourages her to get some gigs together ASAP through dog-walking and pursue her art in the long term.

One brilliant idea that would allow Lindsey to do both was for Lindsey to sit in a park and sketch a dog and give the portrait to the owner with her contact info on the back for dog-walking.

As her journey progresses we see her earn more money through her art and dog-walking. She even starts selling prints of her paintings — something that Paula refers to as ""scalable"" as the painting was created once but Lindsey can sell the prints over and over again.

For low-wage workers self-employment is one way to break through the ceiling. We see that in Lindsey's story and it's something I resonated with as well. I left my nonprofit job earning $31000 per year in 2014 to be a freelance writer. In the next year I doubled my income and was able to pay off my student loan debt thanks to having a higher income which has grown since.

5. Earning more can mean spending more

""Get Smart with Money"" follows John and Kim a married couple with two children. After becoming unemployed during the pandemic John transitioned to being a stay-at-home parent — and both John and Kim are adjusting to their new roles and financial reality.

While John takes care of the children and household duties a refreshing perspective rarely caught on screen we see Kim earning good money through her business. She earned $70000 just a few years ago and was on target to hit $300000.

These are classic high-income earners by many standards but as we see in the documentary the couple admits to earning more and then spending more. There's a hefty food budget and lots of Amazon purchases and the couple admits to using spending as a reward or to manage stress.

Lifestyle inflation can be natural but unchecked and too much can cause misalignment. Mr. Money Mustaches tells the couple that we all have a ""Purchase Justification Machine"" where our brains will do the mental gymnastics to justify whatever purchase our heart desires.

The couple set their sights on early retirement and with the help of Mr. Money Mustache cut $3000 per month in expenses.

6. Pursuing FIRE can mean making moves literally

John and Kim took the first step by cutting their expenses by a significant amount. But they realized that with their lifestyle and desire to pursue FIRE they needed to make more moves. As in actually moving.

We see the couple downsize their home to lower housing costs and turbocharge their investments.

Moving is expensive and not something everyone can do. But if it's possible downsizing homes or moving to an affordable location can significantly lower costs. For this couple that was the right step in order to get closer to FIRE and in turn have more flexibility with life and work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hcnlzdWUuY29tL25ldGZsaXhzLWJlZS1hbmQtcHVwcHljYXQtcmVib290LWlzLXBlcmZlY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's 'Bee and Puppycat' Reboot Is Perfect,"Originally I’d intended to finish this article a lot closer to Bee and Puppycat’s Netflix release date (September 6). However that proved to be an overly ambitious goal as well as a naive one: the magic that pulled us into this beloved series in the first place got a hold on me and instead of bingeing it all in one go I found myself entranced in its dreamlike state. To me bingeing a show like this would have been akin to chugging a gallon of cake and pudding: delicious and sleep-inducing but too quick to really enjoy what I was doing.

Recommended Videos

Indeed I’ve found the Netflix reboot of Bee and Puppycat to be something of a miracle. It’s a reboot that somehow hasn’t taken anything away from its source material instead adding on it like putting more stars in its already starry galaxy. The dreamlike quality is still there the trippyness is still delightfully odd and unique to its own tone and there is still a subtle feeling of warmth and coziness to the whole thing that once you realize it’s there has completely enveloped you.

Of course a lot of my positivity stems from the fact that I never expected this show to see the light of day after its on-again off-again relationship with the internet. There have been so many good projects that just never go anywhere and Bee and Puppycat was such a one-off experience for so many of us I had to swallow my hopes for it ever being more than a brief webseries.

To go back to the cake analogy this reboot really does feel like I’ve been surprised with cake AND am being allowed to eat it. The art-style is still pretty faithful to the original series but more fine-tuned and the characters have similarly been given more distinctive personalities and ideals (whereas before they were still endearing but fairly undeveloped). The eponymous Bee and Puppycat are still more or less the same—a clumsy but well-intentioned early-twentysomething and a stinky poo-boy respectively—while previously established characters like Cas Deckard and Cardamon are given more unique personalities.

Cas for instance (voiced by my girlcrush Ashly Burch) has shed her generic Big Sister persona for a more defined (and lovingly hilarious) Antisocial Coder Chick attitude while Deckard (voiced by the prolific Kent Osbourne) has similarly started showing some ‘tude instead of just taking everything on the chin. And oh lord Cardamon. Sweet Cardamon. He quickly skyrocketed to one of my favorite characters because he finally gets a chance to question why he a little boy has to manage a property instead of play video games and be as silly and frivolous as his peers.

But the new characters only serve to fill the world of Bee and Puppycat even more richly than it already was. All the Wizard Brothers (with the exception of Tim who to be fair seemed to fill the role of the Boring Everyman Brother) absolutely delighted me and I was so pleased that they took up so much screentime. In particular every scene featuring the vain and neurotic Howell (voiced by Kumail Nanjani who of course did a FANTASTIC job!) absolutely cracked me up and every scene with the stoic fisherman Wesley (voiced by Arin Hanson—a delightful surprise) put an easy smile on my face.

As for the other brothers I was really tickled by how quickly we skimmed over the fact that the nerdiest one Merlin was the one who knocked up the freeloader fighter Toast (voiced by the original Sailor Moon actress Terri Hawkes). And of course Bee’s secondary love interest Crispin (voiced by Tom Sandoval who is apparently a reality TV star?? Love that?) was incredibly charming in his persnickety attitude and his attempts to get closer to the romantically clueless Bee.

Honestly I’d love to go over every single character but we’d be here all day. I do recommend going to the Wikipedia page and seeing the voice cast because it’s wildly impressive and varied from the likes of Robbie Daymond (i.e. Goro Akechi from Persona and Hubert from Fire Emblem) as Cooking Prince to Natalie Wynn (a.k.a. Contrapoints <3) as the Head Warlock and even L.A. music wunderkind FrankJavCee as one of the Wiggly Worms (whose voices and hatred of their own “weird hands” made me die laughing).

What made me weepy the most however was the fact that they kept the old soundtrack and then built upon its original motifs. Maybe this doesn’t mean too much to some viewers but I’ve found that a really good and recognizable soundtrack leaves a particular impression on viewers that never goes away. I used to listen to the soundtrack All. The. Time. back in high school to the point where it’s pretty much been burned into my memory. To hear those original notes play through the episodes over and over just like the simple days of my youth really tugged on my heartstrings in a profound way.

This song in particular uploaded by user Paladinlapdanse (excellent username by the way):

Now I should probably also address the fact that some fans aren’t happy with the series. They believe that it’s too different from the original and that it’s lost its charm for various reasons. Some don’t like that Bee isn’t as chubby as she used to be. Others miss the “random chaos” of the pilot (re: “You took too long now your candy’s gone—that’s what happens! Kablow!“). And after such a long wait I think it’s perfectly understandable why some people are disappointed and I’m sorry for them that the reboot didn’t live up to their expectations.

But as with all things your mileage may vary and as a writer for this website you are currently reading I can say with 100% confidence that I think this reboot is absolutely perfect. If nothing else it taps into the Elder Gen Z/Millennial mindset in a way that’s incredibly nurturing and reassuring hence why it feels like a warm hug. Everyone in the show is just doing their best and encouraging each other along and everyone is wild and weird in their own idiosyncratic ways. Randomly the characters will drop profound one-liners that leave me slack-jawed even as the scene immediately progresses into Sillyville.

It really is the sort of show that I think everyone in my demographic should at least try. To quote my friend who watched it with no prior knowledge of the webseries “Stuff happens but I never feel overwhelmed.” Sounds peachy right?

SCORE Paramount Plus Buy at Paramount Plus Pros Wide catalog of familiar shows and movies

Strong stable of kids' content from Nickelodeon

Live NFL football games

Will stream some major movies soon after theater release Cons Outside of Star Trek Evil and 1883 not many must-see originals

Must have premium to get local CBS stations

NFL games for this season and CBS show premieres may have you thinking about a Paramount Plus subscription. The platform houses films popular cartoons TV series like NCIS and live sports making it feel like a mashup of streaming services past and present. And now that Showtime shows and movies are part of the app you can even upgrade your experience for a few extra dollars.

Like Netflix Paramount Plus has an extensive library of familiar binge-worthy series and reality shows but with a small bucket of originals. Like Hulu you can choose from ad-supported or more expensive ad-free plans. Like Peacock there's a live TV component. Like Disney Plus you'll find a lot of content for kids in this case from Nickelodeon. And like HBO Max you'll get major movie releases that appear shortly after their theatrical premiere. All of this should add up to an exciting service with a lot to offer -- especially for the low $5 entry price -- but ends up feeling like parts of all the ones you already have.

By the numbers Paramount Plus has a ton of content -- 30000 episodes of TV and 2500 movies plus more than three dozen original series. Yellowstone spinoff 1883 is already a major hit and it's backed up by audience favorites SEAL Team and Evil. Upcoming shows include Yellowstone spinoff 1932 a new Star Trek series and another show based on Halo.

Parents can assure their kids that more SpongeBob Blue's Clues Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Monster High content is on the horizon and new movies like Mission: Impossible 7 will be arriving 45 days after theaters. This September Paramount Plus merged Showtime content into the app giving you access to more than 600 titles if you sign up for a bundled plan.

Even with all those additions much of Paramount Plus' value lies in nostalgia. You can watch just about every old Nickelodeon show including All That Comedy Central standup specials and popular series ranging from Frasier and Cheers to SpongeBob SquarePants and Young Sheldon. And of course you get existing originals like Star Trek Discovery and The Good Fight as well as the live feed of your local CBS station if you spring for the $10-per-month ad-free option.

On the other hand many shows you might expect including the Paramount Network hit Yellowstone (it's on Peacock) CBS staples The Big Bang Theory (HBO Max) and Two and a Half Men (Peacock again) are not available on Paramount Plus. It's the case with South Park too but the streaming service will soon bring it back to its home base. Blame licensing.

If you're already a fan of any of the CBS or Viacom shows that are available -- or you're just looking to change up your streaming options -- the Paramount Plus $5-a-month plan is not a bad option. But if you're looking to cut back on your streaming services it isn't a must-have on the same level as Hulu for example which costs nearly the same and has much more variety and original programming.

How much is Paramount Plus?

Paramount Plus offers live news and sports as well as on-demand shows and movies including originals leaning on parent company Paramount Global brands like CBS MTV BET VH1 Nickelodeon and Paramount Network plus the Paramount Pictures movie studio. There are also more than one dozen live channels that stream curated content 24/7 and Showtime titles.

Paramount Plus costs $10 a month for the ad-free Premium subscription or $5 a month for the ad-based Essential plan which does not have access to your local CBS stations. For that you'll need to subscribe to the $10-a-month plan. The service is available in the US Canada and 18 Latin American countries.

Showtime content is now available directly in the app but you must pay for the Paramount Plus Showtime bundle to watch it. Right now the bundle is available at a discount but typically costs $12 monthly for the Essential plan and $15 a month for Premium.

You'll find a mixture of shows and movies on Paramount Plus along with live sports and news from CBS affiliate stations. Sarah Tew/CNET

What you can stream on Paramount Plus

Anecdotally most people I know seem to have signed up for the service for two reasons: Star Trek or The Good Fight. With the addition of Yellowstone prequel 1883 Evil and the iCarly reboot they're among the most popular originals exclusive to Paramount Plus.

At launch there were 20 exclusive originals -- far more than the nine titles available at Apple TV's start. Most are from familiar properties that first appeared on CBS All Access including Jordan Peele's reboot of The Twilight Zone and The Stand. The full Star Trek catalog including every show in the various series and originals like Discovery Picard and Lower Decks will likely remain a major draw for the platform. With the integration of Showtime content into the app viewers who pay for the Paramount Plus Showtime bundle can access even more TV shows. If you skip the bundle you'll notice Showtime titles are marked with a padlock within the app.

The Real World: Homecoming debuted at launch based on the seminal MTV reality show and starring the original seven cast members. The Hills Love & Hip-Hop Behind the Music and MTV Unplugged have also landed on the streamer. But Paramount Plus promises new reality series including All Star Shore The Challenge: War of the Worlds and international versions of The Shore.

One of the biggest draws might be for kids. Nickelodeon's library of nearly 7000 episodes of kids and family shows includes SpongeBob's CG-animated spinoff Kamp Koral Avatar: The Last Airbender Paw Patrol and iCarly. Its 24-hour live channels have five selections that are kiddie-themed and feature content for preschoolers up to teens. Millennials will also find seasons of '90s shows like All That Kenan & Kel and Are You Afraid of the Dark? It's not Disney Plus but it's a pretty impressive collection if you're into anything Nickelodeon past or present.

You'll find Star Trek: Picard among the selections in the Trek franchise on Paramount Plus. Paramount Plus

Paramount Plus also integrated CBS Sports HQ streaming more than 1000 live sporting events per year including the NFL on CBS The Masters and the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. AFC fans should know that you need a Premium subscription to watch NFL games on Sundays through your local CBS affiliate. Check here to see if your region is covered for live broadcasts.

Due to the Comedy Central connection you'll find a large selection of standup specials. Easily navigate to this content by clicking the ""Brands"" menu where you'll also see designated tiles for BET CBS Smithsonian Nickelodeon and MTV programming.

In terms of other movies the Paramount Plus collection is… varied. You have classics like the Beverly Hills Cop franchise and the Mission Impossibles but also a whole lot of titles I'd forgotten that were in theaters in the '90s and early aughts (hello The Addams Family and Superstar). I did enjoy the trip down memory lane that scrolling through the available movies gave me but I wouldn't say it's a must-have selection. Also it's important to note that movies like The Godfather are now available through Showtime but you need to have the Paramount Plus Showtime bundle to receive access to more titles.

Coming soon: More originals theatrical releases revivals and spinoffs

If you aren't a fan of any of those shows or movies (or sports) Paramount Plus may bring you in with some of its upcoming originals including more Beavis and Butt-Head a revival of '90s sitcom Frasier and a long-awaited new animated Avatar: The Last Airbender movie. The service will also launch a new NCIS series original films for SEAL Team and Teen Wolf and another spinoff of popular Paramount series Yellowstone. (Note NBC's streaming service Peacock has the rights to the first three seasons of the show).

Another bonus: Some major Paramount movies will arrive on the streaming service about a month and a half after they premiere in theaters. Mission: Impossible 7 will arrive on Paramount Plus to stream 45 days after it first hits theaters and other titles include A Quiet Place Part III and Top Gun: Maverick.

Top Gun: Maverick will be available to stream on the app. Paramount

What's it like to use Paramount Plus?

I tested the app across an Apple TV Roku and Amazon Fire TV Stick along with an iPhone and Android phone and found the experience to be largely the same across all platforms in terms of layout and content.

Paramount Plus looks very similar to other streaming services: At the top you'll see a few featured titles and like on Disney Plus and HBO Max tiles for each brand of content where every network is listed: CBS BET Comedy Central MTV Nickelodeon and Smithsonian Channel.

Next is continue watching trending shows shows recommended for you and recently added shows. What's a bit different is the On Now row where you can see what's currently playing on your local CBS networks. For me that includes my local CBS affiliate station CBSN (CBS's 24-hour streaming news channel) CBS Sports HQ (CBS's 24-hour streaming sports channel) and ET Live.

Below that you'll find other rows such as Sci-Fi TV Sports Horror Franchises Comedy Shows Nick Jr. Dramas News and Daytime.

If you scroll to the navigation sidebar you'll see Search and Home along with the ability to search through movies TV shows live TV Showtime news and all of the different brands. If you navigate this way you'll find some nested menus that can be a little tricky depending on what streaming device you're using (for example when you use the sidebar to check movies another nested menu lets you choose popular action comedy etc. and then toggle over again to the actual choices). But overall using the platform is straightforward and simple. Paramount Plus is available to stream at ParamountPlus.com and on most mobile devices gaming consoles and media players.

Paramount Plus finally added a watchlist feature. Sarah Tew/CNET

Let's talk 4K downloads and parental controls

Paramount Plus supports 4K and HDR for some content if you're a Premium subscriber which costs more. Select Roku devices support the 4K format but Paramount Plus does not offer it for Roku version 10.5.

You can download up to 25 shows to your mobile device -- if you have a Premium account -- and stream on three devices at once. You can create up to six separate profiles per account including profiles with Kids Mode turned on and decide if you want content for younger kids (rated TV-Y) or older kids (up to TV-PG). Be sure to activate the parental controls to filter content for younger viewers. Adding a PIN will allow you to lock content based on its maturity rating but you'll be required to enter that PIN to switch out of the kids' profile or to access restricted streams including live channels.

Basically this is a functional service but there aren't a ton of bells and whistles. For example at launch there was no watchlist to let you bookmark shows and movies to watch later. However the service did finally add a My List feature.

Should you try Paramount Plus?

If you're a fan of Star Trek reality shows CBS mainstays or Paramount Plus originals having a subscription is a no-brainer -- you'll get the same content plus a whole lot more. The addition of Showtime content in the app may be worth paying the bundle price if you're a fan of the network's content.

If you haven't subscribed and already have Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime Video or Disney Plus know that this probably won't replace any of those for you. But if you are looking for some new shows or want to revisit old favorites the $5-a-month ad-supported tier is toward the lower end of streaming service prices. It's also a content playground if you have children. And once more originals and major movie releases arrive it could be worth your while.

In the meantime if you're curious and sign up as a new member you can try out Paramount Plus with a one-week free trial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoYXRzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXguY29tL3doYXRzLW5ldy9uZXctbW92aWVzLWFuZC1zZXJpZXMtb24tbmV0ZmxpeC1zZXB0ZW1iZXItMTZ0aC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Movies and Series on Netflix: September 16th 2022,"Welcome to your roundup of what’s new on Netflix for September 16th where 14 new movies and 6 new series have just arrived for the weekend.

Dr Iddrisu Yahaha said scientists have been developing improved seed varieties climate resilient and high-yielding varieties as well as other technologies in the sector but that farmers were reluctant in accepting and using those varieties.

an Agricultural Economist at the Wa office of the CSIR-SARI said this during a field demonstration exercise in Wa to introduce some field trials of crops to farmers as well as students.

The trial which included soybean omission trial involving lime inoculants and phosphorus and sorghum inter-cropping among others had funding support from the Soybeans Innovation Lab a USAID supported project.

Dr Yahaya explained that the crop trials were to help improve the soybeans’ yield to international standards as well as to devise cost-efficient ways of pest control to help mitigate the challenges farmers were facing regarding pest control and crop yield.

“Our problem with agriculture in the Upper West Region is the inability of farmers to adopt improved technology” Dr. Yahaha who is also the Head of Department (HoD) at the SARI office in Wa observed.

The Agricultural Economist indicated that though it would be expensive for a peasant farmer to adopt all the technologies developed adopting at least one technology could still help improve the farmer’s productivity.

He stressed the need for effective media collaboration with SARI to inform the farmers about the available agricultural technologies and to educate them on appropriate farming techniques to help increase their productivity to reduce poverty.

Dr Peter Quandahor an Entomologist with the CSIR-SARI office in Wa noted that “Climate change had become a major problem globally and unfortunately the area affected most was agriculture.

“The effects of climate change on agriculture could result in lower crop yields and nutritional quality due to drought as well as increases in pests” he added.

He explained that drought was one of the major challenges facing crop production with about 40 per cent of the world’s agricultural land found in arid or semi-arid regions.

Dr Quandahor added that studies showed that an increase in drought severity resulted in increasing populations of insect pests and altered the impact of insect pests on plants.

He therefore said scientists were developing crop varieties that could withstand the negative impact of climate change and implored farmers to adopt those improved crop varieties for their benefit.

“It is difficult for farmers to adapt to innovation. They are always used to the conventional approach to crop production” he said.

Some of the farmers who participated in the demonstration exercise were satisfied with the trials that were ongoing and said the success of those trials would help reduce the challenges farmers were going through especially in the area of pest control.

They said farming was all about effective pest control and application of inputs and expressed hope that if there were interventions that could reduce their cost in that it would be a gain to the farmers.

Mr Karim Alhassan a participant told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in an interview that “If it (the trial) works it will be very good for the farmers because it will reduce our cost of buying inputs.”

“Controlling pests on the farm is also very expensive so if a method like this (inter-cropping) can help to repel some of the pests then it will reduce our cost of buying pesticide which the cost is rising every day” he added.

The soybeans trial was also done in the Northern and Upper East Regions as well as other West African countries including Cameroon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The North Face sent out data breach notification letters and initiated password resets for impacted accounts according to Bleeping Computer.

Credential stuffing attacks involve using login information from previous data breaches to compromise account whose owners reuse the same login credentials across multiple websites

Owned by VF Corporation The North Face sister brands include Altra Dickies Eastpak Ice Breaker Kipling Napapijri Supreme Timberland and Vans. In 2019 the company made $2 billion of the industry’s $4 billion making it one of the market leaders in the outdoor apparel segment.

The North Face credential stuffing attack exposed personal and purchase information

The North Face apparel company stopped the attack on August 19 after detecting unusual activity on August 11 although the attack had begun on July 26 2022.

The North Face determined that the attackers had accessed customer account information of nearly 200000 users. Details leaked in the credential stuffing attack include user’s full name telephone number gender account creation date purchase history billing and shipping addresses and loyalty points.

However the attackers did not access credit card numbers expiration dates and CVVs since the company does not store that information.

“We do not keep a copy of payment card details on thenorthface.com. We only retain a “token” linked to your payment card and only our third-party payment card processor keeps payment card details” the data breach notification stated.

Additionally The North Face explained that the stored payment card tokens could not be used to make purchases on any other website except at thenorthface.com.

Subsequently the company took additional measures by deleting the existing payment tokens to prevent abuse. Thus customers must re-authorize their credit cards to make purchases on the website.

Paul Bischoff privacy advocate at Comparitech warned that the attackers will not stop at The North Face “If you have a North Face account and it has a password that’s the same as other account passwords you should change all of them immediately.”

Users should reset the password of any account that shared login credentials with compromised accounts at thenorthface.com. Additionally they should remain vigilant for phishing attacks attempting to steal personal information by impersonating The North Face staff using leaked information.

Users should also avoid sending account payment and personal information to individuals requesting such details via email text messages or social media. Legitimate companies have defined processes of collecting that information on their websites and hardly rely on email text or social media.

According to Uriel Maimon Head of Emerging Products at Human Security the North Face credential stuffing attack would have a cascading effect on other accounts.

“We should expect that the credentials stolen from The North Face will soon be tested on other apps that we use to power our daily lives” Maimon said. “Therefore It is important that app users and site owners make it difficult and expensive for cybercriminals to use the information in order to disrupt the cycle of attacks.”

“Malicious login attempts out of total logins trended upwards during 2021 reaching a staggering 93.8% of all login attempts in August which was an 8% increase on the 2020 peak” he said.

Signs of an underlying security problem

The incident marks the second time The North Face had reset passwords after a similar credential stuffing attack in 2020.

“We strongly encourage you not to use the same password for your account at thenorthface.com that you use on other websites because if one of those other websites is breached your email address and password could be used to access your account at thenorthface.com” the company told its customers in 2020.

The apparel company has not disclosed the source of the stolen details used in the recent credential stuffing attack. In 2020 the company indicated that attackers had obtained users’ credentials from a third-party website and compromised an undisclosed number of customer accounts at thenorthface.com.

Evidently the 2020 and 2022 credential stuffing attacks follow similar patterns suggesting an underlying security problem that requires a permanent solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mva2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4taXMtY2xlYW5pbmctb3V0LWhlci1ob3VzaW5nLXBvcnRmb2xpby1saXN0aW5nLXR3by1ob21lcy1pbi1hLXdlZWsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian is cleaning out her housing portfolio listing two homes in a week - realestate.com.au,"Kim Kardashian is parting ways with two California homes she purchased during her marriage to Kanye West.

The reality star and entrepreneur put a Calabasas home — a three-bedroom four-bathroom flat — up for sale on September 6 for $3.5m (A$5.2m). She originally bought it back in 2017 for $1.6m (A$2.4m).

Two days later Kardashian listed her four-bedroom four-bathroom Hidden Hills estate for $5.3m (A$7.9m). The Skims founder originally purchased it in 2019 for $2.97m (A$4.4m).

If Kardashian 41 can secure anywhere near the asking price of both residences she will walk away with a very nice profit.

“She just doesn’t use either property so it made sense to sell them” an insider told The Post.

Calabasas flat — three bedrooms four bathrooms

When Kardashian purchased the 210 sqm unit in 2017 it had been constructed just the year before.

Designed by Vincent Van Duysen a renowned German architect the space resembles that of Kardashian’s main residence that West helped design.

Described as a “minimal monastery style flat” the home features European oak flooring and custom plaster walls with soft neutral tones according to the listing.

The chef’s kitchen comes with high-end appliances that include a Gaggenau oven a Sub-Zero refrigerator and a Bosch dishwasher.

The main bedroom features a luxury bathroom with a Jee-O soho bathtub and custom designer vanities with each bathroom being remodelled with waterproof plaster.

The home first appeared on the market in October 2019 before the listing was removed months later on February 14 2020. It later made its way back on the market last week.

Hidden Hills mansion — four bedrooms four bathrooms

Built in 1957 this ranch property spans 360 sqm and is situated in the guard-gated Hidden Hills community overlooking Ahmanson Ranch State Park.

Situated on 1.5 acres of land the open floor plan features a centre island kitchen with granite counters a family room with a vaulted ceiling and a two-sided fireplace.

There is also a lower pad that comes with a four-stall barn tack and feed rooms and a corral area for horses.

But to view interiors of the home you will likely have to set an appointment with the agent as the listing does not show inside the home.

Tomer Fridman with Compass holds this listing for both properties.

The North Face sent out data breach notification letters and initiated password resets for impacted accounts according to Bleeping Computer.

Credential stuffing attacks involve using login information from previous data breaches to compromise account whose owners reuse the same login credentials across multiple websites

Owned by VF Corporation The North Face sister brands include Altra Dickies Eastpak Ice Breaker Kipling Napapijri Supreme Timberland and Vans. In 2019 the company made $2 billion of the industry’s $4 billion making it one of the market leaders in the outdoor apparel segment.

The North Face credential stuffing attack exposed personal and purchase information

The North Face apparel company stopped the attack on August 19 after detecting unusual activity on August 11 although the attack had begun on July 26 2022.

The North Face determined that the attackers had accessed customer account information of nearly 200000 users. Details leaked in the credential stuffing attack include user’s full name telephone number gender account creation date purchase history billing and shipping addresses and loyalty points.

However the attackers did not access credit card numbers expiration dates and CVVs since the company does not store that information.

“We do not keep a copy of payment card details on thenorthface.com. We only retain a “token” linked to your payment card and only our third-party payment card processor keeps payment card details” the data breach notification stated.

Additionally The North Face explained that the stored payment card tokens could not be used to make purchases on any other website except at thenorthface.com.

Subsequently the company took additional measures by deleting the existing payment tokens to prevent abuse. Thus customers must re-authorize their credit cards to make purchases on the website.

Paul Bischoff privacy advocate at Comparitech warned that the attackers will not stop at The North Face “If you have a North Face account and it has a password that’s the same as other account passwords you should change all of them immediately.”

Users should reset the password of any account that shared login credentials with compromised accounts at thenorthface.com. Additionally they should remain vigilant for phishing attacks attempting to steal personal information by impersonating The North Face staff using leaked information.

Users should also avoid sending account payment and personal information to individuals requesting such details via email text messages or social media. Legitimate companies have defined processes of collecting that information on their websites and hardly rely on email text or social media.

According to Uriel Maimon Head of Emerging Products at Human Security the North Face credential stuffing attack would have a cascading effect on other accounts.

“We should expect that the credentials stolen from The North Face will soon be tested on other apps that we use to power our daily lives” Maimon said. “Therefore It is important that app users and site owners make it difficult and expensive for cybercriminals to use the information in order to disrupt the cycle of attacks.”

“Malicious login attempts out of total logins trended upwards during 2021 reaching a staggering 93.8% of all login attempts in August which was an 8% increase on the 2020 peak” he said.

Signs of an underlying security problem

The incident marks the second time The North Face had reset passwords after a similar credential stuffing attack in 2020.

“We strongly encourage you not to use the same password for your account at thenorthface.com that you use on other websites because if one of those other websites is breached your email address and password could be used to access your account at thenorthface.com” the company told its customers in 2020.

The apparel company has not disclosed the source of the stolen details used in the recent credential stuffing attack. In 2020 the company indicated that attackers had obtained users’ credentials from a third-party website and compromised an undisclosed number of customer accounts at thenorthface.com.

Evidently the 2020 and 2022 credential stuffing attacks follow similar patterns suggesting an underlying security problem that requires a permanent solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mva2ltLWthcmRhc2hpYW4taXMtY2xlYW5pbmctb3V0LWhlci1ob3VzaW5nLXBvcnRmb2xpby1saXN0aW5nLXR3by1ob21lcy1pbi1hLXdlZWsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kim Kardashian is cleaning out her housing portfolio listing two homes in a week - realestate.com.au,"Kim Kardashian is parting ways with two California homes she purchased during her marriage to Kanye West.

The reality star and entrepreneur put a Calabasas home — a three-bedroom four-bathroom flat — up for sale on September 6 for $3.5m (A$5.2m). She originally bought it back in 2017 for $1.6m (A$2.4m).

Two days later Kardashian listed her four-bedroom four-bathroom Hidden Hills estate for $5.3m (A$7.9m). The Skims founder originally purchased it in 2019 for $2.97m (A$4.4m).

If Kardashian 41 can secure anywhere near the asking price of both residences she will walk away with a very nice profit.

“She just doesn’t use either property so it made sense to sell them” an insider told The Post.

Calabasas flat — three bedrooms four bathrooms

When Kardashian purchased the 210 sqm unit in 2017 it had been constructed just the year before.

Designed by Vincent Van Duysen a renowned German architect the space resembles that of Kardashian’s main residence that West helped design.

Described as a “minimal monastery style flat” the home features European oak flooring and custom plaster walls with soft neutral tones according to the listing.

The chef’s kitchen comes with high-end appliances that include a Gaggenau oven a Sub-Zero refrigerator and a Bosch dishwasher.

The main bedroom features a luxury bathroom with a Jee-O soho bathtub and custom designer vanities with each bathroom being remodelled with waterproof plaster.

The home first appeared on the market in October 2019 before the listing was removed months later on February 14 2020. It later made its way back on the market last week.

""Bowerman inhaling the land seemed in leathery profile to have been through some sort of mythic struggle"" wrote former Oregon athlete Kenny Moore of the driven leader a World War II veteran in his 2006 book ""Bowerman and the Men of Oregon.""

""His own competitiveness was barely containable"" Moore also wrote.

Seeking an edge for his athletes Coach Bowerman melted and shaped rubber soles with his family’s waffle iron in his home workshop looking to create a new form of footwear: a lighter faster and more supportive shoe for his athletes.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO SHAPED MODERN FOOTBALL: WALTER CAMP PIGSKIN PIONEER

He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014 as the creator of the modern athletic shoe.

His inventions gave rise to Blue Ribbon Sports the company he co-founded in 1964 with one of his former Oregon athletes Phil Knight.

It’s now a colossus of global consumer brands.

Their company is known as Nike.

""Bowerman was tenacious as hell"" Oregon Sports Hall of Fame and Museum curator Jack Elder told Fox News Digital.

""His own competitiveness was barely containable."" — Bowerman biographer Kenny Moore

""He had personal drive curiosity attention to detail and a willingness to develop both people and things.""

Bowerman’s competitive drive built a Ducks dynasty.

He elevated Oregon to the top of collegiate athletics — and ultimately changed the way America runs plays and performs on and off the court track and field.

Bowerman coached Oregon from 1949 to 1972 making it the dominant power in NCAA track and field.

He inspired 24 NCAA individual champs 33 Olympic competitors and 64 All-Americans according to the NCAA.

Bowerman led Oregon to four national championships and coached the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

His successes included coaching an incredible 16 runners who bested the 4-minute mile.

Bowerman coached 24 NCAA individual champs 33 Olympic competitors and 64 All-Americans.

It was a remarkable record of achievement considering that the milestone of human excellence was surpassed for the first time by Englishman Roger Bannister only in 1954 concurrent with Bowerman’s Oregon track dynasty.

Among his stars was Steve Prefontaine whose dominance on the track fiery independent spirit and tragic death in a car accident at age 24 inspired two Hollywood versions of his life story.

Bowerman’s success afforded him the opportunity to become a national mentor. He wrote the book ""Jogging"" in 1967 with cardiologist W.E. Harris.

It sold more than 1 million copies.

He’s widely seen today as one for the forces of the running craze that inspired millions of Americans to don his new shoes and take to the streets in the 1970s.

Among them: fictional American hero Forrest Gump who sported a pair of Bowerman-designed Nike Cortez sneakers while running across the United States.

""If there are limits to what we can do"" Bowerman said powerfully as quoted by the University of Oregon ""I don’t know what they are.""

Oregonian's heroism overseas

William Jay Bowerman was born on Feb. 19 1911 in Portland Oregon to Jay and Elizabeth (Hoover) Bowerman.

His father was a prominent Republican politician who briefly served as the 13th governor of the Beaver State in 1910 and 1911.

The future track icon first starred on the gridiron helping lead Medford High School to state football championships as a junior and senior.

""He was 6-2 over 200 pounds with a powerful upper body"" Moore wrote in his book about Bowerman’s Oregon men.

He was built more like a fullback than the lithe long-distance runners he led to so much success.

He attended Oregon to play football but was encouraged to join the track team by his predecessor as the university’s coach Bill Hayward.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO CREATED THE NATION'S FIRST SPORTS BAR IN ST. LOUIS: WORLD WAR II VETERAN JIMMY PALERMO

The decision to join the track team changed his life. It also changed the course of American culture.

He was ""an Oregonian through and through"" the University of Oregon describes him in its history of it sports.

But he’d soon end up a world away.

Bowerman joined the U.S. Army after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He served with distinction through the end of the war eventually rising to a major and battalion commander in the legendary 10th Mountain Division.

He relied on his size athleticism and force of will to negotiate the surrender of a German garrison near Brenner Pass in the Italian Alps in the final days of the war in the spring of 1945.

""You cannot resist our air force artillery and troops standing by to blast you off the map."" — Bowerman to German general

""Drawing himself up to his full height of an All-American football player which he was"" writes Moore Bowerman told a low-level German officer: ""I am a major and I order you to call the general and tell him a group of American officers would like to talk to him in his headquarters.""

He stoically informed the general of the hopelessness of his situation.

""You surely know you cannot resist our air force artillery and troops standing by to blast you off the map"" Bowerman said according to Moore’s account.

The next morning the general surrendered his 4000 troops to Bowerman’s unit.

Like many members of the Greatest Generation he talked little of his wartime experiences.

""Although the war influenced him profoundly he rarely spoke of his experiences other than recurring parables that he used when trying to make a point with his athletes"" his son Jay Bowerman told Fox News Digital.

Waffle iron that changed an industry

When Bowerman married Barbara Young in 1936 one of the gifts the couple received was a waffle iron.

The competitive Bowerman saw in the waffle iron a way to give his athletes an edge on the track.

He began melting and molding rubber in the waffle iron and attaching the new forms to uppers then using his athletes as guinea pigs for his evolving designs.

""His Waffle Trainer sole first prototyped using his wife's waffle iron featured raised nubs similar to those on modern mountain bike tires which gave the shoe traction while maintaining a low weight"" writes the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

While Bowerman was tinkering with rubber and a waffle iron Phil Knight one of his former athletes was importing athletic shoes from Japan.

He sent two pairs to Bowerman on Jan. 20 1964 to get thoughts from the coach and part-time shoe designer.

""I’ll pass on some of my ideas to you but of course I’ll expect you to make some kind of arrangement with cutting your old coach in too"" Bowerman said according to author Moore’s account.

""Knight cut him in that very week.""

Blue Ribbon Sports was born — and became Nike in the 1970s.

NIKE MAY NOT RENEW KYRIE IRVING'S SIGNATURE SHOE DEAL: REPORT

Bowerman filed a patent for his newest creation an ""athletic shoe for artificial turf"" on August 30 1972. It was approved on Feb. 26 1974.

Its innovative design featured a sole of ""integral polygon shaped studs"" according to Bowerman’s patent application.

""This greatly reduces the weight of a football shoe made in accordance with the invention so that it is approximately one-half the weight of a conventional leather football shoe as well as providing great comfort and enabling use in wet weather without damage.""

The Nike Cortez also designed by Bowerman was released in 1972 — the same year that the coach led American track athletes into Munich at the Olympics.

Now 50 years old the Nike Cortez remains one of the most iconic shoes on the market. Among other iconic pop-culture moments Whitney Houston wore a pair while singing the national anthem before the 1991 Super Bowl.

""If there was no Bill Bowerman there would have been no me"" Knight now chairman emeritus of Nike told Men's Journal.

""He had about as much of an impact on my life as any one person could have. He taught me about competition and ingrained it in me. He taught me not to praise ordinary performances.""

Legacy still shapes culture today

Bowerman died in his sleep on Christmas Eve Dec. 24 1999 in Fossil Oregon.

He was 88 years old.

His legacy still shapes American track and field.

The Bowerman award has been given out each year since 2009 to the top male and female track athletes in the NCAA.

Oregon not surprisingly boasts five Bowerman winners — more than any other school in America.

The Prefontaine Classic is one of the premier events in American track and field named for his famous former athlete.

One of the more interesting implications of Bowerman's legacy has been to help reshape the American sports uniform industry.

""The Nike campus in Beaverton is named One Bowerman Drive.""

Knight in 1996 began investing heavily in the University of Oregon football program.

Among other features Oregon wears different and dramatic new Nike uniforms for almost every game. Sparkling mirror ball helmets and feathery yellow duck wing decals have replaced the boring old helmet ""O"" of old.

The uniforms elevated the program's profile on and off the field and inspired imitators from coast to coast. Every college football team in America and now in other sports turns out special uniforms throughout the season.

""Bill’s legacy is well remembered past his death in 1999"" reads a testament to him from the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame and Museum.

The BYU-Oregon football matchup on at Autzen Stadium in Eugene is a battle of Top 25 teams and will be the feature game for FOX Sports on Saturday afternoon.

It’s also a game between two schools who eat sleep and breathe Nike.

Oregon’s ties to Nike are strong. Former Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman and former Ducks track athlete Phil Knight created the brand in 1964 as “Blue Ribbon Sports” using a waffle iron to make unique soles of running shoes. The company became Nike Inc. in 1971 named after the Greek goddess of victory. In 2021 the net worth of Nike was estimated at $176.27 billion worldwide. The Nike brand alone is worth in excess of $32 billion.

Oregon sometimes refers to itself as the “University of Nike” and claims to have never worn the same football uniform twice. In 2017 the U of O and Nike reportedly agreed to an 11-year $88 million apparel contract so college football fans are going to continue to see bleeding-edge neon football uniforms on Saturdays.

The world headquarters for Nike are in Beaverton Ore. less than 90 minutes up I-5 from Eugene. The 286-acre campus has outdoor hallways adorned with bronze plaques honoring coaches and athletes from the 1990s the era when the headquarters were designed and created.

One of those plaques features former BYU coaching legend LaVell Edwards.

Edwards and Knight became good friends and BYU has certainly benefited from that relationship as one of the few non-Power Five programs designated as “Nike Elite.” In 2019 BYU and Nike announced a seven-year apparel extension through 2026.

“We don’t have a better relationship in the country than the one we have with BYU” said Knight now chairman emeritus at Nike. “We are very proud of it. We love the relationship and the program.”

While BYU didn’t divulge the final figures the news release indicated the agreement “more than doubles the annual value of the previous Nike agreement and includes annual cash compensation for BYU Athletics.”

Head coach Kalani Sitake said “Everyone loves the Nike brand–student-athletes coaches and recruits. It’s a big deal to have Nike as our partner providing our players with the best technology available in footwear apparel and equipment. Being outfitted from head-to-toe by the top brand in the world is very important to us. Nike has been an amazing partner of BYU football for more than 40 years.”

BYU Deputy Athletic Director Brian Santiago said the relationship with Nike is “rock solid.”

“We’re fortunate to be partners with the best in the business” he continued. “It’s been a long-standing relationship and Nike has been awesome with us.”

Research done by Boardroom which was founded by Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman in 2019 bears out Nike’s dominance in college sports. As of 2021 52.3% of the 130 Division I FBS football programs are Nike-affiliated (68). Adidas is a distant second (37) followed by Under Armor (17) Jordan Brand (7) and New Balance (1).

There are currently seven Nike schools in the Big 12 (Texas Kansas State Oklahoma State West Virginia Baylor Iowa State and TCU) with one each for Adidas (Kansas) Jordan Brand (Oklahoma) and Under Armour (Texas Tech).

Of the four schools joining the Big 12 in 2023-24 three (BYU Cincinnati and Central Florida) are Nike branded and one (Houston) is Jordan Brand.

“Going into the Big 12 will enhance our visibility” Santiago said “but the core relationship with Nike remains the same.”

As a Nike Elite school all of BYU’s athletic programs are Nike “head to toe” and that’s no exaggeration. Santiago told a story about a Las Vegas Bowl appearance where one of the gifts was an Under Armour beanie. With colder-than-usual weather some of the BYU players were seen wearing the beanies on the sideline to stay warm during the TV broadcast.

“It didn’t take two minutes for the phone to ring from Nike” Santiago said.

Most sports at BYU have a staff member acting as a Nike liaison and they chose the gear that best fits their program.

“I work primarily with Nike on the contractual side” Santiago said. “We have a great team of equipment managers who are heavily involved in the actual ordering. We’ve also got a great team that works with marketing and social media in designing some of the gear.”

Athletes at BYU look forward to the day their gear drops replenishing their supply of t-shirts hoodies socks shoes hats and the like with the Swoosh logo. Each week BYU football sends photos of that week’s Nike uniform choice out on social media.

The latest slang thrown around by the athletes to describe cool outfits is “drip” and BYU’s Nike drip is the envy of every Cougar fan and prospective recruit on the planet.

“Our Nike gear is prominently displayed on every recruiting trip” Santiago said. “At this level there are high stakes and we want to outfit our athletes in the very best equipment and apparel. Nike opens doors for us.”

On Nike’s end the company is prominently displayed on Saturdays in the fall on every network that broadcasts the sport.

“Nike is heavily invested with collegiate athletics and they get exposure on a very high level” Santiago said. “You can turn just about any game and see the ‘Swoosh’ logo. It’s everywhere.”

A good example of that was last Saturday when Nike schools BYU and Baylor met at LaVell Edwards Stadium on ESPN. Nearly every one of the Cougar fans in attendance was wearing eye-catching royal blue and much of that gear was made by Nike.

Santiago said the relationship with Nike is more than just a financial partnership.

“The cool thing about it is it’s not just transactional. This is a long-standing relationship that has produced life-long friendships from the equipment manager level to the administrative level to executives at Nike. It goes way beyond the transaction of product.”

The 4x All-Star has been unrelenting in his pursuit of history. Judge has hit 57 home runs and is poised to make more noise.

Not only is the 30-year-old slugger taking care of business on the field but he is dressing like a superstar off the field. The Instagram account @mlbfits recently posted pictures of players entering Yankee stadium before a game this week. Naturally Judge was wearing shoes we had never seen before.

Of course Judge wore a pair of the classic Nike Air Force 1 shoes but it was an unknown colorway. That is because Judge is the first person to get a pair of these rare kicks (in size 17 no less). Below is everything fans need to know about Judge's kicks.

Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 Low 'Multi-Patent'

Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 Low 'Multi-Patent' @SneakerNews

Judge debuted a pair of Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 shoes in the 'Multi-Patent' colorway. The shoes are part of a collaboration between Nike and Los Angeles sneaker store Undefeated. The two partners have collaborated on countless projects in the past.

This version of the Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 shoes 'Multi-Patent' has not yet been released. From what we can surmise the multi-colored shoes feature a patent leather upper consisting of teal olive blue grey yellow and off-white.

Currently Nike has not provided a release date pricing or official images of this shoe. There is no guarantee that it even releases. But the silver lining is that rapper Travis Scott also debuted a pair of Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 shoes in a different colorway. So that at least doubles fans chances of getting a pair of these classic Nike shoes.

Judge is many things. A home run leader future Hall of Famer and sneakerhead. Undefeated and Nike could not have picked a better person to debut the unreleased lifestyle shoes. Stay locked into FanNationKicks.com to learn more about what your favorite athletes wear on and off the field.

Here’s the longer story: This week unions representing tens of thousands of railway workers were poised to strike in protest of poor working conditions and low wages. Their complaints were straightforward. The two largest freight railroad carriers — Union Pacific and BNSF Railway — were using attendance policies that punished workers for taking time off from the job. “Engineers and conductors face penalties for taking any time off” The Washington Post explained in its report on the labor dispute “including weekends outside of holidays and preplanned vacation even in the case of emergencies.”

The fact of the matter is that a decade of corporate cost-cutting including smaller crews for longer trains has placed railroad workers under incredible pressure. Not only are they unable to take time for emergencies or sudden illnesses but they are almost always on call with just a few hours’ notice before they have to take a shift. For them the tight schedules and stiff punishments translate to strains on their finances families and health.

What makes these conditions worse is that they come at a time when rail carriers are posting record profits as a result of demand during the pandemic. As NBC News reports BNSF had a net income of nearly $6 billion in 2021 up 16 percent from the previous year. Union Pacific likewise had a net income of $6.5 billion which was also up 16 percent from the previous year. Other freight companies like CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway have posted large gains as well. But this windfall has not stopped the carriers from trying to wring as much labor as possible out of a steadily shrinking work force.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWlucy5jb20vdHJuL25ld3MtcmV2aWV3cy9uZXdzLXdpcmUvdW5pb24tcGFjaWZpYy1kcm9wcy1jYW5hZGlhbi1wYWNpZmljLWZyb20tZW1wLWludGVybW9kYWwtcHJvZ3JhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union Pacific drops Canadian Pacific from EMP intermodal program - Trains,"Union Pacific is booting Canadian Pacific out of the EMP domestic container pool.

EMP which rosters a 44000-unit fleet of green 53-foot containers is an interline intermodal partnership between UP and Norfolk Southern. CP Canadian National Kansas City Southern and Florida East Coast also participate in EMP which allows intermodal marketing companies to book loads across North America.

UP pulled the plug on CP because the proposed CP-KCS merger would create a new single-line competitor to UP in intermodal lanes linking Mexico and Texas with Chicago according to people familiar with the matter.

CP notified customers about the move on Thursday.

“Canadian Pacific has been advised by the Union Pacific that it has elected to terminate its agreement with CP in relation to the EMP program effective Oct. 8 2022. As a result of UP’s action intermodal customers will have one fewer transportation option to move freight between Canada and certain key markets in the U.S. and Mexico” CP said in a customer advisory. “CP regrets the impact that Union Pacific’s action has on our customers. We will continue to accept billing for loaded interline shipments until Oct. 7 2022.”

UP informed its customers in a Sept. 9 announcement.

“Effective Oct. 8 2022 the Canadian Pacific Railroad will no longer be party to the EMP program. As such customers will not be able to waybill EMPs to or from the CP after this date. UP will however be expanding our relationship with the Canadian National and making them our exclusive Canadian EMP partner” UP said. “UP and CN will provide service to and from all points in Canada on the CN network. We are collaborating with the CN on service pricing and equipment allocation to provide a seamless transition to meet your intermodal needs to and from Canada.”

KCS says it’s unaware of any changes to its access to the EMP program in the U.S. and Mexico.

Union Pacific has raised concerns that the CP-KCS merger would reduce competition for cross-border traffic that moves through the Laredo Texas gateway. KCS controls the International Railway Bridge across the Rio Grande at Laredo the busiest rail freight border crossing in North America.

Union Pacific in March asked federal regulators to ensure that the CP-KCS merger does not undermine competition at Laredo where UP interchanges with KCS de Mexico.

“An unconditioned combination of CP and KCS would likely cause a significant loss of competition especially for traffic moving via the Laredo Gateway. CP would gain control of KCSM and thus the ability to increase the costs or reduce the quality of rail service in Mexico for railroads providing shippers competitive options to CPKC north of Laredo” UP wrote in its 334-page filing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2ludGVybW9kYWwvaW50ZXJtb2RhbC1icmllZnMtcG9ydC1vZi1zYXZhbm5haC1wb3J0LW9mLWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intermodal Briefs: Port of Savannah Port of Los Angeles,"Port of Savannah handles more than 575000 twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEUs) in August. Also Port of Los Angeles cargo volume eases in August.

Port of Savannah

The Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) announced on Sept. 13 that the Port of Savannah handled 575513 TEUs in August an increase of 18.5% or 89918 TEUs over the same month last year.

Counting the July volume of 530800 TEUs the Port of Savannah’s August performance made for “the fastest period in which the port has cleared the one million-TEU mark in a fiscal year” GPA said.

“The Port of Savannah’s geographic and capacity advantages remain a driving force behind current and new customers deciding to move cargo through Georgia” said GPA Executive Director Griff Lynch. “Our central location and service through the largest container terminal in the Western Hemisphere offers speed to market and unmatched room to grow.”

According to GPA intermodal volumes including operations at Garden City Terminal and the Appalachian Regional Port totaled nearly 51700 rail lifts in August up by more than 4000 lifts compared to the same month last year.

In November 2021 GPA says it commissioned the final nine of 18 working tracks on its Mason Mega Rail Terminal increasing rail capacity by 30%. Served by Class I railroads Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX the 85-acre rail yard is the largest of its kind for a port terminal in North America according to the Authority.

“The investments we have made in our operating infrastructure have been paying off in our ability to handle the sustained influx of business that began two years ago” said GPA Chairman Joel Wooten. “Combined with a deeper harbor our improved rail capabilities and expanded container yard space have allowed GPA to maintain fluid cargo management.”

While the Port of Savannah continues to work through a vessel backlog Lynch noted imports on the water are trending downward compared to July when there were 265000 containers destined for Savannah. Today that number is 223460 boxes on the water. Lynch said the number of vessels at anchor will “dwindle over the next six weeks and a more permanent solution will come online in June 2023 when improvements to Container Berth 1 at Garden City Terminal are completed.”

According to GPA work to realign the berth is now more than 60% complete. The improvement GPA says will provide space for another big ship berth allowing the Port of Savannah to simultaneously serve four 16000-TEU vessels as well as three additional ships.

“This is a rare project for a U.S. port” Wooten said. “By this time next year an additional big ship berth in Savannah will have increased our ability to move containers on and off vessels by 1.4 million TEUs per year.”

In a related project GPA says it has ordered eight new ship-to-shore cranes set to be commissioned in December 2023. Additionally work has begun on the Garden City Terminal West Expansion Phase II. According to GPA the project will add 90 acres of container storage space to be supported by 15 electric rubber-tired gantry cranes and will add 1 million TEUs of annual container handling capacity coming online in phases in 2023 and 2024.

Port of Los Angeles

After “record-breaking” cargo volume in 2021 and the first half of 2022 Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka announced in a news briefing that import surge at the Port has slowed in August due to the “early arrival of holiday goods and economic concerns.” According to Seroka the Port handled an estimated 806000 TEUs in August approximately 15% less than the same period a year ago.

Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka

“Some goods that usually arrive in August the for the fall and winter season shipped earlier to make sure they reached their destination in time” Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said at a news briefing. “Additionally inflationary concerns and elevated inventory levels have made some retailers and e-commerce sellers more cautious.

“We’ve been able to nearly eliminate the backlog of ships waiting to enter the port by 90% compared to earlier this year” Seroka added. “We’ve got capacity on our terminals and the ability to handle cargo coming in more efficiently than last holiday season.”

While official August cargo volume will be available soon on the Port’s website Seroka offered the following estimates which he says are expected to change only slightly when final:

August 2022 loaded imports reached an estimated 404000 TEUs compared to the previous year a decrease of about 17%.

Loaded exports reached an estimated 100000 TEUs a 1% increase drop compared to last August.

Empty containers landed at an estimated 301000 TEUs an 18% decline compared to last year.

Eight months into 2022 the Port of Los Angeles says it has moved an estimated 7.2 million TEUs about 1.6% down from last year’s record pace.

Phil Murphy announced the state has completed its purchase of the abandoned rail line.

The state paid Norfolk Southern $65 million for the “old Boonton line” as it is referred to setting the stage for a linear state park that runs from Montclair to Jersey City. The purchase marks the state’s single largest conservation project and the largest transaction for a non-motorized transportation corridor.

The Essex-Hudson Greenway Coalition which coordinated and advocated for the project over the past four years celebrated the acquisition. The coalition includes the Open Space Institute the New Jersey Bike & Walk Coalition and the September 11 National Memorial Trail Alliance.

“This acquisition by Governor Murphy and the state of New Jersey brings us one step closer to creating much-needed green space to the most densely populated and diverse region in the entire nation” said Kim Elliman president and CEO of the Open Space Institute which secured the purchase agreement for the 135-acre former rail property.

From East the property begins on Jersey City’s west side hits the tip of Secaucus near Laurel Hill Park to reach the Hackensack River and crosses Kearny on a route parallel to Midland Avenue. It then crosses the Passaic River heads through Newark south of and parallel to Second River travels through Belleville near Belleville Avenue and crosses Bloomfield and Glen Ridge before ending at the edge of Montclair.

Much of the land is currently overgrown and some goes through marshy wetlands as trains haven’t run on the line since 2009. Measuring close to 100 feet wide in areas the park will offer residents ample space for off-road transportation and recreational biking and walking once it is cleaned up.

In 2021 the September 11th National Memorial Trail received unanimous federal approval to make the Greenway part of the triangle-shaped 1300 mile trail that runs from the National Memorial and Museum in New York to the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial in Arlington Virginia to the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville Pennsylvania.

“Many people don’t realize that in addition to providing nearby residents with new green space the Essex-Hudson Greenway also has national significance as a component of the 9/11 Memorial Trail” said Andy Hamilton chairman of the September 11th National Memorial Trail Alliance Board of Directors.

At the same time Jersey City remains in negotiations with Conrail to purchase the Sixth Street Embankment a mile-long elevated stretch of land Downtown that city officials have long envisioned as a High Line-type park.

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop “was one of the major advocates for the acquisition of this property by the state so he is elated” city spokeswoman Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione said. “The city should finally have closure on the Sixth Street Embankment over the next few months with the city obtaining ownership of the eight blocks in exchange for a smaller residential building being built on block one of the embankment while we will continue litigation against Conrail separately.”

“We have worked hard for 10 years on the Embankment with the Embankment Coalition and the timing of our resolution will fit perfectly with the announcement by the state today.”

Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill an advocate for the Greenway plan since its inception said the Essex-Hudson Greenway will serve as a blueprint for future projects nationwide.

“Residents of underserved communities adjacent to the line will now have more access to recreational areas which will foster an appreciation for the outdoors encourage exercise and improve the overall health and quality of life for future generations” he said. “(The Greenway) will demonstrate the positive effects large-scale environmentally friendly transportation projects can have on our community.”

The project follows the right-of-way of the eastern portion of NJ Transit’s former Boonton Line. Passenger service was discontinued on this portion of the line in 2002 following the completion of NJ Transit’s Montclair connection and the diversion of Boonton Line trains onto the transit carrier’s Morris & Essex Line.

Soon after the rail service ended residents of communities all along the line began campaigning for a linear park that would serve as a “shared-use path” for people walking riding a bicycle running rollerblading or just relaxing.

Groups including the Bloomfield Open Space Trust Fund the Friends of the Ice & Iron Trail and groups in North Newark Jersey City and Hoboken have long advocated for the Greenway."

The Embassy of Ireland and the Trust Fund for Victims conclude a joint monitoring visit to northern Uganda between 13 – 17 September 2022

Photo: A joint monitoring visit to Uganda between 13-17 September 2022 initiated by Ireland and the Trust Fund for Victims (TFV). Honourable Norbert Mao Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda and visiting delegation posed for a group photograph during the visit. Delegation include President of the Assembly of States Parties Silvia Fernandez de Gurmendi representatives from the governments of Australia Belgium Chile Estonia Germany Ireland Liechtenstein Netherlands New Zealand Switzerland Tanzania Uganda United States the European Union TFV Board of Directors and staff members ICC Kampala Country Office Legal Representatives of Victims in the Ongwen case and civil society organisations.

From 13 – 17 September 2022 the Embassy of Ireland to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) at the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the assistance of the Embassy of Ireland to Uganda led a joint monitoring visit to northern Uganda.

The objective of the monitoring visit was to provide delegates with the opportunity to witness first-hand the transformative work of the TFV in northern Uganda focusing on the lasting impact of the conflict and the individuals and communities affected by the many atrocities committed. Delegates on the visit hoped to gain insight into reparation implementation programmes and hear directly victims’ experiences of court-ordered reparation programme in the Lubanga and the Katanga case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Honourable Norbert Mao Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda said “Although the guns have gone silent the wounds are still deep”. He added “We highly appreciate this important monitoring visit with so many delegates and we are certain that they will bring back great impressions of Uganda after their personal interactions with the victims of the LRA. It has become apparent that mental health is very important to be addressed. We have to ensure that psychosomatic services among others are continued as some victims will require this assistance to lead a normal life. The work of the Trust Fund for Victims is of utmost important to the thousands of victims in northern Uganda and we hope that the assistance will be prolonged. Without the assistance of the Government of Ireland this visit would have not been possible and we shall welcome you again any time. “

The Chair of the TFV Board of Directors Minou Tavarez Mirabal said “Medical treatment trauma counselling and livelihood support are life changing services that afford recognition and a form of justice to victims of Rome Statute crimes and redress for the harm they have suffered. The TFV calls for collective efforts to restoring hope transforming lives and achieving long-term reparative justice for victims” she added.

Speaking on Ireland's hopes for the visit and support of the TFV's work H.E. Ambassador Brendan Rogers of Ireland to the Netherlands said: “This visit is the bridge between The Hague and the field. Delegates are now better informed and have seen with their own eyes the impact of the work of the TFV on the ground. We now have a family of supporters of the Fund that can take that support back to The Hague and beyond.”

Participating delegates came to better understand the deeply rooted harm persisting in northern Uganda sixteen years after the LRA conflict and the need to redress this harm. Beneficiaries of the programme called upon the delegates to provide reparative measures more broadly to the victims their children and communities. Delegates committed to advocate for increased international awareness and support in order to allow the TFV to continue its programmes in northern Uganda complementing the efforts of the Government of Uganda.

Recalling the commitment to victims and affected communities of atrocity crimes President of the Assembly of States Parties Silvia Fernandez de Gurmendi called on States Parties of the Rome Statute to step up providing support to victims. “States Parties should cooperate with the ICC in order to ensure perpetrators of crimes are brought to justice and the rights and needs of victim survivors are addressed. During my mandate I will do my utmost to promote the important work of the Trust Fund for victims”.

Fourteen States participated in the monitoring visit this year including the President of the Assembly of the States Parties and representatives from the governments of Australia Belgium Chile Estonia Germany Ireland Liechtenstein Netherlands New Zealand Switzerland Tanzania Uganda United States and the European Union. Also Legal Representatives of Victims in the Ongwen case and civil society organisations participated in the visit.

Most notably the 1996 event at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club came down to his singles match with Vijay Singh. Couples rolled in a 30-footer on the 17th hole to win his match and clinch the cup for the U.S. in the 16.5-15.5 win. Freddie's back looked pretty good on the celebration.

That time the Internationals won (1998) That's not a misprint. The Internationals won this event once. This photo is proof. Photo By: ASSOCIATED PRESS

The Taunting Caddie (2000) With Vijay Singh playing World No. 1 Tiger Woods in a Sunday singles match his caddie Paul Tesori showed up wearing this hat that said ""Tiger Who?"" on the back. Probably not the smartest move. Woods won 2 and 1 and the U.S. restored Presidents Cup order by trouncing the Internationals 21.5 to 10.5.

The Duel in South Africa (2003) More evidence that this event has actually been competitive at times. In 2003 the matches ended tied at 17 and a tiebreaker of sending one player out from each team was used for the first and only time. Tiger Woods and Ernie Els were obvious choices and they played even through three holes that included both holing clutch mid-range par putts on the third. With darkness setting in captains Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player decided to end the event with a draw and a shared cup. Sportsmanship wins!

When Chris DiMarco ruled the world (2005) After tying in 2003 the teams remained deadlocked heading into the singles session in 2005. Playing in the final match of the day DiMarco drained a 10-footer for birdie to beat Stuart Appleby 1 up and capture the cup for the U.S. DiMarco went a perfect 4-0-1 that week at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club.

Trying to play a shot from a bank on the 14th hole on Friday Austin lost his balance and fell face first into a lake. After drying off he made three late birdies to salvage a halve in his four-ball match. The next day captain Jack Nicklaus announced him as ""Jacques Cousteau"" and Woody showed up wearing snorkeling gear on Sunday.

Woods' Perfect Week (2009) No one could stop Tiger at Harding Park in 2009. Playing in front of the U.S. squad's special assistant Michael Jordan Woods put forth a dazzling display of golf going a perfect 5-and-0 and leading the U.S. to another lopsided victory. That included a payback beatdown (6 and 5) of Y.E. Yang the man who had denied him at that year's PGA Championship in singles. That week Woods was the most fired up we've ever seen him at the Presidents Cup. Gotta be that argyle right?

Tiger and Steve's bromance (2009) The friendship between these two has been well documented and is a big reason for Woods being an assistant captain for Stricker in 2017 but it all started with a magical week at Harding Park. Beginning with a 6-and-4 foursomes win on Thursday the new dynamic duo rolled to a 4-0 record as a team -- and became instant BFFs.

Sammy The Squirrel (2013) The U.S. made a furry friend during the 2013 matches at Muirfield Village. Everyone especially captain Davis Love III loved Sammy the Squirrel. Well maybe not everyone. Tiger didn't look too pleased when girlfriend Lindsey Vonn put the rodent on his shoulder. Sammy was eventually pried from the hands of a sobbing Love and taken to a wildlife center. Or something like that. Photo By: AP

The City watchdog this week said it was likely to force Link the firm responsible for supervising Woodford’s management of his funds to pay a penalty of up to £306million.

This might seem like small recompense for investors who have lost around £1billion since the Woodford Equity Income Fund (WEIF) was shuttered by Link in 2019.

Payout: The City watchdog this week said it was likely to force Link the firm responsible for supervising former Neil Woodford funds to pay a penalty of up to £306m

The fund was frozen after a flood of investors tried to pull their money out following a run of poor performance on Woodford’s behalf.

Of the £3.7billion in the fund investors have received £2.5billion. There is £118.5million which remains tied up in assets which are yet to be sold.

The remaining £1billion disappeared.

Here we explore some of the parties involved and whether they can be pursued . . .

Neil Woodford

Though it was Woodford himself who caused a problem for investors ploughing too much of their money into risky illiquid stocks which couldn’t be sold in a rush there is little opportunity for savers to target him directly.

It was Link rather than Woodford who had a duty to investors – a distinction which became ever more frustrating as victims saw the 62-year-old renovating his multi-million pound holiday home in Devon while they were nursing their losses.

A lawsuit led by investors against the fallen fund manager seems unlikely but he and his key employees have been scrutinised by the FCA.

Three years after this probe began savers will be hoping that the watchdog will soon announce its result – and slap a fine on the fallen fund manager.

LINK

Given that Link was responsible for supervising Woodford’s management of WEIF on behalf of savers it is perhaps unsurprising that it was first in the firing line.

Now part of Australian-listed Link Group but formerly part of outsourcer Capita the firm has previously been forced to pay out £32million and £66million to investors involved in the Arch Cru and Connaught fund debacles.

After featuring heavily in the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) probe into the Woodford scandal it is likely to face a £306million penalty – but shared between around 300000 investors this won’t equate to much.

Link is also being pursued by law firms Leigh Day and Harcus Parker who have joined forces on behalf of around 13000 WEIF investors to take Link to court.

Meriel Hodgson-Teall a solicitor at Leigh Day said the FCA’s suggested penalty was ‘nowhere near enough to compensate the many thousands who suffered huge and life-changing financial losses investing in this fund’.

The lawyers are claiming that Link failed in its duties to investors leading up to the suspension of the fund and broke FCA guidelines.

Savers can still join the case. But Hodgson-Teall warned that the FCA may not allow them to claim part of the £306million if they are also hoping to get legal damages.

The FCA is yet to confirm the details of the Link redress package but Woodford victims could be left with the tricky decision of whether to take the money which the FCA extracts from Link or to pursue the firm in court in the hope of a bigger pay-out.

Hargreaves Lansdown

The UK’s largest investment platform also attracted ire during the Woodford debacle as it continued to recommend WEIF right up until the fund’s suspension.

Savers who relied on Hargreaves Lansdown’s (HL) Wealth 50 best-buy list for advice were furious when WEIF shuttered.

Just a month before HL’s then-head of research Mark Dampier predicted the beleaguered Woodford was set to turn a corner. Dampier has since retired.

HL is also a target of the FCA’s probe though the regulator has not yet announced whether it plans to penalise HL as it has Link.

Boss Chris Hill apologised to clients but HL is still facing a lawsuit brought by litigation company RGL Management which works with lawyers to build a case on behalf of clients.

The Mail understands RGL is due to file its claim – which will also target Link – within weeks.

Unfortunately savers are unlikely to be able to sign up to multiple legal cases so will have to choose between RGL and Leigh Day/Harcus Parker.

Northern Trust

A Lesser-known party which became embroiled in the Woodford disaster was Northern Trust (NT) WEIF’s so-called depositary.

In a similar way to how Link was supposed to keep Woodford in check NT was charged with keeping an eye on Link.

Questions arose over whether NT challenged Link over Woodford’s steady accumulation of hard-to-sell stocks. Again it will be up to the FCA’s probe to assess whether NT went awry.

Guernsey's stock exchange

The International Stock Exchange (TISE) an obscure stock market operating on Guernsey found itself in the limelight after Woodford used it to list stocks held by WEIF.

Woodford had snapped up several early-stage companies which were not listed on a stock market – a risky venture since these businesses are harder to sell in a hurry and have to comply with fewer governance requirements.

For this reason FCA rules state that they must only constitute 10pc of a fund’s holdings. But Woodford found himself repeatedly breaching this cap. Rather than getting rid of the stakes he listed them on TISE in a cynical attempt to dodge FCA rules.

TISE was criticised by some industry insiders for not running further checks on Woodford.

The exchange has claimed it did nothing wrong and blamed the FCA for failing to act fast enough when it reported concerns.

It could feature in the FCA probe although Guernsey’s regulator – the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) – would have to lead any investigation. The GFSC declined to comment."
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS91bm1hbm5lZC8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3NreXJhbmdlLXVuY3Jld2VkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLXNwZWVkLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtdGVzdGluZy1ieS0yMDI0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'SkyRange' uncrewed aircraft to speed hypersonic testing by 2024,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon expects to complete the transfer of 24 decommissioned Global Hawk drones this month advancing its plan to use the systems to support hypersonic testing as soon as 2024.

The RQ-4s are part of the SkyRange program which aims to use unmanned aircraft to track hypersonic systems during flight tests. The U.S. Department of Defense has relied on ships to perform the mission but it wants to increase the frequency and flexibility of testing so the Test Resource Management Center is looking to autonomous airborne systems to take over that role.

The Pentagon is investing in hypersonic research and development efforts across the military services with the goal of fielding weapons and air vehicles that can travel and maneuver at speeds above Mach 5. In its fiscal 2023 budget request DoD requested nearly $5 billion for hypersonic system development up from just over $4 billion in the previous year. However the Pentagon’s infrastructure isn’t sufficient to meet the high demand for flight test support limiting it to about a dozen airborne demos a year.

George Rumford TRMC’s acting director told C4ISRNET in a recent interview that SkyRange is part of a focused effort within the department to pick up its testing cadence. The goal based on guidance from Principal Director for Hypersonics Mike White is to develop infrastructure that can support a “drumbeat” of one flight test per week.

“That is a big challenge to us” Rumford said. “To be able to support 50-plus tests a year you just can’t keep doing what you’re doing. You’ve got to do something different. And SkyRange is doing something different.”

The benefit of using autonomous aircraft for test support Rumford said is flexibility. Flights aren’t limited to a fixed range location because the infrastructure is airborne.

The drones will have a central hub in North Dakota — a UAV and aviation business park called Grand Sky — but the plan is for them to travel to forward operating stations near where a test is needed. Rather than require programs wait in line for a ship to be available or have an event delayed because of maintenance on the vessel SkyRange is designed to adjust to individual program schedules and needs.

“That means if they want to test in the Pacific we can go test in the Pacific. If they want to test in the Atlantic we can test in the Atlantic” he said. “We can go to where they need to go which is very different than where it is today. . . . You can’t just reposition a bunch of ships from the Pacific over to the Atlantic in a timely fashion.”

Rumford added that while it can take a ship 21 days to be positioned and outfitted for a flight test an autonomous aircraft can be ready to support within hours of the activity. The use of unmanned aircraft also improves testing data because the system can fly closer to the hypersonic flight path.

From Global Hawk to Range Hawk

TRMC has been experimenting with the SkyRange concept — in partnership with the Air Force and NASA — for several years making investments in the sensor and instrumentation technology that will fly on the aircraft and using older-model Global Hawks to demonstrate feasibility.

The program has three Block 10 RQ-4s one of which is a pre-production aircraft retrofitted to what it calls Range Hawks because of their new mission.

Following Congress’ 2021 approval of the Air Force’s plan to retire its Block 20 and 30 Global Hawks the program arranged to receive those aircraft as well. Last October TRMC accepted four Block 20 Global Hawks from the Air Force and expects to complete the transfer of 20 Block 30 systems by the end of this month.

Northrop Grumman which built the Global Hawk will perform the conversions and TRMC is in the process of negotiating how many aircraft will be delivered in the first batch. The plan is for the initial Range Hawks to be ready to support testing in 2024.

It takes at least several months to retrofit a single aircraft Rumford said starting with a full system overhaul to ensure the system is up to date on maintenance. The conversion itself is largely focused on readying the RQ-4 to perform a new mission in which it looks up at the targets it is tracking rather than down as it was originally designed. This involves repositioning onboard avionics and installing new sensors and instrumentation suites that can track a hypersonic vehicle flying overhead. Rumford noted that TRMC has a separate contract with instrumentation providers to perform those installations.

Beyond the initial Block 20 and 30 Global Hawks the program is tracking the Air Force’s plans to retire its Block 40 RQ-4s in 2027 which could present an opportunity to grow the Range Hawk fleet by nine aircraft. Rumford said TRMC is also looking to take in some retired MQ-9 Reapers which can carry instrumented pods to provide telemetry and flight safety support. The team is working with General Atomics the MQ-9 manufacturer to explore the optimal ways to outfit the Reaper for SkyRange.

Can satellites be used for hypersonic testing?

The program is also in the early phases of studying how satellites could be used to support hypersonic testing Rumford said. Over the next few years TRMC and the office of the principal director for hypersonics will work with the Space Development Agency the Space Force and the Army to prototype the concept exploring how to better leverage space assets for the SkyRange mission.

“That will be a game changer” Rumford said. “We’ll see what the study shows but the real question is how many systems are we going to have to be able to support testing and what’s the density going to be?”

Another question is whether the program would have its own dedicated satellite constellation or be dependent on an existing fleet. The answer will need to balance availability concerns with the cost of a standalone system he said.

Rumford said he expects the team to develop a strategy for satellite support by 2025 with several experiments and prototyping efforts planned between now and then.

“Sometimes when people think study they just think it’s all a paper exercise” he said. “But I’ve tasked them to demonstrate that actual hardware can be developed and engineered and proven to help inform this decision.”

The firm’s Mission Extension Vehicles (MEVs) have been docked with Intelsat’s 901 and 10-02 communications satellites since 2020 and 2021 respectively.

Going forward SpaceLogistics plans to launch a more advanced robotic vehicle to refuel and repair satellites without being attached to a single client for years at a time. The company envisions leveraging robotic servicing technology to manufacture satellites in space eventually.

However there’s a cloud hanging over the industry in the form of geopolitical tensions over the use of anti-satellite weapons and a lack of clear rules on what constitutes threatening behavior in space in contrast to peaceful commercial activities.

Companies that are going to be operating robotic vehicles in orbit want transparency so that “everybody knows you’re on the commercial side of that curve” SpaceLogistics vice president Joe Anderson said Aug. 24 at a space policy conference.

“We have to work together to help establish norms” he said.

A key problem for the satellite-servicing industry is that major space powers can’t agree on a definition of a space weapon.

In a draft treaty proposed in 2008 China and Russia define a weapon in space as an object that can damage destroy or disrupt the normal functioning of a spacecraft. But the United States is not on board with that language said Eric Desautels acting deputy assistant secretary of state for arms control verification and compliance.

“The ‘damage and destroy’ part you can kind of understand” but saying that a system that disrupts operations is a weapon would essentially put servicing vehicles in that category he said.

“You could make an argument that an on-orbit servicer or an active debris removal payload would be able to disrupt something in space” Desautels said. “So really this challenge is figuring out how to not constrain all of these commercial entities the dual use capabilities. Because I think that is something that could clearly happen if we were to go down the path of the current draft.”

Such dual-use concerns are not new. The Soviet Union regarded NASA’s space shuttle fleet as potential anti-satellite weapons because the shuttles could change orbital planes and grapple satellites with astronauts and robotic arms.

With the advent of commercial in-orbit servicing and orbital debris removal ventures the United States and a growing number of spacefaring countries are hashing out these issues with fresh urgency under a United Nations working group focused on reducing space threats through norms. Discussions started this year in Geneva and will continue into 2023 said Desautels.

Satellites with robotic arms or other grappling devices will be hard to categorize he said. An example is the U.K.’s RemoveDebris spacecraft designed to snare a small satellite with a net and use a harpoon to grab it.

In the absence of global rules the satellite servicing industry is developing best practices and standards under CONFERS or Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations. The group has more than 50 member companies from multiple countries.

SpaceLogistics’ dockings with Intelsat were the first between two commercial satellites. Anderson said the company is breaking new ground when it comes to the licensing of these activities.

“We worked closely together with the State Department the Federal Communications Commission and [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to find a way to get through our national licensing process” he said.

The first MEV docking with Intelsat-901 occurred in a graveyard orbit about 300 kilometers above GEO Anderson said. The second occurred in the geostationary orbit while IS-10-02 was in service broadcasting to over 18 million users.

The MEV operations helped CONFERS develop recommended standards for safe in-space servicing he said. The consortium suggests that “servicers should perform initial first-time in-orbit checkout procedures and demonstrations at altitudes that minimize the consequences of mishaps on internationally recognized protected orbital zones.”

Anderson’s point was that the industry is trying to bring to market new types of services that previously haven’t been licensed and for which norms of behavior don’t exist.

These are issues that the industry needs to be solved sooner rather than later said Charity Weeden vice president of global space policy at Astroscale a debris-removal and on-orbit services company currently flying a demonstration mission.

“We need a safe space environment so we can grow our space economy conduct operations peacefully and see everyone thrive” she said. “Uncertainty is bad for investment and for business.”

The event attended by Australian U.S. government and defense officials highlights the continued progress of the MQ-4C Triton program for both the Royal Australian Air Force and U.S. Navy.

“Today marks a significant milestone for Australia and the MQ-4C Triton program” said Tom Jones corporate vice president and president Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems. “As we get ready for final system integration and flight test we are one step closer to delivering this extraordinary maritime awareness capability to Australia.”

Australia is a cooperative program partner in the Triton program and was critical in helping shape the requirements for the system. As partners U.S. and Australian defense forces will be able to share data collected by their respective Tritons a critical ability in one of the world’s most strategically important regions.

“Triton will provide the Royal Australian Air Force with an unprecedented capability to monitor and protect our maritime approaches” said Air Marshal Robert Chipman Chief of the Royal Australian Air Force. “Triton will work alongside the P-8A Poseidon and this unmanned aircraft system will allow us to cover significant areas at longer ranges and has the ability to stay airborne longer than a traditional aircraft.”

Northrop Grumman initiated the build of the first Australian Triton in October 2020 at its production facility in Moss Point Miss. and met another major production milestone in December 2021 when the fuselage and one-piece wing were mated in Palmdale Calif. The aircraft is scheduled for production completion in 2023 and delivery to Australia in 2024.

Northrop Grumman’s family of autonomous HALE systems perform critical wide-area intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and targeting (ISR&T) missions. Today autonomous HALE systems operate across the globe with greater than 24-hour endurance collecting essential ISR&T data over land and sea to enable rapid informed decision-making. In the future these systems will connect the joint force implementing advanced autonomy and artificial intelligence and machine learning while delivering indispensable capabilities with fewer people to provide information at the speed of relevance.

Harris will be based at Foreship’s Seattle offices and take responsibility for driving regional growth in the group’s project management of ship refurbishment focusing on returning demand in the cruise sector and opportunities in the ferry market.

Harris joins Foreship from BC Ferry Services where he oversaw a substantial fleet overhaul and upgrade and developed new quality control processes for fleet capital improvements. Previously as Senior Project Manager Vessel Refurbishment Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings he took responsibility for more than $300 million in NCL vessel drydocks with notable projects including the ‘westernization’ of NCL Joy and the high value NCL Spirit refurbishment.

“This is a significant appointment by Foreship LLC of a leader in the field” said Benjamin Sward President Foreship LLC. “Brendan is one of only a handful of professionals whose experience as a project manager include leading a $100 million-plus cruise refurbishment. He has supported the execution of +50 cruise and ferry dry dock refurbishments.”

The cruise industry lost knowledge and experience as a result of the Covid-19 shutdown as talented staff moved on Sward added. Harris brought “a unique set of skills expertise and insights to Foreship in the U.S. at a critical moment for our clients’ revived and new refurbishment plans”. His experience also takes in more than a decade with Gregg’s Marine Interiors where duties included managing 100+ teams of shipwrights working on a Royal Caribbean Cruise Line revitalization project said Sward.

The new Director will be tasked with strengthening Foreship’s U.S.-based capabilities in the planning and implementation phases of project work. He will consolidate existing links with yards and contractors and optimize the relationship between project management and technical support to enhance the ‘on-call’ services cruise and ferry owners increasingly need. He will also focus on enhancing comprehensive project management support for owners seeking to fast-track ambitious refurbishment programs.

In doing so Harris said he looked forward to working within an organization with which he has become wholly familiar as a customer.

“I’m delighted to join Foreship at a pivotal moment for the industry” he said. “Cruise ship refurbishment is making a comeback and the landscape has changed - especially in the supply chain and in human resources. I’m eager to meet these challenges and work with owners as part of the robust and experienced team that Foreship has built over the last 20 years. I’ve been fortunate to have had their support on major refurbishment projects in the past.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Intuitive technologies that save energy and maximize efficiency are transforming houses into smart homes.

Conserve energy

Degrees of Difference™ program uses residential customers’ Google Nest Honeywell Home or Emerson Sensi home thermostats to help conserve energy when demand is high. Customers are notified when peak energy usage days are expected and asked to reduce their usage. By using less electricity during periods of high demand the program allows customers to reduce their bill through Degrees of Difference bill credits.

In 2021 customers with smart thermostats curbed 67 megawatt hours of electricity usage during periods of high demand. Additionally customers participating in the ‘manual’ program saved an additional 176 megawatt hours across three events during the summer season. Combined that is the equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions avoided by switching 6527 incandescent lamps to LEDs.

Maximize efficiency

Through simple voice control Google Nest Hub offers the option to manage thermostats and lighting to maximize home energy efficiency. An additional dual fuel connected home product helps certain customers manage their gas and electricity use.

ASTORIA QUEENS — The owner of a fossil-fuel-powered Astoria energy plant wants to sell the facility to an offshore wind developer following months of controversy over the future of the site.

NRG Energy filed forms with the state on Thursday seeking regulators' approval to sell its peaker plant north of 20th Avenue to Beacon Wind Land LLC the developer of a huge wind energy project being built in the Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles east of Montauk.

The potential sale first reported by POLITICO comes after the state last October rejected NRG's proposal to replace its aging 50-year-old turbine with a natural gas-fired generator.

Advocates and elected officials had long argued that the plant should instead be replaced with a renewable energy source — a demand that the sale would apparently meet.

NRG has always planned to retire its plant by May 2023 to comply with state energy laws. Now under the proposed sale NRG would continue leasing the plant for six months after its closure to help decommission and demolish it before ceding all control to Beacon Wind Land on Oct. 31 2023.

Beacon said it would use the Astoria site as an interconnection between its offshore wind projects and the city's Con Edison grid. NRG has owned the Astoria plant since 1999 when it purchased it from Con Edison according to the company's website.

Some of those who had opposed NRG's prior plan for the Astoria site celebrated news of the potential sale. ""This multi-year long campaign was seen through by an array of ecosocialist organizers"" the Queens chapter of the Democratic Socialists in America said in a tweet. ""Canvasses marches education sessions & more our neighborhood grew this greener future.""",,,,,,,,,

ODU ranked in the top tier of 1500 national higher education institutions evaluated for the 2022-2023 report and placed 156th among public schools.

In addition Old Dominion remained a top performer in advancing social mobility tying for No. 140.

Several ODU academic programs posted strong gains:

Undergraduate business program - No. 144 (up from No. 166 last year)

Undergraduate nursing program - No. 153 (up from No. 183 last year)

Undergraduate computer science program - No. 172 (up from No. 191 last year)

ODU also was ranked No. 150 among undergraduate engineering programs at doctoral institutions.

""The U.S. News and World Report rankings reflect the continuing strength of Old Dominion University's academic programs"" said Austin Agho provost and vice president for academic affairs. ""Further they highlight the tremendous success of our efforts to support underrepresented and low-income students.""

Honors have been plentiful for the University this year.

Five ODU distance-learning programs were named among the best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report in January.

In March Old Dominion earned a Gold ranking as a Military Friendly® School for 2022-2023 from militaryfriendly.com.

In April Old Dominion was recognized as a top-tier institution in the Center for World University Rankings' Global 2000 list.

In May the school was recognized as a global leader for addressing inequality tying for 65th in the world and ranking fifth among U.S. institutions for reducing inequalities in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings for 2022.

In June the University was awarded the No. 1 ranking in Virginia in a new Economic Mobility Index created by the public policy think tank Third Way. That same month the school was named one of the nation's Colleges of Distinction for the 2022-23 academic year.

And this month ODU's online master of business administration program was rated No. 24 in the East Coast and No. 4 in Virginia in the Online MBA Report's 2022 rankings.

What happened?

UNC got out to a 10-5 lead early in the first set thanks to two services aces from first-year libero Maddy May and several Monarch errors during that stretch. UNC went on a 6-2 run during to extend its lead to 19-10 as graduate outside hitter Charley Niego and junior outside hitter Aziah Buckner led the way for the Tar Heels with two kills each during that stretch. The Monarchs made a respectable comeback attempt going on an 8-6 run to end the set but the Tar Heels’ lead was too much to overcome as UNC won the set 25-19.

The second set was tightly contested as neither team took a lead greater than six points. The Tar Heels lost their early momentum by allowing the Monarchs to score six unanswered points and take a 20-14 lead. UNC nearly made a comeback as Aziah Buckner scored five kills after the Monarchs’ 6-0 run to help the Tar Heels trim Old Dominion’s lead to just 23-21. However two costly errors doomed the Tar Heels’ comeback attempt and gave the Monarchs a 25-21 second-set victory.

An all-around team effort helped UNC get out to a seven-point lead early in the third set. The Monarchs quickly chipped away at UNC’s lead until the score was knotted up at 15-15 urging the Tar Heels to take a timeout. The score remained close until UNC went on a 7-2 run with the score tied at 18 to take a 25-20 third-set victory and set themselves up to win the match in a decisive fourth set.

Neither team could separate themselves from the other early in the fourth set as both the Tar Heels and Monarchs were incapable of taking more than a four-point lead until about midway through the set. Despite committing three errors after taking the 21-15 advantage the Tar Heels were able to hold onto their lead and take a decisive 25-19 fourth-set victory winning the match 3-1.

Who stood out?

Outside hitters Buckner and Niego made their presence felt in this match as Buckner registered a game-high 18 kills and Niego tallied 16. Buckner and Niego also contributed seven and ten digs respectively in the Tar Heels’ winning effort over the Monarchs.

Libero May also had a significant impact on the outcome of this match committing a game-high 18 digs while also contributing four service aces.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRraWNrLmNvbS9tZWRpYS1hbmFseXNpcy92aXJnaW5pYS1mb290YmFsbC1yZXZlcnNlcy1sdWRpY3JvdXMtYmFuLWFsbG93cy1vZHVzLWFkb3JhYmxlLXNlcnZpY2UtcHVwcHktdG8tYmUtb24tc2lkZWxpbmUtdGhpcy13ZWVrZW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UVA Football Overturns Absurd Ban Allows Old Dominion To Bring Puppy,"Don't worry Hudson the puppy will be on the sideline for Old Dominion football this weekend. The University of Virginia has changed its rules to allow him to be in attendance after public outcry against the school's ludicrous ban.

Hudson who has quickly become the Monarchs' unofficial mascot is a service-dog-in-training. He is part of the two-year-long 'Mutts with a Mission' program and couldn't be cuter.

Puppies are placed in a caregiver's home for 18 months before returning to the organization for an additional six. From there once the training is complete the dogs are permanently placed with disabled veterans first responders and law enforcement for no cost to the recipient.

ODU head coach Ricky Rahne and his family joined the program and are currently housing Hudson. In turn to some extent the entire program is responsible for the yellow lab pup. He has quickly become part of the family part of the team and part of the university as a whole.

Old Dominion football's support dog Hudson is incredibly well-behaved

Hudson was at Virginia Tech when Old Dominion pulled the Week 1 upset.

He was also on the field at East Carolina last weekend.

Everywhere that Hudson has gone he has been on his best behavior. The young pup even got to go onboard two U.S. military ships at the Naval station in Norfolk without issue.

However until Friday afternoon Hudson was not going to be allowed to travel with the team this weekend. Virginia football has a ridiculous rule in place that bans service animals who are still in training from the sidelines.

Or at least it had a rule in place. The ban is no longer.

On Friday afternoon the official Twitter account for UVA's service dog Champ extended an invitation for a playdate.

The school then followed-up to confirm that Hudson will be allowed at the game.

The Monarchs already left for Charlottesville without Hudson but — NOT TO WORRY! — he will make the two-and-a-half hour drive before kickoff on Saturday. Credentials are in the works and Old Dominion's unofficial mascot will be in attendance for the game.

This is great news! Virginia's rule never made any sense but it is now a thing of the past.

Hudson will be on the sideline and will try to lead the Monarchs to victory!"

The new XM Benchmarks are powered by organic feedback from Qualtrics’ nearly 17000 customers spanning dozens of industries around the globe in addition to targeted panel data from surveys.

According to Qualtrics many organisations have a wealth of customer and employee experience data from surveys support conversations chat and social media posts but lack the ability to use it to decide what to prioritise and what actions to take. Using these benchmarks organisations can compare their customers’ satisfaction patients’ perceptions and employees’ engagement against their industry peers and competitors in order to uncover their biggest risks and opportunities and make the right decisions to address them.

Qualtrics Employee Experience (EX) benchmark data shows shifting employee expectations. For example Qualtrics’ EX benchmark data demonstrate changes in employees’ satisfaction with pay and benefits – a major driver for their intent to stay with a company. Qualtrics’ proprietary data shows that the share of employees who felt they were paid fairly for the work they did decline in the U.S. (from 58% to 56%) UK (from 51% to 49%) and Australia (from 61% to 57%) between 2020 and 2021. Similarly in 2020 63% of employees believed their companies offered competitive benefits packages but that number fell to 57% globally in 2021. The drop-off was particularly steep in Australia (from 58% to 51%) and the UK (from 57% to 48%).

A company using the EX benchmarks can compare these results to their own employees’ responses globally and within their industry and identify risks to retention in various parts of the world.

Brad Anderson Qualtrics’ president of products and engineering noted that amidst inflation spending cuts and a tight labour market organisations must find ways to differentiate themselves from competitors and keep employees engaged and productive.

“Qualtrics has more experience benchmark data within our XM Platform than any other company. The insights our platform delivers allow our customers to identify performance gaps opportunities and best practices across industries and geographies and take action – all within the XM Platform” said Anderson.

Moreover Qualtrics’ new Employee Engagement Benchmarks are composed of data from over 250 science-based questions including EX25 to measure the 25 key drivers of every employee’s experience including work-life balance respect and collaboration. The benchmarks also include data for Qualtrics’ validated DEI solution and the Wellbeing solution enabling companies to attain or maintain a diverse workforce and inclusive culture and make improvements that impact employee well-being. And lastly the new Employee Technology Experience (ETX) Benchmark offers organisations comprehensive benchmarking of their entire technology experience including speed reliability change management knowledge management and other aspects of IT.

Meanwhile the CX Agent Performance Index Benchmark uses three key attributes namely friendliness knowledge and understanding to help organisations compare their customer care agent performance against competitors and peers based on operational characteristics including contact centre size support team size CRM system industry or country. While the CX Support CSAT Benchmark allows customer care teams to compare their overall satisfaction scores and support performance against competitors and peers based on operational characteristics like contact centre size support team size CRM system industry or country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcG9zdC5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2FydGljbGUvMzc3Nzg1L21pbmRzaGFyZS1ncm91cG0tdG9wLW5ldy1iaXotY2hhcnRzLWZvci10aGUtZmlyc3QuaHRtbD9lZGl0aW9uPdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mindshare GroupM Top New Biz Charts For The First Half Of 2022 09/16/2022,"by Steve McClellan @mp_mcclellan September 15 2022

Mindshare was the top global media agency in business development for the first half of 2022 according to agency research firm COMvergence.

The GroupM agency accrued net new business assignments with total media expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion. The net figures include successfully defended accounts and deduct lost business. About three-quarters of Mindshare’s total (or $900 million) came from successfully defending business from key clients such as Master Kong and Dyson in China and Ferrero in the US.

Sibling agency Wavemaker ranked second with $903 million in accrued billings primarily due to the global wins of Audible and Danone.

Dentsu X ranked third helped by strong new business wins in the US including Heineken and JCPenney. Omnicom’s PHD and Publicis Groupe’s Starcom rounded out the top-5 with wins and retentions totalling $808 million and $540 million respectively.

The AMTC provides an income tax credit of 25% for qualified investments in eligible advanced manufacturing facilities.

Since the new tax credit applies to buildings and their structural components a cost segregation study could be an important part of your AMTC strategy.

The U.S. semiconductor industry received a large boost recently with passage of the CHIPS Act signed into law on August 9 2022. Aimed at spurring domestic semiconductor research and production the bill contains a number of incentives including the new advanced manufacturing tax credit (AMTC) under Section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code.

The AMTC provides an income tax credit of 25% for qualified investments in advanced manufacturing facilities placed in service after December 31 2022. The new law also allows for a direct pay option which essentially makes the credit refundable.

Consider assessing the credit in conjunction with a cost segregation study which is designed to identify all eligible assets and costs. This planning strategy may provide your organization with enhanced benefits in the form of both accelerated depreciation and the new AMTC.

Review these key terms and concepts to get started.

What investments qualify for the AMTC?

A qualified investment means the basis of qualified property placed in service by an eligible taxpayer which is part of an advanced manufacturing facility.

Qualified property generally means tangible property integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility that is (i) constructed reconstructed or erected by the taxpayer or (ii) acquired by the taxpayer if the original use of such property commences with the taxpayer.

Qualified property includes buildings and their structural components that meet the requirements above. However portions of a building used for offices administrative services or other functions unrelated to manufacturing do not qualify for the credit.

Under this broad definition a multitude of assets can qualify for the AMTC including new equipment purchased for semiconductor manufacturing as well as the construction expansion or renovation of the facilities in which the manufacturing activities occur.

What is a qualified facility?

An advanced manufacturing facility is a facility the primary purpose of which is the manufacturing of semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

In other words the credit applies not only if your organization is engaged directly in semiconductor fabrication but also if you manufacture equipment for such fabrication. This may provide opportunities for manufacturers across a wide spectrum including downstream suppliers whose products are built primarily for integration into larger pieces of semiconductor equipment.

What is an eligible taxpayer?

An eligible taxpayer is one that is not a foreign entity of concern (as defined in Section 9901(6) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021) and has not engaged in an applicable transaction during the taxable year. An applicable transaction means one involving the material expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the People's Republic of China or a foreign country of concern.

How is the AMTC claimed?

The AMTC can be claimed directly against federal income tax if your organization has sufficient tax liability to absorb it. However Section 48D also offers an elective direct payment option. In this case you would be treated as having made a payment against your federal income tax equal to the amount of the credit. The election which is irrevocable thus acts as an estimated tax payment that can result in a cash refund of the credit.

In the case of partnerships and S corporations the election must be made at the entity level and the credit will be paid directly to such entity. The payment will then be treated as tax exempt income that is passed through to the partners or S corporation shareholders.

The direct payment election must be made no later than the due date (including extensions) of the entity’s income tax return for the year for which the election is made. However in no event can the election be made earlier than 270 days after the date of enactment of Section 48D (August 9 2022). The IRS must still set forth specifics in connection with the manner of the election.

How long is the AMTC available?

The AMTC applies to qualified property placed in service after December 31 2022 the construction of which begins prior to January 1 2027. For construction beginning prior to January 1 2023 the credit is available only to the extent of the basis attributable to the construction reconstruction or erection incurred after August 9 2022. Thus it will be important to identify the date construction begins when claiming the AMTC — and such a determination may not be straightforward. Consider the type and extent of the work performed to establish when construction commences for this purpose.

How does the AMTC affect basis?

When the AMTC is claimed you must reduce the basis of the qualified property by the amount of the credit — the basis reduction applies whether the credit is used against tax or received as a direct payment.

How does recapture apply to the AMTC?

If you dispose of qualified property within one full year after it is placed in service 100% of the AMTC must be recaptured. The recapture percentage is reduced by 20% for each subsequent year beginning in year two. Also 100% of the credit must be recaptured when the taxpayer engages in an applicable transaction (as described above) within 10 years of the property being placed in service.

Why should a cost segregation study be performed?

Cost segregation is a tax planning strategy whereby buildings are broken down into their constituent parts to identify items of real and personal property eligible for accelerated depreciation lives (typically 5 7 or 15 years). In many instances the assets may also be eligible for bonus depreciation which is currently 100% through the end of 2022 — thereafter the bonus percentage phases down 20% each year.

Manufacturing facilities tend to generate substantial benefits through a cost segregation study in large part due to the opportunity to segregate mechanical electrical and piping assets that are dedicated to operating manufacturing equipment. This requires a detailed engineering analysis of each asset and its function on a standalone basis and as part of an integrated system.

Since Section 48D applies to buildings and their structural components a cost segregation study should be part of your AMTC strategy. Even with the required basis reduction under Section 48D cost segregation can generate valuable accelerated depreciation while also identifying qualified property for the AMTC. Additionally a cost segregation study can help in determining when construction commenced for purposes of determining AMTC eligibility.

Over 40 delegates from 16 countries joined the conference representing workers of semiconductor producers and their supply chain. This was the first meeting of the semiconductors’ network which will also include the earlier created NXP and ST Microelectronics union networks.

Opening the meeting Christine Olivier IndustriALL assistant general secretary welcomed the participants and pledged IndustriALL’s support to building a global union network in this fast-evolving industrial segment of semiconductors.

“We need to pull all our energy together workers semiconductors multinationals and their supply chain should join together in solidarity to implement strategies that will make trade unions powerful.”

Semiconductor-producing companies are not equally distributed in the world. About 75 percent of semiconductor manufacturing facilities are located in China and East Asia. At the same time over 90 percent of the cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing capacities are located in Taiwan and another 8 percent are in South Korea. This setup of the industry was relatively economically profitable for big players and functioned for many years but contained a lot of risks that could disrupt the entire supply chain.



The inevitable disruptions started after the pandemic and the sharply increased demand for home electronics in time of lockdowns and the restart of the automotive industry. The semiconductors producers could not satisfy the sharply increased demand. The geopolitical tensions further pandemic restrictions in China and the economic slowdown in the main consuming countries of EU North America and China resulted in these governments’ decision to prevent themselves from troubles in the future and develop their own production of semiconductors. Governments announced of generous distribution the investment tax credits and money in the semiconductors industry hoping to achieve leading positions and strong dividends in the future. Close to US$1 trillion in investments were announced just in Europe and US combined. Other important investments in the industry were announced by Japan India China South Korea and Taiwan. These investments were topped by the biggest chipmakers such as TSMC Intel Samsung Micron Texas Instruments and others.



Alejandro González a researcher at the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations SOMO spoke of the social and environmental risks in the semiconductors industry using a lot of water resources as well as hazardous chemicals presents health risks for workers handling them.



Jan Brauburger policy adviser at IndustriAll Europe explained the situation in the European chips industry and current challenges and policies.



The participants of the meeting identified numerous problems and challenges faced by semiconductor workers including poor working conditions discrimination of migrant workers violence harassment and discrimination at work lack of respect for freedom of association union busting lack of information on health hazards including metals and their combination as well as some unresolved ergonomic issues and others.

“This meeting was the first step and we see a clear interest from our affiliates. We will build on previous experience from earlier created networkers of NXP and ST Microelectronics and address the identified challenges in the order of priority. By the next meeting we will finalise the collecting of information on the presence of our affiliates in the semiconductor industry and its supply chain. We will work together on further organising efforts in order to build strong trade unions in this strategic segment of the electronics industry”

said Alexander Ivanou IndustriALL director for ICT Electrical and Electronics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZmlsZS5jb20vcmVwb3J0aW5nLW9waW5pb24vdmlld3BvaW50L25ldy1leHBvcnQtY29udHJvbHMtY2hpbmVzZS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9ycy1tYXktcHJvdmUtc2VsZi1kZWZlYXRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Export Controls on Chinese Semiconductors May Prove Self-Defeating,"In July news broke that China had made a two-generation leap in semiconductor development despite U.S. export controls on advanced chipmaking technology. According to Tech Insights Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) the leading Chinese chipmaker was able to produce 7-nanometer (nm) semiconductors using tools designed to fabricate chips at the 14nm node and above.

This development has unsettled observers of China’s semiconductor industry who worry that SMIC’s manufacturing capabilities now outstrip those of most American producers and are approaching those of leading global foundries. Although node size is only one variable among many China’s new 7nm chips could enable the production of more advanced electronics including everything from supercomputers to state-of-the-art military equipment. In the weeks following the release of Tech Insights’ report the Department of Commerce notified all U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturers that it would widen export bans on gear used to make anything smaller than 14nm chips including tools that enabled SMIC’s breakthrough; it appears that Washington is shifting from a strategy of slowing down China’s future tech development to degrading its existing capabilities.

But these new restrictions are not only likely unnecessary they may ultimately prove self-defeating. Overly zealous controls that limit older semiconductor equipment sales to China will inflict collateral damage on American and potentially international semiconductor firms and may not significantly damage Chinese firms’ ability to innovate. So rather than enacting blanket bans on existing chipmaking technologies the United States should focus on pushing the technological frontier forward.

The calls for more stringent export controls fail to address a core reality: that SMIC’s achievement may not be quite as momentous as it seems. Some analysts have hailed the 7nm chip as a breakthrough for China’s semiconductor industry. Instead it points toward Beijing’s continued inability to achieve self-sufficiency in a highly specialized and globalized industry. Questions remain about the new chips’ yield memory capacity and energy efficiency as well as whether the company can manufacture them at scale. This is largely because SMIC was forced to use suboptimal manufacturing techniques with decades-old deep ultraviolet (DUV) manufacturing equipment. In short not all 7nm chips are created equal.

Why must SMIC rely on outdated DUV technology? Because the United States already has in place export controls on the most advanced chipmaking tools. That is: existing U.S. export controls appear to be working. SMIC’s latest “breakthrough” may very well be its last.

More broadly while Chinese companies increase their chip production they remain unable to compete with the Taiwanese South Korean and American companies that produce most of the world’s cutting-edge semiconductors. This is because due to effective export controls China lacks the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography software and equipment that have fueled the latest leaps in chip technology. Beijing has some advanced technical know-how but it does not have enough of the best design and manufacturing tools to become globally competitive. Increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress the Chinese government has launched investigations of several officials at the “Big Fund” a state-led venture capital fund tasked with driving semiconductor innovation.

Despite the limitations of Beijing’s chip industry Washington has responded to China’s chipmaking ambitions with increasing alarm. In 2018 Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) mandating that the Department of Commerce identify and control “emerging and other types of critical technologies” that “are essential to the national security of the United States.” Since then export controls on chips and chipmaking technology have broadened. Between 2018 and 2022 the number of Chinese companies on the Commerce Department’s entity list—a group of end-users to whom exporters must first obtain a license to sell controlled technology—quadrupled to nearly 600. The number of export licenses rejected by the Bureau of Industry and Security also rose from 177 to 526 between 2020 and 2021.

Recently the U.S. Department of Commerce has gone one step further by notifying U.S. semiconductor equipment makers that it would restrict the sale of tools used to manufacture sub-14nm chips. Under one proposal Commerce would limit exports of chipmaking tools to Chinese foundries that make chips under 14nm while allowing exports to less advanced production facilities even those operated by the same parent company. Some Republican Congressmembers have argued that these restrictions should apply to exports to all foundries in China. In practice Commerce has already declined licenses at the 14nm level on a case-by-case basis but the institutionalization of sub-14nm controls would represent a major escalation in the U.S. export control regime.

Yet given Beijing’s continued inability to compete with the most cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturers dialing up the bans in the wake of SMIC’s 7nm “breakthrough” is not sound policy. Selective protection of U.S. technology is necessary for the most advanced chipmaking technology but broad bans on older technology may do more to hurt U.S. semiconductor firms than to protect U.S. national security.

This is because China is the largest market for semiconductor equipment providing revenue streams for American companies to pile their profits into the R&D that fuels innovation. Estimates suggest that the prospective ban on sub-14nm manufacturing equipment to China could impact 25-30 percent of Applied Materials’ sales a top U.S.-based manufacturer of chipmaking equipment. Historically chipmakers have cut back on R&D spending during periods of declining revenue.

Second due to the globalized nature of the semiconductor industry the United States will need to bring allies and partners on board before implementing more expansive controls. Otherwise U.S. companies will be unable to sell to their largest market while China continues to buy the tools it needs from other foreign suppliers. Coaxing South Korea Japan and the Netherlands into accepting new U.S. controls may prove difficult as their semiconductor equipment manufacturers would lose billions in sales. If pushed too far leading chipmakers could decide to establish new foundries without American technology to skirt expansive U.S. controls.

Whatever the configuration of export controls however Washington should expect that China will maintain its long-standing emphasis on indigenous innovation. During a famous speech to the Chinese State Council in 1958 Mao Zedong declared that the total trade embargo imposed by the United States during the Korean War had forced Beijing “to work out all the solutions” on its own. Over the course of the country’s modern development China has been surprisingly good at achieving technological advances without foreign help.

Both official policy and geopolitical realities have shaped China’s drive toward technological “self-reliance.” Despite being cut off from Soviet missile and nuclear technology in the 1960s Beijing succeeded in developing both sectors indigenously and now produces some of the world’s most advanced missiles. The country’s space capabilities also improved after the United States ceased cooperating with the Chinese space industry in the 1990s. More recently Beijing has marshaled its impressive industrial resources to make advances in AI 5G and energy storage among other technologies.

For this reason one theory holds that U.S. export controls could spur a breakthrough in China’s semiconductor industry. But thus far Beijing’s experience with semiconductor development has followed a different pattern. In 2015 the State Council set out to supply at least 70 percent of China’s demand for chips with domestic production by 2025. China has tried to wean itself from reliance on foreign products by pouring subsidies into chip research design and production pilfering industrial secrets and recruiting elite international talent. Yet despite investing billions in the semiconductor industry China controls less than one percent of electronic design software and semiconductor tools and materials.

All of this means that the U.S. should stop wasting its time on restricting the export of older less critical technologies. Instead Washington should focus on pushing the technological frontier forward. The recently passed CHIPS and Science Act is a step in the right direction but its investment in domestic human capital is insufficient; the bill only set aside U.S.$200 million for semiconductor workforce training in the United States. China’s ability to attract foreign talent on the other hand including top engineers from foreign tech firms has been an ignored yet crucial component of the limited innovations it has made. The United States for its part has benefited greatly from attracting leading global science and technology talent. Export controls alone do little to push forward human capital development in the United States nor do they hamstring China’s access to international talent.

A better approach would be to maintain the “small yard high fence” approach that commentators and experts have been touting for several years. Washington should focus on protecting only the most advanced dual-use technologies with airtight multilateral controls while allowing other forms of trade and commerce that benefit the U.S. tech ecosystem. As it stands the Biden administration is set to carry forward U.S.-China decoupling on a larger scale than did Trump with potentially deleterious effects on the innovative capacity of domestic chip producers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc3RvY2tzLWJyYWNlLWZvci1jaGlwLWN5Y2xlLWRvd250dXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor Stocks Brace For Chip Cycle Downturn,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/news/technology/semiconductor-stocks-brace-for-chip-cycle-downturn/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc3RvY2tzLWJyYWNlLWZvci1jaGlwLWN5Y2xlLWRvd250dXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS92ZWRhbnRhLWNsYXJpZmllcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctdG8tYmUtZG9uZS1ieS11bHRpbWF0ZS1ob2xkaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktdm9sY2FuL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0MjI2OTY0LmNtc9IBnwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS92ZWRhbnRhLWNsYXJpZmllcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctdG8tYmUtZG9uZS1ieS11bHRpbWF0ZS1ob2xkaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktdm9sY2FuL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDIyNjk2NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vedanta clarifies semiconductor manufacturing to be done by holding company Volcan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS92ZWRhbnRhLWNsYXJpZmllcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctdG8tYmUtZG9uZS1ieS11bHRpbWF0ZS1ob2xkaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktdm9sY2FuL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0MjI2OTY0LmNtc9IBnwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS92ZWRhbnRhLWNsYXJpZmllcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctdG8tYmUtZG9uZS1ieS11bHRpbWF0ZS1ob2xkaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktdm9sY2FuL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDIyNjk2NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239516A3A90>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Anybody who isn’t angry should be terrified because you are the top 1 tenth of 1%.

Don’t believe me? Just ask the rich French and Russians for this is how their revolutions started and it didn’t end well for the rich.

We are in New York tonight and the big story here is the most expensive home in the country just went on the market. It’s on the billionaires’ row overlooking Central Park and will set you back a cool $250 million — for reference that is about 1100 times more than the average American house.

We’ll get to some of the additional record-setting house sales just this year in a minute. But while the rich get richer and literally move up the ladder to the 130th floor middle class Americans not the poor not the working class but everybody minus the super rich take it on the chin.

You want proof? The same week of the world’s most expensive house going up for sale the Dow had its biggest one day drop in two years — that evaporates our savings pensions 401ks. Everything.

Inflation hit another high. Food costs at home are up 13.5% in past year the largest increase since 1979. Rent is up 6.7% in past year the highest since 1986. Electricity is up 15.8% largest since 1981. Health insurance is up 24.3% the largest ever increase.

The inflation that has already occurred will cost the average American household $8616 over the next 12 months.

So if you are on a fixed income this year crushed you.

Mortgage rates are now at 6% compared to nearly 3% a year ago. The average American home costs $400 more every month than it did this time last year. If you’re doing the math that’s an additional $5000 per year.

Yet on the same week the most expensive house in the world went on the market for $250 million.

The billionaires are buying more and more expensive houses.

Brooklyn nets owner Joseph Tsai bought his $188 million home in New York City earlier this year. Last year venture capitalist Marc Andreessen bought a Malibu property for $177 million. This spring Oracle Corporation co- founder Larry Ellison bought a mansion in Palm Beach for $173 million.

And the middle class and working class in America is getting poorer by the day. This is a fundamental reversal of the original bargain we had. Even in 2008 the rich guys got crushed. Now during the pandemic the little guy gets crushed and the big guys get even richer.

Billionaires in this country made nearly $2 trillion dollars between March of 2020 and May of this year. That’s $2 billion dollars a day and $25000 a second.

Here are just a few examples: Elon musk’s net worth rose $230 billion. Jeff Bezos is now worth an extra $37 billion. Bill Gates’ wealth rose $31 billion.

John Kennedy who came from one of America’s richest families understood this can’t work.

“If a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich” Kennedy said in 1961.

America was built on the idea of fundamentally fair play and people didn’t mind guys getting rich. If they did well then you have a chance. If Sam Walton can do it so can my kid. Now people rightfully believe they don’t have a chance and the deck is stacked against them and its worse for their kids.

Right now only 30% of Americans believe in the American dream. That’s awful.

The dream is what binds us together. The dream is what we all believe in until we don’t.

America never had a class problem. We were born free of the European entrenched aristocracy. I didn’t come up with that idea someone smarter than me did. But it’s true. America was exceptionally free and Americans were exceptionally free to go from the broom closet to the castle.

It was fair. Fairness too is a uniquely American idea.

Now not so much. It’s not fair anymore. It’s about class now and that is a dangerous thing. We have an aristocracy their wealth will last until the end of time.

History tells us when a country divides on class things don’t end well. Just think about the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution.

Stocks All Crashed Today,"Paper companies look cheap -- and as it turns out there's a reason for that.

What happened

There was a sell-off in cardboard packaging stocks this morning with shares of International Paper (IP -3.16%) down 9.4% at 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday Packaging Corporation of America (PKG -0.54%) shares down 9.7% and the stock of WestRock (WRK -0.12%) down 9.8%.

So what

Shares of FedEx (FDX 1.40%) plunged more than 22% this morning after the company issued an earnings warning predicated on softening global volume. The volume FedEx referred to was the number of packages wrapped in cardboard and shipped to customers. And if that volume is down then it makes sense that the demand for cardboard around the world might be falling as well.

Investment bank Jefferies cut its ratings on each of the three paper stocks this morning. International Paper and Packaging Corp. both suffered actual downgrades to underperform (sell) with price targets set at $31 and $112 respectively. WestRock barely dodged the downgrade bullet being left at hold but its price target was cut 7% to $42 per share according to a report from The Fly this morning. And that's not even the bad news.

In announcing its downgrades Jefferies didn't say its decision was based exclusively (or even primarily) on FedEx's earnings warning but rather warned that there's a ""massive inventory glut"" in cardboard.

Orders for cardboard packaging are slowing down sharply the analyst says. Manufacturers like International Paper Packaging Corp. and WestRock are likely to slash prices in the fourth quarter. And because new cardboard manufacturing capacity is still coming on line Jefferies expects this situation to get worse in 2023.

Now what

That's miserable news for the paper companies and for investors who are still expecting paper profits to surge this year. Expectations are for 2022 earnings growth of 10% at International Paper 18% at WestRock and 30% at Packaging Corp. according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence with at worst modest retreats in profitability in 2023.

At present we don't know exactly how bad the damage might get only that Jefferies is expecting it to get really bad. But there's good news here too.

All three of these stocks still trade at rather modest valuations: just 11 times trailing earnings for WestRock 11.2 times for International Paper and 12.2 for Packaging Corp. And all three pay very respectable above-market dividend yields. International Paper the most recognizable name of the three has nearly the lowest P/E ratio and by far the greatest dividend yield at 4.7%.

But if I were in the market for a cardboard company and interested in taking advantage of today's sell-off to buy just one stock I think I'd go with Packaging Corporation of America. At 12.2 times earnings it's more expensive than the others but its 3.8% dividend yield is more than generous. And if hard times are coming Packaging Corp.'s $2 billion net debt load is the smallest and the easiest to manage giving it the best chance of emerging from this downturn unscathed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvc3RvY2tzLW1ha2luZy10aGUtYmlnZ2VzdC1tb3Zlcy1wcmVtYXJrZXQtZmVkZXgtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1wYXBlci11YmVyLWFuZC1tb3JlLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9zdG9ja3MtbWFraW5nLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LW1vdmVzLXByZW1hcmtldC1mZWRleC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXBhcGVyLXViZXItYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: FedEx International Paper Uber and more,"Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:

FedEx (FDX) – FedEx tumbled 20.3% in premarket trading after issuing a profit warning due to declining package delivery volumes around the world. The news has exacerbated fears of a slowing global economy weighing on shares of other logistics companies like United Parcel Service (UPS) down 6.8% and XPO Logistics (XPO) down 4.2%.

International Paper (IP) – The packaging and paper products company was downgraded to ""underperform"" from ""hold"" at Jefferies which pointed to decelerating orders and an inventory glut in the industry. For similar reasons Jefferies cut Packaging Corporation of America (PKG) to ""underperform"" from ""hold"" and cut earnings estimates for WestRock (WRK). Sentiment surrounding the packaging companies is also being hit by the FedEx profit warning. International Paper slid 4.6% in premarket action Packaging Corp. dropped 4.3% and WestRock lost 2.3%.

Uber Technologies (UBER) – Uber said it was investigating a cybersecurity incident after a hacker claimed access was gained to the ride-sharing company's computer systems. Uber fell 4% in the premarket.

AstraZeneca (AZN) – AstraZeneca gained 1.6% in premarket trading after the drug maker received EU approval for its Covid-19 antibody cocktail.

General Electric (GE) – GE slid 4.5% in the premarket after Chief Financial Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe told an investment conference that supply chain issues are still affecting the company's ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner. As a result the company's cash flow remains under pressure.

NCR (NCR) – NCR plunged 15.8% in premarket action after announcing plans to separate into two separate publicly traded companies. One company will focus on digital commerce the other on NCR's flagship ATM business.

Extra Space Storage (EXR) – The operator of self-storage properties announced a deal worth $590 million to acquire rival Storage Express. Extra Space Storage rose 2.9% in the premarket.

Alcoa (AA) – Alcoa gained 1.1% in premarket trading after Morgan Stanley upgraded the aluminum producer to ""overweight"" from ""equal-weight"". Morgan Stanley is cautious about the mining sector despite strong balance sheets and cheap valuations but sees ""deep value"" opportunities in Alcoa and some others.",,,,,,,,,

Palo Alto has reached a proposed settlement with resident Miriam Green who sued the city for its historic practice of transferring funds from its gas utility to the general fund. Embarcadero Media file photo.

The city of Palo Alto would issue refunds totaling $17 million to its gas customers under a proposed settlement with Miriam Green a resident who sued the city over its historic practice of transferring funds from its municipal utility to pay for basic city services.

Attorneys for both sides in the lawsuit filed last week a joint motion for “stipulated reversal” which would conclude the yearslong legal battle over gas transfers and which would require Palo Alto to refund funds to its gas customers. The agreement will need to be formally approved by the 6th District Court of Appeal and then the Santa Clara County Superior Court before it’s official. Provided that happens the deal would bring to a conclusion one of the most complex lawsuits in the city’s recent history one that has prompted extensive debate about appropriate use of utility rates and that has spurred the City Council to place a measure on this year’s ballot to address this issue.

Under the agreement which was reached through mediation Palo Alto would issue the refunds in on-bill credits over three installments over the next 24 months. The first installment would be due after the final settlement order becomes official the second one 12 months later and the final one 24 months after the order takes effect.

Former customers would be able to receive their refunds by check and customers over the age of 65 will be able to request the refund in a lump sum rather than through on-bill credits under the proposed settlement.

The settlement follows six years of litigation a judgment against the city and appeals by both parties. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Brian Walsh contended in his 2020 ruling that the city’s transfer of funds from its gas utility to its general fund constituted an illegal tax and violated Proposition 26 which limits utility rates to the “reasonable cost” of providing service. The city’s transfers the court found exceeded this reasonable cost and thus constituted an illegal tax under state law.

The two sides were also in dispute over the manner in which the refunds should be issued with the city offering to do so through bill credits and Green’s attorneys calling for checks that would be issued over two installments.

In its appeal last year attorneys representing Palo Alto pointed to the City Charter which includes language that voters approved in 1950 authorizing the city to use utility revenues to pay for all costs associated with the utility and pay the remainder into the general fund which finances basic services such as public safety parks and libraries. Superior Court Judge Sunil Kulkarni rejected that argument in September 2021 and suggested that voters in 1950 likely did not know whether they were approving a fee or a tax.

As the complex case moved to the California 6th District Court of Appeal the two sides entered into the court’s mediation program. Over discussions facilitated by mediator Bob Blum they entered into an agreement that they say would lead to faster resolution and obviate further appeals to the state’s highest court.

“This Court’s order reversing and remanding for further proceedings consistent with the parties’ settlement agreement would allow the trial court to consider the settlement order the parties to give notice of the settlement terms to the class and enable the City to provide relief to the class more quickly than if the parties litigated this appeal and likely sought Supreme Court review of the novel issues this case presents” the joint motion states.

City Attorney Molly Stump said that if the settlement is approved the current Green lawsuit would be resolved. However the two sides remain in disagreement over one issue: The rent that the city charges its gas and electric utilities for use of general fund assets. It’s possible that that issue would be subject to future litigation she said.

She said it will likely take months for the two courts to finalize the settlement.

“The Court of Appeals now has to make a decision on whether they will advance this and send it back to the trial court with specific instructions to implement the settlement” Stump said.

The city maintains in the settlement agreement that it has not violated any laws or that there is “any basis for liability for any of the claims that have been are or might have been alleged in the Litigation.”

“Nonetheless Respondent has concluded that it is desirable that the Litigation be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement” the settlement states.

Stump noted that because the Green lawsuit and settlement pertains to gas rates paid in the past it will not have an impact on Measure L a November measure that would reaffirm the city’s historic practice of transferring funds from the gas utility to the general fund.

The measure would authorize the city to transfer no more than 18% of the gas utility’s gross revenues to the general fund which comes out to about $7 million per year. According to the measure funds would support general services such as roads parks libraries climate change reduction and public safety services.

The class action settlement agreement signed by Green City Manager Ed Shikada and attorneys for both sides notes that the settlement represents “the compromise of highly contested issues.” Both parties “continue to believe that they can and will prevail on their respective appeals.”

“On the other hand the Parties acknowledge that a judgment has been entered and they have considered the risks and potential costs of continued litigation of the Consolidated Action and litigation of the Tolled Claims on the one hand and the benefits of the proposed settlement on the other hand and desire to settle the entire Litigation upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement” the settlement agreement states.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2Nyb3dkc3RyaWtlLXBsYW5zLWJlY29tZS1nZW5lcmF0aW9uYWwtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How CrowdStrike plans to become a generational platform,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2Nyb3dkc3RyaWtlLXBsYW5zLWJlY29tZS1nZW5lcmF0aW9uYWwtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395240A8C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

By Charlene Badasie |

In the realm of streaming wars Paramount+ and Showtime have struggled to compete with giants like Disney+ Netflix and HBO Max. Now to expand its offering Paramount Global has decided to merge its strengths by combining both services into one app. The news follows last year’s move to unify the billing of both streaming platforms with significant discounts as the parent company wanted to give the service an extra boost. New subscribers can sign up for the basic ad-supported combo at just $7.99 a month while the commercial-free version will cost $12.99.

Current subscribers can upgrade their existing plan to the bundle within the app Deadline reports. Once the introductory discount ends on October 2nd the basic subscription will cost $11.99 a month with commercials and $14.99 without. Folks who don’t want Paramount+ but are still interested in Showtime will still be able to subscribe for $10.99 a month as a stand-alone offering. That offer also applies through third-party distributors. The reverse is also possible with a slight adjustment to the price. A standalone Paramount+ membership will cost $4.99 a month with ads or $9.99 without them.

However there is one small catch. Live sporting events are not part of the ad-free option although Showtime programming will not carry commercials when viewed via the combined app. Speaking about the app merger President and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Global Streaming Tom Ryan said the Paramount+ and Showtime bundle offers folks unprecedented value by providing a vast streaming content library at some of the lowest prices on the market. “This singular user experience streamlines sign-up and enhances discovery” he told Variety.

Ryan added that the lower price will also allow more households to enjoy the combined entertainment offering from Paramount+ and Showtime. Content on the former currently includes original series like 1883 Halo Star Trek: Discovery and Secret Headquarters. There are also a slew of upcoming originals like Tulsa King On the Come Up Criminal Minds Wolf Pack and 1923 debuting this fall. Meanwhile Showtime’s popular shows include Billions Yellowjackets The Chi and Dexter: New Blood. There’s also new programming like American Gigolo and Let the Right One In premiering soon.

Interestingly Paramount+ subscribers outside the United States already have access to Showtime. The service is offered by default within the international streaming platform. According to Tech Crunch Paramount+ recently launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland with plans to expand into Austria France Germany Italy Switzerland Africa and the Middle East. The streaming service was also launched in South Korea in partnership with TVING. It plans to include India in partnership with Viacom 18. In the second quarter Paramount+ added 4.9 million subscribers reaching 43.3 million overall.

The Paramount+ with Showtime offering comes as Warner Bros Discovery works to combine HBO Max and Discovery+ into a single platform in 2023. But the company has not revealed pricing or packaging details at this time. Meanwhile Disney’s three-way bundle of Disney+ ESPN+ and Hulu has been a major success since its 2020 introduction. While each service remains separate Hulu is expected to migrate to Disney+ once the House of Mouse gains full control in 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdmllZ3VpZGUub3JnL25ld3MtYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGFyYW1vdW50LWNlby10YWxrcy1zdHJlYW1pbmctcGFyYW1vdW50LXByZXBhcmVzLWZvci1kZWJ1dC1vZi10b3AtZ3VuLW1hdmVyaWNrLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paramount CEO Talks Streaming Paramount+ Prepares for Debut of TOP GUN: MAVERICK,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.movieguide.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news-articles/paramount-ceo-talks-streaming-paramount-prepares-for-debut-of-top-gun-maverick.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239501C3E50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdmllZ3VpZGUub3JnL25ld3MtYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGFyYW1vdW50LWNlby10YWxrcy1zdHJlYW1pbmctcGFyYW1vdW50LXByZXBhcmVzLWZvci1kZWJ1dC1vZi10b3AtZ3VuLW1hdmVyaWNrLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYmlvZnVlbHMtbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9ib3N0b24tYmFzZWQtd29ybGQtZW5lcmd5LXRvLWNvbnZlcnQtcmVmaW5lcnktaW50by1zYWYtcGxhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boston-based World Energy to convert refinery into SAF plant,"World Energy plans to convert its existing biodiesel and terminal assets in Houston into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) hub.

This new facility will enable the company to produce another 250 million gallons of SAF annually by 2025.

In April the company announced plans to produce 250 million gallons of SAF annually by 2024 at its Paramount California site.

This latest announcement will double the company’s capacity by 2025 making the low-carbon fuel available to most US and many global markets for the first time.

The move will also get the company more than halfway to meeting its commitment to produce one billion gallons of SAF by 2030 five years ahead of that goal.

World Energy’s current biofuel facilities acquired in 2016 are located on the Houston Ship Channel at mile zero of all major US pipelines with direct deep water access at the heart of the country’s energy production and distribution complex and directly connected to two local international airports.

World Energy CEO Gene Gebolys said: ""Houston is the logical choice for World Energy's Aviation Zero plant two.

“Not only does our positioning here provide unparalleled finished product access but provides tremendous access to global feedstocks emerging sources of low-carbon hydrogen and even access to captured carbon to advance commercialisation of innovative new processes for the production of SAF. We've been operating here in various capacities nearly two decades and we recognize why Houston is the beating heart of America's energy complex.""

The project may well get an additional boost from the recently announced Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the US which offers new tax credits and other financial incentives to makers of SAF.

Jacob Rees-Mogg the business and industrial strategy secretary recently appointed to the post by new Prime Minister Liz Truss cleared the proposed $7.3 billion merger saying the deal did not pose a threat to British national security.

The U.S. communications giant launched its bid to acquire Inmarsat last November. The proposed merger has been awaiting the outcome of a government probe as to whether the deal should be approved under new legislation designed to block mergers that are contrary to the national interest.

That hurdle has now been cleared but the merger still has some approval hurdles to overcome.

The U.K. Competitions and Market Authority launched its own investigation Aug. 9 into whether the deal would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the U.K. for goods or services.

The results of that probe are expected to be announced Oct 5.

“The deal requires a series of regulatory processes which includes reviews by the Competition and Markets Authority and in the European Union. The CMA review is ongoing” said a company spokesperson. “We are working closely with them as they conduct their review and will update the market in due course.”

Both companies already serve the British defense and security market and both are vying for a slice of the Ministry of Defence’s £6 billion ($6.9 billion) Skynet 6 satellite communications program elements of which are already in competition.

Inmarsat is a provider of satellite-based communications services to aviation shipping and government departments including the MoD.

Mark Dankberg Viasat’s executive chairman and CEO said the merger would allow Viasat to deepen its commitment to the British market.

Viasat has pledged to increase job numbers and research spending in Britain if the deal goes ahead.

“Viasat has been a trusted partner of the U.K.’s defense and national security communities for more than a decade including in the provision of its market-leading encryption products. The combined company whose global international business headquarters will be situated in the U.K. will build upon the strong U.K. relationships that Viasat and Inmarsat already enjoy and allow us to deepen our contribution to the U.K.’s National Space Strategy” Dankberg said in a statement.

If the deal goes ahead it will be the third major sale of British defense industrial capabilities to U.S. companies in a matter of months.

Parker Hannifin’s purchase of aerospace and defense company Meggitt and the sale of Ultra Electronics to the U.S.-owned Cobham Group have both been pushed through in the last few months.

Oklahoma Freedom: 90.25 / Texas Rattlers: 83.25

OKLAHOMA CITY – For the second consecutive evening during the inaugural PBR (Professional Bull Riders) Team Series homestand in Oklahoma City the Oklahoma Freedom defeated an opponent via a walk-off 90-point ride. Closer Derek Kolbaba (Walla Walla Washington) again propelled the team to a dramatic win this time a 90.25-83.25 victory against the Texas Rattlers presented by Ariat Saturday night inside Paycom Center. The Freedom have now won six consecutive games and are two wins away from tying the league record of eight consecutive game wins currently held by the Austin Gamblers.

In the leadoff position for bull riding’s version of the Red River Showdown the Rattlers struck in the top of the first as Daniel Keeping (Gorman Texas) covered Big Kiwi (Nothin’ But Try Ranch/’Diggers Bucking Bulls) for 83.25 points. The Freedom were unable answer when Chase Outlaw (Hamburg Arkansas) was tossed to the ground in just 4.09 seconds by Next Question (Nothin’ But Try Ranch/’Diggers Bucking Bulls).



After a scoreless second third and fourth the game intensity reached new heights in the fifth. With the chance to clinch the win early for the Rattlers Cody Jesus (Window Rock Arizona) was awarded a re-ride before he even left the chutes atop Jeremiah (Martinez Bucking Bulls LLC). Head Coach Cody Lambert assigned Jesus to the re-ride draw revealed to be World Champion Bull contender Chiseled (Flinn/D&H Cattle Co.). A familiar opponent Jesus was bucked off by the bull in 3.21 seconds during the September 2021 15/15 Bucking Battle in Deadwood South Dakota. Jesus however was unable to reverse his past misfortunes brought down by Chiseled in 4.9 seconds.

For the second evening Kolbaba was in the position to lead his team to a come-from-behind victory this time matched up with Schott In The Dark (Broken Arrow S Ranch/Sutton Ranch) by Head Coach Cord McCoy. With the raucous Sooner State crowd on its feet Kolbaba burst from the chute remaining centered and in perfect time atop the powerful bull reaching the requisite 8 as the crowd erupted into a deafening roar. With his team celebrating atop the chutes Kolbaba was scored a monstrous 90.25 points clinching the game win for the Freedom. The 90-point ride was the second for Kolbaba during the PBR Team Series and Oklahoma’s league-leading fourth.



The Freedom are now one of two teams to be a perfect 2-0 at PBR Freedom Fest alongside the Carolina Cowboys (2-0 | 12-6). The two powerhouses will go head-to-head during the final round of games on Sunday Sept. 18 as they contend for the title of PBR Freedom Fest Champions. The win against the Rattlers improved the Freedom to 10-8 this season allowing them to rise from No. 5 to No. 4 in the league standings. Following the loss the Rattlers are now 1-1 at the Team Series event in Oklahoma and 6-12 this season. Keen to conclude PBR Freedom Fest with a winning record the Rattlers will play the Austin Gamblers (0-2 | 10-8) in an all-Texas showdown on Championship Sunday.

PBR Freedom Fest concludes Sunday Sept. 18 at 1:45 p.m. CT. Tickets are still available and can be purchased online at Ticketmaster.com and PBR.com at the Paycom Center Box Office or by calling PBR customer service at 1-800-732-1727.

""PayPal is a values-driven company and has a strong record of combatting racism sexism and all forms of discrimination"" PayPal CEO and president Dan Schulman said in a statement. ""We have reviewed the report of the NBA league's independent investigation into Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver and have found his conduct unacceptable and in conflict with our values.

""... In light of the findings of the NBA's investigation we will not renew our sponsorship should Robert Sarver remain involved with the Suns organization after serving his suspension"" Schulman said in his statement.

The company's sponsorship deal with the Suns which began in 2018 and also includes the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury and Spanish soccer team Real Club Deportivo Mallorca all owned by Sarver is set to expire after the 2022-23 season.

Sources told ESPN that the PayPal deal with the Suns was worth $3 million during the 2021-22 season.

Sarver who is suspended for one season as part of the punishment announced Tuesday by the NBA can return to the Suns for the 2023-24 season.

The league said the investigation found that during his time with the Suns and Mercury Sarver used the N-word at least five times ""when recounting the statements of others.""

There also were ""instances of inequitable conduct toward female employees"" the NBA said in its statement including ""sex-related comments"" and inappropriate comments on employees' appearances.

The e-commerce market is booming in Ivory Coast French-speaking Africa’s largest economy. Currently worth around €46 million it’s set to grow even more in coming years alongside the population. However e-traders face a host of systemic challenges from high transfer fees to restrictions on global online payment platforms such as PayPal.

Vanessa runs a business from her home in Bouaké one of Ivory Coast's largest cities and has been selling her cocoa butter and shea butter cosmetics online for nearly 10 years. She’s financially dependent on that business and loses a large chunk of her profit to transaction costs.

“In Ivory Coast customers don’t have bank cards. They pay by Orange Money Wave MTN and other phone payment apps – but they must also pay fees. It can quickly get expensive” she laments. “For customers abroad it is even worse. They actually have to go to a Western Union Ria or MoneyGram branch to send the money and fees can reach 2 percent.” These extra costs often discourage customers and ultimately lower turnover.

Kader Diaby who sells clothing made from organic materials faces the same issues. His online business constitutes 30 percent of his monthly income with foreign customers mostly based in Nigeria South Africa and France. But he says his profits could be much higher if only he had full access to PayPal – one of the global leaders in online payments for the e-commerce sector.

PayPal blocks withdrawals

PayPal which has been available in Ivory Coast since 2014 usually allows users to receive money and withdraw it directly in cash. But because PayPal restricts some transactions in Ivory Coast due to cybercrime risks Ivorian customers and merchants can only pay by linking a credit card to their PayPal accounts and cannot receive or withdraw money.

""I find it discriminating; it's not normal that I don’t get access to my money just because I'm Ivorian"" says Mory an entrepreneur who offers online services to artists. “We have to create accounts based in Morocco or elsewhere but when PayPal realises we don’t live there it blocks our accounts and our money with it.”

The young Abidjan businessman has no choice but to accept PayPal payments if he does not want to lose customers.

Local solutions

According to a study by McKinsey & Company e-commerce could account for 10 percent of retail sales in Africa’s largest economies by 2025. In Ivory Coast this sector already represents more than 9 percent of the country’s GDP.

Aware of the potential of this market Idriss Marcial Monthe co-founded CinetPay in 2016 – a payment and money-transfer platform that works without a bank card. “Before I had an online domain name sales company and I traveled to collect payments from my customers. Between the cost of transport and traffic jams it was not viable. We then decided to integrate the three mobile payment operators in Ivory Coast on our site” says the businessman.

Monthe’s idea is now used in more than 10 French-speaking countries at low cost. For CinetPay’s president security and modernisation go hand in hand. He says the fight against cybercrime could open the door to innovations that could revolutionise the e-commerce sector in Ivory Coast.

Focus on banking solutions

Revolutionising the whole e-commerce sector is no easy task when only around 20 percent of the population has a bank account.

For economist Yao Seraphin structural reforms are needed – as well as a stronger collaboration between the state and private firms like Visa MasterCard and PayPal.

Daniel Ahouassa agrees. He co-founded APaym – an application that allows merchants to accept all types of bank payments. During the Ivorian Digital Forum held in Abidjan on September 2-3 he called on telecommunications players to seize this market: “We need to work with banks to develop and raise public awareness of electronic payment methods. We have to make it reliable and accessible” he told FRANCE 24 during the event.

In the meantime small traders continue to pay the price for underdeveloped online payment methods in Ivory Coast.

This strategic partnership is expected to reach up to 2 million acres by 2030 and represents a trailblazing effort by two global companies that share ambitious carbon reduction goals.

The companies' capabilities span the food and agriculture value chains creating a unique large-scale platform to support farmers' transition to regenerative agriculture while building their resilience to climate change.

The long-term agreement will initially enroll corn soy and wheat farmers across Kansas Minnesota Iowa Illinois Indiana and Nebraska with the opportunity for future expansion to increase visibility across the value chain and integrate a range of multi-year farmer-first regenerative agriculture initiatives including cover crops reduced tillage nutrient management diverse rotations and responsible pesticide use.

The companies plan to share resources and collaborate to create value throughout the supply chain by providing participants with technical and financial assistance offering access to peer regenerative farming networks hosting educational field days and tracking results using trusted third-party measurement systems.

Reaching the strategic partnership's goals could eliminate 1.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gasses – equivalent to the amount of electricity used to power 275000 homes per year – at the farm level while creating meaningful shared value directly for farmers.

""Building a better food system is essential to the future health of the earth and all of us"" said Jim Andrew Chief Sustainability Officer PepsiCo. ""At its core PepsiCo is an agricultural company working to spread regenerative agriculture practices that restore the earth and reduce carbon emissions to 7 million acres by 2030. This partnership with ADM marks a sea change in how PepsiCo engages with strategic partners and is expected to help us reach almost one-third of that goal. By enabling greater collaboration through strategic partnerships like this one we can strengthen the livelihoods and resilience of the farmers we work with while building a more sustainable future together.""

""Sustainability is fundamental to ADM: Our growth strategy is underpinned by demand for more sustainable products and our culture compels us to act"" said ADM Chief Sustainability Officer Alison Taylor. ""Last year we expanded on our Strive 35 sustainability goals with a commitment to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2035 and expanding regenerative agriculture practices – as we have with our recent strategic partnerships with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and Farmers Business Network – will be key to reaching that goal. Today's announcement is a major step forward as we work with a partner whose values align with our own to scale up regenerative agriculture in a way few other companies can. We're excited to take the next big step in reducing carbon and making our entire food system more sustainable.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNub3Blcy5jb20vZmFjdC1jaGVjay9zdGFyYnVja3MtZHJpbmtzLXJlY2FsbGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Drink Recall for 'Metal Fragments' Concerns 7 US States,"Claim: Hundreds of cases of Starbucks Vanilla Espresso Triple Shot beverages that were shipped to seven U.S. states were recalled on Aug. 15 2022 due to concerns over possible contamination by metal fragments.

On Aug. 15 2022 PepsiCo voluntarily initiated a recall for 221 cases of the Starbucks Vanilla Espresso Triple Shot drink.

PepsiCo recalled cases of the Starbucks Vanilla Espresso Triple Shot drink in seven states.

According to an enforcement report issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the recall only concerned deliveries of the prepackaged Starbucks drink that were shipped to Arkansas Arizona Florida Illinois Indiana Oklahoma and Texas.

The report said that the recall was for ""bottles"" of the product. It's unclear if this was a mistake as the product appeared to possibly only be packaged in cans.

The report also mentioned the reason for the recall: ""Possible contamination by foreign material (metal fragments).""

In a new lawsuit the organization Do No Harm says the program is discriminatory. The group which is comprised of medical and healthcare professionals who aim to “protect healthcare from a racist divisive and discriminatory ideology” argues the program “categorically excludes” white and Asian-American applicants and is therefore illegal.

The case hinges on the fact that Pfizer receives federal financial assistance by accepting reimbursement from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. That means all of the company’s operations are covered by federal prohibitions on racial discrimination Do No Harm says.

In an emailed statement the company said it is an equal opportunity employer ""proud of its commitment to diversity equity and inclusion.""

Pfizer added that it creates many opportunities for applicants and employees ""regardless of protected characteristics."" The company has an education assistance program which all colleagues are eligible for reimbursing employees up to $10000 annually for tuition and ""other eligible expenses"" for approved courses and degrees ranging from associates to doctors.

The most concerning possible vaccination error would be that a child might receive a higher dose of vaccine than indicated for his or her age because of the potential for increased reactogenicity -- for example an arm that is more sore than normal or a fever -- Elisha Hall PhD Clinical Guidelines Lead and a Health Education Specialist for the CDC told MedPage Today in a follow-up phone call.

In the case of an adult who has inadvertently been given a child's dose ""the concern is less about safety and more immunologic"" she said.

One strategy for preventing vaccine mix-ups is to be aware of the similarities between vials for different age groups and purposes.

Pfizer/BioNTech

Both Pfizer's monovalent primary series vial and its bivalent booster vial for individuals 12 years and older have border labels and caps that are an identical gray color. The total dose amounts are the same for both but the monovalent vaccine only targets the ancestral strain of the virus while the bivalent vaccine has components targeting both the ancestral and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains.

Differentiating vials by cap color is not very effective because once a multi-dose vial is ready to be punctured ""that cap is gone and the color-identifier is gone.""

So it's more important to look at the label and title Hall said.

Comparison of Pfizer/BioNTech's labels for its monovalent primary series vaccine and bivalent booster vaccines for individuals 12 and up

Unfortunately in Pfizer's case the borders again are the same color for both the bivalent and monovalent vaccine vials. The only clear difference is the wording:

Monovalent vaccine: ""Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine""

Bivalent vaccine: ""Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Bivalent: Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5""

Fortunately the 5-11 year old primary vaccine border label is different Hall noted.

Moderna

For the Moderna vaccine some obvious differences in appearance exist between the monovalent vaccine (primary series dose for individuals 12 and over) and bivalent booster vaccine (for adults 18 and over) vials. The monovalent vial cap is red while the bivalent vaccine vial is dark blue which is only useful for vials that haven't already been uncapped and used.

Comparison between Moderna's vaccine products

In addition the label border color for the monovalent vaccine is light blue while the label border color for the bivalent vaccine is gray.

The caps of the monovalent children's dose (primary series for individuals 6-11) and bivalent vaccine booster doses (for adults 18 and older) are both dark blue. However the label border color for the monovalent vaccine for children 6-11 is purple and the label border color for the bivalent booster vaccine for those 18 and older is gray.

To add to the confusion the primary series vaccine label for the 6-11 group says ""booster doses only"" because when the vaccines for young children were first authorized the appropriate vials weren't available but the dose for this age group is the same as the dose of Moderna's original monovalent booster dose for adults.

Comparison between Moderna's monovalent vaccine vial/label for children ages 6-11 and the bivalent vaccine vial/label for adults 18 and up

The most expected error ""would probably be mixing up the 6-11 monovalent product with the 18 year and older bivalent product"" Hall noted.

As for best practices for avoiding mixing up vaccine vials Hall in her COCA presentation listed the following tips:

Separate vaccines into different bins based on their formulation

Use color-coded identification labels on vaccine storage containers for any look-alike vaccine products

Keep look-alike vaccines in different areas of a storage unit

Circle any important information on packaging that highlights differences between vaccines

Use look-alike stickers on packaging and in areas where the vaccines are stored

CDC also offered several recommendations for safe preparation and administration:

Establish a ""Do Not Disturb"" period when vaccines are being prepared or administered

Prepare vaccine for one patient at a time

Label the syringe with the vaccine name

Never administer a vaccine prepared by another person

Always triple-check your work and when possible ask another staff member to check for you

Many pharmacies and practices use only one vaccine product either Moderna or Pfizer Hall noted. And those that carry both may designate days for each -- for example Moderna on Mondays. Providers may also choose to designate one day for children's vaccines and another for adults.

If a vaccine administration error does occur the next action depends on the type of error that occurred.

Bivalent Booster Dose

If a bivalent Pfizer vaccine is given in place of a Pfizer primary series monovalent vaccine the CDC recommends not repeating the dose and instead counting it.

If a bivalent Moderna vaccine is given in place of a Moderna primary series vaccine dose Hall advised administering one monovalent dose immediately afterwards without a minimum interval as the repeat dose ""because administration of the booster dose results in a lower than authorized dose for the primary series.""

That interval can be extended for individuals at high-risk of a reaction for example myocarditis or pericarditis.

Monovalent Vaccine Dose

If a monovalent vaccine dose is accidentally given in place of a bivalent booster dose and a bivalent is indicated for those 12 and older the CDC recommends not repeating the dose but a provider may give a bivalent booster dose as a repeat dose ""based on clinical judgment and patient preference"" Hall noted during the webinar. Any repeat dose should be administered at least 2 months after the dose given by mistake.

Next Steps

For any vaccine administration errors clinicians should inform the patient consult with the state program and report the error to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Hall also stressed the need to investigate how the error occurred in order to develop strategies to ensure it won't be repeated.

Broadly speaking the CDC has not seen additional adverse events associated with reports of vaccination errors Hall said in a follow-up email.

As of August 21 the only serious adverse event report associated with a vaccination error related to a ""syringe malfunction"" she noted. Vaccine leaked or squirted onto a child with a history of eczema resulting in a partial dose she noted.

The child subsequently received a full dose during the same visit. She developed a ""generalized rash"" and ""lip swelling"" later the same day and based on that description ""met the case definition for anaphylaxis.""

Some adverse events may be ""coincidental events"" and others are true adverse reactions she noted.

As to whether there has been a spike in vaccine errors since the bivalent booster doses were authorized Hall said it's ""too early"" to tell and ""data are too sparse.""

Hall recommended for any other concerns consulting the detailed table in the appendix of the CDC's interim recommendations that focuses on COVID-19 administration errors and deviations.

Blood clots are often triggered by certain events such as injuries surgeries or infections like COVID-19.

Blood clotting is a well-recognized complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has also been identified as an extremely rare side effect of certain COVID-19 vaccines. The risk with vaccines is exceedingly low and individuals are at a significantly higher risk of developing a blood clot from COVID-19 infection than following COVID-19 vaccination.

Yazan Abou-Ismail MD a hematologist and assistant professor in the Division of Hematology & Hematologic Malignancies at University of Utah Health specializes in disorders of clotting and bleeding and answers questions about the association of blood clots with COVID-19 and certain vaccines.

Where do blood clots occur?

Blood clots can occur either in the veins or arteries. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in the deep veins of your body usually in the lower leg thigh or pelvis. A blood clot that travels from the deep veins and blocks one of the arteries in your lungs is called a pulmonary embolism (PE) and may be life-threatening. Less commonly venous blood clots can also occur in other locations such as the brain or abdomen.

In contrast arterial blood clots occur in the vessels that supply blood to organs such as the heart or brain causing conditions like a heart attack or stroke. Blood clots can be life-threatening but are preventable and treatable if discovered early. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 900000 people experience a DVT or PE and 100000 people die from blood clots in the U.S. each year.

What is the link between blood clots and COVID-19?

The association between COVID-19 and blood clots was recognized early in the pandemic among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These patients experienced blood clots both in deep veins and arteries which sometimes led to strokes and heart attacks. Although these conditions have mostly been seen in patients with severe COVID-19 illness people with non-severe illness have also developed blood clots.

Data from the beginning of the pandemic indicated that the incidence of blood clots in COVID-19 illness ranged anywhere from 5 to 40 percent varying with individual risk factors and severity of illness.

Do certain people have a higher risk of developing blood clots if they have COVID-19?

Those at higher risk of developing blood clots as a result of COVID-19 infection include patients who:

Have a previous medical history of blood clots or a hereditary blood clotting disorder

Have severe COVID-19 illness (hospitalized in the ICU)

Experience respiratory failure or require high amounts of oxygen

Have prolonged immobility

Have underlying illnesses such as hypertension diabetes obesity or cancer

When is a person likely to develop a blood clot following COVID-19 infection?

Usually in the first week or month following infection. It’s less likely for blood clots to occur after that but clots may occur in those with persistent COVID-19 illness or complications.

Has the incidence of blood clots from COVID-19 changed?

The incidence of blood clots seems to be trending downwards compared to earlier in the pandemic. Abou-Ismail says this may be related to many reasons such as:

Improved testing

Earlier recognition

Improved COVID-19 treatment

Better access to therapeutic approaches

Are there any treatments to prevent blood clots in COVID-19 patients?

New guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the American Society of Hematology recommend that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have oxygen requirements and are not in the ICU (also referred to as “moderate COVID-19”) receive a full dose of anticoagulation therapy to help reduce blood clots that may be triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients in the ICU are recommended to receive a prophylactic dose—a lower dose of anticoagulation or blood thinners.

“At the beginning of the pandemic we didn’t know the best way to prevent blood clots from COVID-19 or whether the bleeding risk caused by blood thinners outweighed the benefit of blood clot prevention” Abou-Ismail says. “Now after having data from several large clinical trials we have guidance on how to best prevent blood clots caused by COVID-19 without causing significant harm in hospitalized patients.”

When a patient leaves the hospital providers can now determine individual risk of blood clots. If that individual risk is high Abou-Ismail says some patients may benefit from temporarily continuing the use of blood thinners at home.

Do COVID-19 vaccines cause blood clots?

The Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines have not been shown to increase the risk of blood clots in multiple studies. However two COVID-19 vaccines are associated with an extremely rare syndrome known as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It was discovered in March 2021 in connection to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and then later with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. In rare cases—2 to 20 per million—antibodies that the body produces as a side effect of the vaccine lead to uncontrolled activation of platelets. This causes both low platelet counts and blood clots to form.

The occurrence of this rare antibody is a random event without a known association with a person’s medical history or any particular conditions. “There’s no way to predict who’s likely to develop the rare antibody that triggers VITT” Abou-Ismail says. “While it is a little more common in younger women compared to other populations it remains exceedingly rare even in that group.”

If deciding whether a COVID-19 vaccine is worth the risk Abou-Ismail tells his patients that ”mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe in patients with a history of blood clots or increased risk factors. The risk of developing a blood clot from COVID-19 infection is far higher than getting a blood clot from a COVID-19 vaccine.”

In fact he stresses that having a history of a blood clot is even more reason to get vaccinated because these patients are more likely to get a potentially life-threatening blood clot from COVID-19 infection itself. It is in no means a reason to avoid vaccination with an mRNA vaccine."

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Sittenfeld case get it wrong? Ex-councilman hopes appeals court frees him from prison,"CINCINNATI — Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld asked a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out his public corruption conviction at a hearing on Thursday.

Once a rising political star and favorite to be Cincinnati mayor Sittenfeld is now serving a 16-month sentence for bribery and attempted extortion.

But Sittenfeld is looking for freedom and exoneration.

“I think this was a good day for Sittenfeld. I think the judges’ questions went much tougher on the prosecutor than on Sittenfeld’s lawyers” said Ken Katkin a Northern Kentucky University law professor who attended the 2022 trial and Thursday’s oral arguments at the appeals court.

Sittenfeld has maintained that he did nothing illegal by accepting $20000 in campaign donations from undercover FBI agents who were posing as developers and championing their project to redevelop a blighted downtown property into a boutique hotel because he was a pro-development politician.

It is extremely rare for an appeals court to overturn a jury’s verdict in a criminal case; it only happens 10% of the time said Katkin who gave Sittenfeld a much higher chance of winning on appeal.

More than 75 people attended Thursday's hearing mostly Sittenfeld’s friends family and political supporters. Once every seat in the large courtroom had been filled a court official directed the standing spectators to an overflow room where they could listen to the hearing.

Oral arguments are usually slated for 30 minutes. But the three-judge panel of appointees of former President Donald Trump asked repeated questions that pushed the hearing to 40 minutes. The judges were John Bush John Nalbandian and Eric Murphy.

Sittenfeld’s attorney Yaakov Roth warned of the widespread implications on political fundraising if the appeals court let this conviction stand. Roth a partner at the Washington D.C. law firm of Jones Day helped to vindicate former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell from corruption charges.

“There is a real danger of exposing every elected official in the nation to potential prosecution” said Roth who argued the government is illegally expanding corruption laws by targeting routine political behavior as somehow criminal.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Singer who prosecuted Sittenfeld during a three-week trial with colleagues Emily Glatfelter and Megan Gaffney Painter reminded the court that the jury’s verdict must be respected.

“The jury does not assess any piece of evidence standing alone the jury assesses all of the evidence in the full context and … the jury found Mr. Sittenfeld’s testimony not credible” Singer said.

The jury rejected Sittenfeld’s explanations from the witness stand about his intent behind some very controversial recorded conversations that prosecutors used to convict him.

Lawyers on both sides focused on an October 2018 recorded call between Sittenfeld and Chinedum Ndukwe who was cooperating with the FBI. Sittenfeld who wanted to run for mayor asked for campaign donations in the form of “rounding up LLCs” from Ndukwe a former Cincinnati Bengal turned real estate developer: Sittenfeld can be heard saying “You don’t want me to be like hey Chin love you but can’t.”

""Honestly I can ... I can sit here and say I can deliver the votes"" Sittenfeld told the undercover agent who is known as Rob during a November 2018 meeting at a downtown condo.

Former prosecutor and ex-city councilman Steve Goodin said an appeals court isn't likely to contradict a jury’s findings.

“There is a jury who found there is actually an express deal to sell his vote. That is his biggest problem” Goodin said.

But Sittenfeld’s case despite its local nature has captured the national spotlight especially among legal conservatives. Former attorneys general White House counsels law professors and former prosecutors filed amicus briefs on behalf of Sittenfeld and in opposition to criminalizing political fundraising.

“All of them were arguing … these were all lawful campaign contributions that were properly recorded to the Federal Election Commission properly disclosed and not diverted these funds were not spent on anything improper either” Katkin said. “These kinds of prosecutions are extremely unusual bordering on almost never happening where no money is diverted into a candidate’s pocket.”

The three judges asked repeated questions about the standard for sufficiency of evidence yet seemed skeptical about throwing out the jury's verdict. They also picked up on technical issues at the trial such as amending the indictment and instructions to the jury.

“This issue of informal amending of an indictment ... what they’re really asking is did the prosecutors and the judge invite the jury to convict based on Sittenfeld’s conversation with Chin Ndukwe even though he was only charged with taking a bribe from the developers not Chin Ndukwe"" Katkin said.

At the end of the hearing Roth asked the judges to consider suspending the remainder of Sittenfeld’s sentence and releasing him from prison while the appeal was pending.

If that happened Katkin said Sittenfeld could be released this week. But the final appeals court decision may not come for three months.

Sittenfeld was the third council member the FBI arrested in 2020 on public corruption charges stemming from a massive sting at Cincinnati City Hall involving at least three undercover FBI agents and multiple informants who secretly recorded numerous elected leaders over two years.

Former council member Tamaya Dennard pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud for accepting $15000 as part of a scheme to exchange her votes for money. A judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison and she was released in 2022.

Former council member Jeff Pastor also pleaded guilty to honest services wire fraud. Prosecutors said he took $55000 in bribes in exchange for votes on development deals.

Pastor is serving his two-year sentence at the same federal prison as Sittenfeld who was his former colleague at City Hall. Both are at the minimum-security prison and camp at Ashland in Eastern Kentucky.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaW9ucHJvZ3Jlc3MuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvcGl0dHNidXJnaC1uZXdzLXN0cmlrZS1sZWFkZXItcmVhY3RzLXRvLXBnLWNvLW93bmVycy1sYXdzdWl0LXZzLWhpcy1mYW1pbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pittsburgh news strike leader reacts to PG co-owner's family lawsuit,"Workers from four unions are continuing their unfair labor practice strike at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette despite the news that one of the PG’s owners has filed suit against his twin brother and other family members in part because they explored selling the newspaper.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aWNvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvZmlubGV0ZS1vZmZlcnMtcGctdmVyc2lvbi1vZi1vbmx5ZmFucy10aHJvdWdoLWF0aGxldGUtaW52ZXN0aW5nLTEyMzQ3NzgyNTUv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvcnRpY28uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvMjAyNC9maW5sZXRlLW9mZmVycy1wZy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLW9ubHlmYW5zLXRocm91Z2gtYXRobGV0ZS1pbnZlc3RpbmctMTIzNDc3ODI1NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finlete Offers ‘PG Version of OnlyFans’ as Pro Investing Grows,"Rob Connolly’s first athlete-related start-up was Meetlete a sports-star version of Cameo. Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

Their best choice is to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether but many don’t.

At Philip Morris International we believe smoke-free products can play a pivotal role in switching those adults who would otherwise continue smoking away from cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products—the most harmful forms of nicotine consumption.

Policymakers around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of these scientific innovations—enabling adult smokers to access better alternatives and accurate information about them.

Yet confusion about these new products—as well as disinformation designed to cast doubt on the scientific substantiation behind them—may be preventing many adult smokers who wouldn’t otherwise quit cigarettes from making a better choice.

Here we pick the top seven questions adults are asking and provide fact-based answers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE3LzItZGl2aWRlbmQta2luZy1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tbWFrZS15b3UtbW9uZXktaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Dividend King Stocks That Can Make You Money in Your Sleep,"Target and Altria look well positioned to continue rewarding investors.

When it comes to dividend stocks there's nothing more important than reliability. Retirees and other investors rely on dividend stocks to pay them consistently so if you're an income investor you want to make sure you choose stocks that can pay you in good times and bad.

A great place to find these stocks is the list of Dividend Kings S&P 500 members that have raised their dividend payouts every year for at least 50 years. That's a period of time that includes the coronavirus pandemic the financial crisis the dot-com crash double-digit inflation in the early 80s and the energy crisis of the 1970s.

Only 42 stocks get to claim this title. It's a group that covers several industries though the majority of the companies are either in consumer goods or industrials. If you're looking for dividend stocks you can count on to keep printing money two great choices today are Target (TGT -0.72%) and Altria (MO 0.43%).

1. Target: An underappreciated growth story

In the retail industry most investors seem to think that Amazon is destroying everything in its path. While the e-commerce giant has turned the industry upside down some brick-and-mortar retailers are still thriving. Target is one of them. In fact Target stock has even outperformed Amazon over the last five years as the chart below shows though both have fallen in the recent market sell-off.

Target has delivered strong growth thanks to a unique multi-pronged strategy. First the company has invested in store-based fulfillment. Unlike Amazon or Walmart Target aims to use its stores to fulfill nearly all of its digital orders and it's prioritized same-day fulfillment options like curbside pick up and delivery through Shipt the Instacart competitor it acquired in 2017.

The retailer has also invested in its private-label owned brands which generate higher margins than name brands and reinforce customer loyalty as customers can only get those products from Target. The retailer now owns at least 10 billion-dollar brands and it continues to launch new ones.

Target is also aggressively opening small-format stores in underserved neighborhoods in cities and college towns across the country a high return-on-investment strategy that pairs well with its focus on same-day fulfillment. The small-format stores are also something that rivals like Amazon Walmart and Costco can't match therefore giving Target a competitive advantage.

Target has struggled this year -- it's been hit by excess inventory like many of its peers and faces difficult comparisons with its performance a year ago as consumer spending shifts back to services. But the company still seems poised for reliable long-term growth. Over the long term the company is aiming for high-single-digit earnings-per-share growth which combined with a modest valuation and a dividend yield of 2.6% sets the company up well to deliver double-digit annual returns.

Target's track record of 51 years of dividend hikes should also give investors confidence that it will continue to raise its quarterly payout.

2. Altria: An unbeatable dividend powerhouse

If you like dividends it's hard to find a better stock than Altria (MO 0.43%) the domestic parent of Marlboro. The tobacco company currently offers a dividend yield of 9% better than any other Dividend King and has a track record of 53 straight years of increases dating back to before its 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris.

Dividends are the principal reason investors hold Altria stock and the management team knows that. Altria just raised its quarterly dividend by 4.4% to $0.94 marking its 57th increase in 53 years. The company has a dividend payout ratio target of 80% meaning it aims to pay out 80% of profits as dividends.

Though cigarette sales have been declining in the U.S. for decades Altria has managed to continue growing earnings per share thanks largely to price increases and share repurchases -- even if operating profits are flat. Despite cigarette volumes falling 11% in the most recent quarter revenue after excise taxes was down just 0.7% because of price increases.

What's also noteworthy about Altria's growing dividend and earnings per share is that they've come in spite of disastrous investments in JUUL and Cronos Group which have led to billions of dollars in write-downs.

Altria will eventually have to transition away from smokeable products and its partnership to sell Philip Morris' IQOS product seems like the most promising next-gen opportunity right now. Bt management has demonstrated its ability to grow earnings per share in a declining industry for a long time.

Investors should feel confident in Altria's dividend payout and its 9% yield makes it an attractive way to ride out the bear market.",,,,,,,,,

Although investigators found no leaks California Attorney General Rob Bonta called Safeway’s gas stations across the state “an accident waiting to happen” and claimed “We averted disaster.”

Bonta accused Safeway of “recurring failure” to implement required systems and processes for preventing leaks which include primary and back-up containment equipment for stored underground fuel continuous monitoring of tanks and use of leak-detection technology.

Safeway in the settlement did not deny or admit wrongdoing and did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the allegations that led to the settlement.

A single pinprick-sized leak in an underground gas tank can leak 400 gallons of fuel in a year and one gallon can contaminate more than a million gallons of groundwater Bonta said Friday during a news conference.

Gas stations subject to the agreement’s provisions include two each in San Jose and Alameda; and one each in Campbell Morgan Hill Dublin Livermore Pleasanton San Leandro Antioch Byron Hercules Pleasant Hill San Ramon Novato Dixon and Vallejo.

Five Bay Area district attorneys’ offices are among the 29 county district attorneys’ offices across California that are to share $5.1 million of the penalty paid by Safeway. Solano’s office is to get $696544; Contra Costa’s is to receive $593775; Alameda’s is to get $60900; Santa Clara’s is to receive $40600; and Marin’s is to receive $10150. Bonta’s office is to get $1450181.

The Solano and Contra Costa allocations are based on their substantial roles in the investigation along with Safeway’s presence and alleged violations in their counties and the other offices received allocations based on Safeway’s presence and alleged violations in their counties Bonta’s office said.

Under the agreement Safeway will ensure its facilities have leak-detection sensors “capable of detecting a leak at the earliest possible opportunity” and equipped with alarms. The company will also have to monitor potential water-intrusion into containment areas around underground tanks among other actions required under state health and safety laws.

The allegations against Safeway arose after DA offices in Contra Costa Solano Placer Sacramento and San Joaquin counties notified Bonta’s office about potential violations of state law regulating gas storage Bonta’s office said adding that it couldn’t confirm or deny whether his office was looking into possible similar problems at other companies’ gas stations.

“Enforcement of underground storage tank violations at gas station chains is an ongoing area of cooperation between our office and our partner district attorneys and a priority for the attorney general” Bonta’s office said.

California’s attorney general has settled several cases against major gas chains over underground fuel storage which have included a $14 million penalty against BP in 2016 a $11.5 million penalty against Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips in 2015 and a $24.5 million penalty against Chevron in 2011.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvYWJvcnRpb24tZ2l2ZXMtZGVtb2NyYXRzLXNob3QtZmxpcHBpbmctMTAwMjM3MTczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abortion gives Democrats a shot at flipping a Senate seat in Wisconsin,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ca.movies.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /movies/abortion-gives-democrats-shot-flipping-100237173.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395168AD40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvYWJvcnRpb24tZ2l2ZXMtZGVtb2NyYXRzLXNob3QtZmxpcHBpbmctMTAwMjM3MTczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9hZmwvYWZsdy9wb3J0LWFkZWxhaWRlLWNsYWltLWhpc3RvcmljLWZpcnN0LXdpbi1pbi02NnBvaW50LWFubmloaWxhdGlvbi9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzI3YzAwZTRlN2VmNDJiODI1NzVlMjdiMjcyM2RkNjAx0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L2FmbC9hZmx3L3BvcnQtYWRlbGFpZGUtY2xhaW0taGlzdG9yaWMtZmlyc3Qtd2luLWluLTY2cG9pbnQtYW5uaWhpbGF0aW9uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMjdjMDBlNGU3ZWY0MmI4MjU3NWUyN2IyNzIzZGQ2MDE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History made in utter annihilation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.news.com.au', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sport/afl/aflw/port-adelaide-claim-historic-first-win-in-66point-annihilation/news-story/27c00e4e7ef42b82575e27b2723dd601 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239508854B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9hZmwvYWZsdy9wb3J0LWFkZWxhaWRlLWNsYWltLWhpc3RvcmljLWZpcnN0LXdpbi1pbi02NnBvaW50LWFubmloaWxhdGlvbi9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzI3YzAwZTRlN2VmNDJiODI1NzVlMjdiMjcyM2RkNjAx0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L2FmbC9hZmx3L3BvcnQtYWRlbGFpZGUtY2xhaW0taGlzdG9yaWMtZmlyc3Qtd2luLWluLTY2cG9pbnQtYW5uaWhpbGF0aW9uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMjdjMDBlNGU3ZWY0MmI4MjU3NWUyN2IyNzIzZGQ2MDE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

Developers say they are early in the design process and are focusing efforts on neighborhood meetings and design review.

The proposal comes as occupancy rates for downtown Greenville hotels have climbed.

Another boutique hotel could be coming soon to downtown Greenville’s West End.

Spartanburg-based Pinnacle Partnership and Atlanta-based Gateway Ventures are developing a mixed-use project at 319 Rhett Street and South Main Street in Greenville’s West End that would include luxury apartments a Hilton-branded boutique hotel two restaurants and upgraded streetscaping.

The city's Design Review Board will have to approve the design for the project to proceed.

“We are working with experienced and trusted partners to develop a beautiful multi-use project at 319 Rhett Street in Greenville” Crystal Pace vice president of sales and public relations for Pinnacle Partnership said in an email. “Our hope is to take this undeveloped and vacant site in the heart of the West End and develop it in a beautiful and thoughtful way.”

The property at 319 Rhett Street that would house the hotel and residential units has a paved lot and an old building that once housed an industrial equipment supplier while the smaller adjacent property that fronts South Main Street is vacant. The land is collectively valued at more than $3 million according to county land records.

Architects ODA Architecture and Dynamik Design are designing a nine-story 110000 square-foot 154-room hotel. Amenities would include a first-floor bar and lounge while the ninth floor would have a rooftop bar and patio and 2000 square feet of meeting space.

What's on the menu? :Greenville's Grand Bohemian Lodge to feature distinct food drinks

The mixed-use portion of the development would feature 248 residential units two restaurants and a 525-space parking garage that would be primarily underground according to developers' initial plans. Local firm MKSK Architects is designing the streetscape.

The developers are early in the design process and they’re focusing their efforts on neighborhood meetings and design reviews for the residential component Pace said. More details are expected to follow once those meetings are complete.

A neighborhood meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Sept. 21 at the Unity Park Community Center at 111 Welborn Street.

The hotel would be just up the street from Kimpton Hotels & Residences’ boutique hotel and luxury residential tower at the corner of North Markley and Rhett streets which is slated for completion in summer 2024.

It would also join the likes of boutique Grand Bohemian Lodge which just opened near Falls Park in the heart of downtown.

The newest proposal comes as occupancy rates for downtown Greenville hotels continue to trend up since the pandemic. The occupancy rate was 72% from January to June up from 59% during the same timeframe in 2021. Rooms sold increased 22% year over year from January to June according to data provided by marketing organization VisitGreenvilleSC.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The data is recorded as of every June 30 and the Philadelphia Business Journal selected the five southeastern Pennsylvania counties and the three South Jersey river counties.

When factoring in Delaware TD had long had more deposits than Wells Fargo. But Delaware data is skewed by the fact that several banks including TD have a large amount of corporate deposits in bank-centric Wilmington.

Cherry Hill-based TD a subsidiary of Toronto-based TD Bank Group (NYSE: TD) led the pack this year with $35.4 billion in local deposits good enough for a 16.7% market share and an increase from $32.3 billion and 15.2% in 2021. TD’s branch count held at 117.

She now lives in Tucson Arizona and for a decade lived and worked in Chicago where she got her master’s degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Though the climates are similarly arid between her original city and her current one Lotfi said it was adapting to Tucson’s lack of walkability that was one of the more difficult changes.

“Moving here and having to adapt to a car culture — that was challenging” she said.

Relocating to Arizona in 2017 a few months into the Trump presidency further complicated the adjustment.

“Moving to the borderland at the same time that the Muslim travel ban went through that was another layer that overshadowed my experience with southern Arizona” Lotfi said. “The proximity to the border the politics of this region and the country — it’s been a lot of layers.”

As Lotfi started integrating with Arizona’s artist community she noticed a lot of landscape painting and photography. It led her to think about how nations including the two she’s lived in define themselves by their landscapes.

This would eventually transpire as “A Garden to Build” a solo art show on view now at University Galleries in Normal. The exhibition runs through Oct. 16.

Lotfi was trained as a painter but here she uses drawing photography and papier mache to illustrate the political power of marked off ""natural"" spaces.

“Gardens are huge in Iranian cultural imagination” she said. “That’s where life happens. That’s where political meetings happen. That’s where people socialize. But also these types of gardens are elitist spaces. They’re not for everyone. They’re not public parks.”

Moreover the oldest Iranian gardens were made possible through unparalleled innovation. Ancient peoples made inhospitable lands livable by moving water underground from mountain springs across the desert to various regions of Persia. And in that sense gardens — a sign of fertile ground — were a symbol of power and control over the land.

Lotfi saw parallels between this and the landscapes she saw of the American West underscored by Manifest Destiny and notions of land as personal property. Westward expansion necessitated a protection program that would become the national parks — considered by many to be inseparable from the collective American identity.

As Midwesterners we are not immune to changing landscapes though we may have better access to water and fertile soil. But Lotfi said a critical lens on the politics of gardens can be applied here too.

“What we think of as nature or landscape is very much a product of human manipulation” she said.

Cornfields did not get there by accident after all.

As Lotfi poured over aerial photographs and Google Earth images she found the global demarcations of land to be equal parts fascinating and heartbreaking.

“We know about borders” she said. “We all know there’s an arbitrary line or wall that people are building to divide people to not share resources” she said. “We don’t think about our properties. We live in homes that are walled. Farmlands sound like they are natural spaces but they’re not.”

“A Garden to Build” by Nazafarin Lotfi is on view now through Oct. 16 at University Galleries 11 Uptown Circle in Normal. Lotfi will give a talk at noon on Wednesday Sept. 21 in the gallery. Admission is free; for more information visit galleries.illinoisstate.edu."

With delayed sand supply from the Sha region in Wangdue some of the transporters are found selling truckloads of sand at truck parking in Babesa Thimphu at double the current rate. It is sold at Nu 28000 for 10m3 (cubic metre) truck from Wangdue to Thimphu. The actual market price is Nu 14000.

The Sha region supplies sand to Thimphu Paro and Haa.

A builder based in Thimphu said that the sand transported from Wangdue by the common pool vehicles is cheaper—Nu 14000 for 10m3 truck. However he said that the supply gets delayed.

“We have to buy in an emergency since it is not logical to keep the labourers idle paying Nu 28000 from the market” he said. “We do not know where to complain. The cost of sand began shooting up a week ago.”











Another builder said that with limited sand supply from the Sha region they resort to buying sand from Toorsa Phuentsholing.

“The rate at which the transporters sell is too high. It costs Nu 27000 for 10m3 truck of sand” he added.

He said the government should monitor sand prices. “With the rate too high the cost of construction with the loan availed at existing loan to asset value is difficult to manage.”

A sand transporter Tandin Dorji said that a 10m3 truck of sand from Wangdue to Thimphu costs Nu 14000. From Phuentsholing the price is Nu 25000.









“Some transporters sell a truckload of sand from Wangdue at Nu 28000.”

Tandin Dorji also said that the nexus between the building thikadar (construction supervisor) and transporters has distorted the sand prices. A thikadar for example receives a commission of about Nu 3000 for a truckload of sand.

On the delayed supply Branch Manager of the Natural Resources Development Corporation Limited’s (NRDCL) Sha branch office Mani Gyeltshen said that the corporation lost the operation of two quarries in the beginning of the year —Havilum and Goleykha—because of the Covid-19 restrictions.

“Stocking of sand could not be maximised; the current supply is dredged sand” he said.

According to the office only 22945m3 of sand was stocked this year which was 54 403m3 less compared to 2021.









Stocking of sand is done from mid-October to March and is supplied during summer.

However Mani Gyeltshen said that the current situation would improve from the first or second week of October as the extraction of sand from riverbeds will start soon.

NRDCL has also temporarily halted both manual and online bookings from September 15 to clear the backlogs. There are 2600 truckload backlogs.

The NRDCL also capped a truckload of sand for each customer a week from September 15. In winter there is no cap on truckload.

Mani Gyeltshen said that after the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted there was huge demand for sand with the opening of construction activities.









In normal times the NRDCL Sha region dispatches 188 truckloads of sand in a day from both stocked and dredged sand -143 truckloads are dredged sand.

However currently with no stocked sand only 86 truckloads of dredged sand are dispatched in a day.

Mani Gyeltshen said that the Sha region produces 35 996m3 of sand in normal times. However after river level rose the production dropped to 25 450m3 as of August a decrease of 10545m3.

He said there are two types of sand customers namely common pool vehicles and self-owned transporters.









Mani Gyeltshen said that illegal sand trading is not possible under common pool vehicles because the NRDCL assigns customers to transporters and payment is made when the sand delivery is completed. Common pool vehicles are private transporters registered with the NRDCL.

The self-owned transporters which the customers send their own vehicles or vehicles owned by their relatives Mani Gyeltshen said that NRDCL verifies the documents like construction approval and validity and the sand must go to the particular site.

He added that the customers complain about the existence of illegal trading of sand in the market. “We asked them to share the vehicle’s number. No one has done so.”"

The SFDR delegated measures (Level 2) set out additional disclosure obligations in respect of:

fund managers' website disclosure of the principal adverse impacts ( PAIs ) of investment decisions on sustainability factors under SFDR Article 4 (the entity-level PAI disclosure rule )

) of investment decisions on sustainability factors under SFDR Article 4 (the ) fund disclosure of environmental or social ( E/S ) characteristics under SFDR Articles 8 10 and 11 ( product-level disclosure rules )

) characteristics under SFDR Articles 8 10 and 11 ( ) fund disclosure of sustainable investment objectives under SFDR Articles 9 10 and 11 (product-level disclosure rules).

Level 2 Compliance Timeline

Level 2 disclosures of entity-level PAIs are required to be published on the fund manager's website by 30 June 2023.

Level 2 pre-contractual and website disclosures for Article 8 and 9 funds must be published from 1 January 2023 and financial report disclosures must be included in any relevant fund reports published after this date (irrespective of the relevant financial/reference period).

The Central Bank has committed to providing a fast-track approval process ahead of the 1 January 2023 compliance deadline for Level 2 pre-contractual disclosures and while regulatory guidance is expected to issue shortly the Central Bank has verbally confirmed a filing deadline of 1 December 2022 for the process. As such fund managers have approximately 11 weeks in which to finalise Level 2 pre-contractual disclosures for any Article 8 and 9 funds under management and submit these for noting by the Central Bank.

Fund managers then have a further 4 weeks (including the Christmas period) in which to finalise and publish Level 2 website disclosures for Article 8 and 9 funds in advance of the 1 January 2023 compliance deadline.

For those funds with a late Q3/early Q4 financial year-end preparations must also be progressed this quarter for publishing Level 2 financial report disclosures in Article 8 or 9 funds' reports published after 1 January 2023.

This guide aims to assist fund managers' Level 2 compliance preparations and includes (i) key Level 2 considerations; (ii) a decision tree to facilitate funds managers scoping of Level 2 obligations; and (iii) a detailed summary of the Level 2 disclosure rules.

Fund Managers' PAI disclosures: 10 key Level 2 considerations

From 1 January 2023 fund managers explaining non-compliance with the entity-level PAI disclosure rule must ensure existing website statements of non-compliance (made pursuant to Level 1) align with Level 2 requirements for the format and positioning of such statements (see Summary of Level 2 Disclosure Rules section below). Fund managers explaining non-compliance with the entity-level PAI disclosure rule are not precluded from establishing/managing funds that consider product-level PAIs. However any such funds should be excluded from the website and pre-contractual non-compliance statements. Fund managers complying with the entity-level PAI disclosure rule must first disclose the PAIs of investments by 30 June 2023 referencing 2022 calculations on the manager's website. Level 2 requires PAIs to be calculated over a calendar year using a prescribed set of 64 mandatory and optional indicators across corporate sovereign and real estate investments. In any given year PAI calculations must be carried out on at least four calculation dates (31 March 30 June 30 September and 31 December) with the average of the impacts disclosed by 30 June of the following year as the PAIs of the previous year. Fund managers complying with the entity-level PAI disclosure rule for the first time are by way of exemption to the calendar-year calculation period rule permitted to disclose PAIs by reference to the period beginning on the date on which PAIs are first calculated in the previous year until 31 December of that year. PAIs must be disclosed using the mandatory website disclosure template set out in Annex I Level 2. The template requires a summary disclosure of the PAIs a detailed disclosure of impacts against the mandatory and optional PAI indicators a historical comparison (where available) details of the manager's relevant policies and procedures and its adherence to international standards for due diligence and reporting (see Summary of Level 2 Disclosure Rules section below). Publicly available data should be used for calculating PAIs and where not readily available fund managers should use best efforts to source data either direct from investee companies by carrying out additional research cooperating with third party data providers or external experts or making reasonable assumptions. Fund managers are expected to calculate PAIs of both direct and indirect investments by applying a look-through approach to indirect holdings e.g. via other funds fund of funds holding companies SPVs and derivatives (see here for further details). Fund managers are expected to calculate the PAIs of instruments financing sustainable projects e.g. a bond by reference to the impact of the project or type of project funded by the instrument (see here for further details). Fund managers complying with the entity-level PAI disclosure rule must from 30 December 2022 disclose whether they also consider product-level PAIs in respect of underlying funds (SFDR Article 7(1)). In respect of funds that consider product-level PAIs managers must make pre-contractual disclosure of how such PAIs are identified and financial report disclosure of any such PAIs identified. In contrast to the entity-level PAI disclosure rule disclosure of product-level PAIs is not required to be made using the Level 2 indicators. However ESMA's recently published supervisory expectation is that the Level 2 mandatory PAI indicators (Table 1 Annex I) are used to calculate and disclose product-level PAIs (see here for further details of ESMA's supervisory expectations for compliance with Level 2).

Funds' E/S characteristics / sustainable investment objectives: 10 key Level 2 considerations

Sustainable investment under SFDR means an investment: in an activity that contributes to an environmental or social objective

that does not significantly harm any social or environmental objective (the DNSH test) and

that follows good governance practices (in the case of investee companies)

From 1 January 2023 Level 2 requires additional pre-contractual website and financial report disclosures for funds with E/S characteristics in scope of SFDR Article 8 and those with sustainable investment objectives in scope of SFDR Article 9. Financial report disclosure templates must be included in reports published after 1 January 2023 irrespective of the relevant reference/financial period. Level 2 pre-contractual and financial report disclosures are required to be made using the mandatory disclosure templates annexed to Level 2 which may not be amended other than changes to the colour and font type and size. Level 2 website disclosures are not subject to a template but are required to be made in accordance with detailed Level 2 rules (see Summary of Level 2 Disclosure Rules section below). Website disclosures should be used to 'expand on topics disclosed in a concise way in pre-contractual documents' and include 'a clear succinct and understandable summary of the [financial report] information' disclosed using the relevant disclosure template. Level 2 pre-contractual and financial report disclosures must include funds' binding sustainable investment commitments (if any)/sustainable investment holdings (if any) noting that both the ESAs and the Commission expect that Article 9 funds only invest in sustainable investments and ancillary investments (e.g. for hedging and liquidity purposes) subject to minimum safeguards (see here for further details). A fund manager's methodology for assessing sustainable investments' compliance with the 'do no significant harm' (DNSH) test (see box on the right) must take account of the Level 2 PAI indicators and all sustainable investments including those aligned with the Taxonomy must satisfy the DNSH test. This is notwithstanding that the Taxonomy also includes a DNSH test and as such Taxonomy-aligned investments are subject to dual DNSH obligations under both SFDR and the Taxonomy. To take account of the Level 2 PAI indicators under the SFDR DNSH test fund managers are expected to develop and establish significant harm thresholds for the Annex 1 Table 1 indicators and any relevant indicators from Tables 2 and 3 which the ESAs consider it best practice to disclose in order to prove sustainable investments' DNSH compliance. In addition to taking account of the Level 2 PAI indicators fund managers' DNSH methodology must also include an assessment of whether the investments are aligned with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the principles and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organisation on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights. Level 2 pre-contractual and financial report disclosures for Article 8 funds with environmental characteristics and Article 9 funds with environmentally sustainable investments must include any binding Taxonomy-aligned investment commitments/Taxonomy-aligned investment holdings. All Article 8 funds with environmental characteristics are subject to this disclosure requirement including those with no sustainable investment commitments/holdings according to the Commission (see here for further details). Article 8 anti-greenwashing guidance issued by ESMA to NCAs clarifies that Article 8 funds' Level 2 disclosures must be binding and any significant discrepancy between a fund's investments and its pre-contractually disclosed investment commitments may be subject to regulatory action for greenwashing (see here for further details). Article 9 anti-greenwashing guidance issued by ESMA to NCAs clarifies that Article 9 funds with significant non-sustainable investment holdings may be subject to regulatory action for greenwashing (see here for further details). Fund managers may but are not obliged to use the Level 2 PAI indicators as sustainability indicators for measuring a fund's success in implementing its E/S characteristics or sustainable investment objectives. A fund manager is also not obliged to use the Level 2 PAI indicators when considering any product-level PAIs however ESMA has published its expectation that such consideration takes account of the mandatory Table 1 PAI indicators (see here for further details). Both Article 8 and 9 funds are subject to the requirement for investee companies to follow good governance practices and must make pre-contractual and website disclosure of their policies to assess corporate investments' good governance practices. Funds investing in companies that do not follow such practices are considered in ""breach"" of SFDR according to the Commission (see here for further details).

Am I in scope of Level 2 disclosure rules?

The decision tree below is intended for use by fund managers in determining whether based on their approach to compliance with the first SFDR (Level 1/L1) deadline of 10 March 2021 they are in scope of Level 2 disclosure rules and if so the relevant disclosure rules to which they will be subject from 1 January 2023 (other than where indicated). A summary of the referenced Level 2 disclosure rules follows the decision tree.

Commercial Crime Insurance Overview

Commercial crime insurance is necessary to protect businesses of any size and scope from employee-related and third-party crimes. A crime perpetrated by a trusted employee or outside individual can cause lasting financial physical and emotional loss. To understand the scope of employee crime or occupational fraud risk consider these statistics from a recent Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) report: organizations lose an estimated 5% of revenue to fraud each year with an average loss per fraud case of more than $1.5 million.

Further a study from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University found that a majority of fraud and theft threats against organizations stemmed from officially-employed insiders. While theft or property damage committed by a third-party is always a threat employee-related incidents tend to be more common.

Any instance of employee dishonesty can be devastating but many kinds of crimes can also undermine your business’s reputation forcing operations off track and throwing a wrench into your revenue. Along with other insurance policies for business owners commercial crime insurance is recommended as a basic protection against these types of events.

What Is Commercial Crime Insurance?

Commercial crime insurance protects business owners from financial loss caused by criminal activity. This can include crimes perpetrated by either employees or non-employees and can include crimes such as theft property damage forgery and fraudulent bank transfers among others. Various forms of crime insurance include employee dishonesty insurance third-party crime coverage fidelity bonds business services bonds and ERISA bonds. Because commercial property insurance excludes a wide range of criminal activity commercial crime insurance adds a necessary layer of protection to your business.

When comparing policies most are organized around the type of person committing the crime (an employee or outside party) and who the crime was perpetrated against (the business itself or one of the business’s customers). Depending on your insurance policy it will either include first-party coverage third-party coverage or a combination of both which is the most secure. Costs covered under first-party coverage include claim expenses and direct financial losses sustained by your company including the loss of physical property. Some policies may also cover proof of loss costs or costs incurred as a result of needing to provide evidence of a crime against your business. This entails hiring forensic experts and investigators that can compile a proof of loss portfolio to present along with your claim.

If you’ve heard the phrase “fidelity bond” used interchangeably with “crime insurance” you might be questioning whether there is any difference between the two. Fidelity bonds constitute a specific type of crime insurance that addresses crimes stemming from employee actions. Employee dishonesty bonds business services bonds and ERISA bonds are the three main categories of fidelity bonds and each protects businesses from a specific set of crimes which will be outlined later in this guide. It’s important to note that a business services bond can strengthen your commercial crime insurance by covering the reimbursement of losses sustained by your customers as a result of your employees’ actions.

Individual fidelity bonds are an effective way to shield your business from the effects on employee crime but they don’t provide as much coverage as a broad crime insurance policy. As mentioned before commercial crime policies usually cover not only employee-related crimes but also those crimes carried out by third parties.

How Does Crime Insurance Work?

A crime insurance policy is often added to an existing BOP (business owners policy) or general liability insurance policy. Commercial crime coverage functions like many other common forms of business insurance: in exchange for a monthly or annual premium paid by the policyholder the insurance provider assumes financial risk in the event of a covered claim. Covered claims generally fall under two broad coverage categories. First-party coverage protects your business from direct losses resulting from criminal activity perpetrated against your business usually by an employee. Although this coverage can be extended to cover criminal activity committed by an outside party. Third-party coverage on the other hand protects your business in the event that another entity-such as a client or business-claims your business (or employee of your business) committed a criminal act against them. This type of coverage is common for businesses whose employees work at a client’s property.

Most commercial crime insurance policies operate on a “named perils” basis meaning that in order for a loss to be covered the loss and crime that caused it must be specifically named in the policy. If a loss or crime type is not specifically named in the policy it will not be covered. For example a policy might state that the insurer will compensate the insured for direct losses sustained as a result of impersonation fraud meaning instances of that specific kind of fraud would be covered.

Another type of policy which is far less common in the U.S. is an “all-risks” crime policy. Unlike named perils policies all-risks policies include broad language that cover a wide range of incidents. With all-risks policies all losses and types of crimes are covered as long as they are not specifically excluded from the policy.

In addition to whether the policy is written as a named perils or all-risks policy how coverage is triggered is also an important component to consider. Commercial crime policies make use of either a “loss-discovered” or a “loss-sustained” trigger.

Policies that use a “loss-discovered” trigger will cover any losses incurred by your business that are discovered within the policy period. The loss will be covered even if the actual crime took place weeks months or even years before. This is usually preferred as it gives business owners more time to discover and then claim a loss.

Unlike discovery triggers “loss-sustained” triggers require that the loss is both sustained and discovered during the policy period in order to qualify for coverage. Under these terms losses that go undiscovered for some time may not be covered. Similarly losses that are discovered during the policy period but occurred prior will also not be covered. Because of these limitations this type of trigger is considered less desirable especially if your business is at risk of electronic crime-instances of transferred funds or tampering with a computer system may not be immediately obvious.

Policy rules vary but generally the insuring company must be notified of a discovered loss in writing as soon as possible. Proof of the losses incurred must be provided as well within a few months of the initial discovery. Proof of loss may not be immediately obvious or easy to gather and present so be sure to familiarize yourself with your policy’s terms– some companies may cover the cost of hiring specialists to help you compile the necessary body of evidence.

The last component of commercial crime insurance that must be considered is the policy limit. While some insurance policies have aggregate limits that define the maximum cost your insurer will cover throughout a single policy period commercial crime insurance does not. Instead the limit of a crime policy defines the maximum cost an insurer will cover per occurrence or per claim regardless of how many claims are filed during the policy period.

What Does Crime Insurance Cover?

Crime insurance covers a range of crimes committed against a business both on the part of employees and third parties or outside perpetrators. This includes theft forgery and other acts of fraud as well as computer-based crimes which have been on the rise over the past decade. Direct costs covered include reimbursement of financial and property losses. The following sections provide an overview of the most common types of criminal acts usually covered by crime insurance.

Employee Dishonesty & Theft

Employee dishonesty and theft should be on any business owner’s radar even within a company based on trust and communication. Petty theft shoplifting and property damage perpetrated at your business are among covered circumstances. If off-premises coverage is specified as part of your policy theft committed in transit will also be covered-in a situation where money or property is being physically moved between locations for example.

This also applies to thefts committed by an employee at a work site. Consider the example of a carpentry business owner who receives complaints from a number of clients who notice valuables missing from their homes. They may suspect that an employee who worked in each of the homes may be at fault. If that is found to be true the cost of the clients’ property will be covered by the business owner’s combined first- and third-party commercial crime insurance policy. Policies that specifically target employee-related theft are often referred to as employee dishonesty insurance.

Third-Party Theft

Theft committed by a third outside party not employed by your business is also covered by commercial crime insurance as long as your policy includes both types of coverage. This includes theft of property theft of money and destruction of money or securities.

Computer Fraud

Computer to computer hacking is a kind of computer fraud that is covered under commercial crime insurance. This would enable a hacker to transfer funds and/or information to an outside source causing financial loss. False transfer requests are another form of electronic fraud in which the perpetrator instructs a bank to transfer funds under the insured’s name.

Social Engineering Fraud

Also called impersonation fraud social engineering fraud encompasses a number of manipulative actions a criminal may undertake to convince you or an employee to transfer money. This kind of fraud often includes phone or email contact and requests to wire money or change a vendor’s account details. Perpetrators may target an individual after doing research on the business they work for to make sure the scenario they are proposing seems believable.

Many will operate on a purported basis of trust after learning enough about their target to impersonate a vendor or a party otherwise affiliated with your business. As the consequences of social engineering fraud may not become obvious until it is too late to regain lost revenue this is where a loss-discovered form would prove safer than a loss-sustained form.

Forgery

Forgery can take various forms but fraudulent check signatures are a common instance of employee crime. Crime insurance coverage can protect you from forgery under your name as well as alterations. Alterations include any unauthorized changes to checks or other documents under your name. Forgery alteration and embezzlement are examples of other crimes that are often committed internally and may not be immediately noticeable.

Counterfeit Currency

If your business receives counterfeit currency from a payment transaction your financial losses incurred as a result will also be covered by commercial crime insurance. This also includes instances of counterfeit money orders. Counterfeit payments may not be immediately noticeable and they are often discovered after the transaction has been made.

Crime Insurance Exclusions

While most of the crimes included under a commercial crime insurance policy may seem straightforward it’s important to note some exceptions. Like most insurance policies crime insurance has specific exclusions that you’ll want to keep in mind.

As a reminder most commercial crime policies are written on a named perils basis meaning that only the incidents and types of costs specifically listed on the policy will ultimately qualify for coverage. In general crime policies cover direct losses incurred as a result of criminal activity committed by employees or outside parties. Crimes committed by business owners indirect losses legal fees and losses resulting from non-criminal activity are usually excluded from standard policies. For more details on what’s not covered by crime insurance continue reading below.

Legal Fees

Unlike many other commercial insurance policies commercial crime insurance won’t cover any legal fees incurred by your business. While some insurers may cover the cost of hiring specialists to help you gather proof of loss the cost of hiring a legal defense team will not be covered in most scenarios. When it comes to assistance with gathering proof of loss coverage is not guaranteed and varies from policy to policy.

Employees With Criminal Records

If you as the insured become aware of a crime or crimes committed by a particular employee any further losses caused by that employee will not be covered. The first instance of you becoming aware of crimes perpetrated by that employee triggers the “discovery of loss.” For example if you witness an employee stealing money from the cash register but wait until it happens again to address the crime and open a claim the second instance of theft may not be covered. Also if you as the insured are aware of an employee’s criminal history further crimes committed by that employee may not be covered under a commercial crime policy.

Theft Committed by Owners or Partners

Crimes committed by business owners business shareholders or senior partners will not be covered by commercial crime insurance.

Data Losses

Data losses or breaches include the loss of information such as client lists sensitive customer information business plans and intellectual property. While such incidents usually result in indirect financial losses in the form of third-party lawsuits legal fees restitution and data recovery they don’t cause direct financial losses which is what crime insurance is designed to cover. Because of this the indirect losses caused by cyber attacks and data breaches are not covered by crime insurance and are instead addressed with a cyber liability policy.

Computing & Accounting Mistakes

Computer or accounting mistakes of a non-criminal nature will not be covered under commercial crime insurance either. For example say one of your employees in the accounting department makes a mistake in their work that results in the business having to pay a sizable penalty to the IRS. This would not be covered by crime insurance. Similarly say one of your website developers makes an error that causes your company’s website to go down for hours which results in lost sales and revenue. Again this would not be caused by crime insurance since the nature of the incidents stemmed from mistakes rather than criminal activity.

As a side note in both of the examples above a mistake by an employee resulted in a loss for the business they are employed by. Had their mistakes resulted in a loss for one of your business’s clients a professional liability insurance policy would provide coverage.

Inventory Discrepancies

Since reasons behind inventory discrepancies can vary between criminal and non-criminal intent inventory discrepancies without evidence of theft will not be covered under commercial crime insurance. Some examples of evidence of criminal activity include video tapes witness statements and transaction records that indicate an employee was unlawfully taking and/or selling company products for their own gain.

Indirect Losses

If a criminal act against your business leads to indirect losses like loss of income or interruption of regular business practices those will not be covered under commercial crime insurance. Direct business losses stem from acts like property theft theft of money and securities and unauthorized transfer of funds between accounts. Criminal acts that result in indirect losses for your business can be covered under a business interruption policy.

Who Needs Crime Insurance?

There are a number of telling factors that put certain businesses at higher risk of crime than others. While internal protocols and risk-management solutions can prevent certain risks including crime the following businesses would benefit most from commercial crime protection.

Businesses with a significant part-time workforce will benefit from crime insurance. The more part-time employees there are to keep track of the greater the risk of missing internal employee theft. The same goes for businesses with large product inventories. The more inventory a business has to manage the harder it is to track employee theft or inventory discrepancies.

According to Embroker’s statistics American businesses lose up to $50 billion a year on employee theft. As most businesses rely on cash transactions or digital data-including digital transactions customer financial records and company financial records-they are at risk of both internal and external theft. Any business that deals with direct payments digital information and financial records is susceptible to having sensitive information and funds stolen or transferred without authorization.

Commercial Crime Insurance Requirements

While most commercial crime insurance policies are not mandated by federal law there are certain scenarios in which a crime insurance policy may be a contractual requirement or otherwise required for conducting business with another party.

For example certain clients may require you to secure fidelity bonds before finalizing a contract. Fidelity bonds are sub-categories of commercial crime insurance that address specific circumstances which will be outlined in detail in the next sections. Businesses that provide employee benefit plans are also required to purchase fidelity bonds under the ERISA or Employee Retirement Income Security Act as a way to protect participating employees’ assets.

Rules regarding specific fidelity bonds also vary by state. For example California requires every HOA or homeowner’s association in the state to secure an HOA fidelity bond. The same goes for Florida unless the requirement is unanimously waived.

Small Businesses

While crime insurance is often recommended for businesses with large workforces and inventories small businesses will also benefit from the protections it offers. Small businesses that rely on both card and digital payment transactions will benefit from commercial crime protections especially in instances of an employee mishandling inventory or funds. Though this may surprise you 90% of large theft-related losses are estimated to stem from employee dishonesty. Small businesses that regularly handle product or customer property may be more prone to internal theft as well.

Financial Institutions

Since banks and other financial institutions regularly work with money transfers sensitive customer information and high-value transactions they may be more prone to employee dishonesty forgery and fraud. This makes banks credit unions and brokerage companies prime candidates for comprehensive crime insurance plans. While actual bank robberies are relatively rare employee-related crimes are considered to be one of the largest risks banks and other financial institutions face.

Homeowners Associations (HOAs)

Homeowners associations or HOAs are another type of business that is vulnerable to crimes like embezzlement theft and fraud. HOAs often use multiple accounts to store funds in anticipation of large purchases. The amount of money stored in these accounts has a tendency to grow quickly thanks to regular member payments. Since HOAs are often managed by a small group of employees or supervisors the money in their accounts may not be kept track of regularly. This can make HOA accounts easier to target.

If for example an HOA has set up a long-term account in anticipation of full roof replacement and an internal employee begins siphoning a small amount of money monthly the discrepancy may go unnoticed for a long period of time. This is especially true if the money in the account grows regularly because of monthly payments and there’s not enough officials overseeing the numbers each month. Commercial crime coverage would provide protection in these types of scenarios.

Commercial Crime Coverage Compared to Other Policies

Commercial crime coverage may seem straightforward but it’s actually fairly nuanced and often confused with other policies that address similar incidents. Two such policies are fidelity bonds and cyber insurance which are discussed in more detail below.

Crime Insurance vs. Fidelity Bonds

While fidelity bonds fall under the umbrella of crime insurance the two are not identical. You can think of fidelity bonds as a kind of crime insurance product with a different set of protections than a broader commercial crime insurance policy.

Fidelity bonds usually come in the form of employee dishonesty bonds business services bonds and ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) bonds each of which serve a different purpose.

As their name suggests employee dishonesty bonds will cover securities money and property theft perpetrated against your business by an employee. This coverage is necessary because other standard commercial insurance policies-like commercial property and general liability-won’t cover losses caused by internal employee theft. Examples of employee dishonesty range from physical theft of inventory to embezzlement of funds and the misuse of business or client credit card information.

Business services bonds are a type of fidelity bond that focus on protecting your customers as opposed to you and your business. If one of your employees commits a crime that results in a customer or client’s property or financial loss business services bonds will cover the cost of replacing their loss. Business services bonds are also a reputation booster as they communicate to your clients that their property and financial assets will be secure.

Resulting from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 an ERISA bond is a fidelity bond that a business owner is mandated to take out to cover employee benefit plans including pensions and 401k plans. This kind of bond has to cover at least 10% of the plan’s assets and is meant to protect employees from dishonest activities that may affect their benefit funds. In most cases ERISA requirements state that individuals who manage such benefit plans must secure a bond to cover losses from embezzlement forgery theft or misuse of funds.

Crime Insurance vs. Cyber Insurance

As discussed above commercial crime insurance focuses narrowly on direct tangible monetary or property losses that result from crimes committed against your business (by an employee or third party) as well as crimes committed against your customers by an employee of your business. The types of crimes covered could be perpetrated electronically or involve the physical theft of property. The most important thing to note is that in general for crime insurance to cover an incident money or property must have been stolen.

Cyber insurance also known as cyber liability insurance covers indirect losses that result specifically from some form of electronic crime perpetrated against your business such as a data breach or cyber attack. These indirect losses include those incurred by your business in responding to the incident-for example legal expenses data recovery lost income public relations fines and customer notification. Indirect losses also include those incurred should a third party bring a lawsuit against your business following the incident.

As a business owner it can sometimes be difficult to determine which policy would apply to a given incident. To help consider the following:

If the incident resulted in a tangible loss of money or property crime insurance will usually be the applicable policy

If the incident resulted in an intangible loss-such as the theft of sensitive customer information account numbers etc.-cyber insurance will apply

When it comes to what costs the policies will actually pay for keep in mind:

Crime insurance reimburses for direct losses based on the value of what was actually stolen. Crime policies don’t cover legal fees public relations costs loss of income etc.

Cyber insurance on the other hand reimburses for indirect losses incurred while effectively responding to the incident. This does include legal fees lost income PR etc.

Commercial Crime Insurance Costs & Premiums

As with other forms of commercial insurance premiums for commercial crime coverage vary widely based on a variety of factors. In addition to the premium businesses should also consider the deductible which will impact the total amount paid before any money is actually received from the insurer in the event of a claim. These details are explained in greater depth below.

How Much Does Commercial Crime Insurance Cost?

For most small businesses commercial crime insurance is an affordable policy that is a smart choice to have. Policies for small businesses typically range in price from less than $1000 to a few thousand dollars annually. Another way to think about the cost of crime insurance or fidelity bonds is as a percentage of the total coverage amount. Depending on a variety of factors related to your business and the policy limit business owners can expect to pay between 0.1%–3% for their policies.

Factors That Affect the Price of Crime Insurance

As with any insurance policy there are a number of factors that can affect your final premium.

Coverage limit and deductible: Generally speaking the higher your coverage limit the higher your annual cost will be. According to Insureon a fidelity bond with a coverage limit of $1000000 may total about $100 in annual costs while a policy with a limit of $2 million may amount to about $1750 yearly. Deductibles or the amount that is paid out of pocket before a claim is covered can usually be chosen by the insured. Generally speaking the higher the deductible the lower the premium and vice versa.

Deductibles or the amount that is paid out of pocket before a claim is covered can usually be chosen by the insured. Generally speaking the higher the deductible the lower the premium and vice versa. Industry: Your business’s industry will affect the cost of your commercial crime insurance premium. High-risk industries will incur larger costs than industries deemed low-risk. High-risk industries typically include high-traffic retail tech and financial institutions.

Claims history: Your business claims history affects your annual costs as it is a strong indicator of your business’s liability risk. A history of claims waged against your business will likely increase your premiums.

Comparing Commercial Crime Insurance

As with any kind of insurance you’ll want to compare and contrast commercial crime policies to find the best fit for your business. The following factors should all be considered when weighing your options.

Coverage Options & Policy Limits

When considering your coverage options be aware of whether a policy utilizes a “loss-discovered” or “loss-sustained” trigger. Similar to an occurrence-based liability policy a loss-sustained policy will only cover losses that both took place and were discovered while the policy was active. Policies written on a discovery basis on the other hand will automatically cover losses that were discovered within the active policy period no matter when they took place.

You’ll find that most commercial crime insurance policies operate on a “named perils” opposed to an “all-risks” basis meaning that losses claimed must be within the categories outlined in the actual policy. You’ll want to read through your policy carefully to be aware of the specific losses that it names and covers.

Claims expenses are another aspect of your commercial crime insurance policy you’ll want to pay attention to as claim expenses coverage limits may vary. Your claim expenses are separate from the cost of reimbursing stolen goods and assets-claim expenses encompass the costs of the claim itself. When it comes to submitting crime claims the cost may be even higher since forensic experts may be needed to provide evidence along with a team of attorneys. A higher claims expense limit will mean a higher premium but may save you money in the event of an expensive claim you submit on behalf of your business.

Your policy limit is the maximum amount your insurer will pay out for a claim covered by your policy. Most insurers offer a range of limits to choose from and higher limits usually mean higher premiums. Keep in mind that when it comes to commercial crime insurance the limit won’t be aggregated meaning it will apply individually to each loss incurred.

Premiums & Deductibles

As is the case with most insurance policies your premium or annual cost of insurance depends on a number of factors including the size and scope of your business your coverage limit and your claims history. However business owners can look for reduced limits higher deductibles and policies with less flexibility to save money on annual costs.

Financial Strength

Financial strength is an important factor to consider when looking for a commercial crime insurance provider. Financial strength ratings are subject to change so you’ll want to check rating agencies like AM Best Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s for the latest scores. By rating insurance companies on a number of factors including how effective they are in meeting their financial obligations when it comes to claim coverage these agencies can help you choose the most reliable provider.

Company Reputation

Along with financial strength a company’s reputation with its customers is crucial to choosing the right insurer. Sources like the Better Business Bureau and J.D. Power analyze companies’ customer ratings and reputation allowing you to access information that may not be readily available otherwise. Similarly the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also provides comprehensive data on insurance companies incorporating a complaint index that compares performance across insurers. Obtained by dividing the company’s complaints by its share of premiums the index is a reliable indicator of an insurer’s reputation.

The Best Commercial Crime Insurance Companies Overall

Chubb (Best Commercial Crime Insurance Overall)

Chubb Best Crime Insurance Overall

Known as a leading underwriter Chubb is a sound choice for large and mid-sized businesses that need a reliable comprehensive commercial crime insurance policy. The company goes above and beyond in providing detailed information for customers about its crime insurance offerings generally as well as for specific policies.

Pros Offers a loss-discovered policy which is preferable to loss-sustained

Offers an all-risks insuring clause

Covers the costs of customer notification in the event of a data breach Cons Chubb’s policies are usually more expensive than those offered by competitors

Along with providing a transparent guide to all of its commercial crime insurance services on its website Chubb specifies important highlights of its crime policy right away. The company’s commercial crime insurance operates on a loss-discovered basis meaning it covers losses that are discovered within the policy period no matter when the actual crime occurred. This is highly preferable to the alternate loss-sustained policy form which limits coverage to losses that take place during the policy period. Chubb’s loss-discovered policy takes into account crimes that may not be immediately obvious and are only realized after a long period of time.

The company is similarly transparent regarding its all-risks insurance clause. As opposed to a conventional named perils policy an all-risks policy is not limited to only covering the specific risks outlined in the insuring agreement. This results in broader coverage and less risk assumed by the customer.

Another benefit of Chubb’s commercial crime coverage is the company’s commitment to covering costs like customer notification in case of a data breach. Notifying customers when their information has been put at risk can be a highly expensive task and Chubb’s ability to cover these costs can relieve you of an additional financial burden in an already difficult situation. This along with the services listed above ensures your peace of mind in case an electronic or physical crime is committed against your business.

The company’s NAIC complaint index is listed as 0.43 putting it far below the expected market index of 1.00 when it comes to complaints. This is a positive sign as it is indicative of the company’s low frequency of complaints when compared to other insurers.

Chubb’s extensive list of services and policy benefits mean that the company’s insurance packages tend to be more expensive than those of its competitors. This is part of the reason why Chubb’s coverage is often recommended for larger and mid-sized businesses with greater financial resources. However with Chubb you do get what you pay for. And even despite its more expensive policies we still recommend Chubb as offering the Best Commercial Crime Insurance Overall.

Hiscox (Best Crime Insurance for Small Businesses)

Hiscox Best for Small Business

Founded at the turn of the 20th century Hiscox has well over 100 years of experience in the insurance space and is one of the nation’s top providers of commercial policies. Offering broad coverage options Hiscox’s policies are an excellent choice for small businesses in nearly every state.

Pros Specializes in commercial insurance for small businesses

Strong reputation in claims handling

Broad employee definition when considering employee crimes Cons Coverage options aren’t ideal for larger organizations

Limited online tools

Throughout its long history Hiscox has zeroed in on small business insurance as its primary focus making it a popular choice for businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Today the company counts over 500000 customers offering specialized insurance plans for a number of professions. Hiscox holds a financial strength rating of A from both AM Best and Standard & Poor’s and an A+ rating from Fitch. The company also works with Feefo a third party platform that collects and manages small business owner reviews of Hiscox’s services. Public access to Feefo means that you can read through the company’s most recent feedback from customers.

When it comes to claims reporting Hiscox makes the process easy by offering online phone and mail options. If you purchased your policy through an agent you can also have them file a claim on your behalf. Hiscox has invested over $200M in claims expertise over the past five years with the goal of forming a robust network of 800 insurance claims specialists across the world including claims lawyers and adjusters. Filing and tracking a claim can be the most daunting part of protecting your business and Hiscox’s large community of claims experts is meant to take the burden off your shoulders by helping you through the entire process.

When it comes to commercial crime insurance specifically Hiscox has strong options for small businesses. Covering events ranging from employee theft to the cost of establishing the existence and amount of a loss Hiscox’s crime insurance policies are flexible and attuned to the changing nature of crime-related risk. The company’s broad definition of what constitutes an “employee” is one of its major pros especially when considering employee dishonesty and theft. Hiscox’s definition of an employee includes temporary and leased employees including former workers in consulting positions. Guest students interns uncompensated officers trustees volunteers and employees on medical leave also fall under its broad policy language. This makes Hiscox’s commercial crime coverage more flexible than that offered by many of its competitors.

While Hiscox is known for its focus on small businesses it may not be the best choice for larger organizations with more complex needs. One other small downside to note is that the company’s most recent NAIC complaint index came in at 1.14 which is slightly above the expected market average of 1.00. That said in 2019 Hiscox had a complaint index that was about 30% below average so we don’t consider this to be much of a concern.

Overall Hiscox is a highly reputable insurer committed to resolving the unique risks small businesses face. This expertise coupled with a strong claims handling department and flexible commercial crime coverage makes Hiscox our choice for having the Best Crime Insurance for Small Businesses.

Travelers (Best for Customer Service)

Travelers Best for Customer Service

A long successful history in the field and loyal customer base have made Travelers a household name in American insurance. Popular with owners of both small and large businesses Travelers offers a variety of coverage types including but certainly not limited to fidelity and crime insurance.

Pros 24/7 customer service access and claims reporting services

An extensive national network of agents

High ratings from both AM Best and Standard & Poor’s Cons No option to purchase coverage online

Lauded for both its expertise and range of coverage options for business owners Travelers is one of the country’s leading commercial insurers. With service options listed by industry and business size it’s easy to navigate your way to coverage tailored to your business via the Travelers website.

Travelers bundles fidelity and crime coverage into single policies providing broad protection from employee dishonesty and other crimes. The company offers a wide range of crime policies designed for both private and public companies as well as small/new businesses and nonprofits. This sample crime insurance agreement from Travelers can give you a general idea of what to expect after choosing a policy. Online risk management resources focusing on coverage options and common threats can help you further narrow down the specifics of your policy from Travelers.

The company’s 24/7 online claims center makes filing and checking on your claim simple especially if you take advantage of the provided Claim Guides beforehand. If you need assistance with filing a claim or just have questions about settling on a policy or billing Travelers customer service specialists are available 24/7.

The company’s national network of independent agents makes it easy to connect with a professional near you. However its lack of a streamlined online quote tool may turn off some customers who prefer to handle their business insurance online.

The company’s most recent rating from AM Best is A++ a superior score. AA ratings from both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s as well as an Aa2 score from Moody’s reaffirm Travelers’s financial strength and credible reputation. Further the company’s NAIC complaint index is 0.47 a figure indicating that Travelers receives far fewer customer complaints than its competitors.

While getting a quote from Travelers may not be immediate the company’s vast agent network and customer service availability surpasses expectations. Considering its strong financial ratings and excellent customer feedback we recommend Travelers as offering the Best Customer Experience.

For dissident heiress Abigail Disney inequality is well goofy. And for the many underpaid Disney employees we learn in her new documentary The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales the Magic Kingdom is more miserable than magical.

The film which premieres September 16 in Orlando Florida (near Disney World) and opens in theaters in selected cities on September 23 is an excoriating critique of the ruling class and the predatory profiteering of contemporary capitalism as filtered through the quintessentially all-American lens of her family business the Walt Disney Company. That’s part of what gives this extraordinary expose weight: it was co-made by the granddaughter and grandniece respectively of Roy and Walt Disney—creators of Mickey Mouse and an animated film legacy that has morphed into a multinational corporate empire of live action movies retail items and theme parks around the globe.

In the eighty-seven-minute documentary that she co-produced and directed with Kathleen Hughes Abigail blows the whistle on Disney’s enrichment of its CEO at the expense of impoverishing workers at the so-called “happiest place on Earth” criticizing the chief executive’s $66 million salary. “In other words a [Disneyland] custodian would have to work for 2000 years to make what Bob Iger makes in one” Abigail acidly notes. At one point Michael Eisner—who worked for Disney from 1984 to 2005—was the world’s highest paid CEO.

Expand Fork Films Stylistically animation in the documentary looks more like Monty Python than Pinocchio.

The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales follows four Disneyland staffers as they struggle mightily to make ends meet in pricey Orange County California on their $15-an-hour wages. Before and during the pandemic (which unleashed mass layoffs at Disney theme parks) the workers were forced to rely on food banks and government services to survive even as Iger his 2020 CEO successor Bob Chapek and other corporate bigwigs have raked in the kingdom’s treasure.

To weave her motion picture tapestry Abigail—who in addition to inheriting part of the family fortune has Walt’s storytelling panache—intercuts the trials and tribulations of the quartet of beleaguered Anaheim California theme park employees with her own fond memories growing up as a real-life Disney princess. Throughout the film we see her home movies archival footage news clips and animations plus interviews with thinkers who critique the Disney Company. Stylistically however the documentary’s cartoons look more like Monty Python than Pinocchio or Snow White.

The interviewees in The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales who all appear to be questioned by Abigail herself include experts on Disney and economic disparities including Peter Dreier Occidental College professor and co-author of Working for the Mouse: Inequality at Disneyland; film historian Neal Gabler who wrote Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination; Heather McGhee CUNY labor professor and author of The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together; Kurt Anderson author of Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America: A Recent History; and Harvard’s Rebecca Henderson author of Reimagining Capitalism in a World On Fire.

The publisher and editor-in-chief of Voice of OC Norberto Santana Jr. and Anaheim city council member Jose Moreno expose sweetheart deals that the city of Anaheim has cut with the Disney Company and more. In addition Abigail’s sister Susan Disney Lord also provides commentary and context that is skillfully interwoven with the John Steinbeck-like hard luck stories of the four Disneyland proletarians.

But this personal essay of a film goes beyond Disneyland with the Magic Kingdom serving as a microcosm of capitalism run amok unleashed by the laissez faire fetishism of future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell Jr. economist Milton Friedman and novelist Ayn Rand smoothing the way for the trickle-down economics of President Ronald Reagan’s unregulated free enterprise exaltation of profit above all else. The triumphant free marketeer is shown at the bell podium of the New York Stock Exchange in 1985—Reagan was in fact the first sitting President to ever visit the NYSE.

Abigail denounces this greed-is-good ethos as “The asshole-ification of America.” The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales boldly exposes and tackles the ruling class for its hyper-exploitation of the working class. McGhee asserts that “Stolen land stolen people and stolen labor is what our economy is based on.” Abigail steps up as an activist penning op-eds and appearing on media outlets such as CNBC where a host incredulously asks: “So you want higher taxes?”

The “patriotic millionaire” even takes her campaign for economic fairness to Congress where Abigail testifies before the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets—where we glimpse Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Maxine Waters. We learn in the film that the Disney Company secretly lobbied the Committee before Abigail’s appearance during which her policy proposals were denounced by Republicans as “socialism” and “communistic.” (Mickey McCarthyism anyone?)

Abigail denounces the greed-is-good ethos as “The asshole-ification of America.”

Since 2008 Abigail—president and CEO of Fork Films which produced this documentary—has been using her fortune and storytelling know-how to make left-leaning features and documentaries. These include 2019’s American Woman a dramatization starring Sarah Gadon as that other famous female class traitor a fictionalized Patty Hearst. The 2012 and 2020 documentaries The Invisible War which scored two Emmy Awards and On the Record took on the thorny topic of sexual harassment and abuse in respectively the military and the music industry. (An avowed feminist in The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales Abigail has a ring shaped like a clitoris that she says “I wear at the most patriarchal places.”)

Co-director Kathleen Hughes also worked with Abigail in 2015 on The Armor of Light a film about guns and abortion which won an Emmy. Hughes has received two other Emmys including one for the PBS/Bill Moyers investigation into the news media’s coverage of the Bush Administration’s rationale for the Iraq invasion in 2008’s Buying the War.

Their current film also touches on the topic of racism through what The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales dubs “white fear.” Movie historian Gabler argues that Disneyland sought to “discharge reality” and create a Caucasian-dominated “berm” to protect whites from the Civil Rights movement—or in other words a fairy tale of the American way. The documentary features clips of an Aunt Jemima character at Disneyland and also of stereotypically-depicted Indigenous people at the theme park’s Frontierland attraction.

“We’ve let the search for daily bread and other things completely overwhelm what our ancestors called our ‘souls’ ” Rebecca Henderson muses onscreen. Abigail describes bearing the Disney name as “like having a weird superpower you didn’t ask for” and admits that in “my privileged life I felt complicit.” But by using the advantages platforms skills and “superpowers” bestowed upon her by the family she was born into Abigail has built a new filmmaking tradition—one that holds her family accountable in the larger scheme of late capitalism.

Abigail Disney has betrayed Mickey Mouse and the ruling class perhaps tying with Jane Fonda as America’s most famous active activist class traitor. With this latest film the heiress is again biting the hand—or rather the claw—that has fed her to help change things for those low-wage Disneyland employees and other workers forced to partake of food banks and food stamps in order to keep the fairy tale alive.

The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales’ theatrical release starts September 16 at Orlando near Disneyworld. For more info on other screenings and the film see: https://americandreamdoc.com/."

LeGrand Coffee House of Woodbridge New Jersey won the club's Buy Black Partnership for the 2022-23 NHL season.

MARKET SIZE: In Ottawa Bruce Garrioch reported NHL teams “could be demanding"" $4-10M per season to wear a logo on their jerseys ""depending on the size of the market.” After wearing stickers on helmets the last two years “to help recover lost revenues during COVID-19 this was a natural next step.” While initially there was “some outrage on social media over the decision by one of the NHL’s Original Six teams to sell ad space it was nearly forgotten within the hour after the Habs announced Nick Suzuki had been named the 31st captain in franchise history.” That was “a piece of brilliant media management by the Habs’ public relations department” but there “will be a reminder the RBC logo is there every time a player pulls on the ‘CH’ at home -- and Montreal won’t be the only NHL team to cash in on the brand.” This is “an expensive space and this isn’t something that a small company can get involved with so finding a buyer hasn’t been easy.” Teams in Canada for example “already have deals with big companies like Bell Canada Rogers Communications or brewers like Molson and Labatt’s.” There is talk that “just over"" 50% of NHL teams ""have actually been able to get a sponsor for jerseys and this has turned out to be a little more work than maybe league officials expected” (OTTAWA SUN 9/15).

HURRICANE SEASON: The HOCKEY NEWS' Mike Stephens noted the Hurricanes “became the latest NHL team to adopt a retro look this summer” as the club officially unveiled its third jerseys for the 2022-23 season on Thursday “commemorating the organization's 25th anniversary by paying homage to the uniforms worn by the 2005-06 team that won the franchise's first Stanley Cup.” The club is “making efforts to ensure that the colors they donned upon their inception into the NHL back in 1997 will remain present moving forward.” The primary color is red with this alternate uniform “ensuring that the branding that fans are accustomed to stays intact despite the change.” The Hurricanes will don their new alternate uniforms “for 12 different games throughout the coming 2022-23 NHL season” (THEHOCKEYNEWS.com 9/15).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2RjdGhlYXRlcmFydHMub3JnLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvZnJlZS1jdXJ0YWluLXVwLWJyb2Fkd2F5LWZlc3RpdmFsLXJldHVybnMtdG8tdGltZXMtc3F1YXJlLWZvci10aHJlZS1kYXlzLW9mLXN0YXItc3R1ZGRlZC1ldmVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free 'Curtain Up Broadway Festival' returns to Times Square for three days of star-studded events,"The upcoming Curtain Up Broadway Festival will bring more than fifteen free interactive public events and live performances to the heart of NYC from Times Square to Duffy Square between 45th and 48th Streets on Broadway.

CPSE ETF is among the best performing mutual funds in the last one year. The outstanding performance is attributed to the rally in PSU stocks recently. The CPSE ETF has offered 35% returns in the last one year 16% in 6-months and 11.54% returns in three months. Mutual fund analysts say that this performance may continue for some more time.The entire basket of funds betting on PSU stocks has seen a big uptick. The category has offered 21.54% returns in one year and 17.52% in the last three months. The schemes have offered returns in the range of 14-35% with CPSE ETF topping the charts. The stellar performance of the fund is also attributed to the recent upward rally seen in the commodity and energy prices.For those who don’t know CPSE ETF was created to help the Government of India in its initiative to dis-invest some of its stake in selected CPSEs through the ETF route. The ETF is based on Nifty CPSE index and includes 11 listed Central Public Sector Enterprises and is managed by Nippon India Mutual Fund. At the moment the ETF has a majority allocation to the energy sector. Here’s the current holding of the scheme:Source: Value ResearchMutual Fund analysts believe that the CPSE stocks are seeing a strong earnings growth. They believe that this kind of growth is seen once in a decade. However they believe that the rally might not be sustainable in the long term.“PSU stocks are seeing a strong earnings tailwind. These stocks were very cheap till last year. Stocks in sectors like thermal power coal and PSU banks were trading at a very attractive valuation. Recently the value theme has also come back to the spotlight. That has also benefited these stocks. All the companies in the CPSE ETFs give high dividends and are available at a cheap value. So the entire segment saw a turnaround especially the CPSE ETF” says Ashutosh Bhargava Fund Manager and Head Equity Research Nippon India Mutual Fund.Analysts say that the PSU segment suffered from the mainstreaming of the ESG theme globally in the last couple of years. Recently after the war in Ukraine supply shortage and energy demands have become bigger and hence globally ESG has been set aside for some time. This has helped some of the PSU companies in India.“Many PSU stocks that make a part of the CPSE ETF portfolio also had suffered due to strict ESG mandates. These companies fare low on environmental scores and a lot of times on social governance also. There is also an underownership in these companies. Even though the fundamentals are strong for the short term the rally is not sustainable for a longer term because of the innate issues” says Ashutosh BhargavaMutual fund advisors believe that the CPSE ETF is as risky as a sectoral fund. The ETF has 83% of the portfolio concentrated towards the energy and commodity sector PSEs. Advisors say that PSUs and PSEs have a governance structure that becomes a problem a lot of times. Hence tactical play into these schemes is not a good idea for retail investors.“The Nifty CPSE TRI has failed to beat the Nifty 50 TRI in terms of returns and consistency over the long term. Investing in PSEs is a cyclical play and has to be taken as a tactical bet in ones portfolio. PSEs can be more vulnerable than private entities at times. Apart from the earnings of the companies macro economic factors and government policies can have a strong impact on the business which may not be in favor of the company's growth and its shareholders. With the cheap valuations in the PSE segment investors should not get carried away. Currently I would not recommend investors to venture in this product and recommend a product which is well diversified and consistent” says Rushabh Desai Founder Rupee With Rushabh Investment Services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9zbWJzdG9yeS9ha3N1bS10cmFkZW1hcnQtc2NhYXMtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXNlcnZpY2UtbXNtZS1zbWUtY29ycG9yYXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How this SCaaS company aims to build a bridge between MSMEs and corporates,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9zbWJzdG9yeS9ha3N1bS10cmFkZW1hcnQtc2NhYXMtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLXNlcnZpY2UtbXNtZS1zbWUtY29ycG9yYXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394F8C5DE0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

“We understand that growing a business is hard. Business leaders are juggling many priorities and often cannot attend to them all” said MTN Group Enterprise Business Unit Executive Tumi Chamayou. “MTN Business’s role is to assist them do the things that make an impact and support their growth helping them get it done better.”

MTN Business provides the tools to shift small medium and large enterprises and multinational corporations and those in the public sector to being modern connected and digital. These include converged ICT – managed network services; cloud services; unified communications; security solutions; and Internet of Things – as well as connectivity (mobile and fixed).

Chamayou said the plan was for MTN Business to become the empowering leading ICT expert providing value to enterprise clients. Among our customer base we already have more than four million enterprises who are instrumental in contributing to Africa’s economic growth.

She said MTN Business also had a key role to play in realising the MTN Group’s Ambition 2025: Leading digital solutions for Africa’s progress: “Building the largest and most valuable platforms is one of Ambition 2025’s four strategic priorities. Enterprise Services is one of MTN’s five platform businesses and operates under the ‘MTN Business’ brand.”

Ambition 2025 targets MTN Group enterprise revenue of more than R30 billion by 2025. This compares to R16.6 billion in 2021. In the first six months of 2022 enterprise revenue accelerated increasing by 26.8%* in constant currency terms to R9.9 billion. This was driven largely by MTN Business growth in South Africa Nigeria Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.

African enterprises have a valuable role to play in addressing the continent’s most pressing challenges by providing much-needed jobs products and services. World Bank data shows that SMEs contribute up to 60% of all employment and as much as 40% of the GDP in emerging economies. This makes them the cornerstone of most economies in Africa.

“We want to be the business enabler of choice in Africa meeting the communication and ICT demands of business clients throughout the continent” said Chamayou. “With a customer-centric approach to providing cutting-edge services we are doing this by leveraging our brand and advanced network as well our strong customer base of top companies across sub-Saharan Africa.”"

The acquisition includes all the assets of Indianapolis-based Storage Express including 107 self-storage properties across Indiana Ohio Illinois and Kentucky and 14 future development sites. It also included the purchase of E-Tracker a storage software operating platform that supports Storage Express locations.

""In addition to increased scale this acquisition provides a new growth channel for Extra Space Storage to add smaller remote-managed stores in both new and existing markets through acquisition and third-party management” Joe Margolis CEO of Salt Lake City-based Extra Space Storage said in a statement.

Ronald Camden REIT analyst for Morgan Stanley Research views the acquisition as supportive to growth for Extra Space Storage.

“External growth gaining more scale and improving the technology on the platform is positive” Camden wrote in a note to clients. Extra Space Storage ""has been adding multiple growth channels via third party management bridge lending and the recent creative storage acquisition such as Storage Express [with its] smaller remote-managed stores.”

Occupancy at self-storage facilities has been near long-term highs since the pandemic. Demand has come from households downsizing and moving and people who are working or running businesses from home and need to declutter to create space to work.

Jefferson Shreve founder and owner of Storage Express will join the board of Extra Space Storage.

The company’s ability to re-imagine itself and its gaming form factors over the decades have kept it not just relevant but on the forefront of innovation and technology advancements in gaming.

The Switch handheld game console started as a small form factor device that had removeable controllers and was ultra-portable. The iteration of the Nintendo Switch OLED changes the form factor once again to make it larger but with a higher resolution better looking display. What it makes up with in improved looks it sacrifices in portability with a dedicated larger screen and docking station.

While a user could still carry it in a backpack or other case the original smaller switch is an easier load. However once again Nintendo is offering up different form factors and experiences for its gaming consoles by continuing to adapt its products to fit differing preferences in the consumer electronics market.

Powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1 GPU and with 4 GB of SDRAM the Nintendo Switch OLED gaming console is no slouch with performance power and a capacitive touchscreen that helps navigating through games or online stores easier.

The X65 chip can be seen on the logic board in a teardown of the iPhone 14 Pro. We're still in the process of confirming whether the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also have the X65 but all models within a series typically share the same modem.

iPhone 14 Pro teardown confirms the inclusion of Qualcomm's X65 modem

Qualcomm announced the X65 modem in February 2021 with power efficiency improvements resulting in improved battery life while using 5G. In addition the X65 modem is the world's first 10 Gigabit 5G modem and antenna system for smartphones enabling theoretical data speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. In May 2021  Qualcomm updated its X65 Snapdragon modem with wider mmWave spectrum support.

The power efficiency improvements of both the X65 modem and A16 Bionic chip contribute to longer battery life on iPhone 14 Pro models. A battery test earlier this week claimed that the iPhone 14 Pro Max lasted two hours longer than the iPhone 13 Pro Max from last year.

""I lost my mom to breast cancer eight years ago and I just battled it myself in December"" Redd said.

As a survivor Redd's making it her mission to raise money to help fund cancer research. Thursday she teamed up with 717 South restaurant to host a fundraising event. Danielle said seeing others join the fight against cancer is a huge part of her motivation.

""It inspires me to continue raising money for more research so we don’t have to continue watching people suffer through this horrible cancer"" Redd said before smiling. ""Looking forward to fundraising a lot.""

Redd and 717 South owner Michael Stewart enlisted the help of an old friend to aid in the money-raising effort. A friend who's a pro wrestling icon and a 16-world champion.

""We love doing guest bartender events and who better than Mr. Ric Flair?"" Stewart said. ""All the money raised with tips at the bar is going to this charity.""

""There’s no pleasure like supporting people that have health issues"" Flair said before the event kicked off. ""Having had serious ones myself they can be hard. And cancer is a terrible terrible disease.""

Flair said he's just happy to see Danielle be able to keep fighting after beating the toughest opponent of her life.

""It’s unbelievable. To see her come back. To be around her as traumatized as she was before she had the surgery"" he continued. ""To see her bounce back like this. It’s worth every minute of it to be here with her by her side.""

Redd's event raised more than $10000 and she has a team assembled to walk in the American Cancer Society's ""Making Strides Against Breast Cancer"" event on October 29th at Raymond James Stadium.

She also has no intention of slowing down.

""We all know someone that has had it or has it right now. So hopefully we can make a difference"" Redd said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L3NlZS1zZWFzb24tMy1lcGlzb2RlLTQtcmVjYXAtdGhlLXN0b3JtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""See"" recap: Manure rain and still no war","It's hard to know what to make of ""See."" The show is unrelentingly dark both in story theme and visuals with many scenes so dim it's difficult not to feel like it's all supposed to be a metaphor. The Apple TV+ series is about a future where a deadly virus has resulted in most people in the world being blind. Those very few born with sight are considered alternatively as witches or as saviors to disabled people.

As The A.V. Club writes ""That vision would be considered a super power to blind people who have managed to restore civilization without it — smacks of ableism but that isn't 'See's' only trouble."" It has a blindness consultant. (And disability consulting is unfortunately some of the lowest-paid work in television and film.) The show also boasts of a large blind cast and actors who are low vision though none of them appear to be in leading or major roles which are played by seeing actors with eyes digitally altered by special effects.

It's somewhat depressing that this is considered a huge step for disability in Hollywood but here we are with Jason Momoa as Baba Voss the leader of a dystopian blind tribe and adopted father of young adult twins who can see. Their mother Maghra (Hera Hilmar) was pregnant by the mysterious Jerlamarel (Joshua Henry) a kind of seeing prophet with not the greatest intentions when she first stumbled into the tribe's encampment. Last season Jerlamarel was killed as was beloved elder Paris (the great Alfre Woodard) and this season started with the characters once a tight family unit scattered.

""See"" is on its third and final season and we're headed for an ending as seemingly dark as its beginning. Episode 4 both sets characters off on their own journeys and by the end brings some back together.

Sibeth (Sylvia Hoeks) formerly known as the queen escapes and covers herself in animal manure to get past guard dogs. It's not pleasant but neither has most of her reign been. With dramatic piano chords benefitting ""The Phantom of the Opera"" she wanders in the woods.

The show is best when it's groups of people bantering in the woods as opposed to wallowing in damp industrial buildings.

Momoa's Baba Voss is really great at two things: fighting people and being a good dad. Now he's a great grandad to ""a boy named Wolffe and a dog named No."" He leaves his dog at first reluctant to have the companion all but now beloved and proven guarding his grandson whose reluctant father is Kofun (Archie Madekwe). Kofun of course was seduced by the former queen Sibeth who is both older creepy and happens to be his aunt. How ""House of the Dragon"" of them. Kofun feels guilty for helping Sibeth to hide before her escape.

Archie Madekwe and Nesta Cooper in ""See"" (Apple TV+)

Baba Voss Kofun Haniwa (Nesta Cooper) the likable Wren (Eden Epstein) and the hilarious Charlotte (Olivia Cheng) set off to rescue Jerlamarel's kids. The show is best when it's groups of people bantering in the woods as opposed to wallowing in damp industrial buildings so it's nice to see the band head off on a merry side quest. Time in the woods allows Baba Voss and Kofun to have a heart to heart. Baba Voss is good at those too. ""Stay alive my boy"" he advises before slapping him on his wound.

Animal manure is a recurring theme this episode.

Meanwhile Ambassador Trovere (Trieste Kelly Dunn) and Lord Harlan (Tom Mison) are off on their own flirting. Oops Harlan has fallen in love with the woman he was forced to marry new queen Maghra. He breaks off from the ambassador and heads with ""some associates"" to sneak into the city.

Baba Voss takes his group to the site of Bow Lion's death. The sighted kids examine the damage made by new-fangled explosions and Baba Voss convinces Ranger to join their cause by invoking the name of Tormada the scientist who created the bombs that killed so many already.

Michael Raymond-James and Jason Momoa in ""See"" (Apple TV+)

Animal manure is a recurring theme this episode as Harlan sneaks into Trovere's city whilst hiding in a rattling wagon of livestock. ""Did it have to be chickens?"" he asks like someone from another century who knows of ""Indiana Jones. ""

Sibeth struggles to make it alone in the wilderness doing an admirable job of smacking her lips after eating insects off a log while Harlan in his storyline delivers news of the advanced weapons headed the city's way. Sibeth's not actually alone either as there are wolves in these here woods. Mad scientist Tormada makes his case for explosions in front of the council. A demonstration is apparently in order. Harlan won't stop talking long enough to escape. I mean he just wants the details.

Harlan makes it but much of the council do not and the lord realizes that the sexy ambassador was in on it the whole time though she swears she didn't have a choice. She gives Harlan a choice though to ""live at the top of the new order."" But Harlan is nothing if not stubborn.

Sylvia Hoeks in ""See"" (Apple TV+)

It rains on Sibeth the show perhaps finally deciding that her character is more camp than anything else. And there's more than one ""Indiana Jones"" nod in this episode with Indy's least favorite reptile finding our least favorite royal. Sibeth's more Rasputin than queen as she apparently lives to be annoying another day.

We get an insight into the bomb factory where some of Jerlamarel's children are forced to work. Time for Baba Voss to work his magic and the women too who rescue the children. Maghra fights in her administrative way which is asking for a vote to finally begin an official battle.

""See"" keeps threatening war and perhaps like the downpour on Sibeth (and Maghra who's waiting vainly for her lost sister outside and on Baba Voss in his own storyline) the bombs mean it finally will rain firepower upon the fractured kingdoms.

4 Reviews

After several painful years of inflated desktop GPU prices gamers around the world are anxiously awaiting the official reveal and subsequent release of Nvidia's next-gen GeForce RTX 4000 series of graphics cards. While these cards are rumored to offer some noticeable performance gains in some cases prospective buyers of these next-gen GPUs will unfortunately have one less reputable AIB brand to choose from.

According to corresponding reports by Tom's Hardware and a video published by the popular tech YouTuber Gamers Nexus the California-based GPU maker EVGA will cease its collaboration with Nvidia immediately and therefore won't produce any of the aforementioned RTX 4000 cards. The company cites several business-related reasons for this drastic and quite surprising decision. EVGA for example claims that Nvidia withheld crucial information like the official MSRP and the eventual costs of its latest GPU chipsets until after the official reveal.

Furthermore EVGA apparently complained about price ceilings as well as limited customization options which make it increasingly difficult to compete against Nvidia's first-party graphics cards that are sold under the ""Founders Edition"" moniker. Aside from its decision not to carry the soon-to-be-released RTX 4000 series EVGA assured its existing customers that it will continue to support current-gen GPUs and that the associated warranties will also be honored. The company has apparently withheld a certain number of graphics cards in order to replace defective units.

Last but not least EVGA announced that it does not seek a collaboration with AMD which unfortunately means that one of the most recognizable brands on the GPU market will indeed vanish completely as GeForce RTX 4000 cards will slowly replace their respective predecessors over the next few years. Please refer to Gamer Nexus' comprehensive video for further information and details on this developing story.

One of Nvidia’s biggest partners that gamers and PC builders will be familiar with EVGA has now cited “disrespectful treatment” on Nvidia’s part and announced that the company will be completely exiting the GPU business.

The story came out when Steve Burke Editor-in-Chief at Gamers Nexus released a new video where Burke reports discussions held with EVGA CEO Andrew Han. The video suggests that EVGA will not be joining forces with Nvidia rivals AMD or Intel either and will simply not be making GPUs after the stock of the existing RTX 30-series is sold out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ldmdhLWRvbmUtbWFraW5nLWdwdXMtbnZpZGlhcy1mYXVsdC_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvZXZnYS1kb25lLW1ha2luZy1ncHVzLW52aWRpYXMtZmF1bHQvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA is done making GPUs and reports say it’s because of Nvidia,"Among Nvidia’s 3rd-party GPU manufacturers EVGA is perhaps the most famous. The brand is well known for high-quality RTX and GTX graphics cards with generous consumer policies as well as power supplies coolers and motherboards. The partnership between Nvidia and EVGA which lasted over two decades is now over however and not only will EVGA stop making Nvidia GPUs it has no plans on making any GPUs ever again. It’s not a clean breakup either.

EVGA Terminates NVIDIA Partnership Cites Disrespectful Treatment

In a statement to Gamers Nexus which broke the news EVGA stated “this is not a financial decision it is a principled decision.” EVGA has accused Nvidia of keeping partners out of the loop on future products cutting GPU prices without warning and limiting what prices GPUs can be set at. According to an Nvidia staff member who spoke to Gamers Nexus Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sometimes wonders “why are these guys [EVGA and other Nvidia partners] making money when they’re not doing much?”

One of the main issues is that Nvidia sells its own Founder’s Edition models for significantly less than models from partners. EVGA reportedly loses hundreds of dollars on each RTX 3080 3090 and 3090 Ti it sells as it needs to cut prices to remain competitive with Nvidia. That figure only considers manufacturing however.

Although EVGA says this isn’t a financial decision finances are certainly at play. Jon Peddie Research noted that the gross margin for Nvidia has continued to increase year after year while the already small margin for GPU partner companies has declined. In its 2022 estimate Jon Peddie Research believes Nvidia will see about 65% gross margin for its entire business while AIB partners will just see 5%. Declining margins are down to increasing costs for production R&D and marketing. According to Jon Peddie Research making up low margins on volume is no longer appealing.

Gamers Nexus was skeptical of EVGA’s story however. In its report host Steve Burke suggest the company was probably ordering too many GPUs during the crypto boom and could have gotten burned by the sudden decline in mining. Burke notes that something similar happened with its RTX 20-series GPUs when the company lost money in the six-digit range.

EVGA CEO Andrew Han might also have personal reasons for ending the partnership. Gamers Nexus says that Han who is in his 60s and has been CEO since EVGA was founded in 2000 wants to spend more time with his family as he approaches retirement and feels that Nvidia’s allegedly disrespectful attitude is no longer worth the trouble.

EVGA isn’t going out of business yet

Although 78% of EVGA’s revenue is derived from its graphics business the company says it will continue to operate its other ventures. The company’s next largest venture is power supplies and while it only makes up 20% of EVGA’s revenue it has four times the gross margin of its graphics business. Losing the vast majority of its revenue is still problematic however though EVGA explicitly denied that there would be any layoffs.

Han also denied he would sell EVGA. The company is apparently in a healthy financial position. Furthermore the CEO didn’t want to deprecate EVGA’s reputation by selling it to another company that might only be interested in profit.

While EVGA could potentially partner up with AMD or Intel to preserve its AIB GPU business the company has make it clear that it will not be making any GPUs in the future. Gamers Nexus speculates that EVGA’s CEO might have personal reasons for not wanting to pursue a partnership with Nvidia’s competitors similar to his personal reasons for terminating the partnership with Nvidia.

As for existing EVGA GPUs the company confirmed it would honor warranties and RMAs as long as supplies last. Its supply of RTX 30-series cards will run out by the end of the year however and it’s not certain how easy it will then be for EVGA to uphold its warranties whether or not the company is willing.

The situation in Pakistan is the deadliest in a wave of extreme weather linked to climate change that is contributing to exceptional volatility in fashion’s supply chains. For now cotton is at the epicentre of upheaval.

“With climate patterns becoming more erratic there is serious risk on the supply of cotton” said Rui Fontoura an expert at Textile Exchange a sustainable fibre-focussed non-profit organisation.

In India the world’s largest cotton producer rainfall and pests caused such a dent in supply that the country has had to turn to imports. In the US and Brazil — the world’s third and fourth cotton producers respectively — drought has ravaged crops.

The issues aren’t just climate-change related. A US law that went into effect this summer tightened a ban on imports from China’s cotton-producing Xinjiang territory where the Chinese government is accused by Western nations of detaining Uighur muslims and other ethnic minorities in forced labour camps.

Together India China Pakistan Brazil and the United States make up the top five growers of cotton. Coinciding trouble in each and every region spells unprecedented disruption for the textile industry.

Preparing for the Unknown

The worst of the shortage won’t be felt until 2024 according to Textile Exchange’s Fontoura.

But retailers can prepare today by stocking up on supply earlier strengthening their relationships with suppliers leveraging data to better predict demand and investing in the circular economy to reduce dependence on new production. That’s the case across the supply chain with the forces buffeting cotton part of a wider climate of uncertainty.

For instance Zara-owner Inditex told analysts on an earnings call Wednesday that it will temporarily increase production to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions in the next six months.

Chief executive Oscar García did not point to a specific segment in the supply chain but said that the decision involves manufacturing in Asia the Financial Times reported.

In the case of cotton experts don’t yet know the full impact of this summer’s climate disasters or of restrictions on imports from China. The European Union proposed its own ban on products made with forced labour this week.

Broader global instability is feeding into the climate of uncertainty. Fluctuations in the oil price as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for instance has kept demand for polyester low. That could in turn put more pressure on cotton demand at a time of restricted supply.

Still there are ways to account for the unknown. Using data analytics to better plan for and manage inventory is one solution though a product that could predict the future on all fronts of the supply chain doesn’t exist yet.

“Improving flexibility and agility should be a priority for this year” said Sheng Lu associate professor at University of Delaware’s Fashion and Apparel Studies department.

Lu recommends for example cultivating strong relationships with suppliers and vendors so that even if disruptions occur brands can rely on their partners to come through.

“In the long run it’s about how to make the industry more sustainable” he said.

Still the single-dose antibody—which will sport the brand name Beyfortus—has much to prove amid the prospect of oncoming competition.

Friday the European Medicines Agency’s human medicines committee CHMP vouched for approval of Beyfortus. The drug is in the running to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season and—if approved—would become the first single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population. That includes babies born healthy at term or preterm or with specific health conditions AstraZeneca and Sanofi said.

After the CHMP endorsement it's widely expected the European Commission will sign off on final approval.

Stateside a Sanofi spokesperson recently told Fierce Pharma a U.S. regulatory submission is planned for the “second half of 2022.” The French drugmaker also aims to roll out an RSV disease awareness consumer campaign in the U.S. timed to RSV awareness month in October.

Beyfortus could eventually reap peak sales of $3 billion Jefferies analysts have predicted. Evaluate Vantage for its part recently cited a consensus forecast of $700 million in 2026.

While the drug will likely score approvals commercial uptake remains an open question because the drug didn't meet its secondary endpoint of reducing RSV-related hospitalizations versus placebo in a phase 2/3 trial Evaluate Vantage notes.

Meanwhile RSV looks poised to become a hotly contested field over the next several years.

Aside from Pfizer and GSK the RSV development landscape is further crowded by efforts from the likes of Novavax Merck & Co. and Regeneron Sanofi pointed out in an investor presentation on nirsevimab.

Pfizer leading the RSV vaccine race recently posted positive data on its shot prospect RSVpreF in adults ages 60 years and older. The company plans to file for approval in that population this fall. In a more direct challenge to AZ and Sanofi’s antibody Pfizer is also testing its vaccine candidate in pregnant women to help protect their babies from RSV after birth.

GSK also chalked up a win for its vaccine candidate RSVPreF3 in older adults back in June but on the childhood protection front the company recently had to pause phase 3 studies over safety concerns.

Back to Beyfortus CHMP’s blessing was based on data from the antibody’s clinical program which found the drug led to a statistically significant reduction in occurrence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV compared to placebo. In June Sanofi and AZ unveiled results from a phase 2/3 safety and tolerability assessment that showed the med performed on par with AZ’s RSV incumbent Synagis.

Synagis also known as palivizumab was first approved in 1998. AstraZeneca acquired the drug in its $15.6 billion MedImmune takeover back in 2007. Synagis is currently the only drug cleared in Europe to offer passive protection against RSV Pharmaphorum reports. Synagis is administered monthly during the five-month RSV season whereas a single dose of Beyfortus could provide protection throughout the stretch presenting a large convenience edge for the new med.

Once a blockbuster Synagis brought home $410 million for AstraZenca in 2021.

RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants as well as a leading cause of infant hospitalizations Sanofi and AZ said. Worldwide there were an estimated 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infection in 2019 leading to more than 3 million hospitalizations.

Those flimsy grocery bags shrink-wrap packaging and of course bottles — lots and lots of bottles.

Every year we toss out 2.5 million plastic bottles.

""They are highly recyclable and it's imperative they end up in your recycling bin"" Republic Services External Communications Manager Jeremy Walters said.

Together we create 400 million tons of plastic waste a year. Only 2 million tons of that gets recycled. We used to do better but during the pandemic our recycling rate dropped because we started making more garbage.

""It's how much trash is generated versus how much recycling is generated. And when that trash starts to go up the recycling volumes start to dilute"" Walters continued.

Las Vegas is a city known for excess— huge hotels and big casinos. It also has the largest residential recycling plant in the country.

Republic Services recycles 2 million pounds every day which is the equivalent weight of 500 cars. Workers at the massive plant sort the mixed recyclables plastics aluminum glass and paper and remove the wish-cycle items which are things we wish we could recycle but can't.

""Bowling balls shoes engine blocks steel security doors—I promise you if you use your imagination we've seen it here"" Walters said.

Paper is easily the most recycled item — 50 million tons of it per year and we also break down and recycle almost all of our cardboard boxes. More than 90% of those boxes get recycled.

There is plenty that doesn't get recycled though. Approximately 110 million glass bottles get thrown away every year. Glass can be recycled indefinitely—same with aluminum— but we still don't recycle about seven million tons a year. And then there are all those plastic bottles.

All the trash that we create which does not go through recycling plants ends up in landfills.

Now Let's Nationalize the Railroads.,"Money wasn’t the sticking point. A Presidential Emergency Board proposed the 24 percent pay hike in July. (The unions requested 31 percent the railroads offered 17 percent and the emergency board split the difference.) The point of dispute was that the railroads were imposing Dickensian work rules governing time off. Workers were required to be on call 24/7. If they declined an assignment they lost points. The workers started with about 30 points. If they took a sick day they lost (according to a 2021 Union Pacific document) between three and eight points. If they declined an assignment for some other reason they lost 10 points. If they burned through all their points within a 90-day period the workers were subject to disciplinary proceedings.

The unions were demanding more predictable schedules. They were particularly incensed that workers were penalized for doctor visits and medical procedures—during a Covid pandemic no less. In the end the railroads agreed to an additional paid day off and to allow workers to go to the doctor or get a medical procedure done without having to forfeit points. The points system itself though remains in place.

Perhaps you’re wondering—and if you aren’t you certainly should be—why an industry that’s supposed to pride itself on predictable schedules for train departures and arrivals can’t produce predictable schedules for its workers. You probably have some quaint picture in your head—perhaps the Stage Manager in Our Town examining his pocket watch as Shorty Watkins down at the depot watches the Albany train pull in. Passenger service still operates like that (or is supposed to) but not freight. Freight schedules are pure chaos and the railroads aren’t willing to employ enough workers to make that chaos even minimally functional. Instead the railroads cut the Class I workforce by 29 percent over the past six years a net loss of about 45000 employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL21hcnJpb3R0cy1maXJzdC1sdXh1cnktYWxsLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1yZXNvcnQtZGVidXRzLWluLWRvbWluaWNhbi1yZXB1YmxpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott's First Luxury All-Inclusive Resort Debuts In Dominican Republic,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

RMD,ResMed,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy52YS5nb3YvMTA4OTEwL3BoaWxpcHMtcGFwLW1hc2tzLXJlY2FsbGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philips PAP masks with magnetic closures recalled - VA News,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a recall of Philips Respironics Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP/Bi-PAP) masks with magnetic closures. The magnets in the recalled masks may affect certain metallic medical devices or metallic objects in the body presenting a potential risk. Masks with magnets made by other companies are not included in the recall.

“We want to ensure that any Veteran using one of the Philips CPAP or Bi-PAP masks with magnetic closures does not have an implanted medical device that can be impacted by magnets” said Dr. Charles Atwood VHA acting national program director for Sleep Medicine. “This warning is extended to anyone in close proximity when the mask is in use such as bed partners.”

Magnet closure concerns

The magnetic closures for these masks can cause implanted medical devices to malfunction if they are within six inches of implanted metallic medical devices. These implanted medical devices can include pacemakers implantable cardioverter defibrillators neurostimulators magnetic metallic implants/electrodes/valves (placed in upper limbs torso or higher) cerebral spinal fluid shunts (e.g. ventriculo peritoneal shunt) embolic coils magnetic denture attachments certain magnetic metallic implants and others. A list of devices that may be impacted is on the FDA website.

If you have a mask with magnets and are concerned about interference with implanted devices the magnets can be removed and the Velcro strap will fit through the empty magnet space. You can contact your care provider to order plastic replacement clips or a different mask.

The masks included in the recall are Amara View Full Face Mask DreamWisp Nasal Mask DreamWear Full Face Mask Wisp and Wisp Youth Nasal Mask and the Therapy Mask 3100 NC/SP. VA has a hold on distributing these masks until updated warning labels are added or care providers confirm that the Veteran does not have one of the implanted devices noted in the recall.

Veteran outreach

This issue impacts patients nationwide with an implanted device who wear Philips masks with a magnetic closure including their partners and other loved ones who are within close proximity while the mask is in use. VA is working to contact patients who have been issued the affected Philips Respironics masks by a VA provider.

If you have an implanted magnetic medical device and use a Philips Respironics CPAP or Bi-PAP mask with a magnet contact your care team for a replacement. Veterans who have general issues or concerns can contact the Philips Customer Care Solutions Center at +1-800-345-6443.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the course of the last six seasons the show has developed a reputation for being ruthless; any character can die at any given time. This has become an integral aspect of the show and – according to series creator Robert Kirkman – essential for the show’s continued success.

During an appearance and Bravo’s Inside The Actors Studio Kirkman explained the importance of the show regularly killing off characters:

I wrote the comic for like eight years before the show even existed and uh you know I like to say ‘people gots to die’ because you never want to lose that--what you were talking about--you know if you go too long a period with characters surviving and being safe then you lose that element of ‘oh my god any of these characters could go at any moment.’ That is a tremendously powerful engine that drives this whole thing and it is emotional.

The Walking Dead has always worked best when it runs at a frantic pace and keeps the stakes high. Robert Kirkman seems to recognize this ingredient to success and realizes that nobody can be safe in order for the show to remain popular with fans. The knowledge that anyone can die at any time – even fan favorite Daryl Dixon – keeps the show running at a fever pitch and provides an experience unlike any other show on television with the possible exception of Game of Thrones. While Season 6 has featured an incredibly high body count none of the dead have included anyone particularly popular from the show’s core group of characters. Robert Kirkman’s words may foreshadow some major deaths to come sometime before the end of Season 6.

Of course it makes sense that the show plays it somewhat safer than the comic book source material. Killing off live-action characters left and right presents a much bigger logistical challenge for a TV show than a graphic novel because in a book all Kirkman has to do is write that character out of existence. Robert Kirkman’s statement seems incredibly important because it points towards a recognition that the show has kept too many characters safe for too long and that the death and devastation inherent in the comics may soon become more prominent in the series.

We will just have to wait and see if The Walking Dead keeps true to its spirit and starts dropping more bodies during the second half of Season 6. The series will return to the schedule on AMC on Sunday February 14 at 9 p.m. ET. Stay tuned for more details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9sYXN0LXF1YXJ0ZXItbW9vbi1zZXB0LTE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See the last quarter moon of September 2022 tonight (Sept. 17),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.space.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /last-quarter-moon-sept-17 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FB0B670>, 'Connection to www.space.com timed out.

Sports fans will have another location on the Strip to grab their favorite team-branded merchandise or athletic gear.

Lids opened its two-story flagship store at the Showcase mall next door to MGM Grand on Friday — making the 12000-square-foot location its largest store yet. It will host a week of grand opening activations Oct. 3-7.

“This is a premier location … essentially the same thing as like Times Square is kind of what we’re trying to recreate here in Vegas” said Michael Mottram general manager of the Las Vegas store. “This is going to be the top ornament on top of the tree for us.”

The store’s exterior is covered in digital screens showcasing its products and inside two large LED screens play prime-time games.

Lids said the shop will carry more than 50000 units of apparel accessories and sports merchandise including officially licensed products from the Las Vegas Raiders Aces and Golden Knights. It also carries autographed merchandise from professional and collegiate teams.

The store has its “Custom Zones” where shoppers can create custom embroidered jerseys hats and other products.

There are also plans to host events at the store such as athlete signings.

This is the third flagship store for Lids and it’s part of a larger expansion plan to open 40 stores in the U.S. and 40 international locations by the end of 2022 according to Lids spokeswoman Christy Distefano.

The company chose Las Vegas because of the city’s high visitation rate and retail offerings.

“Opening our newest and largest Lids store to date in the heart of Las Vegas was an obvious choice for us as the area is a shopping destination known around the world” Lids President Britten Maughan said in a news release.

Mottram said Lids expanding its brick-and-mortar operations in the age of online shopping shows there is still consumer demand for physical stores.

“Many times when you purchase something online depending on the brand they’ll tend to fit a little bit differently” Mottram said. “At least here you can come down here physically try on the product look in the mirror and see how you look.”

Lids will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

This story has been updated to reflect the correct number of flagship stores.

Cruise ships are sailing at 100% capacity in the Caribbean which means lots of people are vying to get onboard as well.

While there are lots of people enjoying a cruise the good news is you can still get a great deal on a cruise if you're looking for a deal. The key is to know where and when to look.

To get the best cruise deal you're going to want to employ these top tips for getting a great price. No matter the time of year these tricks should get you a great price so you can maximize every dollar of your vacation budget.

Book a cruise during off-peak times

Every region of the world that a cruise ship sails has peak and off-peak times so if you can take a cruise during the less popular times you will find some of the best cruise deals out the season.

Off-season cruises are when there are less people able or willing to go on a cruise. Usually this is at the very beginning or very end of when ships begin sailing in a region such as Europe or Alaska.

In the Caribbean where the cruise season is year-round the off-peak cruise times are usually opposite the school calendar. When school is in session there are less families that can cruise.

Just like a 6am flight there is less demand for these departures and that means lower prices to be found.

Besides bad timing less than perfect weather can be a factor for why there is less demand for certain sailings.

In Alaska the very beginning and end of the season is when it is coldest. May and September typically are when Alaska cruise prices dip to their lowest.

In the Caribbean hurricane season greatly impacts people's desire to book a cruise. This means lower prices for a Caribbean cruise in September or October. You'll also find great prices in January and early February when school is back in session.

Work with a travel agent

In other forms of travel the public has been conditioned to expect the best prices if you book things on your own to ""skip the middle man"". This strategy doesn't work as well with cruises.

The cruise industry still relies heavily on travel agents to spur sales and there is no doubt that a good travel agent can help get you the lowest possible price for a cruise.

The potential money savings of working with a travel agent are not about simply who can do an internet search for a cruise price faster. Travel agents have access to special group rates and discounts you would never be able to find on your own.

Many travel agents are part of a consortium of agencies who have rates you cannot otherwise book.

Moreover a lot of people booking on their own may simply be unaware of special discounts offered to select groups such as residency discounts military discounts and more.

If there's one incredibly common mistake people make by booking on their own it's not fully understanding the deposit rules and regretting it later when there are fees for changing or cancelling. Travel agents can assist greatly with this before making a mistake.

A good travel agent can guide you through the different fares help you pick out the perfect cruise ship cabin type for your family and avoid the bad cabins.

The best part about leveraging a good travel agent is they should cost you nothing extra to use because Royal Caribbean pays them a commission for their services.

Book your cruise as early as you can

The best strategy for locking in a great price for your cruise is to book as early as you can.

Cruise ship pricing has many factors but as more and more cabins on a particular sailing get booked up prices tend to go up as inventory diminishes.

Cruise experts advocate booking your cruise as soon as you can. Ideally when Royal Caribbean releases the new sailings around two years in advance of the sail date and inventory is untouched.

Not only will booking a cruise years in advance get you a rock bottom price you're also going to have plenty of cabin types to choose from. The first type of cabins to sell out on a cruise are almost always suites.

Of course booking a cruise that far in advance is difficult for many people because most people don't plan vacations years in the future. But if you have the flexibility this is the best strategy for netting a great cruise price.

Book a cruise on an older ship

While Royal Caribbean's Oasis and Quantum Class ships are as amazing to cruise on as they look they do not usually have the cheapest cruise fares out there. Newer ships command higher prices.

Instead price shop around the Voyager or Radiance Class ships to find the real bargains.

Similar to how a used car that is a few years old will provide a better value than a brand new vehicle cruise ships that have been around for a few years tend to offer better deals to entice cruisers to book them.

The great thing about the Voyager and Radiance Class ships is that you are not compromising a ton on the onboard experience but will save a lot compared to the bigger ships.

Book a repositioning cruise

If you don't mind flying you can often find the lowest prices for a cruise on a sailing that begins in one port and ends in a different port.

Known as repositioning sailings these are when Royal Caribbean moves the ship from one region to another.

Because of the logistics of getting to and from the cruise as well as duration of the sailing repositioning cruises can be a tremendous value. Simply put less people are willing to book these because it requires more vacation time or they'd have to find a different way home.

The most common type of repositioning cruises are transalantic and transpacific cruises where the ship moves between North America and Europe or Australia.

Last-minute cruise deals

More elusive than booking early you can sometimes book a last-minute cruise deal if you are flexible.

This won't work for everyone but there are sometimes really good prices in the final weeks leading up to a sailing when inventory hasn't fully sold out yet.

As mentioned earlier in this article prices tend to go up over time as more and more people book a sailing. But sometimes a sailing doesn't sell as well as Royal Caribbean wants and you can find a price drop meant to spur sales.

If you can travel on short notice and aren't picky there are last-minute cruise deals to be had for those that look for them.

When you book at the last minute you'll have less cabins to choose from and last minute airfare prices may negate any savings from the cruise fare.

It's important to act quickly if you do spot a good cruise to book that sails soon because inventory within the last month or two of a cruise will disappear fast.

Book a guarantee cabin

One way to turn an average cruise price into a great deal is to let Royal Caribbean pick your exact cabin.

Guarantee staterooms are when you tell Royal Caribbean the minimum cabin type you want and let the cruise line assign a cabin to you instead of you picking a specific room.

You will receive a room of at least that category (or higher) but it may be days or weeks before you learn of the room assignment.

In exchange for this ambiguity of room selection you can often save hundreds of dollars off your cruise fare.

Keep in mind that you may end up with a cabin at the very front or very back of the ship. Or even a cabin with a partially blocked view. Those that value convenient cabin location or are sensitive to motion sickness may not want to roll the dice on a guarantee cabin.

If the exact location of your cabin doesn't matter much to you then a guarantee room could be your ticket to deep savings.

Book Kids Sail Free if you have kids

Royal Caribbean will periodically offer a kids sail free promotion where the third and fourth passengers under the age of 12 in your cabin will cost you nothing extra in terms of cruise fare.

In short kids sail free will result in a cruise fare cost of zero dollars for third guests and higher who are 12 years old or younger. You are still responsible for paying for the taxes and port fees associated with the children along with any other charges onboard.

For families a kids sail free promotion is one of the most lucrative offers Royal Caribbean has especially if you book a suite since the per-person savings are highest in these luxurious cabins.

Kids sail free will still save you money on other cabin types but the amount is significantly less.

One drawback of kids sail free is you have to share a cabin with your kids. This means in many cabins one bathroom for three or four of you.

Families on a budget can often get a great deal especially when combining kids sail free with the tip earlier in this article about booking as early as you can.

Going Going Gone Rates

A wonderful tool meant for travel agents to spot great deals has returned.

Before the pandemic the Going Going Gone weekly flyer was a staple at Royal Caribbean that would list especially good rates for last minute cruises to book.

The flyer usually gets updated weekly on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning.

You'll have to act fast if you want in on these days because by week’s end most of the deals are gone.

You can find the flyer always at this address.

Chase the best deal and not a specific date

The more flexible you are the better the chances of finding a rock-bottom cruise fare.

If you have the ability to go on vacation anytime you'll find far more super cheap cruise deals out there compared to trying to find a low price for a specific week.

Cruise experts recommend looking at cruise prices for many destinations and not limit yourself to just one week. Instead look at prices across two or three months and you'll likely find many better deals.

Sail from less popular ports

Instead of booking a cruise from Miami New York or Orlando try to book a cruise from a different port to nab a really good price.

Royal Caribbean sails from many cruise ports around the United States and there are definitely certain embarkation ports where prices tend to be lower for a variety of reasons.

Generally speaking you'll find lower prices if your cruise begins in one of these ports:

Don't worry there's nothing wrong with sailing from these ports. The reason prices tend to be less on cruises from here are the ships are not always the newest and the market the cruise lines target for these regions require a different price than other places.

Pick a weird length for a cruise

Instead of a 7-night cruise try a slightly shorter or longer cruise.

For most families a week-long cruise is the perfect length of time for a cruise because it fits in nicely with school vacations and time off work.

Often you'll find a better price for four five six and eight-night cruises.

The reason has to do with a combination of logistics and psychology. Many four- five- and six-night cruises begin at the start of the week which still require as many vacation days as a 7-night cruise.

Usually 5- and 8-night cruises tend to begin on non-traditional embarkation days (i.e. not a weekend) and that can be a problem for many to coordinate with time off.

Book an inside room instead of a balcony

While a balcony cabin is wonderful you can save a lot of money by booking an inside room instead.

An inside or oceanview cabin will usually get you a much better deal given how popular balcony rooms are these days.

Remember you're going to be so busy around the ship and in port that your cabin will end up being a place to sleep shower and change. So why pay a lot more for a room you won't use all that much?

Shore excursions are a major part of any cruise vacation because the ports of call a cruise ship visits is an extension of the overall trip. Each day you visit a new port and there's just enough time to get a taste of what that city island or country has to offer.

I've usually had good luck with choosing a tour as I've learned the sort of things I like and don't like to do. But once in a while I run into a dud and realize I've made a mistake.

Sometimes the issue is subjective because I personally don't care for the type of tour offered or something else just isn't my cup of tea.

Other times I felt the tour just didn't measure up to expectations. In any case it left me wishing I had done something else.

Here are five times I took a cruise ship shore excursion and reconsidered my decision making almost immediately.

Blue Waters Beach Escape in Falmouth

Ever since Royal Caribbean started visiting Falmouth Jamaica I've struggled to find a great go-to shore excursion.

Part of the issue is Falmouth is a relatively new cruise port and there aren't a lot of attractions nearby which means you need a long bus trip to get to the great stuff.

On one visit in 2016 I thought to heck with spending an hour or more on a bus we'll go to the beach and enjoy the Caribbean waters because how bad could it be?

We tried Blue Waters Beach Escape that I booked through Royal Caribbean and it reinforced one of the most common issues a person can have on a tour booked through the cruise line: an oversold and underwhelming experience.

While bus ride was short to the beach (about 10 minutes) we found a ton of other tours had beaten us here which left very little seating.

Some guests who arrived after us had no chairs available and had to settle for beach chair mats until chairs were freed up by departing guests. The shore excursion title says ""An exclusive Blue Waters Beach Escape"" but clearly this was not as exclusive as one may have thought.

On top of that the food offered by the beach's ""5-star chefs"" was also quite underwhelming and limited.

The lesson for me here was to reconsider beach break shore excursions sold through the cruise line for the overselling aspect it brings with it. In the Caribbean there are plenty of beaches in any port so I'm best served by finding another way to visit one of the other less-crowded options.

A day at Margaritaville

Another ""Jamaica mistaica"" was to skip the tours all together and just hang out at the Margaritaville in Falmouth.

On my next visit to Falmouth we thought we'd take it easy and just hang out in the Margaritaville bar that contained within the Falmouth cruise port because it has a rather large pool plenty of chairs and food that we'll enjoy (even if it's nothing special or authentic).

The day started off good as we got to Margaritaville and found our spot. There was no cost to enter the pool or use the facilities and the kids really enjoyed the pool.

Unfortunately a lot of other people had the same idea we did and by mid-morning the pool and seating was super crowded.

Being a Margaritaville the food and drink were nothing spectacular but also quite expensive. The longer we stayed the more I thought ""I could be enjoying a very similar experience back on the cruise ship for a lot less money"".

We eventually packed things up and went back to the ship but the lesson I learned here was Margaritaville is fine for a quick visit not a whole day stop.

Trying to get to St. John on my own

Ever since I visited St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands I loved how absolutely beautiful it was and wanted to return every time.

In order to visit St. John you have to take the ferry from an area of St. Thomas known as Red Hook. Red Hook is not really near any popular beaches so it is not exactly the most popular destinations out there.

My plan was to go take the ferry to nearby St. John and enjoy a day at one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever visited.

We went to the taxi stand and asked to go to Red Hook. In St. Thomas taxis in the form of a sedan are nearly nonexistent.

Each taxi driver passed us on to someone else as they were unwilling to drive us there. For some strange reason the taxis in St. Thomas are primarily these converted pickup truck buses and the taxi operators all want to maximize every seat in the vehicle.

So after 30-40 minutes of literally standing around to go we were told to board one of these buses to go to Red Hook. Except the bus was not going to Red Hook. We asked the people onboard where they were headed and were told some other beach on the island. So clearly the plan was to take these folks somewhere and drop us off later.

I was so irritated at the situation that I decided I would rather spend my day back on the ship than deal with the taxi consortium.

My lesson learned here was to either book a Royal Caribbean excursion that would take us to St. John or pre-arrange private transportation to the ferry area.

Kennedy Space Center

Don't worry I loved Kennedy Space Center when I visited it on my Anthem of the Seas cruise. The issue was how I chose to get there.

We sailed on Anthem of the Seas from New York and had a port stop in Port Canaveral.

I don't remember why but when we decided to visit Kennedy Space Center I was fixated on finding a Royal Caribbean shore excursion to take us there. Kennedy Space Center is a very short distance by car from Port Canaveral and I'm not certain why I didn't take a taxi cab.

We got to the space center without any problems and had a fabulous time but we wasted a lot of time with the bus.

We booked the Kennedy Space Center Express tour which was not a guided tour and it would simply drive us to the entrance and give us a time to return back.

Part of my mistake was assuming 5 hours at Kennedy Space Center was going to be too much time and I'd run out of things to do. The reality was I wish we had another five hours because it was incredible.

Had I just taken a taxi to Kennedy Space Center we could have squeezed out another hour or two from our day.

Mr. Sanchos in Cozumel

My most recent shore excursion goof was spending the day at Mr Sanchos Beach Club in Cozumel.

Within a half hour of arriving that little voice in my head started saying ""this was a mistake"" and I tried my best to enjoy the day but it was a disappointment.

It's my opinion that Mr. Sanchos' popularity seems to have lead to the one faux pas of any beach spot: overcrowding. They clearly had sold every chair and table at the resort and I found it to be overcrowded and unenjoyable.

The wait staff were great but I found it disappointing how busy things were because it felt like we were all pushed together a little too much.

Making matters worse was the food which came overcooked and didn't taste great.

I know Mr. Sanchos is a beach resort a lot of people have enjoyed over the years but I thought it paled in comparison to many other beach days spots in Cozumel.

Bonus: Walt Disney World

Consider this a word of caution rather than a personal experience.

A lot of cruisers that visit Port Canaveral for the day are tempted to book a shore excursion that takes them to Walt Disney World in nearby Orlando.

It's an hour-long drive and seems like a great idea for a day visit.

The problem with this idea is how incredibly expensive a one-day pass is to the parks along with the timing.

Because your ship arrives much later than when the theme parks open for the day (compounded by the fact it will take you time to disembark and then drive to the parks) you'll have a very limited window of time to enjoy what Disney offers.

Moreover because you have to be back onboard the ship much sooner than the theme parks close there's just no way you're getting your money's worth from a day visit.

If you want to experience Disney World with a cruise your best best is to do a land vacation there before your cruise for a few days and then book a short weekend cruise on Royal Caribbean to recuperate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvd29ybGQvd2hhdC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LWNhbGxzLWZvci1yZXBhcmF0aW9ucy1mb3ItYnJpdGFpbnMtbGVnYWN5LW9mLXNsYXZlcnktaW4tdGhlLWNhcmliYmVhbtIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvYW1wL3dvcmxkL3doYXQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC1jYWxscy1mb3ItcmVwYXJhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWJyaXRhaW5zLWxlZ2FjeS1vZi1zbGF2ZXJ5LWluLXRoZS1jYXJpYmJlYW4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to know about calls for reparations for Britain’s legacy of slavery in the Caribbean,"The death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II has set off a period of public mourning and celebrations of life. But even as many lauded Elizabeth for her 70-year reign for some — including those from Britain’s former colonies — it was a fresh reminder of the country’s imperial past.

In the last two years two former British colonies in the Caribbean have made robust efforts to further separate themselves from Great Britain — moves that have been under consideration for decades before. Last year Barbados officially removed Elizabeth as head of state becoming a republic in a move that was partly motivated to create a formal break with its colonial past. Jamaica has indicated it may do the same. During official visits to these countries members of the royal family had expressed regret for Britain’s role in the slave trade. On a visit to Barbados in Nov. 2021 King Charles III then Prince Charles spoke of “the appalling atrocity of slavery which forever stains our history.”

“There were slave owners and slave plantation owners in Queen Elizabeth II’s family” said David Scott a professor of anthropology at Columbia University. “There is a deep connection between the monarchy and slaving in the British Caribbean.”

Over the course of almost two centuries the British empire colonized islands in the Caribbean and transformed them into plantations labored by over 2 million enslaved Africans.

While Charles and his son Prince William have acknowledged the wrongs of slavery critics have said not enough has been done by either the royal family or the British government in the form of reparations or restitution.

“The fact that the British state — and the queen was the sovereign of the state — has consistently refused to make any gesture toward apology restitution much less compensation or reparation in respect of slavery has been a deeply wounding matter for Jamaicans” Scott said.

Here’s what you need to know about calls for reparations from Jamaica Barbados and other Caribbean nations.

Why are the British being asked to make reparations?

“The reason is history” said Dorbrene O’Marde vice chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Reparations Commission.

During the 1600s and 1700s England’s colonies produced sugar tobacco and cotton. To do this the British brought indentured servants and eventually enslaved Africans to work the fields and mills turning the colonies into large production centers.

Scott said England’s government and the monarchy had been deeply involved in the creation of the transatlantic slave trade. In the 16th century Queen Elizabeth I was herself involved in the chartering of one of the first major ships for slaving.

Luke Moffett a researcher at Queen’s University explained that on top of supporting the country’s slave trade the monarchy owned their own companies and plantations that used the labor of enslaved Africans.

In the 1800s the British Empire began to dismantle the institution of slavery eventually freeing slaves in the Caribbean in the 1830s. Rule by the British and plantation economies continued into the 20th century.

Since that period of abolition Caribbean nations have continued to deal with poverty and struggled to diversify their economies with many depending on tourism for foreign investment.

“Britain continued to rule these islands until 1962 when Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago led the way with national independence” said Matthew Smith professor of history at University College London.

“The sequel to that history of repression and disavowal has been poverty and uneven progress. So calls for reparations consider this wide story and its micro-level consequences in their activism” Smith said.

But Moffett said Britain still sees the colonial era through the belief that it was a civilizing mission that benefited the colonized.

“There’s no real ownership of responsibility. So there is recognition that what happened in the past was bad but we’re not responsible now” said Moffet. “It’s a way of sort of separating the monarchy or British government from the past.”

The sequel to that history of repression and disavowal has been poverty and uneven progress.”

Moffett said there is now more dissension in Britain from this view thanks in particular to Black Lives Matter protests that put in greater focus the legacy of the country’s colonial past. During one protest in Bristol England itself once a major part of the slave trade a 125-year-old statue of a slave owner was toppled in 2020.

Smith notes that in Great Britain most discussions highlight the British abolition movement’s efforts in ending the slave trade and finally slavery itself.

“But that important achievement has obscured the longer history of racial slavery and how violent it was. It also obscures the way the apparatus of control and racial denial carried on in the centuries after through colonial control” Smith said.

How long have Caribbean nations been asking for reparations?

O’Marde said one of the earliest proponents of reparations was Nobel prize-winning professor Sir William Arthur Lewis whose economic theories in the early 1900s addressed the imbalance between wealthy and poor nations.

Throughout the 20th century groups like ​​the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America have called for financial compensation for the descendants of enslaved Africans in the Western hemisphere.

CARICOM an intergovernmental economic union in the Caribbean launched its own Reparations Commission in 2013. The commission created a 10-point plan for European governments to deliver reparatory justice including debt cancellation literacy programs and a full and formal apology.

One of the most recent high-profile calls was in 2022 during Prince William and Princess Kate’s visit to Jamaica to mark both the 60th anniversary of the country’s independence and the 70th anniversary of Elizabeth’s coronation. In response to the visit over 100 Jamaican leaders signed a letter calling for reparatory justice.

“We see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership and that of her predecessors have perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind” the letter read. “Her ascension to the throne in February 1952 took place 14 years after the 1938 labour uprisings against inhumane working/living conditions and treatment of workers; painful legacies of plantation slavery which persist today.”

But despite decades of effort from various groups there has been little movement among European powers to open a discussion.

“Like Black people in the New World everywhere there is a special relationship to the past of slavery and consequently a moral outrage that white European former slaving societies have added insult to injury by disrespecting that past” Scott said.

O’Marde said the goal in part is to get the “offending countries in Europe to sit at the table and discuss these issues.”

Since the launch of CARICOM’s Reparations Commission the group has been working to educate people on the tragic history of colonialism and spread awareness internationally.

“We’re not going to achieve reparations at all unless it is in the mind of the masses of persons here in the Caribbean” O’Marde said.

Scott said it’s not enough for there to be a legal framework to hold European countries accountable. He said there needs to be a grassroots effort by the people in Caribbean countries to demand that their leaders include reparations in international relations but also to include reparations in their social policies as well.

He argued that many Caribbean governments are too dependent on the global capitalist economy to be critical toward European nations and push for the “social transformation of the conditions of the Black poor.”

“None of these states are critical of that fundamental relationship to the former slaving states and one can imagine that it’s not entirely clear to ordinary people in the Caribbean what a demand for reparations would mean for them materially” Scott said.

Are there new calls for reparations in the wake of Elizabeth’s death?

O’Marde said CARICOM has not changed or renewed their statements in the face of Elizabeth’s death. However he said there’s promise in Charles’ approach to the issue.

Along with his apology in Barbados Charles also denounced the atrocity of slavery during a visit to Ghana in 2018. O’Marde said this is more acknowledgement than normal and so with Charles’ ascension to the throne he’s hopeful there may be similar interactions in the future.

“It’s quite in contrast to former heads of government and royalty … that simply urge us to understand that these things happened a long time ago and we should forget it and move on” he said.

Moffett said it will likely be some time before the British government opens up to making reparations because it takes time to sensitize those responsible to actually confront the history.

“We’re not at the stage yet where the monarchy is going to say ‘We apologize we’re going to make reparations’” he said. “But we’re slowly moving towards maybe a more formal apology.”

He also said now might be a poignant time to confront the issue during a “seismic moment.”

Is there precedent for reparations?

As slavery ended throughout the British Empire in the 19th century parliament approved the payment of 20 million pounds–about 300 million pounds in today’s money–not to formerly enslaved Africans but to slave owners as compensation. The United Kingdom took out a loan to pay reparations to slave owners in 1833 and only paid off the debt in 2015.

Great Britain has offered some atonement for its actions during the colonial period. In 1995 Elizabeth signed an apology to the Maori people of New Zealand for the confiscation of land perpetrated during Queen Victoria’s reign. In 2013 the British government agreed to pay reparations to survivors of Kenya’s Mau Mau uprising who were tortured by the colonial government.

O’Marde pointed to other examples of reparations in the modern world. Native Americans received some payments from the U.S. government in the form of grants starting in the 1920s and Japanese Americans received a payment for their internment in the 1940s.

The most prominent example of reparations are the payments given to Holocaust survivors by Germany which are still being paid to this day.

Scott believes part of why countries are not keen to talk about the issue is because the amount owed to the descendants of millions of enslaved Africans used over centuries of labor is almost incalculable.

“This is not just about the confiscation of discrete parcels of land or discrete kinds of wealth. New World slavery was not just about the violation of Africans brought to the Caribbean” he said. “New World slavery was about the extraction of wealth from the labor of enslaved peoples wealth that was exported to build Europe.”"

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

He said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET): ""I wouldn't say he's not in the band anymore. We've said this before that he'll always be the drummer of this band. But we're all going through stuff right now that it takes personal attention to dive in and to figure it all out so that we can all get along. He's my cousin he's family. But we're not trying to put anybody's business out there. We're all grown men and we have to take responsibility in our own lives to just figure things out. And for quite some time now with there's just been tension in the band.""

Referencing P.O.D.'s latest album ""Veritas"" which was released on May 3 via Mascot Records Sonny said: ""When we had to write this record it was just with the mindset of like 'Hey we'll start the record. Maybe we'll just get things going and we'll figure this out. COVID all this stuff — life is crazy right now. But everybody wants to be in this band and so we'll fight for it.' And then as things happen it hasn't happened yet. But [Wuv] will always be the drummer of this band. The seat is his when he wants it. It's just I think all these years later we just all have to be on the same headspace together. So I hope that that's sooner than later.""

Regarding how P.O.D.'s current touring drummer Alex Lopez (ex-SUICIDE SILENCE) came to be involved with the band Sonny said: ""I think he had reached out to Marcos [Curiel guitar] a while ago just as friends even just to help out drum teching or doing whatever. I think he was tired of that world that he was in 'cause he's been grinding for a long time. And he's married to Tatiana [Shmayluk] from JINJER. And I think Marcos and him just started hanging out. I was supposed to hang out too. Tatiana came down and instantly they all became part of the P.O.D. family the JINJER/P.O.D. family. And then when the time came to start doing live shows we just said 'Hey would you wanna give it a shot? We need a drummer right now.' And so he helped us out. He's been filling in for about two years now. But again like I said… I love playing with Alex and it's been so much fun but we're still waiting to see what happens with P.O.D. as P.O.D. Maybe it's just this album cycle. Who knows? But in the meanwhile Alex is amazing and he's such a talented drummer and along with him we've been able to know Tatiana and the whole JINJER camp. So it's been awesome.""

Last fall the band debuted the video for ""Drop"" which features a vocal cameo from LAMB OF GOD singer Randy Blythe. It earned quick press accolades from Metal Injection Consequence Revolver Idioteq The Pit Yahoo! and Knotfest. They followed with the video for single ""Afraid To Die"" featuring Shmayluk.

""Veritas"" was written over the course of several years with the band typically writing a tune or two at a time with the Los Angeles-based production duo called the Heavy (Jason Bell and Jordan Miller).

Last October Sonny revealed to the 96.7 KCAL-FM program ""Wired In The Empire"" that renowned session drummer Robin Diaz laid down the drum tracks for ""Veritas"" marking the first P.O.D. LP that doesn't feature Bernardo. Regarding Robin's contribution to ""Veritas"" Sonny said: ""He tours with all the bands but he's pretty much one of the — I would say next to Josh Freese he's probably the main man in Hollywood. And he's an old-school friend of ours and dude he came in and just nailed it. So there's a different feel on that too because it's the first time without my cousin Wuv. So it's a rocking feel.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtc3RhdGUtZmxhZy1kaXNwbGF5LzYwMDM2NTI3MC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Laser loon lives: The second life of Minnesota state flag(s),"Not everything Minnesotans ran up the flagpole on Statehood Day was the new state flag.

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

Below the post was the image of a flag waving proudly as light broke through dark storm clouds. /On that flag were two words: Naz Reid."

And while most organizations have found ways to adapt our research finds that customers still want more channels utility convenience and personalized experiences.

Our new alliance with Salesforce will help our clients answer that call by uniting McKinsey’s strategic insight and deep transformation capabilities with Salesforce’s leading CRM platform.

“Together Salesforce and McKinsey have created a powerful new way to support our joint customers in their digital transformation journeys—from ideation to value realization” said Brian Millham Salesforce President and COO.

McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels agrees. “The combination of McKinsey’s expert insights paired with Salesforce’s best-in-class technology allows us to help companies address their most urgent business challenges and drive sustainable inclusive growth.”

McKinsey and Salesforce have a strong history of collaboration and creating impact together with this alliance building on McKinsey’s May acquisition of Salesforce Platinum Partner S4G Consulting. The combination of McKinsey’s proprietary knowledge analytics benchmarks client-capability building and direct impact creation through hands-on delivery with S4G with Salesforce’s CRM platform has helped numerous organizations accelerate their digital transformations for the future of work.

“Our alliance with McKinsey has enabled us to bring the power of Salesforce to life in transformative ways that are tailored to specific customers and industries” said Tyler Prince EVP Alliances and Channels at Salesforce. “We look forward to continuing this collaboration and helping drive success for our joint customers.”

In one case McKinsey and Salesforce teamed up to help a European gas-distribution leader create a new digital solution for CapEx management. The solution allows the organization to have end-to-end management of its capital expenditures which increases productivity across the organization. In fact the client expects a significant overall reduction in CapEx deployment time of 10 percent.

Elsewhere through the alliance an AI solution was developed for a global banking leader that helped the organization optimize their client selection processes and make more informed decisions around new opportunities. The solution also provided a real-time view into their deal pipeline improved account planning and automated pricing. The effort not only led to better performance in deal execution—through a productivity uplift of 1.5-2X per relationship manager—but also a better customer experience for clients.

“By bringing the best of McKinsey and Salesforce together we can help clients seamlessly navigate their end-to-end customer-centered digital transformation journeys and capture more value from Salesforce’s CRM and other cloud platforms” said McKinsey senior partner and global head of Alliances and Acquisitions Peter Dahlstrom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN4dG9kYXkuY29tL2RhdGEtYW5hbHl0aWNzL3NhbGVzZm9yY2UtZXhwYW5kcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLXNub3dmbGFrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salesforce Expands Partnership with Snowflake,"Salesforce has joined forces with Snowflake to offer “zero-copy” data sharing capabilities which enable customers to get more insights from their data.

Customers can now sync data in real-time between Salesforce Customer Data Platform (CDP) and Snowflake reducing the risks and costs involved in traditional sync methods.

In doing so customers can build segments and extract insights on data from Snowflake and vice versa.

The “zero-copy” part of the integration streamlines the process of exchanging data between platforms without having to copy it or move it around since it uses references to point to data.

David Schmaier President and Chief Product Officer at Salesforce said: “Companies struggle to deliver real-time personalization at scale and automation because data resides across different clouds technology stacks and enterprise systems.

“These new data sharing innovations grant secure native and open access to the data where it already lives and allow organizations to deliver intelligent memorable experiences based on a single source of truth for each and every customer.”

In addition customers can visualise data from Salesforce and Snowflake using Tableau which natively connects to both platforms.

Christian Kleinerman SVP of Product at Snowflake said: “We are excited to expand our strategic partnership with Salesforce to unlock new value for our customers and help them to maximize their data investments.

“This integration will empower companies to break down data silos unify data for rich insights and analytics and enable a real-time single view of their customers across both of our leading platforms.”

The new capabilities also provide data access to customer profiles in real-time enabling many personalisation initiatives.

Salesforce’s portfolio upgrades in the personalisation department come as no surprise since the company has been named a leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines 2022. This move only verifies Salesforce’s plans to hold its position.

The 5-year agreements—the largest of their kind to date in the oil and gas industry according to ADNOC—went to Abu Dhabi’s Al Ghaith Oilfield Supplies and Services Company Al Mansoori Directional Drilling Services Schlumberger Middle East SA Halliburton Worldwide Limited Abu Dhabi and Weatherford Bin Hamoodah Company LLC following a tender.

The awards apply to ADNOC’s onshore and offshore fields as Abu Dhabi aims to boost conventional drilling by 40% by 2025 as well as tap into unconventional reservoirs to reach 2030 production targets. If needed the agreements can be extended by another 2 years the company said.

Abu Dhabi set its 5 million B/D production goal with intent to retain the country’s position as a leading low-cost low-carbon oil producer while also producing enough gas to support the UAE’s domestic needs and industrial development. Over 75% of the award value is expected to flow back into the UAE economy under its In-Country Value program.

Commenting in a separate press release Weatherford President and CEO Girish Saligram noted that besides his company’s technology solutions Weatherford’s “manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi will further bolster the In-Country Value Program—an initiative Weatherford has supported since the beginning.”

Weatherford pegged the value of its most recent contract with ADNOC at more than $400 million.

ADNOC has optimized its procurement strategy of late focusing on long-term contracts with an optimal number of suppliers that provide stable and reliable delivery at competitive rates.

Since November 2021 the company said it has awarded more than $11 billion to top-tier contractors for wellheads and related components downhole completion equipment and related services liner hangers cementing services wireline logging and directional drilling.

“These (latest) awards (made in the last month) build on our ongoing investments in drilling services and they will deliver substantial in-country value for the nation to support economic growth and diversification in line with the UAE Leadership’s wise directives” Yaser Saeed Almazrouei ADNOC Upstream Executive Director said.

As a string quartet played by a regal fountain ROSÉ posed for pictures wearing an immaculately intricate Schlumberger necklace in all its 18K gold and platinum diamonds.

“Schlumberger said ‘A piece is not finished until it’s worn” Chief Gemologist and Vice President at Tiffany & Co. Victoria Wirth Reynolds told GRAZIA. “It’s really transformable… Jewellery is very personal. It represents a special moment in time. That then stays with you for the rest of your life.”

“When you have a Maison like Tiffany & Co. which is 185 years old you have this wealth of things that you can pick and choose from [to reimagine]” she continues. “We then have a design team that is literally extraordinary.”

Extraordinary indeed. As Tokyo opened its borders to tourists once more guests – which included media clients and KOLs from seven different countries – mingled in nooks of the candlelit estate before being seated in its ballroom. As dinner was served (caviar dressed in gold of course) so too were the diamonds with models walking in between tables wearing pieces from the new BOTANICA collection.

While model Ayaka Miyoshi sparkled on the blue carpet in a pendant and ring from the 2022 Tiffany Blue Book Collection and a platinum diamond bracelet she surpassed ROSÉ as the woman of the night when she took to the runway in Tiffany & Co.’s 80 ct diamond necklace. The breathtaking flawless oval diamond is very rare and was responsibly sourced in Botswana in Africa a symbol of Tiffany & Co.’s industry-first approach to diamond traceability. See it here.

Sandy Springs-based Brightwater Homes and Peachtree Corners-based Atlantis Granite and Marble teamed up with HomeAid Atlanta last month to help the Zaban Paradies Center for Homeless Couples prepare for year-round operation by renovating the facility’s kitchen one of several recent volunteer efforts led by the building-industry nonprofit.

Zaban Paradies which has provided housing and support for homeless couples with dependent children for 36 years has traditionally been open from October to April only. Brightwater Homes volunteers helped with the demolition of old kitchen cabinets painting new cabinet installation and more while Atlantis donated and installed new kitchen countertops to finish the job. The renovation work completed on the Care Day saved Zaban Paradies more than $10000 HomeAid said in a news release.

Also last month HomeAid brought in volunteers from Roswell’s Northview Church to the Forsyth County Family Haven where they completed painting tasks floor repairs and more. The Family Haven provides temporary shelter individual crisis support and referral services for victims of violence in Forsyth and North Fulton counties. The volunteer work and donations of paint from Sherwin-Williams saved the facility almost $6000.

The two volunteer days brought HomeAid’s Care Day tally to 11 for the year. Altogether the Care Days have resulted in more than $60000 worth of maintenance-related savings to local homelessness organizations. HomeAid has five more Care Days scheduled for the rest of the year.

HomeAid also facilitated the distribution of 500 CareKits to Another Chance of Atlanta which supports homeless veterans and their families.

Rockhaven Homes employees held a drive to collect feminine hygiene products and other supplies for the CareKits and raised another $1100 to purchase additional items. Volunteers from Stacey’s Place which serves adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities assembled the kits. Thus far this year HomeAid has packed and distributed 1500 CareKits and has another 500 or more scheduled for the fall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9hbm90aGVyLXNob3ctYml6LXN0YXItaXMtZ2V0dGluZy1hLWZhY2VsaWZ0LXN0YXJ0aW5nLW1vbmRheS10aGUtaG9sbHl3b29kLXNpZ24v0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L2Fub3RoZXItc2hvdy1iaXotc3Rhci1pcy1nZXR0aW5nLWEtZmFjZWxpZnQtc3RhcnRpbmctbW9uZGF5LXRoZS1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2lnbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another show-biz star is getting a facelift starting Monday: The Hollywood sign,"Alexandra Gedda 17 of Virginia Beach takes a picture of her mother Stella with the iconic Hollywood sign on Wednesday June 29 2022 in Los Angeles.

A tourist gets close to the Hollywood sign on a pleasant afternoon on Tuesday March 9 2021.

The Hollywood sign is set to receive a fresh paint job starting Monday Sept. 19.

A crew of 10 workers will apply nearly 400 gallons of paint to the sign over the course of eight weeks.

The project is expected to be completed in November. This year marks a centennial for theiconic sign.

“The sign is the pride of Los Angeles and we are excited for fans all around the world to see this makeover for a very special 100th anniversary” said Jeff Zarrinnam chair of the Hollywood Sign Trust.

Sherwin-Williams which last refurbished the sign in 2012 will run the project again. Duggan and Associates a Los Angeles-based painting company will paint the 45-feet-high sign.

The sign which originally read “Hollywoodland” was shortened to the current “Hollywood” in 1949. It was rebuilt in 1978 and has gone through several repairs.

(IBJ photo /Eric Learned)

In a matter of weeks Duke Realty Corp. is expected to go from being one of the largest and most prolific industrial real estate companies in Indianapolis to becoming a small part of a large West Coast-based developer.

It’s painful for some Duke employees to watch the locally based company’s name—and many of their jobs—disappear. But Duke’s legacy will linger beyond its pending $26 billion all-stock acquisition by industrial-sector behemoth Prologis Inc. expected to close early next month. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal Sept. 28.

The sale is also a hard pill to swallow for Duke’s CEO Jim Connor. He said it’s difficult to let the company go even as he prepares to join the board of San Francisco-based Prologis. He said a tinge of guilt still lingers from June 13 when he shared with his employees that Duke was accepting a buyout offer from its biggest competitor even though he felt it was the right business decision.

“Worst [expletive] day of my life” Connor recalled.

He made the announcement on the front steps of the company’s headquarters at Keystone at the Crossing—a structure that has been sparsely used since it opened in early 2020 just a few weeks before the pandemic. The news left many employees (some of whom had worked there for three decades or more) in tearsand just as many speechless. Connor said he felt numb as he delivered the news.

“I was standing there with a 50-year anniversary banner across the front of the building at my back talking to our team—people that I’ve known for [decades] and people that had built this company and done all the incredible heavy lifting. … I had to stand up and tell them that the decision had been made and that it was going to happen.”

The making of Duke

Duke’s run in Indianapolis has brought numerous business parks to central Indiana such as Keystone at the Crossing Park 100 industrial park and Parkwood Crossing as well as multiple downtown office buildings including Simon Property Group’s headquarters at West Washington Street and Capitol Avenue. The firm’s success has also led to many new companies—Scannell Properties Ambrose Property Group PK Partners and Strategic Capital Partners to name a few—as Duke alumni struck out on their own.

Duke was founded in 1972 by John Rosebrough Phil Duke and John Wynne and went public in 1993 with an initial public offering that raised $310 million. It is the 11th-largest public company in the Indianapolis area according to IBJ research with nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2020. It has 160 million rentable square feet of industrial assets in 19 logistics markets throughout the United States.

Industry insiders say the company’s legacy will survive its buyout. After all Duke’s roots are deeper than just industrial development. Until 2017 it was in a variety of sectors including office retail medical and even residential and apartments. It exited all but industrial as part of a strategy shift in response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Within 10 years 80% of Duke’s holdings were industrial with the remainder in the medical office sector which it also has since offloaded.

Connor said he thinks narrowing its focus put Duke in a position to thrive and survive.

“I think we’d be in a very different place” if the company had held onto all its assets Connor said. “And it wouldn’t be a good place. Had we not made that decision would we be selling? Probably not because Prologis wouldn’t have an interest in us—they wouldn’t want to buy all this other stuff. Would financially we be where we are now with our stock price and our performance that we’ve had? No I think we’d be struggling.”

Steve Schwegman senior managing director and market lead for Chicago-based brokerage JLL’s Indianapolis office said Duke has long been known for sowing deep roots in Indianapolis.

“Anytime you lose a headquarters it’s a sad thing for the business community” Schwegman said. “But they’ve built quite a legacy—one that will live on.”

Schwegman is a Duke shareholder and favors the merger. “I think a lot of the Duke culture is maintained by those developers … so in a way their innovation and training has been built out from Duke’s fundamentals” he said.

Connor said Duke is a proud company and that pride has continued since the sale was announced.

“Our entire leadership team is so proud of our associates that have maintained this culture” he said. “All the buildings the financial performance but most of all we’ve continued to outperform the market since we made this announcement. We’re still leasing space. We’re still building buildings. We’ve improved occupancy. Nobody has mailed it in.”

Under the proposed deal outgoing company executives said Duke employees shouldn’t need to find jobs immediately because of the severance package human resources officials secured from Prologis.

“Our employees are all shareholders so they’ll see the benefit” of the merger Connor said. “We also went to extreme lengths to make sure that all of our associates were treated very generously in terms of their severance to the point of where nobody needs to rush out and get a job.”

But Duke is still helping with the job hunts. Duke said about 40 employees will join Prologis—either permanently or on a short-term basis to end the fiscal year—while the remaining nearly 300 employees will be laid off. Prologis said the final number is yet to be determined.

Members of Duke’s executive ranks—ranging from the heads of various divisions to Connor himself—are making calls to help employees land new gigs.

Jenny Bean chief human resources officer for Duke and a 26-year employee has made calls or written letters for most of the company’s staff including many of the 172 based in Indiana. She said the sale was a shock for her and most every employee but she sees it as her job to help her co-workers find new jobs.

“I’ve never worked this hard and to have such a yucky outcome … and with all that craziness there’s been a lot of extra hours” Bean said.

Duke insiders like Gene Rodriguez Miller senior manager of communications and public relations said Bean is being too modest about her role in helping fellow workers.

“She’s underselling the work she’s doing—she is calling these companies trying to get us placed” Miller said sitting across a table from Bean fighting back tears. “I don’t even see her trying to land a job because she doesn’t have the time; she’s too busy trying to find everybody else a job.”

‘We still had so much growth’

Connor said that while he understands some employees felt betrayed by the decision to sell he ultimately thought it was the correct move. It came after months of behind-the-scenes discussions between the companies.

Prologis first made a formal offer in November 2021 that Duke’s board rejected because it didn’t believe the offer provided strong value

for shareholders.

In May Prologis made another offer—this time around $24 billion—that was also rejected before Prologis went public with its intent to buy Duke.

“We thought they could do better [with a higher offer] but we knew they were close—it was a record-setting price at that time” Connor said. “Ultimately they improved the offer [a few billion dollars] and … the board knew our investors wouldn’t sit still that it was too much money” to turn away.

The board finally agreed to a sale worth $26 billion. Under those terms Connor’s shares are worth about $10 million.

Connor said Duke grew at a rate of 14% in 2021 and Prologis’ final offer was a 31% premium on that growth.

“Last year was our best year ever. We didn’t want to sell the company. But it was too good a deal for our investors. We had to make the deal” he said.

At the time the proposed merger was announced in June Prologis CEO Hamid R. Moghadam said in a written statement that his company “admired the disciplined repositioning strategy” Duke had employed over the past decade.

“They have built an exceptional portfolio in the U.S. located in geographies we believe will outperform in the future” Moghadam added.

While most experts and some at Duke believe the decision to sell was smart that doesn’t make it any less painful for employees.

Bean said she disagrees with the company’s decision particularly because of Duke’s growth trajectory. The company has long viewed Prologis as a competitor even though Duke is only about a quarter the size of Prologis in market value.

“In my personal opinion it wasn’t right because if you look at our balance sheet and what we’re doing today we’re outperforming” everyone Bean said. “We still had so much growth on the West and East Coasts—we weren’t done.”

David Funke principal of real estate management consultancy DW Funke Advisors said a company’s sale is difficult for executives and employees. But financially speaking he said the timing was right.

“It would seem to be common sense that if you’re going to sell a monstrous industrial company that it’s a good time to consider selling when the market is probably as strong as it will be in our lifetime which it is right now for industrial” Funke said.

Bean and others said it will be tough for Prologis to replicate Duke’s community involvement. For example Duke has long offered a down-payment assistance program for first-time home-buying employees a benefit started by former Duke CEO Tom Hefner who donated his bonuses to establish the program. That money now is expected to be redistributed to local charities that focus on addressing housing challenges she said.

Duke has also participated in community days of service each year and it’s held monthly blood drives with the American Red Cross since the pandemic began.

“I think that’s going to be a huge hit to Indianapolis” Bean said.

Prologis said it maintains deep ties to all the communities in which it does business. Spokeswoman Jennifer Nelson said the company supports community groups through its foundation year-round volunteering and a corporate day of service.

Down the road

It’s hard to know for sure what Prologis’ long-term plans are for Indianapolis though the company is among the biggest players in the local industrial market. It’s been involved in numerous projects on the south and west sides and taken on partnerships with companies such as locally based Browning Investments.

When the merger was announced Prologis Chief Financial Officer Tim Arndt said in written remarks that the deal “increases the strength size and diversification of our balance sheet while expanding the opportunity for Prologis to apply innovation to drive long-term growth.”

JLL’s Schwegman said he expects Prologis to continue investing in Indianapolis because it’s such a strong Midwestern market. About 23 million square feet of industrial development is under construction across central Indiana according to his firm’s research.

“I don’t think they can have quite the impact as Duke just by virtue of the fact that they’re not based here” he said. “That said Prologis has already done a lot. With them there’s a ‘Have your cake and eat it too’ mentality. If they continue to do that they can have a strong impact in our community.”

For some the more immediate question will be what becomes of Duke’s new headquarters building a $28 million four-story property it builtwith PK Partners at Keystone at the Crossing. The 78000-square-foot building is already starting to empty out though the remaining employees are expected to continue using the structure until at least mid-2023.

Prologis is based in the 8888 Keystone Crossing building directly across the street from Duke’s headquarters.

Connor said he expects Prologis to list the Duke headquarters by the first quarter of 2023. Even without being listed the property has already attracted interest he said.

For Bean the loss of Duke is a blow she never expected to face. But she said that up until the end she’s committed to making sure her co-workers are well cared for.

“It’s always the right thing to do—treat people well as they walk out the door” she said. “That is important to me … this wasn’t our time to leave. And we built something here that is going to be hard to replace.”•

Fashion Square is still doing business as usual continuing with new tenants and leases according to documents filed with the Albemarle County Planning Department. Mall officials have said retailers currently in the mall will continue with their leases.

Court documents obtained by Sean Tubbs of Town Crier Productions and shared with The Daily Progress show that the mall has new tenants slated to come into the shopping center while others may leave.

Among those coming into the mall is the Jefferson Area Board for Aging which plans to open a 2500 square-foot Medicare Insurance Counseling office in the mall’s south wing next to the Eddie Bauer store.

“We’re glad to be able to offer in-person counseling for this open enrollment season and [we’re] grateful to the new landlord for working with us” said Randy Rodgers JABA’s insurance counseling program manager. “To be able to provide more people this important service we needed a bigger space. And having this site at Fashion Square Mall along with Zoom and phone appointments we hope to be able to help several thousand people.”

Mall officials confirmed this week that Home Depot the Georgia-based home improvement big box retailer with more than $150 billion in revenue purchased the mall with the exception of the women’s Belk store and the former JCPenney storefront. The mens’ Belk storefront which is separate from the women’s store is included in the purchase.

Home Depot’s national competitor Lowe’s has a retail outlet about a mile away from the mall.

Attempts to reach Home Depot for comment on the sale or plans for the mall have been unsuccessful. The purchase price has not been announced.

Home Depot and the local holding company that purchased the mall at a July 2021 foreclosure auction on the county courthouse steps entered into a sale agreement on July 8 of this year with a July 31 effective date according to Tubbs.

Tubbs has been a reporter for local news organizations for 30 years. He now produces the Charlottesville Community Engagement newsletter and podcast.

On Sept. 2 the Charlottesville Circuit Court recorded three documents between Home Depot USA and Charlottesville JP 2014-CP the holding company that previously owned it.

One of the documents is a Deed of Bargain and Sale with no clear sale price and another is a detailed list of parcels affected. Another document releases Home Depot from a ground lease and sublease that governs the property.

That document references the bankruptcy of Sears Roebuck and Company which anchored one end of the mall and was part of the original operating agreement for the shopping center.

Sears declared Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 2018 and closed the Albemarle County store early the next year.

Online records at Albemarle County do not show an updated ownership of the mall. Those records often lag behind however.

County assessor records show the land on which the mall sits is assessed at $8796000 as of Jan. 1. The building and improvements on the site are assessed at $7329900 for a total assessed valuation of $16125900.

The assessed value is what the county uses to determine tax bills.

In a separate transaction Fashion Square Assets LLC a company associated with developer Richard Hewitt purchased the former JCPenney space on Sept. 10 2020.

Earlier this summer Albemarle County agreed to rent a portion of the space for use as a public safety center including vehicle parking and bays for maintenance.

Albemarle County Fire Rescue maintenance crews would be at the site and Albemarle County police will station the department’s traffic unit there.

The county will pay $3.1 million to refit the site and $558000 for the first year’s rent.

The sale is the latest in a series of ownership changes for the once-bustling 570000-square-foot indoor shopping center that has struggled for relevance in the wake of online sales and the pandemic.

Built in the early 1980s the mall was once the moving force in retail sales in Central Virginia. Like other indoor malls across the country its popularity faded as people switched to online purchases and many retailers left or went bankrupt between 2015 and 2021.

The mall was purchased by Simon Property Group in 1997. It was assigned to Simon’s spin-off company Washington Prime Group in 2014. The spin-off company held Simon’s strip center business and smaller enclosed malls. It merged with Glimcher Realty Trust in January 2015 and became WP Glimcher.

“We are currently responding to a cybersecurity incident. We are in touch with law enforcement and will post additional updates here as they become available” Uber tweeted.

The compromise surfaced on Thursday (Sept. 14) when Uber employees got a Slack message that read “I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach” The New York Times reported.

A lone hacker claiming responsibility for the breach told The New York Times he was 18 years old and decided to compromise Uber because the company had weak security. The attacker said he texted an Uber employee under the guise of being from corporate IT.

The hacker then persuaded the employee to reveal a password that allowed the hacker to gain access to Uber’s systems per reports an increasingly common cyber attack maneuver known as social engineering.

Identified by the Telegram handle Tea Pot the hacker also reportedly gained control of Uber’s security researcher HackerOne vulnerability bug bounty account the Wall Street Journal reported.

The incident is a major compromise for Uber assuming all of the Hacker’s claims are true cybersecurity consultant Robert Graham told the WSJ.

“It’s all of their IT information. And because they’re an IT company it’s everything” he said.

Uber was also compromised in 2016 when hackers stole the data of 57 million driver and rider accounts and then approached Uber and demanded $100000 to delete their copy of the information. Uber arranged the payment but kept the breach a secret for more than a year.

In response to the incident Uber fired security chief Joe Sullivan who allegedly arranged the payment. Sullivan is now on trial the U.S. District Court in San Francisco facing criminal obstruction charges for his role in paying the hackers."

Will this be a problem: Back in April Candice slipped her supermodel body into some SKIMS for one of Kim's campaigns for her clothing line

The artist's lawyers sent a letter to the company on Thursday to notify them of the termination according to The Wall Street Journal.

The letter alleged that Gap breached their agreement by not releasing apparel as planned or opening stores.

On Thursday Kanye shared what appeared to be the letter to his Instagram page.

The contract with Gap signed in June 2020 is good for for another eight years.

The multi-Grammy Award-winning recording artist who is also feuding with Adidas still has until 2026 before his deal with the sportswear brand runs out.

All of it happened when they picked up their entire family to move to Tennessee.

“July 27th we left” said Jimmy Bell. “And my wife and kids they wanted a new kind of fresh start.”

Months back in the summer the family packed up the belongings in their five-bedroom 3000-square-foot West End home and headed out.

Bell reached out to a moving company called Southern Guarantee. He had used them before in their move to Montana years ago.

Bell ordered up a 53-foot moving truck to accommodate the family’s belongings.

But when moving day came that’s when Bell says the scam started to unravel.

“He showed up in a 23-foot box truck Enterprise” he said.

Q2 News Jimmy Bell

At that point the Bell family was already on the road heading to their new home. But the Bells got a call from their driver asking for thousands of dollars more to move all the items.

They refused after paying some $17000 already in upfront moving costs.

“I said 'I already paid you in full' but (the driver said) 'Nope that’s what it’s going to cost you'” said Bell.

Bell responded saying the driver didn’t show up with the right trailer in the first place.

For more than 40 days the Bell family’s household items complete with brand new appliances TVs jewelry and even Jimmy’s spare wheelchair sat somewhere in Billings.

The Bells knew for sure because they put a tracker in the truck.

But the items were being held hostage according to Bell for more money.

“And at that point…. I just told them where to go” said Bell.

Turns out the truck was taken to a storage unit facility called Big Sky Storage on Underpass Avenue in Billings.

But every time Bell tried to call and get information about his things he was met with resistance.

MTN News headed down to Big Sky Storage to get some answers and met Paula who identified herself as the manager. She didn’t provide a last name.

She said Bell couldn’t verify who moved the units in.

Q2 News Paula who wouldn't give her last name said she is the manager of Big Sky Storage where the Bell's belongings were being stored.

“So we couldn’t give him any information and then two days later the people who had the unit moved one of them out and the other one is partially still here” Paula said.

And that wasn’t the only dead end that Bell encountered.

When he reached out to Billings police they told him the case was civil meaning criminal charges wouldn’t be filed.

Lt. Matt Lennick told MTN News that the company has cooperated with officers and provided the contract and claims they are waiting to be paid before they release the property.

“At this time nothing Jimmy has reported or that they have uncovered in their investigations allows for criminal charges to be filed” said Lennick in a statement.

Southern Guarantee is a moving brokerage company out of Florida.

Bethany Cook identified herself as the principal of the company and was reached by phone for comment.

“We cannot predict what a carrier or even a customer might do” said Cook.

She says the company does a thorough job of vetting any working partner but got caught up with bad players in the industry.

She’s vowing to make things right with the Bell family.

“So we do really feel as though we do our best and then some and beyond for any consumer” said Cook.

But a simple search of Southern Guarantee with the Better Business Bureau shows a plethora of bad complaints with the company getting an F rating due to 79 complaints filed in the last year.

Dale Dixon with the Better Business Bureau that overseas Montana and the Northwest says the moving scam is real with as many as 15000 complaints filed to the BBB regarding moving scams every single year.

Q2 News Dale Dixon with the Better Business Bureau





“I hesitate even calling it a scam” he said. “It is bad businesses doing bad things to people. So they’re setting up as moving companies they’ll come with a truck and take your stuff and disappear” said Dixon.

Cook says they have a great track record of making things right with their customers but it took MTN News calling the company to get things moving on the whereabouts of the Bell’s items.

Bell says he never even heard of such a scam until recently. But as of now the family is living without 99 percent of their possessions and trying to get anyone to help and listen.

“It's about a hundred thousand dollars worth of property” said Bell. “I mean all new TVs computers laptops a brand-new fridge and washer and dryer.”

As of Friday Bell was told that the truck is now on its way and would arrive by that evening. Still there’s no word on the condition of the contents or if all of the items are going to be there when it arrives.

“I mean it's not just my stuff it’s my kids’ stuff it’s my wife’s stuff” said Bell. “It's 40 years.”

Bed Bath & Beyond is closing 56 stores in the coming weeks and the list includes several Southern California locations.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Bed Bath & Beyond has released a list of stores that will be closing and it includes several Southern California locations.

The company is set to close 56 stores in the coming weeks with the long-term plan of closing 150 stores.

The four Southern California stores shutting down soon are the following locations:

Burbank: 201 East Magnolia Blvd

Lakewood: 75 Lakewood Center Mall

Palmdale: 39421 10th Street West

Santee: 9918 Mission Gorge Road

In August the chain announced a restructuring that includes the closure of around 150 stores layoffs and a possible stock offering.

The company said it had obtained more than $500 million of new financing and was reducing 20% of its workforce.

Although it is closing 150 namesake stores it will keep its Buy Buy Baby chain.

Bed Bath & Beyond also said that it would go back to its original strategy of focusing on national brands instead of pushing its own store labels.

Days after the company's announcement Gustavo Arnal the chief financial officer of Bed Bath & Beyond was found dead after falling from a Manhattan high-rise apartment.

A law enforcement source told CNN that he jumped to his death from the 57-story skyscraper.

A man who jumped to his death from a high-rise luxury apartment building in TriBeCa was the chief financial officer of Bed Bath and Beyond.

Bed Bath & Beyond is ""profoundly saddened by this shocking loss"" a company spokesperson said.

Arnal was named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit accusing him Ryan Cohen and other large shareholders of engaging in a ""pump and dump"" scheme to artificially inflate the price of the company's stock.

After boarding the plane in Long Beach California flyers were delighted on Friday to find a ukulele waiting for them in their seat.

They would soon learn that Guitar Center the world’s largest musical instrument retailer was behind the stunt with instructors onboard to give them a free lesson

The ukuleles—arguably the world’s happiest instrument and the one that conjures up the Aloha spirit of Hawaii—is also one of the easiest to learn to play.

It is so easy in fact that passengers learned to play the song “Hello Aloha. How are you?” from start to finish during the flight.

Each passenger received a Road Runner carrying case containing a Mitchell MU40 Soprano ukulele—and the first-ever in-flight ukulele lesson in the sky.

Passengers then flew across the Pacific Ocean unified one chord at a time. (Watch the video below…)

“I’ve taught students through Guitar Center Lessons since 2014 but never in an airplane. It was inspiring to see how quickly passengers of all ages picked up the ukulele – many with no musical background” said Alexandra Windsor educational specialist for Guitar Center Lessons.

Even if you weren’t on the flight you can enter the Ukuleles Take Flight sweepstakes for a chance to win round trip air travel on Southwest for a winner and a guest and two Mitchel MU40 Soprano ukuleles here at Southwest.fm/ukuleleflight.

NEW ORLEANS — Starbucks announced Friday that it would be closing its Canal Street store permanently on October 3 over safety and security concerns for its employees.

Sam Jefferies a Starbucks spokesperson called the coffee shop on the corner of Canal Street and St. Charles Avenue ""a high incident store.""

""Our stores are windows into America and every day our partners witness the challenges facing our communities – challenges to personal safety and security racism a growing mental health crisis and issues magnified by COVID. These challenges play out within our stores – affecting our partners our communities and our customers alike"" Jefferies said.

The first clue that they were breached came on September 10 when a threat actor offered to sell a database containing sensitive details of 219675 Starbucks customers on a popular hacking forum.

Starbucks Singapore forum post selling database contents

The hacking forum's owner ""pompompurin"" joined the discussion to back the validity of the stolen data saying that the provided samples contain substantial proof of authenticity.

Today Starbucks Singapore sent out letters to notify its customers of a data breach explaining that hackers may have stolen the following details:

Name

Gender

Date of birth

Mobile number

Email address

Residential address

This breach concerns only customers who have used the Starbucks mobile app to make orders or used the chain's online store to purchase goods from one of the 125 shops the chain operates in Singapore.

This point was further clarified by a Starbucks spokesperson to local media outlets where the data breach was confirmed again.

Additionally the company said that no financial details such as credit card information have been compromised as Starbucks does not store the data.

Letter received by one of Starbuck's impacted customers (hardwarezone.com.sg)

Even though account passwords Rewards membership or credits aren't considered impacted Starbucks Singapore urges customers to reset their passwords and remain vigilant against suspicious communications.

The data seller on the hacking forums claims to have already sold one copy of the stolen data for $3500 and is willing to offer at least four more copies to interested buyers.

The reason for this limitation is to artificially keep the value of the offered data high as selling it to many threat actors would diminish the value as multiple attacks are launched simultaneously.

This approach raises the risk of Starbucks Singapore customers becoming targets of phishing attacks social engineering and scamming.

It is also worth noting that the hacker initially offered access to the compromised admin panel for $25000 enabling intruders to fabricate promo codes change membership tiers and more.

However access to the admin panel was lost at some point so that offer has been retracted and the sale is now limited to the database contents.

Metinvest Kryvyi Rih Machining and Repair Plant (KMRP) carried out major repairs of a 20-ton electric bridge crane at the heat treatment section of the steel casting workshop. Metinvest Kryvyi Rih reports about it on its Facebook page.

Specialists updated the crane control system and replaced cable materials. A comfortable chair was installed in the cabin a heating and air conditioning system was also installed and a loudspeaker was installed for convenient communication with colleagues.

“Thanks to modern technology the driver has everything to perform work tasks productively and comfortably” the company notes.

Previously an electric overhead crane with a load capacity of 16 tons was installed in the mechanical assembly shop of KMRP after major repairs.

As GMK Center reported earlier in August Metinvest-KMRP launched the MA4134A pneumatic hammer in the steel construction shop the operation of which was suspended 10 years ago. Thanks to the restoration of the hammer Metinvest-KMRP will be able to expand the range and quantity of manufactured products.

Earlier KMRP produced wooden models for casting unloading and loading trunnions. Casting of parts will be done by Kametstal specialists and after casting the parts will be handed over to the enrichment factories of Ingulets Mining.

KMRP produces and repairs equipment for mining and metals enterprises of the Metinvest group. The enterprise has a metallurgical complex with a closed cycle.

ArcelorMittal expects its steel production in Europe to decline by approximately 1.5 million tons in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of 2021 Reuters infoms. The reason for this will be the underloading of capacities due to the decrease in demand for steel products and the energy crisis.

Earlier the world’s largest steel producer announced production cuts in Germany Poland and Spain. In particular ArcelorMittal stopped blast furnaces at its factories in these countries.

The steel industry is one of the most energy-intensive industries struggling to cope with rising costs. According to ArcelorMittal European producers have faced a drop in demand particularly in the automotive sector due to a worsening economic climate and increased imports from outside the EU.

As the representative of ArcelorMittal in Europe told the agency the mood of customers is worse now than during the crisis in 2020 caused by the coronavirus.

In particular in France according to the local representative of ArcelorMittal the company plans to use a vacation scheme for employees on certain days by the end of 2022. At the processing plant in Florange in the east of the country production will be reduced. The company will also use scheduled maintenance on one of the blast furnaces at the Dunkirk plant to reduce production from October. All French ArcelorMittal plants will shift activity to off-peak hours to reduce energy costs.

In the fourth quarter of 2021 ArcelorMittal produced 8.6 million tons of steel in Europe which is slightly more than half of the company’s global production.

The company also reported about a drop in total steel supplies by almost 10% y/y in the second quarter of 2022 mainly due to the impact of the war in Ukraine.

As Bloomberg notes the energy crisis is hitting steelmakers in Europe simultaneously raising costs and limiting demand from major consumers. This is a worrying sign for the European economy where steel demand is seen as a barometer of growth especially in the manufacturing and construction sectors.

According to investment bank Jefferies about a tenth of steel capacity in Europe is currently idle and ArcelorMittal has cut production by 20%. This could mean the end of high profits’ period for the European steel industry.

As GMK Center reported earlier ArcelorMittal Dunkirk plans to operate only one blast furnace out of three – the other two were stopped earlier due to rising energy costs.",,,,,,,,,

The rear I/O plate has holes. This is because there is a shroud the is designed as a fan intake. For a 200-300W CPU this shroud would probably be challenged but it worked in this chassis even with the Intel Xeon D-2755TE 16-core processor. One item we will note on this is that the shroud is very flexible. As a result it is a bit harder to get into place than many of the more rigid designs we see.

Once removed we can see the CPU heatsink for the Xeon D-2775TE.

We previously did a review of the Supermicro X12SDV-16C-SPT8F that powers this system. Check that one out for more on that platform.

Here is the airflow view with the PCIe riser and the CPU shroud removed and both memory and storage installed.

The memory is DDR4 and this platform takes ECC LRDIMMs and RDIMMs. All four channels are provided via 1 DIMM per channel slot configuration.

We installed a Sabrent Rocket Q NVMe SSDs as well as a few other options in this server in the M.2 slot. That worked well for primary storage. It would have been nice to have dual M.2 for redundant storage.

Not used but available in this system are the two MiniSAS connectors providing eight PCIe lanes or alternatively more SATA. We did not use these in our configuration. You can learn more about them in the motherboard review.

The PCIe riser comes on a small cage that helps provide rigidity to the riser solution when deployed. We wish that instead of requiring screws that this eventually becomes a tool-less riser slot.

Here is a look at the riser without the cage. If we were putting a high-power PCIe card here to take advantage of the 800W PSUs we would add two additional fan modules to the rear of the chassis.

Here is a quick look at the system again assembled one will see additional storage.

On the side of the system in front of the PSUs we get 2.5″ storage. One can see the hard drive here.

Next we are going to show the topology management and performance. If you read the motherboard review you can probably skip these as we tested the motherboard in this configuration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0b3JhZ2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VwZXJtaWNyby1ncHUtc3VwZXJzZXJ2ZXItc3lzLTgyMGdwLXRuYW8tbGF1bmNoZWQtd2l0aC1udmlkaWEtaGd4LTgtZ3B1LXN1cHBvcnTSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdG9yYWdlcmV2aWV3LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N1cGVybWljcm8tZ3B1LXN1cGVyc2VydmVyLXN5cy04MjBncC10bmFvLWxhdW5jaGVkLXdpdGgtbnZpZGlhLWhneC04LWdwdS1zdXBwb3J0P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO Launched with NVIDIA HGX 8-GPU Support,"Supermicro has added to their robust line of Universal GPU systems with an 8U box capable of housing eight socketed (SXM) NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs that support NVLink and NVSwitch.

Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO Highlights

The highlight of this box is clearly the support for NVIDIA’s HGX A100 8-GPU SXM4 Multi-GPU Board. That board and associated fans and heatsinks for cooling make up the lower half of the 8U chassis seen above. This box supports CPU-GPU PCIe 4.0 x16 interconnect and GPU-GPU interconnect via NVIDIA NVLink with NVSwitch.

Cooling is a big deal with GPU systems like this; if thermals get out of control the system will throttle performance. Supermicro has put significant effort into its dual cooling zones to ensure the GPUs remain operating at peak performance. There are fans at the front and back of the system in addition to a bank inside the server and a few more in the back. While the primary go-to-market chassis is air-cooled Supermicro does offer liquid cooling support in this chassis.

The top half of the Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO is the computer and storage portion of the server.

At launch this uses a Supermicro Super X12DGO-6 motherboard with support for two Intel Xeon Scalable CPUs with TDP up to 270W. The board also offers 32 DDR4 DIMM slots which translates to a max DRAM footprint of 8TB (LRDIMMs).

The motherboard also offers 10 PCIe slots all PCIe4 x16 LP including AIOM/OCP 3.0 support. These slots are split into two banks on the back of the system and are ready for NICs or a wide variety of accelerator cards. In terms of storage the system supports six drives in the front (tri-mode) and an optional set of four NVMe bays on the back. Some of the SSD bays also support NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage. There is M.2 onboard for boot duty.

A single 6000W OCP-compliant power supply provides power. In addition the system supports both AC and DC Power including support for standard OCP DC rack configurations.

Our Perspective

Supermicro is listening to customers in HPC and AI fields who are clamoring for more powerful GPU systems. To date Supermciro has also been flexible in their Universal GPU line making it easy to swap out Intel for AMD CPUs for instance or NVIDIA SXM GPUs for something else. That means from a few base components Supermicro can get pretty creative to solve high-end GPU needs.

The only thing that’s strange with the Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO is that it’s 8U. That’s a very beefy box and something that might be a challenge for those who are rack U-sensitive. Supermicro can configure similar 8-GPU servers in 4U and 5U. There are reasons to go with the 8U chassis though; it’s a little more efficient it should have better thermals and there are many more expansion options.

Supermicro is leaning very hard into the GPU server space; in traditional Supermicro form they have something for everyone. This 8U box appears quite impressive but is perhaps nearing the last hurrah for air-cooled GPUs. These boxes can only get so big and powerful before liquid cooling is the primary solution.

Back in August we reviewed the WD Gold 22TB CMR HDD which was highlighted by OptiNAND-enabled ArmorCache technology. We previously tested the Golds via our 36-bay Supermicro Storage SuperServer (SSG-540P-E1CTR36H) with TrueNAS installed (RAID2Z); however we wanted to gauge the performance (and value) of the 22TB Golds when used in an SMB environment. For this review we will be looking at how well they fare inside a Synology DiskStation DS1821+.

WD Gold 22TB Synology DS1821+

Powered by an AMD Ryzen CPU the Synology DS1821+ is an easy-to-use 8-bay NAS aimed more at SMBs that require a bit more performance and capacity. It features two M.2 slots for NVMe SSD cache as well as 10GbE connectivity (though this must be added via one of its PCIe expansions slots). Overall the Synology DiskStation DS1821+ is a strong performer for an SMB NAS.

Combining the WD Gold 22TB drives with the DS1821+ creates a huge potential storage repository for SMBs via a small physical footprint. While this might be a more specialized use case (as most businesses won’t likely this amount of storage in an 8-bay NAS) small professional offices like architects or content creation companies might start out with 4 or 5 of the WD 22TB drives with the other bays available for expansion when needed. And yes we know WD Red Pros would be preferred here but we don’t have them in the lab.

The combination of the Synology SMB NAS and the 22TB Gold drives would also make for an ideal internal backup solution. For example an organization could use most of the drive bays as their main storage pool while leaving a few available for online backups.

No matter the use case however the massive WD Gold 22TB drives will give organizations a lot of flexibility on how they manage their data with tons of opportunities for scalability.

Setup and Configuration

As usual we used the DSM Storage Manager app to manage the WD Gold populated-DS1821+. It also makes it incredibly easy to set up RAID pools and volumes as well as to view the health of the drive.

That said when setting up the Gold HDDs we actually hit a limitation of the filesystem. There is an upper limit on volume size so we first had to make a volume with the max size of 103.5TB (as you can see in the image below).

We then had to make a second volume to use the rest of the pool space.

WD Gold HDD 22TB Performance

Enterprise Synthetic Workload Analysis

As we indicated above we previously review the WD Gold 22TB inside the Supermicro server; however for these sets of benchmarks we installed eight of them into our Synology DiskStation DS1821+ configured in RAID6. We will be testing in both iSCSI and SMB protocols.

Our enterprise hard drive benchmark process preconditions each drive-set into steady-state with the same workload the device will be tested with under a heavy load of 16 threads with an outstanding queue of 16 per thread. The device is then tested in set intervals in multiple thread/queue depth profiles to show performance under light and heavy usage. Since hard drives reach their rated performance level very quickly we only graph out the main sections of each test.

Preconditioning and Primary Steady-State Tests:

Throughput (Read+Write IOPS Aggregate)

Average Latency (Read+Write Latency Averaged Together)

Max Latency (Peak Read or Write Latency)

Latency Standard Deviation (Read+Write Standard Deviation Averaged Together)

Our Enterprise Synthetic Workload Analysis includes four profiles based on real-world tasks. These profiles have been developed to make it easier to compare to our past benchmarks as well as widely-published values such as max 4K read and write speed and 8K 70/30 which is commonly used for enterprise drives.

4K

100% Read or 100% Write

100% 4K

8K 70/30

70% Read 30% Write

100% 8K

128K (Sequential)

100% Read or 100% Write

100% 128K

Our first throughput test measures 4K random performance when inside the Synology DS1821+. Here the WD Gold 22TB posted 328 IOPS in reads and 1477 IOPS write (SMB) and 5204 IOPS read and 1513 IOPS write (iSCSI).

In average latency the 22TB WD Gold was able to reach read and writes of 778.4ms and 174.4ms respectively in SMB while iSCSI posted 49.2ms read and 169.1ms write.

Moving on to the max latency the WD Gold hit 2453.2ms read and 3779.2ms write in SMB while the reaching 1461.1ms read and 846.9ms write in iSCSI.

For standard deviation the WD Gold recorded 611.48ms read and 333.9ms write in SMB and 51.12ms read and 165.22ms write in iSCSI.

Our next benchmark subjects the drives to 100% read and write activity at 8K sequential throughput. When inside the Synology DS1821+ the 22TB WD Gold drive posted 43709 IOPS read and 30951 IOPS write in SMB while hitting 140877 IOPS read and 56623 IOPS write in iSCSI.

Our next test shifts focus from a pure 8K sequential 100% read/write scenario to a mixed 8K 70/30 workload which will demonstrate how performance scales in a setting from 2T/2Q up to 16T/16Q.

In our first test which measures throughput the WD Gold 22TB had a range of 354 IOPS to 412 IOPS in SMB and 526 IOPS to 1700 IOPS in iSCSI.

With average latency at 8K 70/30 using a Synology DS1821+ the 22TB Gold 22TB posted 11.26ms through 619.27ms in SMB while iSCSI recorded a range of 7.57ms through 150.39ms.

Moving on to max latency numbers the 22TB WD Gold had a range of 710.87ms to 4883.6ms while the iSCSI showed 1309.31ms through 1902.51ms.

For our standard deviation latency results the 22TB Gold hit 14.04ms through 408.46ms (SMB) and 16.83ms to 245.49ms (iSCSI).

Our last test is the 128K benchmark a large-block sequential test showing the highest sequential transfer speed. Here the WD Gold 22TB posted 2.3GB/s read and 1.33GB/s write in SMB while iSCSI showed 1.88GB/s read and 615MB/s write. It’s worth noting that 2.3GB/s number effectively is capped by the interface on the Synology.

Conclusion

The WD Gold 22TB drive is designed to lower TCO for organizations as they allow for more capacity without having to increase physical footprint or the same capacity at a lower physical footprint. Not only that the Golds are one of the best-performing 3.5″ HDDs we’ve seen in our lab.

While this certainly makes them a perfect fit for enterprise-level data centers they are also a great choice for SMBs that need to store huge amounts of data and for those who want to future-proof their repository (capacity-wise). So it made sense for us to see what it is capable of outputting using some of the leading desktop (or SMB) NAS form factors.

As such we populated the Synology DS1821+ (a strong performing 8-bay SMB NAS) with eight WD Gold 22TB drives and put it through our usual gauntlet of tests. Overall we saw great throughput results across all of our benchmarking especially when configured with the iSCSI protocol.

This includes 328 IOPS read / 1477 IOPS write (SMB) and 5204 IOPS read / 1513 IOPS write (iSCSI) in random 4K and 43709 IOPS read / 30951 IOPS write (SMB) and 140877 IOPS read / 56623 IOPS write (iSCSI) during the 8K sequential workload. In addition the WD Gold was able to record a range of 354 IOPS to 412 IOPS in SMB and 526 IOPS to 1700 IOPS in iSCSI. For our large-block sequential test it posted 2.3GB/s read (capping the interface) and 1.33GB/s write in SMB while iSCSI showed 1.88GB/s read and 615MB/s write.

The WD Gold 22TB did not disappoint at the SMB level posting solid numbers throughout. Professional offices like architects and content creators will find that these massive hard drives will bring a lot of flexibility performance and room for growth when combining them with a NAS solution like the Synology DS1821+.

A revolution is happening in the chip design industry. A revolution that allows projects to finish earlier with fewer bugs while budget stays in control.

In this article I’ll share my personal view on a few related bottlenecks that directly affect time to market and the quality of the silicon. I’ll also touch on EDA licenses utilization engineering headcount and discuss the compute solution that is already at your grasp a few clicks away.

But before diving into the cloud world let’s explore a few real-life examples.

What are users saying about boosting chip-design productivity

You don’t have to read them all… feel free to jump to the next paragraph if you “got the idea”…

Arm was able to see “8x to 10x improvement turnaround time when running EDA workloads in the cloud”. Freeing up engineering teams to innovate was a key issue.

Anupama Asthana Director of Grid Solution Engineering at Qualcomm saw similar results. In this video she talked about the performance boost and hybrid flexibility in static timing analysis of up to 27%.

Sanjay Gajendra Chief Business Officer at Astera Labs shared that the company completed their PCIe5 design in less than a year on AWS compared to the years it would have taken using an on-premises HPC environment.

There are other semiconductor companies enjoying the fruits of this revolution. Not all of them are publicly talking about the edge they are gaining from using AWS.

Well not every workload would be ~50% faster as NXP’s circuit simulations but you’ll be able to experiment what works best for you.

How fast “new” becomes “old”

If you’re in R&D compute may be IT’s responsibility. Right? After all you’re “Just” the user.

However a couple of important points that directly affect every day work directly and frames the picture:

On-premises servers (i.e. in-house IT infrastructure) refresh rate is 2-4 years on average . Hardware gets outdated. FAST!

Compute refresh cycles are affected by operation’s yearly budget. But new servers supply time is un-certain even when budget is available. If you need more NOW you may have an issue.

The variety of on-premises compute may not provide the best resource for the job (I’ll explain why shortly).

We all witness the pace of innovation. The process technology keeps shrinking allowing more CPUs on a die more dies packed together. The compute capabilities are getting better and faster every year. Running on last year’s server a three years old server (or even older) cannot compete with the latest generation compute that came out this year. Cutting runtime getting results faster at scale with more cycles a day overnight runs with results ready to be debugged the morning after instead of the next day will all have huge impact on the quality of the silicon and time to market.

But there’s another angle

When your company made the decision which servers to acquire what was the compute variety? Was Intel hardware selected? AMD? ARM? Other? Accelerators? How much memory defined in the purchase order? How many CPUs per machine? Lots of decisions that were made by guesstimating the needs a few months in advance.

The point is – If you limit yourself to a few types of machines/vendors you’re missing the others. What if… a workload runs much faster on different CPU type or architecture that you have access to? Would you be able to measure the difference on premises? How easy would it be to experiment? (Spoiler Alert… it’s VERY EASY to do in the cloud… in minutes…reducing CAPEX and margin of error).

In my previous role I experienced cases where I had business-critical place & route runs. Timing closure was a challenge and the team had to try multiple parallel runs. Each run took around three days. We had to close timing ASAP… or… lose the business. The discussion with IT went like this:

(Based on a true story… names have been changed to protect the innocent)

Me: We need more compute capacity ASAP (I gave a number…). This directly affects time sensitive multi-million dollar business opportunity.

IT: We already used this year’s budget. You can work with management to fund H2’s operation plan budget. We’ll be happy to look into that next year.

Me: But we need it NOW!! The business wouldn’t wait for us!

IT: Sorry no budget left. But even if we had the budget there’s a shortage in supply chain we could have gotten some hardware installed four months from ordering. How about taking a couple of machines from another project and secure it for you now would that do?

Me: I’ll take everything you got. (Beggars can’t be choosy) but it is far…far… from what we really need.

IT: Sorry…

Me (Thinking to myself): “If there was just a simple way to get compute on demand in minutes…mmm”

Every design or verification task has different compute needs

A typical project requires a variety of compute tasks through the design cycle validation front-end backend etc…. Each flow would work best with different compute specific storage I/O access and different amount of memory.

Let’s talk again about the compute pool that your company has. Let’s assume for the sake of the discussion that it is compute farm is new and park the scenario of running on old/slow compute that hasn’t reached refresh cycle.

Now let’s analyze some chip design flows:

Verification

For verification you may want fewer CPUs running as fast as possible. Regressions start slim as you’re building up the environment (less compute is required – so on-premises paid for machines are staying idle) and as the project progresses you need more and more compute (beyond what you actually have onsite). What do you do today? Has your company acquired compute for the maximum peak? Average peak? What happens if you need more compute resources? Imagine needing 20 additional high memory servers for timing analysis and having them available in seconds funded by the money you saved by potentially shutting down idle compute nodes.

We talked about new HW vs old one. Another aspect is HW that is challenging to own for short durations. Think about special accelerators or special servers with CPU overclocking that you can’t just buy in the open market. For verification if the CPU is overclocked to run 30% faster you’ll get the results faster.

Formal is another verification topic – proving multiple properties. Every property could be run with multiple engines in parallel and therefore you can uncover more bugs upfront…

If you use more compute you finish your project design and verification faster. And by more there are already examples of tens of thousands of jobs running in parallel for a short period of time and getting JasperGold results faster (tens or thousands of times faster…).

Backend / Analog

For place & route you will want to use multicores with high memory per core machines and high throughput to storage.

EDA vendors now have AI features. Multiple automatic Place & Route runs would be invoked in order to get best PPA (Power/Performance/Area) but those runs require a lot of parallel high-end servers. What’s the impact of taking these servers from your project’s server pool? Would you need to sacrifice other runs for that?

Remember that these are not the same servers you will use for verification. You’ll want the runs to finish ASAP when those runs are on the critical path of the project. What about equivalence checking? Characterization? Analog runs? Different machines here again…

You get the idea…

Changing the way we think about hardware

We are traditionally taught to forecast the compute we need in advance plan for the average plus and cope with shortage. We’re taught that we only have the servers pool on our compute farm (oh… and BTW you can’t take the stronger ones now because a peer project is more urgent and those are allocated to them…).

The cloud revolution turns the cards and changes the game entirely. You have virtually no compute limitations. Take as many as you need. Take new hardware. Take faster/stronger machines when you need those or more mainstream ones when you’re not on the critical path of the project. Experiment what works for you best. Optimize for cost or performance – the options are nearly limitless.

Some semiconductor companies are operating ONLY in the cloud. Others that already invested in on-premises compute are going hybrid – leveraging the cloud for peak usage or for special compute that’s inefficient to own throughout the entire year.

The trend is clear. The benefits are clear. There’s no reason to stay behind when it’s so simple to get actual compute needs fulfilled.

Hmm… so is cloud more expensive than on-premises?

With all the benefits discussed you would ask yourself – is cloud more expensive?

But the real answer is “it depends”. It’s all in your control.

You can probably pay less or be on par if you match the same workloads and reduce the time of idle licenses. Some customers started the journey to the cloud because of cost reduction. But… you also have the option to choose… do you want better compute for a specific workload today? Are you willing to pay a bit more for runs to end in a week rather than two months? You decide the cost/performance tradeoffs for the current stage.

Apples to apples

The correct way to look at cost is on the project level.

The real cost for taping out a chip is heavily leaned on cost of engineering (people) and licenses then cost of compute (including rent space taxes per meter electricity on-going maintenance: backup/restore/sw updates… etc).

A wrong way to run a calculation would be to compare the price of on-premises server for the refresh cycle period then you compare it to same period of on-demand pricing. This is far from the real cost.

Moving to the cloud you are neutralizing: rent electricity physical security maintenance of the HW… All these are being taken care of for you. You’re also not paying for compute when you don’t use it you pay by the second only when you running simulations (on demand model).

Chip designers can experiment with multiple compute types in minutes the right compute for the job without having to order physical HW. Without waiting months for installing just to find out it’s not what you need. The innovation speed increases dramatically.

The above chart is a graphical representation of predicted (guessed…) on-premises capacity vs actual use. The blue line represents refresh cycle investments over time. As project starts compute may be underutilized and you paid for compute you do not need but as project progresses you might not be able to handle peaks. That can be business critical as discussed earlier.

“Hidden” project costs

We discussed few ways to pull in schedule. Using high end compute at scale.

If you’re the first to market it can make a vast difference. (or the other way around… if you’re second or third – you may be losing the market).

By pulling in two months of your project taking into account a chip-design team that consists of 50 engineers (with SW it is probably more…). You are looking at an immediate cost saving of ~$1M (based on average chip design salary – Glassdoor 2022 report).

You may also be able to save project cost by pulling in schedule (engineering headcount cost) and licenses when those could be released for your next project earlier.

While some companies specifically discussed the schedule pull in others claim they will not cut the project time even when it is technically possible. For those companies the benefit of getting things done better and faster is quality: a cleaner tape-out database.

According to Semiengineering / IBIS – taping-out in 16nm costs $106M 7nm costs $297M 5nm $542M. Actual cost may be different for your chip. Whatever the number is it is not negligible.

Major bugs might require another tape-out…

This has huge cost implications. The team will not work on the future generation as debugging takes an enormous toll and then FAB costs waiting again for FAB production packaging … forget the engineering and manufacturing cost but you could lose the market.

Let’s say it all gladly went well well… you should still want to analyze wafers to improve yield. Improving yield is money on the table. AWS offers methods to analyze huge datasets with AI to get the insights for yield improvement.

How about security and licenses?

Take a look at the banking industry defense industry automotive industry chip design industry…

The list goes on… (look for the public use cases at the bottom of the linked pages). If those industries don’t have security issues working with the cloud why would you think you do?

Security is a solved problem for EDA and other industries. Cloud alliance was formed so FABs and EDA companies could collaborate and allow smooth cloud based tapeouts. When you provision the compute environment with AWS you have full control over the data over the location of the data is stored the encryption and who has access to it.

EDA Licenses are no different for on-premises or cloud. It doesn’t really matter where your license server is located. We do see EDA companies offering special cloud licensing models as Synopsys (FlexEDA) and Cadence (Cloud Passport) but that’s an article for a different time.

ARM NXP Qualcomm Annapurna and many others already enjoy the increased productivity.

Summary

Starting with cloud compute doesn’t mean you have to throw away what you already have. Engineering doesn’t have to feel a change in their working environment. Hybrid models allow using local resources and expand to the cloud when you need it.

This is a paradigm shift. You can start as small or as big as you wish. Staying behind shouldn’t be an option – If you want to get projects out faster and cleaner potentially at a lower cost drop us a note below in the comments section. Our team will be happy to assist.",,,,,,,,,,,,

So what does that have to do with Android? Well typically when Apple does something like this the entire industry follows. Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 – citing “courage” as the reason. Then every other phone also removed the headphone jack. And there are other examples out there too.

While many Android phones do support eSIM already most carriers do not advertise it. That is because eSIM makes it easier to switch carriers at will and that’s not something the carriers like to have. So your phone that you’re reading this on might actually have eSIM support and you don’t even know it. For example every Pixel has eSIM because they work on Google Fi. And Google Fi is an eSIM first carrier.

So what we want to do today is go over how you can transition from a physical SIM to an eSIM on each of the three carriers in the US. But first let’s talk about what an eSIM actually is.

What is an eSIM?

So now that we know what a SIM is what is an eSIM? It’s an embedded-SIM or a programmable SIM that is built into the phone and you’ll never see it. This has been available for things like cellular-connected smartwatches and some tablets. Some phones are compatible with eSIM as well.

eSIM was first introduced in 2016 so it’s still fairly new. The Samsung Gear S2 Classic 3G was the first device to use an eSIM. Apple first introduced eSIM back in September 2017 on its Apple Watch Series 3 and the following year on the iPhone XS.

Interestingly some MVNO carriers like Google Fi use eSIM and prefer it over a regular SIM card. Likely because that’s one less thing they need to ship to the customer.

eSIMs give customers more flexibility for switching carriers. Which is something the carriers don’t like. Since you are able to just go into settings and add another carrier of course you do need an account and plan with that carrier for it to really work.

How to activate an eSIM in the US

After you get your phone you’re going to need to activate that eSIM on your phone. Now some MVNO’s like Google Fi makes this super easy but it does take a few minutes. The larger carriers like AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon don’t make it as easy because it makes it easier to switch carriers. Something they don’t want. So here’s how you can activate it on each carrier.

How to activate an eSIM on AT&T

Firstly you’ll want to sign into your AT&T account.

Next click on My devices.

Then you’ll want to find your device and click on Manage.

Next click Options & Settings.

Now click on Get a new eSIM.

From there you’ll just follow the prompts to complete the setup of your new eSIM. And within a few minutes your eSIM will be active.

How to activate an eSIM on T-Mobile

Over on T-Mobile you’ll want to head over to your T-Mobile account.

Then find your device and select the phone number.

Next you’ll be prompted to enter your EID number.

Now scan the QR code (which is pictured below).

And you’ll be walked through the process of setting up your eSIM on T-Mobile.

How to activate an eSIM on Verizon

With Verizon you’ll need to open the My Verizon app to activate your eSIM. This will work on phones you buy from Verizon and those that you brought over to Verizon.

The other way you can do this is by calling Verizon’s customer support at (800) 922-0204 to get help activating your eSIM. Obviously Verizon doesn’t make it as easy as other carriers.

How to download an eSIM to your Android phone

If you already have an eSIM activated on your carrier then when switching to a new Android phone you’ll simply need to download the eSIM to that device. Now Android phones are able to save multiple eSIMs so you can switch pretty easily. Here’s how you can download that eSIM.

On your Android phone head into Settings.

Next tap on Network & Internet.

Now tap on the plus button next to SIMs.

Tap on the Download a SIM instead button. It’ll be at the bottom of the screen.

Then tap on Next.

It’ll connect to the network. Then ask you to confirm your carrier. Select your carrier here.

Scan the QR code that you got from your carrier.

After your code has been confirmed tap on Done to complete the activation.

Now this may not work for everyone (I’ve had trouble doing this with Verizon myself) so you may need to call your carrier to get your eSIM switched over.

And that’s it. That’s how you can download an eSIM onto your Android smartphone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvbW9iaWxlL3RoZS1pcGhvbmUtMTRzLWVzaW0tY2hhbmdlLWhhcy1zbWFsbC1jYXJyaWVycy1ob3BlZnVsLXN3aXRjaGluZy13aWxsLWJlLWVhc2llci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The iPhone 14's eSIM Change Has Small Carriers Hopeful Switching Will Be Easier,"Apple's embrace of virtual embedded SIM cards in the iPhone 14 line -- eliminating the SIM card slot for US models -- has led some online to worry that switching carriers is about to get a lot more difficult. Smaller carriers like Mint Mobile US Mobile and Boost Mobile however see it as just the opposite.

""Mint has always believed in digital technologies that enhance and ease wireless services"" Aron North Mint Mobile's chief marketing officer said in a statement to CNET. ""Mint has been supporting [the] eSIM for almost two years because we knew even back then this innovation would allow users to switch faster and easier.""

Apple has supported digital SIM cards dating as far back as 2018's iPhone XS XS Max and XR. Last year's iPhone 13 line expanded that support and allowed for multiple eSIMs to be enabled at once letting customers easily swap carriers or make use of multiple phone numbers for instance for work and personal use.

While the physical SIM card slot won't be included on the iPhone in the US international phones will still have a physical SIM card slot.

""I think it's transformational"" Ahmed Khattak founder and CEO of US Mobile a mobile virtual network operator that offers service on Verizon and T-Mobile's respective networks. ""I think the fact that it even happened ... I'm shaking my head ... because it really democratizes connectivity.""

""I didn't expect that they [would] just go cold turkey on physical SIM cards"" he adds. ""The fact that they just got rid of it like headphone jacks is surprising.""

Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols believes eSIM technology makes it ""way easier to switch"" providers. Boost Mobile uses a combination of AT&T T-Mobile and parent Dish's wireless networks. Once a Sprint brand it became part of Dish as a result of T-Mobile's 2020 merger with Sprint with the satellite TV provider now in the process of becoming a fourth network option to rival AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon.

Later this year Dish will start offering Boost Infinite a wireless service that seems set to more directly compete with the big three providers. Having an easier way to get customers to switch networks could be key to its ability to grow.

No different than signing up for Netflix

Physical SIM cards. Jason Cipriani/CNET

A physical SIM card Stokols says usually takes a few days to arrive if ordered online. Customers then have to put the SIM card into their phone and go through an activation process. With the eSIM he says the activation and transferring can be done ""immediately"" at the time of purchase.

""It looks a lot like software... It's literally 'you sign up online and you activate.' No different than [when] you sign up for Netflix.""

Khattak has nearly 250000 subscribers for his US Mobile service with a third of his customers using eSIMs today.

""It's easier for you to move in it's easy for you to move out"" he says. ""I think the reason why people think it's not that easy is because most carriers have made it very difficult"" to switch in the past. ""But I think if you try it out... you realize it's so easy.""

Khattak says that the process can potentially take ""less than a minute to get your device provisioned with us."" If you wanted to leave that could similarly take ""less than a minute to cancel your phone number"" and bring it to someone else which is known as ""porting.""

He notes that the porting process is largely the same via eSIM as it was with physical SIM cards but because you don't need to wait for a physical SIM card to show up it can go faster leading to a potentially more seamless experience. You don't have to deal with figuring out what size SIM card goes into your phone when to put it in during activation or having to search for 16- or 17-digit numbers to enter into a website or repeat to a customer service representative to activate the physical SIM cards.

Khattak envisions that over the next couple of years ""the end result"" of the switch to eSIM technology will lead to people ""buying their cell phone connectivity on the app stores not through local stores.""

All three of the major US carriers support eSIM. Apple/Screenshot by Sarah Lord/CNET

All three of the main US providers support the eSIM. Some like T-Mobile have even been utilizing the technology to offer free trials of their networks as a way to lure customers from competitors.

Last month it expanded the program now dubbed Network Pass to allow for three free months of T-Mobile service. Using the eSIM the virtual SIM card is downloaded from T-Mobile's app and is designed to exist alongside your current provider to let you see if T-Mobile's network works as well or exceeds what a rival might be offering. You will need your phone to be unlocked to participate but the company doesn't run a credit check or even take down a credit card number.

If you want to switch the app will guide you through the process. If you want to stick with your current provider you can simply delete the eSIM inside the settings app of your phone.

US Mobile and Verizon-owned Visible offer similar free trial programs over apps that use an eSIM to allow you to try out their respective networks.

Growing pains expected

Although there is plenty of optimism from some smaller wireless players for the future some wireless watchers do envision a few potential issues in the transition. For one finding out who's accepting eSIMs is not readily apparent. Apple has a list of eSIM-ready wireless providers on its website but as of when this is written that only includes 39 networks and still lacks some MVNOs including US Mobile.

""In the short term there are going to be a lot of growing pains as carriers streamline the process of converting from physical SIMs"" Avi Greengart an analyst for research firm Techsponential tells CNET. ""Things go wrong"" he says noting that there are issues with MVNOs that don't currently support the eSIM as well as potentially with the process of transferring from an eSIM to a physical SIM card if you needed to go back to an older device.

That said Greengart does see the benefits in the technology particularly when it comes to consumers' flexibility for choosing network providers switching between networks and managing multiple phone lines on one account.

""I think in the short term there's going to be some pain and in the long term I think it'll actually be OK.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9zdHJhdGNhcC1idXlzLTE0LW1vYmlsZS10b3dlcnMtaW4tdGhlLXVzLWZvci0yMG0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,StratCap buys 14 mobile towers in the US for $20m,"The towers which have been acquired by the infrastructure arm of StratCap are located in and around the Oklahoma metropolitan area plus one tower in Wichita Kansas.

StratCap Wireless has completed the acquisition of 20 towers for a fee of $20.3 million.

Of the towers acquired it includes 23 existing tenant leases with US telcos Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile who make up 100 percent of rental revenues. It is expected that these tenants will likely upgrade the existing sites to 5G with towers boasting a significant capacity for new tenants to modify these towers.

“These assets serve as mission-critical infrastructure for our tenants helping them to deliver wireless coverage to a significant customer base in the Oklahoma metro region"" said StratCap managing partner Jim Condon.

The company adds that the acquisition will provide 'long-term predictable rental revenues from premier tenants'.

Data Center push

StratCap formerly Strategic Capital has been acquisitive of late with the company acquiring a data center leased to Expedient outside Milwaukee Wisconsin last month through its data center real estate division StratCap Data Centers.

StratCap Data Centers completed the acquisition of a 28500 square foot (2650 sqm) data center that is fully leased on a triple-net basis located outside Milwaukee in Franklin. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Before this acquisition StratCap scooped a data center in Jacksonville Florida in July. The 25600 square foot (2400 sqm) facility is fully leased to a 'major telecommunications carrier' that is likely T-Mobile and serves as one of the company’s wireless communications switching centers and includes a cell tower.

Last year StratCap set up a new $1.5 billion data center investment platform called Strategic Datasphere LLC to invest in data centers.

The investment is focused on the acquisition development and management of data center facilities across the US and Europe including through sale-leaseback transactions with ‘technology communications cloud enterprise and public sector tenants.’"

With one simple line of code Java’s JOptionPane enables a program to prompt the user with a Windows-based input dialog box and return any user input as a String. var name = javax.swing.JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""What is your name?""); If the javax.swing package is imported the JOptionPane code becomes even more succinct. The import also simplifies the use of other fun JOptionPane methods including: showConfirmDialog();

showMessageDialog(); and

showOptionDialog().

JOptionPane import and methods For example the following Java class uses JOptionPane’s showInputDialog() method to prompt for user input and then displays a message back to the user with the showMessageDialog() function. As you can see the javax.swing import greatly reduces the code’s verbosity: import javax.swing.*; public class JOptionPaneExample { public static void main(String[] args ) { /* JOptionPane Java user input example */ var name = JOptionPane.showInputDialog( ""What is your name?"" ); var output = name + "" is such a nice name!"" ; JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null  output ); } }

JOptionPane vs Console vs Scanner input in Java It has always been a mystery to me: Why do instructors teach Java always subject students to console-based input with the JDK’s Scanner Console or InputStream classes? Using a command prompt or terminal window to input text into a computer program is not intuitive nor is it fun. Actually console input is a great way to discourage new learners and push them away from the Java platform. In contrast to the Console or Scanner classes the JOptionPane provides immediate visual feedback which makes writing Java code satisfying and fun. Furthermore it teaches newcomers to the Java platform some important lessons about the JDK including: Java user input does not have to be terminal- or console-based.

Java supports Windowing components out of the box unlike languages such as Python or Rust.

Java is cross-platform as the JOptionPane works on Linux Windows and Macs.

JOptionPane showConfirmDialog example The showInputDialog and showMessageDialog functions are great at garnering user input and displaying a response. Alternatively to limit a user’s response to just yes no or cancel you can use the JOptionPane’s showConfirmDialog() method. This function displays a message box with only three options and returns one of the following int values to the program: 0 if the user selects ‘Yes’

1 if the user selects ‘No’

2 if the user selects ‘Cancel’ The following example demonstrates the JOptionPane’s showConfirmDialog() method in action: import javax.swing.*; public class JOptionPaneExample { public static void main(String[] args ) { /* JOptionPane Java user input example */ var yesOrNo = JOptionPane .showConfirmDialog(null ""What will it be?"" ); if ( yesOrNo == 0) { JOptionPane .showMessageDialog( null  ""You chose yes!"" ); } if ( yesOrNo == 1) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null  ""You chose no."" ); } if ( yesOrNo == 2) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null  ""You chose to cancel!"" ); } } }

JOptionPane showOptionDialog method To limit input but not restrict the user to a ‘yes’ ‘no’ or ‘cancel’ the JOptionPane showOptionDialog method can be used. This method allows you to supply an array of objects to the dialog box. Each object is rendered and the calling program receives the array index position of the option selected. For example the following JOptionPane showOptionDialog example asks the user to select a brownie pie or cake as a dessert option. import javax.swing.*; public class ShowOptionDialogExample { public static void main(String[] args ) { /* JOptionPane Java user input example */ String[] options = { ""brownie"" ""pie"" ""cake"" }; var dessert = JOptionPane .showOptionDialog(null ""Which dessert?"" ""Select one:"" 0 3 null options options[0] ); if ( dessert == 0) { JOptionPane .showMessageDialog( null  ""You chose a brownie!"" ); } if ( dessert == 1) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null  ""You chose pie."" ); } if ( dessert == 2) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null  ""You chose cake!"" ); } } } If the user selects the pie button then the code returns an index of 1 which generates a JOptionPane message dialog box that displays the text “You chose pie!”

JOptionPane error message dialog boxes As you can see the JOptionPane’s showOptionDialog box is highly parameterized. The options available are: The parentComponent which can be left null unless the program will display a dialog box on a custom panel

The title of the dialog box

The text to display inside the dialog box

An option type to include yes no or cancel buttons

The message type be it warning informational or a question

An optional custom icon to display

The array of values to display

The item in the array to initially highlight",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbmJ5dGUuY29tL2xlZ2FjeS9ob3ctdG8tYmVhdC10aGUtbWFoam9uZy1zdWJzdG9yeS1pbi15YWt1emEta2l3YW1pLTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to beat the mahjong substory in Yakuza Kiwami 2,See what others are saying,,,,,,

Probat has announced that it is now operating as a stock corporation as it seeks to strengthen its international expansion plans.



The German company said that becoming a stock corporation provides the Probat Group with an opportunity to continue to ‘decisively and sustainably shape the international coffee market’.



A statement by the group said that an initial public offering is not planned and that the Probat Group will now operate solely under the Probat title.



""We have clearly focused our corporate strategy on growth and strengthening the international brand presence of the entire Group. The transformation into a stock corporation particularly focuses on further successful market development which is an important pillar for the long-term success of Probat” said Wim Abbing CEO Probat.



Probat began expanding the production area at its headquarters in Emmerich in September 2020 with the €40m ($40m) project expected to reach completion by the end of this year.



The company also recently established a climate strategy with the target to reduce Probat’s carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2030.

The stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is likely to see earnings growth of 119.6% this year.

What's Favoring the Stock?

The price of West Texas Intermediate crude is trading over $85-per-barrel mark highlighting a substantial improvement in the past year. The positive oil price trajectory is a boon for BP’s upstream operations. The favorable oil price scenario and increasing daily oil equivalent production volumes are aiding the energy giant’s bottom line. BP stated that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key new projects had been delivered.

BP is expected to gain from the refining business. The integrated energy player has a significant portion of its refining capacities in the United States. In the country BP operates feedstock-advantaged and sophisticated refineries. The refineries are connected to strong logistics and fuel infrastructure. Thus with a considerable presence in the United States the energy major is well placed to capitalize on the solid fuel demand backed by the reopening of the economy and wider distribution of vaccines.

BP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. The integrated player recently announced that it is planning to repurchase $3.5 billion in shares before declaring results for the September quarter.

Other Stocks to Consider

Other top-ranked players in the energy space include Chesapeake Energy Corporation CHK EQT Corporation EQT and Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM. Chesapeake Energy presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while EQT and ExxonMobil currently carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Chesapeake Energy is a premium natural gas operator and is well-positioned to gain from the significant improvement in gas prices in the past year. In the prolific gas-rich Marcellus shale play CHK’s operation is spreading across roughly 650000 net acres where an average of four to five rigs will be operating this year.

Chesapeake Energy also has a strong presence in Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale play making the production outlook bright. Overall being a leading upstream energy player CHK has more than 15 years of inventory signifying more than 2200 gas locations.

In the core of gas-rich Marcellus and Utica Shales EQT Corporation has a strong foothold. Being a leading producer of natural gas EQT is benefiting from high natural gas prices. For 2022 it is likely to witness earnings growth of almost 337%.

The positive trajectory in oil price is a boon for ExxonMobil’s upstream operations. This is because ExxonMobil has a pipeline of key projects in the Permian the most prolific basin in the United States and offshore Guyana.

This time our focus shifts to consumer giant McDonald's Corporation (MCD). As ever we will outline our valuation framework using discounted cash flow and relative valuation techniques. Then we will adjust based on some assumptions on an overall macroeconomic level as well as more company-specific measures. After that we add to this with an overview of the charts to see how it fits in before coming up with our final 12-month price target for McDonald's stock price.

McDonald's company overview and history

Not sure how much detail we really need to go into for this one. Practically everyone is familiar with McDonald's and the products and services they offer. McDonald's was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in Illinois. It quickly became an American institution and has undergone a rapid global expansion mostly during the 1970s and 1980s and is now practically visible in every country on earth. McDonald's operates in the restaurant sector through direct ownership and franchise business. The company offers a range of signature lines such as the Big Mac McChicken and ice cream sundaes. Over the past number of years the company has adapted its menu to account for changes in consumer tastes; now salads fruit and coffee are mainstays on the menu. McDonald's went public on April 21 1965.

As we can see below overseas markets represent over 50% of McDonald's revenue with the US being the other major source. This means the strong dollar is a major headwind for earnings in the current cycle.

McDonald's operates mostly via franchises with less than 10% of its restaurants directly owned. To this day it is one of the most successful franchise models in history.

Given its huge and long established business McDonald's would be seen as a relatively defensive stock. Below is the performance since the start of this year. McDonald's stock has comfortably outperformed the main indices. McDonald's is down 5% for the year while the S&P 500 is down 20% and the Nasdaq down 29%.

However if we go back over the last five years the picture changes with the Nasdaq outperforming while McDonald's still outperforms the S&P 500.

Wall Street consensus forecasts

The amazing thing is that there is not a single Sell recommendation. Given that the stock is down 5% on the year so far you would think at least one analyst would have noticed this and the bear market we find ourselves in but the optimism of Wall Street analysts continues to baffle. McDonald's is defensive for sure. It is always the lowest price point and has incredible pricing power with consumers and its suppliers.

In an economic downturn it remains a ""treat"" for the family and replaces more expensive dining out options. Still with the advent of inflation and consumers reigning in spending it may be hard for McDonald's to grow revenues and margins. This is something we will look into in more detail below.

Macroeconomic backdrop market cycle and sector analysis

Regular readers may find this section a bit repetitive but it is important to put the cycle into context. This after all determines stock performance as much as individual micro factors or management skill. Especially for a truly global company such as McDonald's there is no escaping the macro backdrop. As mentioned the rising dollar will be a serious headwind when converting overseas revenue back into USD. This is perhaps being overlooked by the analyst community.

Dollar Index year to date % change

Last week's CPI number certainly put any notion of inflation quickly coming under control back to sleep. Inflation it seems is here to stay and that will hurt consumer demand. Bond yields have already spiked considerably after the CPI number. We can use any number of bond yields but the picture is the same – interest rate predictions have been increased and sit at the top of recent rages.

Also of particular note is that yields are higher than when the S&P 500 bottomed in June. This either indicates equities are behind and need to play catch up or they are a leading indicator and the bond market has got it wrong. In any event it looks like a continued difficult environment for equities.

This is generally what happens where we are going to.

The Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) is higher when inflation is low and growth rates are high. During stagflation or times when growth is slow & inflation is high the P/E ratio goes down. In the stagflationary '70s the P/E for the S&P 500 $SPY went to single digits. pic.twitter.com/l86bRaKLxz — Ben Woodward CFA (@BennettWoodman) September 9 2022

Big tech aka FANNGT (whatever you want to call it) still looks to be the ones causing much of the relative overvaluation so they may have the furthest to fall still despite some spectacular collapses so far (Netflix Meta Platforms).

Already we can see how valuations for small-caps and mid-caps have corrected so big caps could and should be next.

The relative strength we have been seeing within middle caps and small caps for weeks now is mainly due to their valuation metrics imo.

Recent McDonald's news and earnings

McDonald's missed on the top line in its last earnings report. Earnings per share came in at $2.55 versus consensus estimates of $2.47 but revenue was $5.72 billion versus $5.81 billion. The company instigated price increases to offset rising costs and relied on international markets to pick up the slack versus the US slowdown.

As expected McDonald's mentioned currency impacts during the call and we expect these to continue given the ongoing strength of the dollar. McDonald's took a charge of just over $1 billion from exiting Russia. The next earnings are scheduled for October 24. What is of particular interest is the number of downward revisions in the past three months. There were 17 downgrades versus just 14 upgrades to earnings estimates.

McDonald's forecast and valuation

As ever we use two models: the discounted cash flow and relative valuation models. First we start with consensus estimates and tweak them based on what we see happening to margin and sales growth. We then add an extra layer of analysis from the overall macro environment and technical analysis to get our overall 12-month price target.

Source: Refinitive FXStreet calculations

Source: Refinitive FXStreet calculations

There is not much need to adjust our figures as it is becoming clear McDonald's stock is overvalued. Trading on a current P/E of 25 is toward the top of the 20-year average range. Forecasting revenues to grow at consensus gives us a possible upside to $266 based on the P/E remaining constant. Looking at the DCF calculation however that would give us a fair value of $156. Again that is based on consensus. I tend to think 2023 will see a flatlining in terms of revenue and margins. That means EPS of $9.94 giving us a price target at current levels of $248.

However I also tend to think McDonald's will see its P/E ratio rerate along with the S&P 500 back to at least 20. This gives a price target of $189. This is more in keeping with the discounted cash flow outcome.

The two charts below show historical comparisons for McDonald's valuation. The average price/earnings (P/E) going back 20 years is 19. It is trading more or less in line with the overall restaurant sector. All sectors appear to be in line for a rerating lower though if current economic forecasts for inflation and interest rates prove accurate. If we look at other metrics they also look too high.

""McDonald's is a cash cow though and immune to any recession"" you interrupt. For starters not many are immune to recession inflation rising costs or a strong dollar. But yes McDonald's is an extremely well-run and cash-generative business. However valuations during this Fed-juiced period have gotten way too over-stretched. McDonald's trades on over 23 times its free cash flow. The 20-year average is nearer to 15.

McDonald's trades at eight times sales. Over the past 20 years the average is nearer to four. The recent move up is a causative effect of years of monetary stimulus.

McDonald's technical analysis

At present it does appear that we have put in a bearish double top around $270. If so this is a negative sign and adds to my concerns regarding the valuation. There is strong support at $220 and only as recently as March McDonald's stock was trading at that level. I have not seen much reason since March to account for a 20% increase in the MCD stock price and neither has the overall market.

MCD is defensive but not to that extent. Forecasting at consensus but with a rerating gives us a price target of $202.35. The market loves round numbers so it will be too tempting to trade to $200. It may well be that we go below here. In selecting a price target though 12 months is the standard timeframe. With the market being forward-looking to the tune of about 6-9 months on average what we are really forecasting is how McDonald's will look in about 18 months' time. My impression is it will be coping well as it always does but the overall market will have rerated lower. Thus I am going for a 12-month price target of $200.

McDonald's (MCD) stock weekly

Executive Summary: Price target and recommendation

Therefore taking $200 as our price target that necessitates a SELL rating on McDonald's (MCD) stock.

Upside risks

Fed pivot inflation falls sharply as Fed pauses or cuts rates. (This is unlikely and if they do it means a deep recession which is not a reason for equities to go higher)

USD falls (Again this is unlikely unless we get a Fed pivot above but it may begin to slow as other countries begin to hike rates as the ECB and BoE are doing)

Downside risks

Inflation remains sticky and we enter a moderate to deep recession. (This will cause an earnings slowdown and a P/E rerating at the same time and necessitate a steeper fall than forecast)

It was the one at 1550 St. Georges Ave. in Delco Plaza. But that’s how you’d locate it if you’d never been there. For those of us who had known it for decades since our childhood it was the one across St. Georges Avenue from Buxton’s and from Bradlees.

Or the one on St. Georges Avenue in Avenel behind the Roy Rogers where my friend almost got us kicked out as teenagers.

Those places are all gone now too.

So I can imagine how my mom and dad felt when their places went away for good. Places like EJ Korvette (which everyone just ended up calling Korvettes) and Two Guys. Actually I don’t have to imagine. I now know.

Making business news this week is that the troubled home store Bed Bath & Beyond is laying off 20% of its corporate employees and closing down three of its New Jersey locations.

The one on Route 9 South in Manalapan along with International Drive in Flanders and East Ridgewood Avenue in Paramus are all going to be shuttered. No exact date has been given.

It’s part of a broader plan to ditch 150 Bed Bath & Beyond stores nationwide. This is more than one-fifth of all the U.S. locations. And isn’t this how it always seems to start? The beginning of that long gray march towards the edge of the retail cliff.

There are stores we are so used to seeing in New Jersey it seems hard to imagine them not here. Places like Staples. Home Depot. Walmart. Target. Walgreens. It’s a changing world. And when the world starts changing faster than you do you feel left behind.

When some of these places go the cycle will be complete. We will replace our parents. Our parents who lost Bamberger’s and Woolworth’s S.S. Kresge’s and Woolco and all the others. And we’ll know how they felt.

Old.

You may have seen other articles about how well Tesla’s batteries hold up over lots of miles (hint: they hold up well) but my Tesla actually has low mileage on it (thanks pandemic and now my new work from home situation!). Thus I think my battery life story is kind of interesting because its age accounts for any difference in my range more than anything else. I don’t live in a hot area I only rarely use superchargers (like the drive I took from Seattle to San Diego and back last summer) and I rarely charge to more than 80% full. In my first electric car a 2011 Nissan LEAF after four and a half years I had lost around 20% of the battery’s capacity (and by the time I sold it two years later it had lost about 25% of its original range).

But let me add a caveat: in order for me to get about 300 miles of range in my Tesla Model 3 I need to drive it in certain ways and under certain conditions. I can’t just charge it to 100% jump on the interstate and cruise at 85 MPH without ever slowing down or stopping and expect to go 300 miles before the battery is used up. No quite the opposite. In order to test my current real world range I am performing a series of tests to see what kind of range I might expect in different scenarios. My first test: 10 days of errand running commuting and other short trips (nothing over about 30-40 miles on a single drive) on a single charge in a warmer than normal September in and around Seattle WA. Warmer than normal here means temps in the upper 70’s to low 80’s Fahrenheit.

Note I ran the battery down to 20% and I started from an 80% charge so that’s another caveat for this test. My wife and I both drive the car so technically we put 159 miles on the odometer during this first test and used 34 kWh according to the car’s Trip display (for an average of 212 Wh/mi or 4.7 miles per kWh). We also lost at least a few kWh of the battery’s charge to “vampire drain” sitting in the garage and or running the pumps and fans to cool off the battery on hot days after returning from a drive. Doing some simple math if we had used 100% of the battery’s charge getting about 4.7 miles per kWh on average and hadn’t lost any range to sitting in the garage then I calculate we would have gotten at least 283 miles on a full charge (159 miles * 1.666 + about 18 miles from 4 kWh not lost to the vampires). But that’s on the conservative side because that would come out to roughly 60 kWh of usable battery capacity and our Tesla model 3 had an estimated 73.5 kWh of usable capacity when it was new. It certainly doesn’t have that much usable capacity now but I don’t expect it has lost more than 7-8 kWh of capacity so far (or around 10%). Thus I think a realistic worst case estimate of the maximum range we could have gotten driving the way we did for this first test if we had started with a 100% charge and driven to 0% in the span of a day or two would have been about 307 miles.

But wait you say you’re cheating with your fancy math! Well maybe but only a little. The point is naysayers that in this scenario most of the driving we did was at lower speeds. Slightly less than half of it was done on the freeway but even so traffic is so bad around Seattle the average speed of our freeway driving was only about 52 MPH as best I can tell. The rest of our driving was on suburban roads and neighborhood streets and there our average speed was more like 30-35 MPH which means our combined average speed over those 159 miles was likely somewhere around 40-45 MPH. No wonder!

Here’s a few other details that may be of interest or worth further discussion in the comment section: We are still on our original set of factory installed Michelin tires and they are roughly at or just past 50% worn. How the heck did we do that you ask? Easy! First we rotate the tires religiously (like we actually get down on our knees and pray! Ok not really but we do get down on our knees for this). In fact we do this twice per year because we put snow and ice tires on for about 4 months of the year. We use studless Michelin X-Ice tires which I have found to perform very well on frosted icy and or snow compacted roads; they sure are loud though when driving on regular pavement! So yes we’re cheating a little again here but in that time we only put roughly 10000 miles on the snow tires so about 27000 miles are on the factory installed tires and with about 50% life remaining I expect they’ll make it to about 50000 miles before needing to be replaced. I’ll have to write up one of those wildly popular “which tires should I put on my Tesla?” articles a few years from now when I actually need new tires. Except in my piece it won’t be about getting stickier higher performance rubber mounted. If anything it will be about getting better performance on rain slick roads and or decent rolling resistance and or quieter tires. I don’t track my Tesla even though I do enjoy driving it hard sometimes. Oh I also do most of my own maintenance so far (which besides the tires has just been changing the cabin air filter changing the wiper blades and filling the reservoir). I did have to have my glove box fixed when it randomly stopped staying closed and Tesla did that in my driveway while also addressing a squeaky steering column and replacing my charging port flap (which was operating fine). I’m still on my original 12 Volt battery too though thinking I may need to have it replaced sometime in the coming year.

In future tests I’ll see how far I can go at interstate speeds too and we can compare the difference. I’ll also prepare for that test by running my battery down to a single digit percent first then charging it to 100% before I set out on my road trip. Until my next test do you have any questions for this long term Tesla Model 3 owner? Have you had different experiences with yours? Please leave your comments and questions below.

This week Tesla has started to push its FSD Beta 10.69.2 a refined version of its big Full Self-Driving Beta update 10.69 that the automaker feels good enough about to push to all 100000 FSD Beta testers in North America.

FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.

Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. Tesla is basically using its customer fleet to test the capabilities and to gather data moving toward its goal of eventually making the system truly self-driving and taking responsibility for it.

I have FSD Beta on my Model 3 and my last test in August wasn’t super successful so I was looking forward to trying the update when I got in my car earlier this week.

Tesla FSD Beta 10.69.2 is the company’s biggest FSD Beta software update in months and includes significant changes to all the neural nets powering the system. There’s a clear focus on unprotected left turns that seems to be dominating this update.

Yesterday I tested out the update in Shawinigan Quebec and put a quick video together showing my first drive with Tesla FSD Beta 10.69:

As you can see in the video I tested the update on country roads and residential streets. I was going to test it in the city too but unfortunately the test failed before that.

It started out well with a perfect right turn at a stop which can be a bit difficult as you have to creep forward a bit to see if cars are coming from the left.

The second turn was also a right turn but this time at a four-way stop. It was fairly good but the vehicle decided to embark slightly on the bike line as it was doing the turn for some reason.

After that it started to go downhill. To be fair I hit a construction zone and a blocked street but it was fairly simple to navigate and I feel like detecting a blocked street should be a priority.

At first there was a barrier on the other side of the road that extended into our lane and as we approached it it didn’t look like FSD Beta was seeing it. It did ask me to take control when I was less than a second away from it but it actually got around it without disengaging.

Then we had a left turn at a four-way stop where I had to press the accelerator to tell the FSD Beta to go ahead because it wasn’t taking its spot and was waiting for a pickup truck that arrived after us.

That was a first-driver intervention but not a disengagement of the system.

However it didn’t take long for that to happen. We encountered a blocked road a second later and while FSD Beta appeared to detect the barrier it decided to drive around it before I pressed the brakes:

I know some would think that it is an edge case and it shouldn’t be a high priority to navigate that but I think not driving around blocked road signs is quite important.

Considering Tesla FSD Beta uses the navigation system I think it would be fairly easy for it to detect that the road is blocked and to find a detour instead of trying to drive through it.

I am going to do some additional testing this weekend and hopefully I will get a good drive without disengagement but it’s a fail for my first test drive of Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta 10.69.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGJlZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hcnRpY2xlMjY1ODA3MTgxLmh0bWzSATdodHRwczovL2FtcC5tb2RiZWUuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NTgwNzE4MS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How will Tesla use the Modesto Airport to help workers?

Over 40 delegates from 16 countries joined the conference representing workers of semiconductor producers and their supply chain. This was the first meeting of the semiconductors’ network which will also include the earlier created NXP and ST Microelectronics union networks.

Opening the meeting Christine Olivier IndustriALL assistant general secretary welcomed the participants and pledged IndustriALL’s support to building a global union network in this fast-evolving industrial segment of semiconductors.

“We need to pull all our energy together workers semiconductors multinationals and their supply chain should join together in solidarity to implement strategies that will make trade unions powerful.”

Semiconductor-producing companies are not equally distributed in the world. About 75 percent of semiconductor manufacturing facilities are located in China and East Asia. At the same time over 90 percent of the cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing capacities are located in Taiwan and another 8 percent are in South Korea. This setup of the industry was relatively economically profitable for big players and functioned for many years but contained a lot of risks that could disrupt the entire supply chain.



The inevitable disruptions started after the pandemic and the sharply increased demand for home electronics in time of lockdowns and the restart of the automotive industry. The semiconductors producers could not satisfy the sharply increased demand. The geopolitical tensions further pandemic restrictions in China and the economic slowdown in the main consuming countries of EU North America and China resulted in these governments’ decision to prevent themselves from troubles in the future and develop their own production of semiconductors. Governments announced of generous distribution the investment tax credits and money in the semiconductors industry hoping to achieve leading positions and strong dividends in the future. Close to US$1 trillion in investments were announced just in Europe and US combined. Other important investments in the industry were announced by Japan India China South Korea and Taiwan. These investments were topped by the biggest chipmakers such as TSMC Intel Samsung Micron Texas Instruments and others.



Alejandro González a researcher at the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations SOMO spoke of the social and environmental risks in the semiconductors industry using a lot of water resources as well as hazardous chemicals presents health risks for workers handling them.



Jan Brauburger policy adviser at IndustriAll Europe explained the situation in the European chips industry and current challenges and policies.



The participants of the meeting identified numerous problems and challenges faced by semiconductor workers including poor working conditions discrimination of migrant workers violence harassment and discrimination at work lack of respect for freedom of association union busting lack of information on health hazards including metals and their combination as well as some unresolved ergonomic issues and others.

“This meeting was the first step and we see a clear interest from our affiliates. We will build on previous experience from earlier created networkers of NXP and ST Microelectronics and address the identified challenges in the order of priority. By the next meeting we will finalise the collecting of information on the presence of our affiliates in the semiconductor industry and its supply chain. We will work together on further organising efforts in order to build strong trade unions in this strategic segment of the electronics industry”

“Cultivating Community Through Art: Sam Coronado’s Serie Project & Its Continuing Legacy” features prints from the artist-in-residence program Coronado began independently in 1993.

Coronado taught at ACC from 1986 until his death in 2013. Born and raised in the greater Dallas area he began his artistic career as a technical illustrator for Texas Instruments following service in the U.S. Army. He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1975 from the University of Texas.

Like many of his generation activism and creating community were inseparable from Coronado’s artistic practice. While at UT he helped kickstart the Chicano Art Students Association and in 1984 he co-founded Mexic-Arte Museum.

In the early 1990s Coronado visited Self Help Graphics in East Los Angles which had incubated the Chicano art movement in the 1970s. Screen printing proved a natural tool for the movement. Screen prints are cost-effective and fairly quick to produce — a nimble creative response to rapidly unfolding social and political issues. Moreover printmaking linked the Chicano art movement with the importance of the medium in Mexico as a means of communicating social and political causes through art.

Back in Austin in 1993 Coronado opened his printmaking studio in the Montopolis neighborhood an historically Latinx community. Under the auspices of the Serie Project artists were invited to work with a master printer to create an original screen print that was then published in editions of 50 half of which the artist kept. The remaining prints joined Serie’s growing collection some of which were sold to collectors others presented in exhibitions throughout Texas and beyond.

In 2002 the Serie Project became founding members of Consejo Grafico the first nationally recognized consortium of Latino printmakers in the United States.

More than 250 artists — the majority Latinx or artists of color — participated in the Serie Project during its 20-year existence. Some were already established; many were emerging artists and first-time printmakers. The current exhibition includes Serie prints by artists who now have celebrated careers: Cruz Ortiz Deborah Roberts Luis Valderas and Joey Fauerso.

The ACC exhibition highlights Serie Project artist with connections to the school as well as work by Coronado himself. It also includes a selection of work by the three Coronado Studio Master Printers: Pepe Coronado (no relation) Brian Johnson and Jonathan Rebolloso who made a three-part work called “Paletas” when he was an ACC student.

Today Rebolloso and Pepe Coronado carry on the legacy of Sam Coronado. Pepe was one Sam’s first mentees and the first Master Printer of the Serie Project. Rebolloso was a student of Sam’s at ACC.

With the opening of its new 2.2 million-square-foot $400 million expansion the largest distribution center in the state now lies in a city of 8573 residents. The company which already employs 3600 in Thief River Falls plans to add more than 100 employees in each of the next three years.

And while the company's growth has helped the area hold its own as far as population it does not insulate the company or others in northwestern Minnesota itself from the economic issues of today. All over Minnesota and indeed the country communities are dealing with a tight workforce affordable housing issues inflation and supply chain issues.

President Dave Doherty said the company is well ahead of its hiring goals with no immediate plans to stop as the new facility continues to ramp up.

""We're investing more than we originally planned for good reasons"" Doherty said about employment and also how the expansion grew in both scope and from the original price estimate of $250 million. ""We saw some cool things along the way.""

While Textron's Arctic Cat factory sits next to Digi-Key — and Polaris and Marvin have large operations in neighboring Roseau County — the growth of the privately held electronics component distributor is paramount to the health of Thief River Falls and surrounding Pennington County.

Digi-Key’s new warehouse is one of the 10 largest in the country.

The $45 million in local and state tax breaks and incentives were more than worth it for this reason officials said at a ribbon-cutting for the expansion in August.

""If your neighbor doesn't work there don't go too far down the street and you'll find somebody that does work at Digi-Key"" said Brian Holmer mayor of Thief River Falls.

Fast growth means investment across community

In 2016 Digi-Key had annual sales of $1.86 billion and 3200 employees. The company expects for this year's annual revenue to be $5.15 billion with 5081 workers overall and 4133 in the U.S.

The company is a quick-turn distributor of electronics components offering 13.4 million products to more than 857000 customers in 180 countries each year. That means trucks — run by FedEx USPS UPS and others — are constantly leaving with orders. In fact space is dedicated within the expansion for the carriers.

The Thief River Falls airport is the third-busiest cargo airport in Minnesota behind Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Rochester International Airport said Joe Hedrick the airport manager. The facility built a 140000-square-foot concrete cargo ramp this year and next year will complete a 30000-square-foot hangar so larger cargo plans can be loaded and unloaded indoors.

""Without Digi-Key we wouldn't have that outbound cargo"" Headrick said.

Right now officials are completing a master plan for the airport that would include an 800-foot extension to the main runway in the next four to six years to increase cargo capacity even more.

While many rural areas in Minnesota and across the country are losing population with teens and young adults leaving after high school and college because of either a perceived lack of opportunity or a big deficit in job openings.

Thief River Falls gained 2% in population between 2010 and 2020. Pennington County held steady adding 62 people during the decade for a population of 13992.

Without Digi-Key and Textron Thief River Falls would not be able to support a regional medical center Holmer said. There are also opportunities at retail and support businesses.

Yet he admits the tight workforce is causing concern. The unemployment rate in Pennington and Roseau counties was 2.1% in July not much higher than the record 1.8% rate for the state.

Digi-Key relies heavily on northwestern Minnesota for employees with 87% of its workforce living within a 60-mile radius of Thief River Falls.

""This workforce issue is the issue of our moment"" said Steve Grove commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. ""There is no question it's going to be with us for a while. We've got to be doing new things.""

Wages in the distribution center start at $18 to $20 an hour depending on the shift with a $2000 sign-on bonus. Entry-level wages in sales jobs start at $22.70 an hour.

The company also provides a generous health plan that covers 97 cents for every dollar in medical expenses plus other benefits.

More than 17 miles of automated conveyer belts transport products throughout Digi-Key’s new 2.2 million-square-foot warehouse.

""We're actively recruiting people from all walks of life here"" Doherty said.

Shane Zutz now the company's director of human resources spent years as a teacher coach and school administrator in Thief River Falls before Digi-Key recruited him.

The expansion — and the automated systems built into it — will allow others to advance their careers in the company Zutz said. An employee at Digi-Key he stressed can still go from entry-level to leading departments with one creating a human resources program for veterans and another directing a $100 million marketplace.

""We want people to be able to move around and learn our company. And so then when we get it to these places these inflection points we can lean on them to help us through those times to continue to be successful"" Zutz said.

Key to the new expansion is a conveyor system by Austrian-based Knapp. A leader in automated storage picking and shipping systems that provides logistics for large retail and fulfillment operations.

The new systems mean the employees who pick items and pack boxes can work more efficiently the company said. But the move also created different types of specialty jobs that requires recruiting more people to the Thief River Falls area.

Dave Doherty president of Digi-Key says northwest Minnesota has a rare gift for innovation.

Fast growth also poses challenges

Having such a strong regional employment base opens up the problems that the rest of Minnesota including the Twin Cities has right now.

Even parking can be an issue. Because Digi-Key has to draw from a large region to fill new jobs the city of Thief River Falls moved its electrical department to make room for a new employee lot.

The city also expedited the building permit process helped with the infrastructure and utilities needed for the expansion and worked with DEED on a variety of financing options.

""They needed an overall whole package"" Holmer said of the incentives given to Digi-Key.

And the city and county are also working on other issues that come along with growth.

""Housing definitely is an issue for us regionally and is for Marvin and Arctic Cat and others as well."" Zutz said. ""I think a bigger risk for families is day care right at the moment.""

In Thief River Falls 500-plus children need day-care slots but the community is 100 to 150 short. Digi-Key has tried to create more flexibility in schedules to respond to the need and the community is working on long-term issues.

Holmer a four-term mayor running unopposed this fall for re-election growth at Digi-Key and Arctic Cat also provide an unmet housing demand.

""And with that demand goes investors that come into the community"" he said. During the past four years 600 housing units were added including new multi-unit buildings.

""It's just not enough. We're not putting it up enough fast enough"" Holmer said.

Selling northwestern Minnesota

The fact that Digi-Key plus Polaris in Roseau and Marvin in Warroad are homegrown companies make for a solid economic base.

""Its a unique regional economy that I don't think a lot of Minnesotans know "" Grove said. ""They've heard about brands like Arctic Cat or Polaris or Marvin windows but did they know they are all located in the northwest corner of the state?""

The state needs to support workforce promotion so the companies do not need to slow their growth for lack of available workers.

""Some of these regional groups that are pulling together efforts to market and sell themselves are critical"" Grove said.

Digi-Key is on board.

""We want to be a partner in the region; we don't need to own the region. That has not been a goal at Digi-Key. We want Marvin to be thriving Polaris Arctic Cat all those folks. In fact you know we talk to them often"" Zutz said. ""That's kind of the spirit I think of northwest Minnesota.""

The companies all do things a bit differently because of the remoteness of the region that breeds a certain can-do attitude.

""Growing up in Boston if I couldn't find something at the store I would just assume it never existed"" Digi-Key's Doherty said. ""It is incredible that people here don't count on someone else to build something for them; they build it themselves.""

At Digi-Key that culture started with founder Ron Stordahl 79 someone who has always liked to keep a low profile but still comes in daily. While he does not get involved in the day-to-day operations anymore he ""wants to keep a pulse on the vibe"" Doherty said.

Its Next Generation turboprop will address what Embraer believes will be an explosion in regional air travel over the next 20 years with a design that includes aft-mounted engines for a quieter cabin and better fuel efficiency than its competitors.

While initially aimed at the commercial market the Next Generation remains a good example of how the new breed of turboprop is differentiating itself from the stodgy ultrapractical blade-spinners of old. This new guard is quickly becoming known as luxe and tech-savvy aircraft that can fill the roles of small- to mid-sized jets.

“The turboprop story has been a mix of private and business use” says Philippe de Segovia director of TBM promotion at Daher which recently released its TBM 960. “What we see is rising interest from people who are getting caught in airline delays and cancellations or who don’t want to be forced into close quarters with others or who need to reach places fast to make appointments without spending too much money.”

The evolution derives from a generational shift as those under 40 see the market with a greater focus on both convenience and sustainability. “A propeller looks old-fashioned while a jet is cool and more modern” says de Segovia. “But the new generation is less concerned with perception and at end of day go for efficiency.”

At Beechcraft the 90-year-old turboprop manufacturer the movement has led to a reworking of its venerable King Air brand which first took flight in 1964. Christi Tannahill senior vice president of customer experience at Textron Aviation Beechcraft’s parent points out that recent models such as the King Air 360 and 260 are no longer as utilitarian as previous generations. “The fit and finish have dramatically improved” she says noting the upgrades were inspired by luxury SUVs.

That means reshaped cabinetry pull-out worktables USB charging stations and upgraded materials. Details such as illuminated cupholders and pinhole lighting along the sidewalls are the types of touches that wouldn’t have made their way into turboprops of the past. But now luxe is in. “Everything from the seats to the large windows to the accent lighting and resculpted sidewalls has been reworked to create more space overall” Tannahill says.

On the tech side Beechcraft has introduced auto-throttle to the cabin as well as digital pressurization that decreases cabin pressure for a more comfortable flight. The 11-seat King Air 360 cruises at 312 knots with an 1806-nautical-mile range while the nine-seat 260 nearly matches those numbers.

While those aren’t jet speeds de Segovia argues that turboprops have an advantage thanks to less time spent interacting with air traffic control—plus since they are more efficient at medium altitudes they reach their cruising speeds sooner than jets. “Especially in congested airspace there’s often no advantage to flying a jet” he claims.

Daher’s single-prop TBM 960 also runs at more than 300 knots while in the cockpit the integrated flight deck includes everything from an auto-landing system to icing detection and protection. The cabin serves up jet-like features including ambient strip lighting integrated into the header and electronically dimmable windows controlled by a “passenger comfort display.”

And then there are the running costs. De Segovia points to a customer who flies about 500 hours annually: After switching to a turboprop he saved $400000 in operating fees while giving up very little luxury. “There’s no comparison between now and 10 years ago” he says. “Turboprops have amenities for all types of passengers with a lot of ramp appeal.”"

So I can imagine how my mom and dad felt when their places went away for good. Places like EJ Korvette (which everyone just ended up calling Korvettes) and Two Guys. Actually I don’t have to imagine. I now know.

Making business news this week is that the troubled home store Bed Bath & Beyond is laying off 20% of its corporate employees and closing down three of its New Jersey locations.

The one on Route 9 South in Manalapan along with International Drive in Flanders and East Ridgewood Avenue in Paramus are all going to be shuttered. No exact date has been given.

It’s part of a broader plan to ditch 150 Bed Bath & Beyond stores nationwide. This is more than one-fifth of all the U.S. locations. And isn’t this how it always seems to start? The beginning of that long gray march towards the edge of the retail cliff.

There are stores we are so used to seeing in New Jersey it seems hard to imagine them not here. Places like Staples. Home Depot. Walmart. Target. Walgreens. It’s a changing world. And when the world starts changing faster than you do you feel left behind.

When some of these places go the cycle will be complete. We will replace our parents. Our parents who lost Bamberger’s and Woolworth’s S.S. Kresge’s and Woolco and all the others. And we’ll know how they felt.

Old.

Amanda Rena Lott has now been charged as a second suspect in connection to the case on charges of arson and theft.

As previously reported deputies arrived at the location of the burning truck on May 31 and found the truck destroyed by the flames but were able to identify that the truck belonged to Deep South Fuel. Deputies spoke with representatives at Deep South Farm Supply who said they had an employee 30-year-old Joshua Railey who “had been causing problems” that did not show up for work that morning. Deputies also reported that employees of the business reported that Railey often carried a 9mm handgun and lived near the area the burning truck was located. The report states that the company vehicle was a single cab flatbed truck with a trailer that had a large tank that contained diesel exhaust fluid. When the truck was discovered deputies observed two holes in the the tank which led to the DEF leaking. Firefighters at the scene also discovered two 9mm shell casings and one 9mm bullet close to the truck.

A second incident report from the Douglas Police Department showed that the truck had been removed from the inside of a locked fence on the property of Deep South Farm Center in Douglas. According to the report the truck trailer tank and DEF were valued at around $78000.

The investigation yielded evidence that led to the arrest of Railey on charges of arson (2nd degree); criminal damage to property (2nd degree); receipt possession or transfer of a firearm by a felony first offender; and two counts of theft by taking.

As the investigation continued additional information was discovered that led to Lott’s arrest in the case. Lott was booked into the Coffee County Jail on September 13 and has also been charged with arson (2nd degree) two counts of theft by taking and criminal damage to property (2nd degree).

According to a copy of the Coffee County Jail roster on Thursday morning Lott and Railey were both still being held in the Coffee County Jail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXAuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvc3VjY2Vzc2Nvbm5lY3QtMjAyMi10b2dldGhlci1jaGFuZ2Utd29yay1mb3ItZ29vZC_SAVVodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2FwLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3N1Y2Nlc3Njb25uZWN0LTIwMjItdG9nZXRoZXItY2hhbmdlLXdvcmstZm9yLWdvb2QvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SuccessConnect 2022: Together We Can Change Work for Good,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXAuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvc3VjY2Vzc2Nvbm5lY3QtMjAyMi10b2dldGhlci1jaGFuZ2Utd29yay1mb3ItZ29vZC_SAVVodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2FwLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3N1Y2Nlc3Njb25uZWN0LTIwMjItdG9nZXRoZXItY2hhbmdlLXdvcmstZm9yLWdvb2QvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239504E1F90>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

A valuable University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa engineering program provided 15 rising high school seniors from Hawaiʻi and Japan with opportunities to conduct meaningful laboratory research engage in professional development and cultural activities participate in engineering challenges and visit with engineering firms to explore career opportunities in a variety of settings.

The College of Engineering’s signature internship program relaunched this summer after a four-year hiatus and is now known as the Junior Engineers Summer STEM Experience ( JESSE ). To be selected for JESSE  interns underwent a rigorous application process that included submission of transcripts teacher recommendations and essays demonstrating their passion for engineering.

At the start of the program each intern was paired with an engineering lab and mentor—most of whom were graduate students—and given a meaningful research project to complete either individually or in a small group setting. Seven labs participated and spanned different engineering topics from drone technologies to aerospace to water resources and geotechnical testing.

Sprinkled throughout the weeks of lab time were additional educational opportunities such as resume workshops public speaking and presentation training and site visits to various local employers. Participating industry partners included KAI Hawaii Trane Technologies Raytheon Austin Tsutsumi & Associates Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific Booz Allen Hamilton Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation SSFM International and Burns & McDonnell.

Engineering student learns valuable leadership lessons

At the helm of JESSE were the college’s Engineering Student Ambassadors—current students who conduct STEM outreach programs and plan college events throughout the year. JESSE lead and rising mechanical engineering senior Dedrick Sakuma handled the program coordination and logistics and also developed a mentor relationship with many of the interns advising them on academics and college life.

“Working with these rising high school seniors was definitely an unforgettable experience” Sakuma said. “It was a pleasure getting to know them and we hope to see many of them at UH next fall or else back in Hawaiʻi in the future as engineering professionals.”

The internship culminated in a final evening at UH Mānoa in which the interns enjoyed dinner and presented their research findings and program outcomes to an audience of family friends mentors and college faculty. Assistant Dean Song Choi was one of the many attendees who were blown away by the interns’ caliber of work and presentation abilities.

“Having been involved from the beginning of the UH Mānoa College of Engineering summer internship program from 20 years ago the quality of internship projects and the professional presentations were both beyond any caliber displayed in any of the past years” said Choi. “This year’s project groups were exceptionally articulate and detailed in their project scope and results. I truly commend all the effort provided by the organizers and mentors. Fantastic!”

In a post-program survey the interns provided overwhelmingly positive feedback on their experiences with 100% of the group ready to recommend JESSE to others. What did they love? Applied learning industry access and new connections were the biggest highlights.

It was a “great opportunity to meet similarly minded engineering students and get hands-on experience working on engineering projects” said one student. Another liked the program because it “gives you a good glimpse into what engineering looks like professionally and it allows you to network and meet really cool people and mentors.”

For the sustainable travel movement to make any seismic change globally it would be completely counterintuitive to not include Asian travelers in the conversation.

From Seoul to Singapore Asian travelers are not only interested in traveling more consciously but also expecting companies and brands to provide more sustainability-centric options than what is currently available.

According to a recent Expedia Sustainable Travel Study Asian travelers have a higher preference for sustainable travel at 95 percent compared to 74 percent in the Americas and 69 percent in Europe.

Yet most Asian consumers cited top reasons that discourage them from making sustainable choices are non-price related. They are the lack of access low variety and hard-to-verify information and claims.

With a high demand for sustainable travel among Asian travelers the possibilities for destinations hospitality and travel brands to implement innovative initiatives are endless.

1. Asian consumers drive the world’s green growth this decade. They are willing to pay a premium to travel more sustainably

The OECD estimates that by 2030 3.5 billion people in Asia or roughly 40% of the global population will be in the middle-class rank. This means that 90% of the world’s next 1 billion people entering the middle-class rank will be coming from Asia.

A 2022 Bain & Co report ﬁnds that Asian consumers of all age groups – whether 18-34 or above 60 years old and of all income levels express a similar level of consciousness for environmental social and health-related issues.

In the same Expedia study nearly all surveyed Asian consumers said they would be willing to pay more for sustainable travel. In Southeast Asia 51% of the travelers would spend at least half of their monthly salary or more to travel more sustainably.

2. A long stay at an eco-luxury local accommodation is at the top of their wish list.

According to a recent BlackBox survey as many as 9 in 10 Asian travelers said that they would prioritize a holiday centered on eco-consciousness and wellness.

They would choose luxury whenever possible but 8 in 10 prefer small and local businesses over bigger chains and franchises.

A Google Travel & Vertical report indicates a marked increase in searches for vacation rentals in Asia Pacific markets prompting a sign that travelers seek longer trips and exclusive accommodations. This is in line with the global trend of long-term stays that drives Airbnb growth this summer.

In addition to choosing a hotel that aligns with their value many Asian travelers may show heightened interest in conscious travel activities at the destination – whether related to local cuisine culture and community. Brands could introduce a product and outreach strategy that recognizes their target audience’s preferences for local flare and capitalizes on global operational standards.

3. What Asian destinations and travel players are doing to ‘walk the walk”

In a recent interview on The Southeast Asia Travel Show Liz Ortiguera CEO of Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) highlighted the importance of integrating and implementing practical and responsible solutions with destination and hotel partners regionally as evidenced in the organization’s sustainability projects.

On a national level some Asian governments have begun transitioning away from relying on mass tourism as a recovery approach. Indonesia’s tourism ministry has set its eyes on promoting ‘quality tourism’ spotlighting the country’s natural and cultural heritages targeting long-term visitors and empowering local businesses and communities.

Commercial Crime Insurance Overview

Commercial crime insurance is necessary to protect businesses of any size and scope from employee-related and third-party crimes. A crime perpetrated by a trusted employee or outside individual can cause lasting financial physical and emotional loss. To understand the scope of employee crime or occupational fraud risk consider these statistics from a recent Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) report: organizations lose an estimated 5% of revenue to fraud each year with an average loss per fraud case of more than $1.5 million.

Further a study from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University found that a majority of fraud and theft threats against organizations stemmed from officially-employed insiders. While theft or property damage committed by a third-party is always a threat employee-related incidents tend to be more common.

Any instance of employee dishonesty can be devastating but many kinds of crimes can also undermine your business’s reputation forcing operations off track and throwing a wrench into your revenue. Along with other insurance policies for business owners commercial crime insurance is recommended as a basic protection against these types of events.

What Is Commercial Crime Insurance?

Commercial crime insurance protects business owners from financial loss caused by criminal activity. This can include crimes perpetrated by either employees or non-employees and can include crimes such as theft property damage forgery and fraudulent bank transfers among others. Various forms of crime insurance include employee dishonesty insurance third-party crime coverage fidelity bonds business services bonds and ERISA bonds. Because commercial property insurance excludes a wide range of criminal activity commercial crime insurance adds a necessary layer of protection to your business.

When comparing policies most are organized around the type of person committing the crime (an employee or outside party) and who the crime was perpetrated against (the business itself or one of the business’s customers). Depending on your insurance policy it will either include first-party coverage third-party coverage or a combination of both which is the most secure. Costs covered under first-party coverage include claim expenses and direct financial losses sustained by your company including the loss of physical property. Some policies may also cover proof of loss costs or costs incurred as a result of needing to provide evidence of a crime against your business. This entails hiring forensic experts and investigators that can compile a proof of loss portfolio to present along with your claim.

If you’ve heard the phrase “fidelity bond” used interchangeably with “crime insurance” you might be questioning whether there is any difference between the two. Fidelity bonds constitute a specific type of crime insurance that addresses crimes stemming from employee actions. Employee dishonesty bonds business services bonds and ERISA bonds are the three main categories of fidelity bonds and each protects businesses from a specific set of crimes which will be outlined later in this guide. It’s important to note that a business services bond can strengthen your commercial crime insurance by covering the reimbursement of losses sustained by your customers as a result of your employees’ actions.

Individual fidelity bonds are an effective way to shield your business from the effects on employee crime but they don’t provide as much coverage as a broad crime insurance policy. As mentioned before commercial crime policies usually cover not only employee-related crimes but also those crimes carried out by third parties.

How Does Crime Insurance Work?

A crime insurance policy is often added to an existing BOP (business owners policy) or general liability insurance policy. Commercial crime coverage functions like many other common forms of business insurance: in exchange for a monthly or annual premium paid by the policyholder the insurance provider assumes financial risk in the event of a covered claim. Covered claims generally fall under two broad coverage categories. First-party coverage protects your business from direct losses resulting from criminal activity perpetrated against your business usually by an employee. Although this coverage can be extended to cover criminal activity committed by an outside party. Third-party coverage on the other hand protects your business in the event that another entity-such as a client or business-claims your business (or employee of your business) committed a criminal act against them. This type of coverage is common for businesses whose employees work at a client’s property.

Most commercial crime insurance policies operate on a “named perils” basis meaning that in order for a loss to be covered the loss and crime that caused it must be specifically named in the policy. If a loss or crime type is not specifically named in the policy it will not be covered. For example a policy might state that the insurer will compensate the insured for direct losses sustained as a result of impersonation fraud meaning instances of that specific kind of fraud would be covered.

Another type of policy which is far less common in the U.S. is an “all-risks” crime policy. Unlike named perils policies all-risks policies include broad language that cover a wide range of incidents. With all-risks policies all losses and types of crimes are covered as long as they are not specifically excluded from the policy.

In addition to whether the policy is written as a named perils or all-risks policy how coverage is triggered is also an important component to consider. Commercial crime policies make use of either a “loss-discovered” or a “loss-sustained” trigger.

Policies that use a “loss-discovered” trigger will cover any losses incurred by your business that are discovered within the policy period. The loss will be covered even if the actual crime took place weeks months or even years before. This is usually preferred as it gives business owners more time to discover and then claim a loss.

Unlike discovery triggers “loss-sustained” triggers require that the loss is both sustained and discovered during the policy period in order to qualify for coverage. Under these terms losses that go undiscovered for some time may not be covered. Similarly losses that are discovered during the policy period but occurred prior will also not be covered. Because of these limitations this type of trigger is considered less desirable especially if your business is at risk of electronic crime-instances of transferred funds or tampering with a computer system may not be immediately obvious.

Policy rules vary but generally the insuring company must be notified of a discovered loss in writing as soon as possible. Proof of the losses incurred must be provided as well within a few months of the initial discovery. Proof of loss may not be immediately obvious or easy to gather and present so be sure to familiarize yourself with your policy’s terms– some companies may cover the cost of hiring specialists to help you compile the necessary body of evidence.

The last component of commercial crime insurance that must be considered is the policy limit. While some insurance policies have aggregate limits that define the maximum cost your insurer will cover throughout a single policy period commercial crime insurance does not. Instead the limit of a crime policy defines the maximum cost an insurer will cover per occurrence or per claim regardless of how many claims are filed during the policy period.

What Does Crime Insurance Cover?

Crime insurance covers a range of crimes committed against a business both on the part of employees and third parties or outside perpetrators. This includes theft forgery and other acts of fraud as well as computer-based crimes which have been on the rise over the past decade. Direct costs covered include reimbursement of financial and property losses. The following sections provide an overview of the most common types of criminal acts usually covered by crime insurance.

Employee Dishonesty & Theft

Employee dishonesty and theft should be on any business owner’s radar even within a company based on trust and communication. Petty theft shoplifting and property damage perpetrated at your business are among covered circumstances. If off-premises coverage is specified as part of your policy theft committed in transit will also be covered-in a situation where money or property is being physically moved between locations for example.

This also applies to thefts committed by an employee at a work site. Consider the example of a carpentry business owner who receives complaints from a number of clients who notice valuables missing from their homes. They may suspect that an employee who worked in each of the homes may be at fault. If that is found to be true the cost of the clients’ property will be covered by the business owner’s combined first- and third-party commercial crime insurance policy. Policies that specifically target employee-related theft are often referred to as employee dishonesty insurance.

Third-Party Theft

Theft committed by a third outside party not employed by your business is also covered by commercial crime insurance as long as your policy includes both types of coverage. This includes theft of property theft of money and destruction of money or securities.

Computer Fraud

Computer to computer hacking is a kind of computer fraud that is covered under commercial crime insurance. This would enable a hacker to transfer funds and/or information to an outside source causing financial loss. False transfer requests are another form of electronic fraud in which the perpetrator instructs a bank to transfer funds under the insured’s name.

Social Engineering Fraud

Also called impersonation fraud social engineering fraud encompasses a number of manipulative actions a criminal may undertake to convince you or an employee to transfer money. This kind of fraud often includes phone or email contact and requests to wire money or change a vendor’s account details. Perpetrators may target an individual after doing research on the business they work for to make sure the scenario they are proposing seems believable.

Many will operate on a purported basis of trust after learning enough about their target to impersonate a vendor or a party otherwise affiliated with your business. As the consequences of social engineering fraud may not become obvious until it is too late to regain lost revenue this is where a loss-discovered form would prove safer than a loss-sustained form.

Forgery

Forgery can take various forms but fraudulent check signatures are a common instance of employee crime. Crime insurance coverage can protect you from forgery under your name as well as alterations. Alterations include any unauthorized changes to checks or other documents under your name. Forgery alteration and embezzlement are examples of other crimes that are often committed internally and may not be immediately noticeable.

Counterfeit Currency

If your business receives counterfeit currency from a payment transaction your financial losses incurred as a result will also be covered by commercial crime insurance. This also includes instances of counterfeit money orders. Counterfeit payments may not be immediately noticeable and they are often discovered after the transaction has been made.

Crime Insurance Exclusions

While most of the crimes included under a commercial crime insurance policy may seem straightforward it’s important to note some exceptions. Like most insurance policies crime insurance has specific exclusions that you’ll want to keep in mind.

As a reminder most commercial crime policies are written on a named perils basis meaning that only the incidents and types of costs specifically listed on the policy will ultimately qualify for coverage. In general crime policies cover direct losses incurred as a result of criminal activity committed by employees or outside parties. Crimes committed by business owners indirect losses legal fees and losses resulting from non-criminal activity are usually excluded from standard policies. For more details on what’s not covered by crime insurance continue reading below.

Legal Fees

Unlike many other commercial insurance policies commercial crime insurance won’t cover any legal fees incurred by your business. While some insurers may cover the cost of hiring specialists to help you gather proof of loss the cost of hiring a legal defense team will not be covered in most scenarios. When it comes to assistance with gathering proof of loss coverage is not guaranteed and varies from policy to policy.

Employees With Criminal Records

If you as the insured become aware of a crime or crimes committed by a particular employee any further losses caused by that employee will not be covered. The first instance of you becoming aware of crimes perpetrated by that employee triggers the “discovery of loss.” For example if you witness an employee stealing money from the cash register but wait until it happens again to address the crime and open a claim the second instance of theft may not be covered. Also if you as the insured are aware of an employee’s criminal history further crimes committed by that employee may not be covered under a commercial crime policy.

Theft Committed by Owners or Partners

Crimes committed by business owners business shareholders or senior partners will not be covered by commercial crime insurance.

Data Losses

Data losses or breaches include the loss of information such as client lists sensitive customer information business plans and intellectual property. While such incidents usually result in indirect financial losses in the form of third-party lawsuits legal fees restitution and data recovery they don’t cause direct financial losses which is what crime insurance is designed to cover. Because of this the indirect losses caused by cyber attacks and data breaches are not covered by crime insurance and are instead addressed with a cyber liability policy.

Computing & Accounting Mistakes

Computer or accounting mistakes of a non-criminal nature will not be covered under commercial crime insurance either. For example say one of your employees in the accounting department makes a mistake in their work that results in the business having to pay a sizable penalty to the IRS. This would not be covered by crime insurance. Similarly say one of your website developers makes an error that causes your company’s website to go down for hours which results in lost sales and revenue. Again this would not be caused by crime insurance since the nature of the incidents stemmed from mistakes rather than criminal activity.

As a side note in both of the examples above a mistake by an employee resulted in a loss for the business they are employed by. Had their mistakes resulted in a loss for one of your business’s clients a professional liability insurance policy would provide coverage.

Inventory Discrepancies

Since reasons behind inventory discrepancies can vary between criminal and non-criminal intent inventory discrepancies without evidence of theft will not be covered under commercial crime insurance. Some examples of evidence of criminal activity include video tapes witness statements and transaction records that indicate an employee was unlawfully taking and/or selling company products for their own gain.

Indirect Losses

If a criminal act against your business leads to indirect losses like loss of income or interruption of regular business practices those will not be covered under commercial crime insurance. Direct business losses stem from acts like property theft theft of money and securities and unauthorized transfer of funds between accounts. Criminal acts that result in indirect losses for your business can be covered under a business interruption policy.

Who Needs Crime Insurance?

There are a number of telling factors that put certain businesses at higher risk of crime than others. While internal protocols and risk-management solutions can prevent certain risks including crime the following businesses would benefit most from commercial crime protection.

Businesses with a significant part-time workforce will benefit from crime insurance. The more part-time employees there are to keep track of the greater the risk of missing internal employee theft. The same goes for businesses with large product inventories. The more inventory a business has to manage the harder it is to track employee theft or inventory discrepancies.

According to Embroker’s statistics American businesses lose up to $50 billion a year on employee theft. As most businesses rely on cash transactions or digital data-including digital transactions customer financial records and company financial records-they are at risk of both internal and external theft. Any business that deals with direct payments digital information and financial records is susceptible to having sensitive information and funds stolen or transferred without authorization.

Commercial Crime Insurance Requirements

While most commercial crime insurance policies are not mandated by federal law there are certain scenarios in which a crime insurance policy may be a contractual requirement or otherwise required for conducting business with another party.

For example certain clients may require you to secure fidelity bonds before finalizing a contract. Fidelity bonds are sub-categories of commercial crime insurance that address specific circumstances which will be outlined in detail in the next sections. Businesses that provide employee benefit plans are also required to purchase fidelity bonds under the ERISA or Employee Retirement Income Security Act as a way to protect participating employees’ assets.

Rules regarding specific fidelity bonds also vary by state. For example California requires every HOA or homeowner’s association in the state to secure an HOA fidelity bond. The same goes for Florida unless the requirement is unanimously waived.

Small Businesses

While crime insurance is often recommended for businesses with large workforces and inventories small businesses will also benefit from the protections it offers. Small businesses that rely on both card and digital payment transactions will benefit from commercial crime protections especially in instances of an employee mishandling inventory or funds. Though this may surprise you 90% of large theft-related losses are estimated to stem from employee dishonesty. Small businesses that regularly handle product or customer property may be more prone to internal theft as well.

Financial Institutions

Since banks and other financial institutions regularly work with money transfers sensitive customer information and high-value transactions they may be more prone to employee dishonesty forgery and fraud. This makes banks credit unions and brokerage companies prime candidates for comprehensive crime insurance plans. While actual bank robberies are relatively rare employee-related crimes are considered to be one of the largest risks banks and other financial institutions face.

Homeowners Associations (HOAs)

Homeowners associations or HOAs are another type of business that is vulnerable to crimes like embezzlement theft and fraud. HOAs often use multiple accounts to store funds in anticipation of large purchases. The amount of money stored in these accounts has a tendency to grow quickly thanks to regular member payments. Since HOAs are often managed by a small group of employees or supervisors the money in their accounts may not be kept track of regularly. This can make HOA accounts easier to target.

If for example an HOA has set up a long-term account in anticipation of full roof replacement and an internal employee begins siphoning a small amount of money monthly the discrepancy may go unnoticed for a long period of time. This is especially true if the money in the account grows regularly because of monthly payments and there’s not enough officials overseeing the numbers each month. Commercial crime coverage would provide protection in these types of scenarios.

Commercial Crime Coverage Compared to Other Policies

Commercial crime coverage may seem straightforward but it’s actually fairly nuanced and often confused with other policies that address similar incidents. Two such policies are fidelity bonds and cyber insurance which are discussed in more detail below.

Crime Insurance vs. Fidelity Bonds

While fidelity bonds fall under the umbrella of crime insurance the two are not identical. You can think of fidelity bonds as a kind of crime insurance product with a different set of protections than a broader commercial crime insurance policy.

Fidelity bonds usually come in the form of employee dishonesty bonds business services bonds and ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) bonds each of which serve a different purpose.

As their name suggests employee dishonesty bonds will cover securities money and property theft perpetrated against your business by an employee. This coverage is necessary because other standard commercial insurance policies-like commercial property and general liability-won’t cover losses caused by internal employee theft. Examples of employee dishonesty range from physical theft of inventory to embezzlement of funds and the misuse of business or client credit card information.

Business services bonds are a type of fidelity bond that focus on protecting your customers as opposed to you and your business. If one of your employees commits a crime that results in a customer or client’s property or financial loss business services bonds will cover the cost of replacing their loss. Business services bonds are also a reputation booster as they communicate to your clients that their property and financial assets will be secure.

Resulting from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 an ERISA bond is a fidelity bond that a business owner is mandated to take out to cover employee benefit plans including pensions and 401k plans. This kind of bond has to cover at least 10% of the plan’s assets and is meant to protect employees from dishonest activities that may affect their benefit funds. In most cases ERISA requirements state that individuals who manage such benefit plans must secure a bond to cover losses from embezzlement forgery theft or misuse of funds.

Crime Insurance vs. Cyber Insurance

As discussed above commercial crime insurance focuses narrowly on direct tangible monetary or property losses that result from crimes committed against your business (by an employee or third party) as well as crimes committed against your customers by an employee of your business. The types of crimes covered could be perpetrated electronically or involve the physical theft of property. The most important thing to note is that in general for crime insurance to cover an incident money or property must have been stolen.

Cyber insurance also known as cyber liability insurance covers indirect losses that result specifically from some form of electronic crime perpetrated against your business such as a data breach or cyber attack. These indirect losses include those incurred by your business in responding to the incident-for example legal expenses data recovery lost income public relations fines and customer notification. Indirect losses also include those incurred should a third party bring a lawsuit against your business following the incident.

As a business owner it can sometimes be difficult to determine which policy would apply to a given incident. To help consider the following:

If the incident resulted in a tangible loss of money or property crime insurance will usually be the applicable policy

If the incident resulted in an intangible loss-such as the theft of sensitive customer information account numbers etc.-cyber insurance will apply

When it comes to what costs the policies will actually pay for keep in mind:

Crime insurance reimburses for direct losses based on the value of what was actually stolen. Crime policies don’t cover legal fees public relations costs loss of income etc.

Cyber insurance on the other hand reimburses for indirect losses incurred while effectively responding to the incident. This does include legal fees lost income PR etc.

Commercial Crime Insurance Costs & Premiums

As with other forms of commercial insurance premiums for commercial crime coverage vary widely based on a variety of factors. In addition to the premium businesses should also consider the deductible which will impact the total amount paid before any money is actually received from the insurer in the event of a claim. These details are explained in greater depth below.

How Much Does Commercial Crime Insurance Cost?

For most small businesses commercial crime insurance is an affordable policy that is a smart choice to have. Policies for small businesses typically range in price from less than $1000 to a few thousand dollars annually. Another way to think about the cost of crime insurance or fidelity bonds is as a percentage of the total coverage amount. Depending on a variety of factors related to your business and the policy limit business owners can expect to pay between 0.1%–3% for their policies.

Factors That Affect the Price of Crime Insurance

As with any insurance policy there are a number of factors that can affect your final premium.

Coverage limit and deductible: Generally speaking the higher your coverage limit the higher your annual cost will be. According to Insureon a fidelity bond with a coverage limit of $1000000 may total about $100 in annual costs while a policy with a limit of $2 million may amount to about $1750 yearly. Deductibles or the amount that is paid out of pocket before a claim is covered can usually be chosen by the insured. Generally speaking the higher the deductible the lower the premium and vice versa.

Deductibles or the amount that is paid out of pocket before a claim is covered can usually be chosen by the insured. Generally speaking the higher the deductible the lower the premium and vice versa. Industry: Your business’s industry will affect the cost of your commercial crime insurance premium. High-risk industries will incur larger costs than industries deemed low-risk. High-risk industries typically include high-traffic retail tech and financial institutions.

This will result in higher annual premiums. The same goes for property-owning and using expensive property puts your business at higher risk of theft.

Claims history: Your business claims history affects your annual costs as it is a strong indicator of your business’s liability risk. A history of claims waged against your business will likely increase your premiums.

Comparing Commercial Crime Insurance

As with any kind of insurance you’ll want to compare and contrast commercial crime policies to find the best fit for your business. The following factors should all be considered when weighing your options.

Coverage Options & Policy Limits

When considering your coverage options be aware of whether a policy utilizes a “loss-discovered” or “loss-sustained” trigger. Similar to an occurrence-based liability policy a loss-sustained policy will only cover losses that both took place and were discovered while the policy was active. Policies written on a discovery basis on the other hand will automatically cover losses that were discovered within the active policy period no matter when they took place.

You’ll find that most commercial crime insurance policies operate on a “named perils” opposed to an “all-risks” basis meaning that losses claimed must be within the categories outlined in the actual policy. You’ll want to read through your policy carefully to be aware of the specific losses that it names and covers.

Claims expenses are another aspect of your commercial crime insurance policy you’ll want to pay attention to as claim expenses coverage limits may vary. Your claim expenses are separate from the cost of reimbursing stolen goods and assets-claim expenses encompass the costs of the claim itself. When it comes to submitting crime claims the cost may be even higher since forensic experts may be needed to provide evidence along with a team of attorneys. A higher claims expense limit will mean a higher premium but may save you money in the event of an expensive claim you submit on behalf of your business.

Your policy limit is the maximum amount your insurer will pay out for a claim covered by your policy. Most insurers offer a range of limits to choose from and higher limits usually mean higher premiums. Keep in mind that when it comes to commercial crime insurance the limit won’t be aggregated meaning it will apply individually to each loss incurred.

Premiums & Deductibles

As is the case with most insurance policies your premium or annual cost of insurance depends on a number of factors including the size and scope of your business your coverage limit and your claims history. However business owners can look for reduced limits higher deductibles and policies with less flexibility to save money on annual costs.

Financial Strength

Financial strength is an important factor to consider when looking for a commercial crime insurance provider. Financial strength ratings are subject to change so you’ll want to check rating agencies like AM Best Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s for the latest scores. By rating insurance companies on a number of factors including how effective they are in meeting their financial obligations when it comes to claim coverage these agencies can help you choose the most reliable provider.

Company Reputation

Along with financial strength a company’s reputation with its customers is crucial to choosing the right insurer. Sources like the Better Business Bureau and J.D. Power analyze companies’ customer ratings and reputation allowing you to access information that may not be readily available otherwise. Similarly the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also provides comprehensive data on insurance companies incorporating a complaint index that compares performance across insurers. Obtained by dividing the company’s complaints by its share of premiums the index is a reliable indicator of an insurer’s reputation.

The Best Commercial Crime Insurance Companies Overall

Chubb (Best Commercial Crime Insurance Overall)

Chubb Best Crime Insurance Overall

Known as a leading underwriter Chubb is a sound choice for large and mid-sized businesses that need a reliable comprehensive commercial crime insurance policy. The company goes above and beyond in providing detailed information for customers about its crime insurance offerings generally as well as for specific policies.

Pros Offers a loss-discovered policy which is preferable to loss-sustained

Offers an all-risks insuring clause

Covers the costs of customer notification in the event of a data breach Cons Chubb’s policies are usually more expensive than those offered by competitors

Along with providing a transparent guide to all of its commercial crime insurance services on its website Chubb specifies important highlights of its crime policy right away. The company’s commercial crime insurance operates on a loss-discovered basis meaning it covers losses that are discovered within the policy period no matter when the actual crime occurred. This is highly preferable to the alternate loss-sustained policy form which limits coverage to losses that take place during the policy period. Chubb’s loss-discovered policy takes into account crimes that may not be immediately obvious and are only realized after a long period of time.

The company is similarly transparent regarding its all-risks insurance clause. As opposed to a conventional named perils policy an all-risks policy is not limited to only covering the specific risks outlined in the insuring agreement. This results in broader coverage and less risk assumed by the customer.

Another benefit of Chubb’s commercial crime coverage is the company’s commitment to covering costs like customer notification in case of a data breach. Notifying customers when their information has been put at risk can be a highly expensive task and Chubb’s ability to cover these costs can relieve you of an additional financial burden in an already difficult situation. This along with the services listed above ensures your peace of mind in case an electronic or physical crime is committed against your business.

The company’s NAIC complaint index is listed as 0.43 putting it far below the expected market index of 1.00 when it comes to complaints. This is a positive sign as it is indicative of the company’s low frequency of complaints when compared to other insurers.

Chubb’s extensive list of services and policy benefits mean that the company’s insurance packages tend to be more expensive than those of its competitors. This is part of the reason why Chubb’s coverage is often recommended for larger and mid-sized businesses with greater financial resources. However with Chubb you do get what you pay for. And even despite its more expensive policies we still recommend Chubb as offering the Best Commercial Crime Insurance Overall.

The company’s broad definition of what constitutes an “employee” is one of its major pros especially when considering employee dishonesty and theft. Hiscox’s definition of an employee includes temporary and leased employees including former workers in consulting positions. Guest students interns uncompensated officers trustees volunteers and employees on medical leave also fall under its broad policy language. This makes Hiscox’s commercial crime coverage more flexible than that offered by many of its competitors.

While Hiscox is known for its focus on small businesses it may not be the best choice for larger organizations with more complex needs.

That said in 2019 Hiscox had a complaint index that was about 30% below average so we don’t consider this to be much of a concern.

The biggest was junior quarterback Ty Kelley throwing a 23-yard touchdown pass to his younger brother Drew a freshman. It was the brother’s first TD connection at the varsity level.

“It’s kind of cool to see that until you see them fighting on the sidelines like brothers always do” Bourne coach John McIntyre said with a laugh.

Ty Kelley a left-handed QB rolled out to his left and lofted up a pass to open Drew Kelley down the field. Drew Kelley hauled in the pass and walked into the end zone. That cut the deficit to 42-20 with 5:29 left in the third quarter.

That TD pass capped a six-play 63-yard drive. Craig Hill kickstarted the drive with a 24-yard run.

The brothers nearly had a second TD connection on Bourne's next drive but a penalty wiped a 57-yard TD connection off the board.

The Canalmen were shorthanded Thursday night having to throw freshmen like Drew Kelley into the varsity fire.

""Tonight we started six freshmen because we had some sicknesses we had some injuries this week” said McIntyre. “It was a tough week of practice but we battled. I was happy that we were able to put some young kids in the game and still move the football and establish the run game.”

South Shore Tech junior Todd Egan proved to be a tough matchup for Bourne. Egan scored 6 TDs including an 82-yard kick return and tallied 158 yards of offense on 11 touches.

Egan heaped much of the praise for his performance onto his offensive line which included Chris White Owen Lemere Tyler Holmes Finn Hagan Cliff Monroe and Lucas Jones.

“We have the best offensive line in the world” said Egan. “They’re violent they pull our line is great. I love them.”

The Canalmen led once in the game. In the first quarter Hill who ran 15 times for 148 yards broke outside and ran up the sideline for a 65-yard score. Ty Kelley added the extra point to make it 7-6 Bourne but Egan returned the ensuing kick 82 yards for a score and the Vikings never looked back.

In the second half Bourne scored on its first three offensive drives. Bourne senior captain Matt Burr recovered a fumble on the Vikings second play of the second half on a botched snap. Kelley ran for 15 yards on a bootleg on the next play and senior captain Kelly DeSimone capped the quick drive with a 1-yard TD run. That cut the deficit to 36-14.

Bourne’s final scoring drive was a nine-play 60-yard drive. The Canalmen converted a fourth-and-13 to extend the drive when Ty Kelley dropped a pass into Hill’s bucket for a 28-yard gain. Hill made a difficult over-the-shoulder grab near the sideline.

Hill later extended the drive with a 26-yard run on third down. On the next play Ty Kelley scored on a 2-yard run to cut the deficit to 48-27.

Ty Kelley finished 2 of 3 passing for 51 yards with a TD pass. He added 41 yards on six carries.

“They’re good” said McIntyre of his backfield. “Ty Kelley he’s a game changer and he’s good. He’s going to continue to get better and our running backs I thought Craig Hill had a great game. I thought the line blocked very well tonight. We just couldn’t stop them. They’re a senior team and they’re big and strong just a little quicker than we’re used to.”

Bourne which opened the season with a 29-22 win over Upper Cape Tech will try to get back above .500 next week when it heads to Cape Tech on Saturday at 1 p.m.",,,,,,

Tyson Foods is donating 50000 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) to help the Marshall Islands' struggle with the COVID-19 outbreak.

The country’s president recently issued a health disaster proclamation due to the rising number of positive COVID cases.

“I would like to thank Tyson Foods once again for this generous contribution” said Eldon Alik Republic of the Marshall Islands Consul General. “Tyson Foods have always been a great friend and supporter of the Marshallese people not only in Arkansas but also in the islands. As it was during the pandemic in Arkansas Tyson Foods is again stepping up to fill a need. Thank you!”

“We’re proud to support The Marshall Islands and help them stay safe” said Hector Gonzalez Head of Labor and Team Member Relations. “Northwest Arkansas is home to one of the largest Marshallese populations in the continental U.S. and the Marshall Islanders are vital members of the Tyson team and our community.”

Officials say this is just one of the many ways Tyson has supported the Marshallese community.

The company recently awarded the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese (ACOM) a $25000 community grant to fund programming that supports the Marshallese community in Arkansas.

Funding for these programs is part of the Biden administration's Climate Smart Agriculture Initiative designed to support pilot programs that will help farmers transition to sustainable farming practices establish new markets to create and grow revenue sources and to verify and report data that proves to consumers that crops were produced sustainably Vilsack said.

""Farmers ranchers producers ... around this country fully understand and appreciate the challenges of climate change probably better than just about anybody on the planet"" Vilsack said Friday during a visit to Isbell Farms in England.

""They deal with it every single day they deal with it in the form of mega droughts in some parts of our country forest fires in other parts of our country major floods that take place periodically and with greater frequency and intensity ... windstorms hurricanes the whole nine yards.""

""They also know that they have a responsibility which they take very seriously and that responsibility is to be the stewards of our land and water"" Vilsack said.

USA Rice Federation Winrock International and Tyson Foods will take the lead on major contracts worth at least $160 million in total.

Those projects will be geared mostly toward rice production a few other row crops and cattle and poultry.

Vilsack announced earlier this year the USDA had allocated $1 billion to its Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program to be divided into two funding pools but the Biden-Harris administration increased total funding to roughly $3.5 billion because of higher demand from applicants.

The USDA is investing up to $2.8 billion into 70 projects for the first funding pool to support 'climate-smart' projects; 20 of those projects are expected to affect Arkansas.

An estimated 50000 farmers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico will take part in the programs Vilsack said and more than 55 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent will be sequestered over the five-year terms of all 70 projects.

Proposals for the projects include plans to get matching funds up to 50% of federal investments on average from non-federal sources the USDA release stated.

Funding for the program will come in two phases from the USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. Projects chosen for the second funding pool will be announced later this year.

USA Rice Federation will get $80 million for its Rice Stewardship Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities project to help farmers adopt conservation practices that will reduce their water usage when growing rice and also help them try to reduce methane a greenhouse gas emission.

""For this particular project we're looking at 40000 acres impacted 25% that is earmarked specifically for historically underserved producers and what that will do is to enable all of those producers to enable climate-smart practices"" Isbell Farms partner and rice farmer Mark Isbell said.

""We're still going to impact water quality we're still going to impact air quality we're still going to impact soil health but we're also going to diminish greenhouse gases and that is going to have a substantial impact on the climate in the future"" Isbell said.

Isbell Farms produces nearly 3000 acres of rice annually using zero-grade technology to reduce water and land use and increase efficiency.

USA Rice is working with Memphis-based Ducks Unlimited Walmart the National Black Grower's Council Missouri-based Anheuser-Busch Arkansas-based Riceland Foods -- a USA Rice member -- Arva Intelligence the University of Arkansas and others for the project.

""The Rice Federation project was the number one scored project of all of the various grant [proposals] that were submitted"" Vilsack said.

Winrock International is getting $20 million to help farmers -- particularly historically underserved producers -- adopt sustainable farming practices.

Winrock is also working with Riceland Foods and Arva Intelligence as well as the Intertribal Agriculture Council.

Springdale-based Tyson Foods Inc. will get $60 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration in beef production and row crops for livestock feed like corn and to provide technical assistance and incentive payments to small and underserved producers.

Tyson is working with Bayer; McDonald's; Scoular an agriculture supply chain solutions company; Where Food Comes From a third-party food verification company; Iowa Select the eighth-largest pork producer in the United States; certain Native American Tribal communities; and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development of which Tyson is a member.

That's Springdale where Springdale High Springdale Har-Ber and Shiloh Christian have all won state championships in football.

Few know the story of Springdale athletics better than Don Struebing who was an All-American center at Springdale High under legendary coach Jarrell Williams. Struebing coached at Springdale and Springdale Har-Ber and his sons played football at Har-Ber.

""You ask anybody around the state and when you hear the word Springdale you think high school football"" said Struebing who is now in private business. ""After that it's probably chickens.""

Ah yes the chickens. Springdale is home to Tyson Foods a worldwide multibillion dollar Fortune 500 company. Springdale is also noted for the annual Rodeo of the Ozarks which attracts the top cowboys and cowgirls on the professional rodeo circuit each summer. Springdale is host to many and varied restaurants including the popular Neal's Cafe where diners can eat a country-style meal with a trophy buck mounted on the wall just feet above their heads.

Springdale is a working-class town and that is reflected in its football programs started by Williams years ago at Springdale High. For high school football there may not be a more recognizable symbol of excellence in Arkansas than the 'Super S' lettering on the field at Springdale High. It is a tribute to the Bulldogs and Coach Williams the man whose name is on the stadium. Williams coached for 35 years at Springdale where he won 261 games with 15 conference and four state championships in 1968 1969 1982 and 1989.

""Playing for Jarrell it was a life-long dream for me as it was for all my teammates"" said Struebing who also played college football at the University of Arkansas and Central Arkansas. ""It's what you did. It's what the men in this community did for decades. Coach Williams for us he was our Vince Lombardi. He was our 'Bear' Bryant. Looking back he was our community's version of (Gen.) George Patton.""

In addition to Springdale's four state titles Springdale Har-Ber and Shiloh Christian have also stood at War Memorial Stadium holding championship plaques. Har-Ber won a state championship four years after splitting with Springdale High in 2006 and Shiloh Christian added its eighth state title two years ago after starting a football program in 1989.

""When the day is done we all live within the city limits and these are Springdale kids"" said Chris Wood who's coached at all three programs and has led Har-Ber as head coach since 2006. ""Whether you put on Bulldog red or Wildcat blue Shiloh gold you're representing the DNA of aunts uncles grandpas and it's the Jarrell Williams brand that you're putting on the field. It doesn't matter the color of the jersey if you've got Springdale on the front of it it's a special deal and there's a different standard you have.""

Wood and Jeff Conaway at Shiloh Christian have continued the tradition of winning that started with Williams who was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. Springdale High teams under Williams were noted for their physicality and it began during preseason in a drill called the Blood Pit where players went 1-on-1 in tight space between two tackling dummies.

""The program was built on just hard-nosed guys that got after it"" said Chris Smith a fierce tackler who played for Williams at Springdale in the 1980s. ""We always said we may not beat you on the scoreboard but you are dang sure going to know you were in a fight. That was what Coach Williams and all the coaches preached.""

After Williams retired Gus Malzahn brought his ""hurry hurry"" wide-open brand of football from Shiloh Christian and guided the Bulldogs to a 14-0 record in 2005 before joining the college ranks as a coach. Springdale averaged 47.4 points that season when most of its games were essentially over by halftime.

The Bulldogs were such an attraction in 2005 that fans were still piling into War Memorial Stadium in the first half for the state championship game against West Memphis. More than 30000 fans watched as Springdale applied an exclamation point to its undefeated season with a 54-20 victory over West Memphis.

Afterward six Springdale seniors signed Division 1 scholarships including receiver Damian Williams who played at Arkansas and Southern California before landing in the NFL with the Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams. Springdale finished as high as No. 2 in the national rankings for high school football teams.

""This is the best team I've ever played on"" Williams said when the 2005 Bulldogs were honored before a game at Jarrell Williams Stadium in 2015. ""We were a band of brothers. We knew every time we stepped on the field we were fighting for each other.""

If the Springdale team of 2005 is considered ""best ever"" in Arkansas then a Class AA quarterfinal playoffs game between Shiloh Christian and Junction City in 1999 has to be among the ""best ever"" to be played not only in the state but perhaps the country.

Malzahn was the coach when Shiloh Christian rallied from a 51-35 halftime deficit to beat Junction City 70-64 in a game where the teams combined for 1407 yards in total offense. Shiloh Christian quarterback Rhett Lashlee who is currently the head coach at Southern Methodist University completed 36 of 59 passes for 668 yards and 8 touchdowns and 2 rushing touchdowns in the game.

Austin Bivens who spent seven years on the radio as the play-by-play announcer for Shiloh Christian remembers the game as ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Junction City"" after someone parking a car hit an electric pole and knocked the lights out prior to kickoff.

""We sat there 45 minutes to an hour and at one point we thought we were going to have to get hotel rooms and play the game the next day"" Bivens said. ""Marcus Godfrey their great running back literally ran a quarter of a mile 250 yards in the first half. He literally just got tired. The scoreboard wasn't working and Gus used that to his advantage; kept telling the kids we need to score again we need to score again. Eventually they just wore them out.""

Shiloh Christian went on to defeat Harding Academy and Carlisle to claim the Class AA state championship with a second straight 15-0 record.

Springdale High has mostly struggled since its break with Har-Ber. But if there's anyone who knows about the Springdale tradition it's Brett Hobbs an all-state linebacker who is now head coach of the Bulldogs. The process is ongoing for Springdale which is 0-3 to start the season.

Earlier this week executives at the parent company of U.S. Bank said they expect the deal to close later in the second half of this year . When the $8 billion cash-and-stock acquisition was announced last September executives projected a closing around June 2022.

The deal extension comes during a period when large-bank deals are drawing increased scrutiny and vocal pushback.

U.S. Bank said this week that it expects to realize between 40% and 50% of the expense savings from the MUFG Union Bank deal in 2023 down from the 75% it initially anticipated. Bloomberg

Several mergers between large financial institutions have been delayed after President Biden's 2021 executive order directing federal financial regulators to reassess their processes for reviewing proposed mergers . The directive came as part of a broader executive order designed to promote competition in the U.S. economy including in sectors such as technology health care and agriculture.

The Federal Reserve official in charge of bank oversight Michael Barr said earlier this month that he is working with Fed staffers to review current merger-review processes. Bank mergers have the potential to raise prices narrow the range of services offered and reduce the supply of small business and community development loans according to Barr the Fed's vice chair for supervision.

""The advantage that firms seek to gain through mergers must be weighed against the risks that mergers can pose to competition consumers and financial stability"" Barr said.

Some regulators are concerned that deals to create financial institutions with more than $500 billion of assets pose heightened risks to the financial system in the event of failure. Michael Hsu acting Comptroller of the Currency said this year that his agency needs banks to enhance their resolution strategies in order to receive approval.

U.S. Bancorp Chief Financial Officer Terry Dolan said Monday that his company is much less complex than a global systemically important bank. As of June 30 U.S. Bancorp held about $591 billion of assets and MUFG Union had almost $125 billion of assets.

""We have had resolution plans that have stood the test of time for a decade"" Dolan said at an industry conference. ""Union Bank doesn't really complicate that because the structure of Union Bank and what we are buying is very similar to what exists today.""

There have been a number of delays during the merger-approval process in recent years. For several months in 2021 regulators didn't green-light any bank deals.

First Citizens Bancshares and CIT Group extended their merger timeline last year citing prolonged delays in regulatory approval. The $2.2 billion deal closed in January more than 13 months after it was announced.

M&A U.S. Bancorp now expects MUFG Union deal to close later in second half of 2022 The Minneapolis-based buyer had previously said the deal would close earlier in the second half. Some of the financial benefits which had been expected to be realized next year won't come to fruition until 2024 executives said Monday. September 12

Another large deal waiting for regulatory approval is TD Bank's acquisition of Memphis Tennessee-based First Horizon. Progressive groups have asked regulators to refrain from approving the $13.4 billion deal until the banks agree to increase certain community investments.

The extension of U.S. Bank's purchase agreement will lengthen the timeline for achieving about $900 million in expense savings. U.S. Bank expects to realize between 40% and 50% of these savings in 2023 down from the 75% it initially expected Dolan said.

The bank had initially planned to perform its systems conversion over Presidents Day Weekend in 2023. That transition is now scheduled for Memorial Day Weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGF3YXJlcHVibGljLm9yZy9zaG93L3RoZS1ncmVlbi8yMDIyLTA5LTE2L2Vhc3RzaWRlLWNoYXJ0ZXItc2Nob29sLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtMS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbmF0aW9uLWZyb20tYmFyY2xheXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EastSide Charter School celebrates $1 million donation from Barclays,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGF3YXJlcHVibGljLm9yZy9zaG93L3RoZS1ncmVlbi8yMDIyLTA5LTE2L2Vhc3RzaWRlLWNoYXJ0ZXItc2Nob29sLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtMS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbmF0aW9uLWZyb20tYmFyY2xheXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002394FD52FE0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

NFL fans are some of the most dedicated fans known to sports and this has been an asset for teams for generations. Whether it’s the cheerleaders or the tens of thousands of people cheering in the stands football is not football without fans.

With the 2023 season just beginning let’s take a look at which NFL stadiums are the loudest:

Stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Boston sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.

What are the loudest NFL stadiums?

Here are the top 10 loudest NFL stadiums:

10. Gillette Stadium

Located in Foxborough Mass. the home of the New England Patriots makes the top 10 loudest NFL stadiums to date. And it's no surprise considering the Pats have produced and showcased some of the best players in the NFL including the iconic Tom Brady.

Opened in 2002 to replace the original Foxboro Stadium Gillette seats 65 878 fans. The decibel level which is how we measure sound once reached a high of 106.4 in 2011.

9. AT&T Stadium

Formerly known as Cowboys Stadium AT&T Stadium is located in Arlington Texas and is home to the Dallas Cowboys.

The stadium which opened in 2009 seats about 87000. However with its extra standing-room-only area the stadium can actually fit closer to 100000 on a day it’s needed.

The average sound level of the arena is 87 decibels.

8. Acrisure Stadium

Located in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh and home of the Steelers Acrisure Stadium is also one of the rowdiest residences for the National Football League.

The stadium known as Heinz Field until 2022 holds 68400. But even though the stadium capacity is smaller than venues like AT&T Stadium the loudness remains the same. A fan once clocked the sound measurement to be 90 decibels.

7. U.S. Bank Stadium

Home of the Minnesota Vikings U.S. Bank Stadium is located in the heart of downtown Minneapolis. The stadium opened its doors in 2016 and was built in replace the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. And since that expansion the fans got noticeably louder.

Despite having only 66000 seats the stadium holds about 73000 because of its immense outdoor space and clubs.

The peak loudness level was measured at 120.1 decibels and according to Purdue scientists that is similar to the level of noise made by a chainsaw.

6. Lucas Oil Stadium

Opened in 2008 to replace the RCA Dome Lucas Oil Stadium serves as the home to the Indianapolis Colts. It is located in downtown Indianapolis and seats about 70000.

Though the decibel level only reaches about 86 the loudness still tops most stadiums. Clearly Colts fans are some of the most rambunctious.

5. State Farm Stadium

Just west of Phoenix State Farm Stadium is the home of the Arizona Cardinals and the annual Fiesta Bowl. The arena replaced Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe when it opened its doors in 2006. It holds about 63400 rowdy Cardinals fans.

Here the decibel level has hit up to 130 decibels and this is noticeably more than most stadiums of this size.

4. Lambeau Stadium

Home to the Green Bay Packers Lambeau Stadium is located in Green Bay Wisconsin. The stadium has been standing for quite a long time opening in 1957. It replaced the original City Stadium which was located at Green Bay East High School and served as the Packers’ home.

The stadium holds 81441 and though it is one of the oldest NFL stadiums it is also one of the loudest – maxing at about 123 decibels.

3. Caesars Superdome

Also one of the oldest NFL arenas Caesars Superdome opened in 1975. It was formerly known as the Mercedes Benz Superdome.

Located in the heart of the Central Business District in New Orleans the stadium is the home of the New Orleans Saints and seats about 75295.

In 2013 the arena set a Guinness World Record as the loudest stadium when it hit 136.6 decibels during a game against the Niners.

2. Lumen Field

The home of the Seattle Seahawks has seen quite a few names in its day. At first the arena was called Seahawks Stadium when it opened in 2002. In 2011 the arena was renamed CenturyLink and in 2020 the stadium was rebranded as Lumen Field.

The stadium seats about 72000 and has been widely regarded as one of the loudest arenas – it hit 137.6 decibels during a 2013 game.

1. Arrowhead Stadium

Finally the very loudest of all NFL stadiums is the home of the Kansas City Chiefs. Located in Kansas City Missouri Arrowhead holds about 77000 spectators.

The stadium holds the Guinness World Record for loudest open outdoor stadium. It hit 142.2 decibels during a 2014 game when only 76416 fans showed up. This sound was equivalent to a jet engine."

The screenshots shared by the hacker and seen by BleepingComputer show what appears to be full access to many critical Uber IT systems including the company's security software and Windows domain.

Other systems accessed by the hacker include the company's Amazon Web Services console VMware vSphere/ESXi virtual machines and the Google Workspace admin dashboard for managing the Uber email accounts.

The threat actor also breached the Uber Slack server which he used to post messages to employees stating that the company was hacked. However screenshots from Uber's slack indicate that these announcements were first met with memes and jokes as employees had not realized an actual cyberattack was taking place.

Uber has since confirmed the attack tweeting that they are in touch with law enforcement and will post additional information as it becomes available.

""We are currently responding to a cybersecurity incident. We are in touch with law enforcement and will post additional updates here as they become available"" tweeted the Uber Communications account.

The New York Times which first reported on the breach said they spoke to the threat actor who said they breached Uber after performing a social engineering attack on an employee and stealing their password.

The threat actor then gained access to the company's internal systems using the stolen credentials.

On Friday afternoon Uber posted an additional update stating that the investigation is still ongoing but could sharing these additional details:

We have no evidence that the incident involved access to sensitive user data (like trip history).

All of our services including Uber Uber Eats Uber Freight and the Uber Driver app are operational.

As we shared yesterday we have notified law enforcement.

Internal software tools that we took down as a precaution yesterday are coming back online this morning.

More details emerge

After the attacker loudly announced that they breached Uber's systems on the company's Slack server and in comments to submission on the HackerOne bug bounty program security researchers reached out to the threat actor to learn more about the attack.

In a conversation between the threat actor and security researcher Corben Leo the hacker said they were able to gain access to Uber's Intranet after conducting a social engineering attack on an employee.

According to the threat actor they attempted to log in as an Uber employee but did not provide details on how they gained access to the credentials.

As the Uber account was protected with multi-factor authentication the attacker allegedly used an MFA Fatigue attack and pretended to be Uber IT support to convince the employee to accept the MFA request.

Hackers claim to have used an MFA Fatigue attack

Source: Kevin Beaumont

MFA Fatigue attacks are when a threat actor has access to corporate login credentials but is blocked from access to the account by multi-factor authentication. They then issue repeated MFA requests to the target until the victims become tired of seeing them and finally accept the notification.

This social engineering tactic has become very popular in recent attacks against well-known companies including Twitter MailChimp Robinhood and Okta.

After gaining access to the credentials the threat actor told Leo that they logged into the Internal network through the corporate VPN and began scanning the company's Intranet for sensitive information.

As part of these scans the hacker says they found a PowerShell script containing admin credentials for the company's Thycotic privileged access management (PAM) platform which was used to access the login secrets for the company's other internal services.

""ok so basically uber had a network share \\[redacted]pts. the share contained some powershell scripts. one of the powershell scripts contained the username and password for a admin user in Thycotic (PAM) Using this i was able to extract secrets for all services DA DUO Onelogin AWS Gsuite""

The New York Times reports that the attacker claimed to have accessed Uber databases and source code as part of the attack.

To be clear this information is from the threat actors and has not been verified by Uber which has not responded to our requests for more information.

HackerOne vulnerability reports exposed

While it's possible that the threat actor stole data and source code from Uber during this attack they also had access to what could be an even more valuable asset.

According to Yuga Labs security engineer Sam Curry the hacker also had access to the company's HackerOne bug bounty program where they commented on all of the company's bug bounty tickets.

Comment left by the hacker on HackerOne submissions

Source: Curry

Curry told BleepingComputer that he first learned of the breach after the attacker left the above comment on a vulnerability report he submitted to Uber two years ago.

Uber runs a HackerOne bug bounty program that allows security researchers to privately disclose vulnerabilities in their systems and apps in exchange for a monetary bug bounty reward. These vulnerability reports are meant to be kept confidential until a fix can be released to prevent attackers from exploiting them in attacks.

Curry further shared that an Uber employee said the threat actor had access to all of the company's private vulnerability submissions on HackerOne.

BleepingComputer was also told by a source that the attacker downloaded all vulnerability reports before they lost access to Uber's bug bounty program. This likely includes vulnerability reports that have not been fixed presenting a severe security risk to Uber.

HackerOne has since disabled the Uber bug bounty program cutting off access to the disclosed vulnerabilities.

However it would not be surprising if the threat actor had already downloaded the vulnerability reports and would likely sell them to other threat actors to cash out on the attack quickly.

The hacker has apparently been talking to cybersecurity In the hours after the breach was announced more details about it have been revealed on Twitter. The hacker has apparently been talking to several experts  sharing some information on how they broke in.

The hacker said that he first stole the Uber employee's password and then triggered Uber to send several multi-factor push notifications to the employee. These notifications are essentially pop-up windows that appear on an employee’s device prompting them to approve or deny the login attempt.

Another alternative is using an authenticator app that provides unique codes to input as the second factor. These are safer than text messages but hackers can still phish and social engineer targets into giving away the codes.

The brand launches with the U.S.’ largest specialty beauty retailer digitally on Sunday and will go into 715 doors nationally on Oct. 16.

More from WWD

Despite the brand’s age — it only launched earlier this year — it has already hit $9 million in retail sales via its existing partnership with Target and is on track to hit $15 million for its first year there the brand confirmed to WWD.

Byoma is owned by Future Beauty Labs the parent company behind Tan-Luxe Tanologist and Isle of Paradise. The company’s founder and chief executive officer Marc Elrick told WWD it was born out of consumer insights.

“We’re a consumer-led business” he said of the brand’s inception. “During the pandemic we noticed internally and what we saw on social was the consumer over-exfoliating. With the rise of DermTok and a lot of conflicting information out there I felt like the consumer was more informed but maybe more confused.

“When we looked at the data insights as well as our own social media platforms we noticed it was a really big problem” he continued.

Social media’s role in the brand’s creation didn’t end there. The brand which houses its formulas in Gen Z-friendly vibrantly colored packaging has already gained 200000 social media followers. Its Moisturizing Gel Cream is the brand’s top seller given its TikTok virality status with 1.7 million views.

The brand’s offerings include a cleanser three serums the moisturizer and a hydrating trio kit. Each product incorporates a proprietary barrier-health complex with ceramides cholesterol and fatty acids at optimal ratios. Prices range from $12.99 to $24.99 and the full assortment will be available at Ulta.

As reported by WWD Ulta Beauty is winning with the Gen Z consumer. A Piper Sandler survey cited the retailer as the top retailer for the cohort nabbing 48 percent mindshare.

Though the brand plays well with younger consumers Elrick stressed that Byoma’s appeal spans demographics. “Every single person has a skin barrier and every single person can benefit from barrier care whether your barrier is compromised or not” he said. “We’ve noticed from the data we’re starting to get back from our retailers is that it’s appealing to a much broader demographic.” Byoma also over-indexes with Gen X.

“Our vision is to build the next CeraVe” Elrick continued. “With the demand we’ve had from retailers globally and the roadmap that we’ve built we will absolutely get there.”

The brand which recently expanded across European markets anticipates it will exceed between $300 million and $500 million in retail sales in the next three years.

United Airlines considers government air traffic controller staffing shortages its top concern and says there is still time to minimize the impact on holiday travel this winter.

“When you have air traffic control close a center down or close a region of the country it leads to hundreds of delays and cancellations and there’s just nothing else – there’s no other rocks that are anywhere close to the size of that” CEO Scott Kirby told CNN’s Pete Muntean at the Global Aerospace Summit organized by the US Chamber of Commerce.

The Federal Aviation Administration which runs air traffic control and airlines like United spent the summer at loggerheads over who was to blame for major travel disruptions. More than 57000 flights have been canceled and 638000 delayed since the start of the Memorial Day weekend according to FlightAware data.

Now Kirby says he is speaking “diplomatically” and attempting to rally the aviation industry and ultimately lawmakers to fund more controllers and better technology for the FAA.

“It was tight before the pandemic and they don’t have enough people today and they need more” Kirby said. “And we in aviation have to commit to helping them get that.”

The FAA said in response to Kirby’s comments that its focus “is keeping airline passengers safe.”

“Airlines should focus on restoring customers’ faith by being transparent about the cause of interruptions and by delivering what they promise” spokesman Matt Lehner said in a statement.

The FAA pointed to data from its tracking systems showing delays attributed to airline issues increased in recent years while those attributed to FAA issues are down. Weather-driven disruptions are a separate category.

Kirby said several airlines including his have pulled off multiple days in recent weeks without any cancellations.

The FAA is currently led by an interim chief while the Biden administration’s pick to lead the agency is under review and scrutiny.

Kirby has another gripe with the FAA – how it manages heavy interest in flying in and around Newark – but said Thursday the agency on the whole “does a heroic effort” managing air traffic.

“Air traffic control is set up in a way that they’re staffed on average well throughout the year” he said. “So in September when demand is lower things go great because you don’t have staffing shortages.”

But volume at peak periods plus weather can cause disruptions to “quickly spiral out in an exponential way.”

“I think if we work together on this we can certainly make the holidays better” Kirby said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new UPS Tariff/Terms and Conditions of Service indicates that only licensed dealers importers manufacturers and collectors will be able to ship firearms products or parts via UPS.

“Packages containing firearms (as defined by Title 18 Chapter 44 and Title 26 Chapter 53 of the United States Code) and firearms parts that do not constitute firearms as defined by federal law (together “Firearms Products”) are accepted for transportation only as a contractual service and only from Shippers who are licensed importers licensed manufacturers licensed dealers or licensed collectors (as defined in Title 18 Chapter 44 of the United States Code)” the terms read.

According to letters sent to some manufacturers by UPS one requirement for shipping with UPS is that gunmakers sign a written UPS Firearms Agreement for shipping firearms and firearm parts. The UPS Handguns Exception Agreement which is required for shipping handguns and is only good for one year spells out some strict requirements that if not met could end in quick termination by UPS.

One stipulation of the handgun agreement which was shared with us by a manufacturer who wished to remain anonymous stated: “Customer agrees to ship an average of fifty (50) or more handguns shipments per day via UPS. In the event this volume commitment is not maintained during the Term of this Agreement UPS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on ten (10) days’ notice.”

Of course this could have a negative impact on small manufacturers who typically don’t ship that many guns. Also high-end custom gunmakers who also deal in much smaller numbers could be negatively impacted by it.

Per UPS’s new Agreement For Transporting Firearms Or Firearms Parts the company can unilaterally decide if they don’t want to continue in a contract with a manufacturer whether or not the manufacturer has done anything wrong or agrees with that decision.

“UPS may suspend or terminate delivery services for Shipper or terminate this Agreement immediately and cease providing service if UPS determines in its sole and unlimited discretion that such action is prudent or necessary” the agreement reads.

Despite the fact that all requirements are spelled out in the agreement the company also reserves the right to change the rules of the game at any time without input from manufacturers.

“UPS may modify or amend any requirements for Firearm Products Shipments at any time” the agreement states. “By tendering Firearm Products Shipments to UPS for shipment Shipper agrees to be bound by UPS’s requirements in effect at the time of shipping.”

The latest changes along with the earlier decision on shipping gun parts are likely a result of a strongly worded letter sent on May 19 to UPS Federal Express the U.S. Postal Service and trucking and rail carriers by five anti-gun U.S. senators blaming shipping companies for playing a part in the country’s criminal violence problem. The letter signed by Democrat Sens. Edward Markey (Mass.) Corey Booker (N.J.) Chris Murphy (Conn.) Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) stated “We are concerned that lax shipping security measures are contributing to the epidemic of gun violence in this country by allowing criminals to use stolen firearms to commit crimes.”

TikToker Mykol Gummings (@mykol_gummings) shared a secondary video to let his viewers know that the CEO of United Parcel Service sent him a challenge coin for his promotion of the company’s high rate of worker compensation.

“This is too dope” he says in the video. “The UPS CEO just sent me a letter. It reads ‘Dear Mykol I watched the awesome TikTok video of you sharing how well UPS drivers are compensated. Please let me know that video made my day. I want to personally express my gratitude to you for being a terrific brand ambassador. Thank you for helping spread the word about how UPS is a great place to work. As a small token of appreciation please accept this UPS challenge coin reserved for UPSers who go above and beyond.””

While he appreciated the challenge coin he shared that he still expected additional compensation for the video tagging UPS in the caption.

“Shout out to UPS” he says. “I still want my check though.”

Some viewers thought Gummings should have received additional compensation for advertising the company.

“They gave you a coin bruh?” one commenter wrote. “If they don’t give you a raise.”

“Damn if it were my company and I were that grateful I’d send him a bonus not a friggin coin” another said. “But awesome they showed appreciation to you.”

“My man giving them free marketing and they compensate him with a medal?” a third viewer added. “You deserve a raise.”

The Daily Dot has reached out to Gummings via Instagram direct message as well as to UPS directly via email but did not receive responses as of publication time."

I returned home with seven pieces of bread when this amount used to be enough for 14.”

In the district of Pichacani in Peru’s southern province of Puno many are struggling with rising costs of living. Located at 3900 meters above sea level the climate in Pichacani is characterized by low temperatures strong winds and intense precipitation. These conditions pose a challenge for small-scale agriculture which along with animal herding contributes to people’s livelihoods. Recent price increases in food and fuel represent an additional stress for families just emerging from the hardships of the pandemic making it necessary to adopt strategies to mitigate hunger in the midst of an economic and political crisis in the country.

Efforts to address high rates of childhood anemia and malnutrition in the province of Puno have stalled due to the pandemic and could be made more difficult with the elevated cost of food. Faced with economic uncertainty the news of the arrival of monkeypox and the fourth wave of Covid-19 was no longer cause for surprise or concern because the main worry on people’s minds was the provision of the family food basket and meeting basic needs.

We spoke with small scale farmers in Puno earlier this year about how they are coping with the increased cost of living and food insecurity in the region. At the end of the May harvest peasant producers had to spend more for foods that they were used to sharing at the family table. The high cost of agricultural products affected the family economy while spikes in the cost of fuel brought with it an increase in bus fares freight for the transport of goods tractor rentals and equipment used in agricultural activity. These costs doubled and rural families had to absorb production expenses that were not foreseen in the previous agricultural season.

Challenges to Traditional Food Systems

The food crisis in the first quarter of 2022 disrupted already vulnerable food systems in the highlands making more evident the lack of machinery and equipment for the transformation of agricultural products the effects of climate change and the government’s inadequate management of resources in the agricultural and livestock sector. With the increase in food costs the day's wages were only enough to buy a few products and families worried about the threat of famine and other economic difficulties. In the local primary school when teachers asked students to bring fruit for snack time not everyone had the means to bring something to eat. In their homes there were days when the foods that are essential for children’s development and nutrition were out of reach for many families. Many families were forced to seek additional income to cover the rising expenses of the family food basket.

Adding to the setbacks of the 2022 agricultural season inclement weather such as frost and hailstorms affected the potato oca (a variety of Andean tuber) and quinoa crops. In previous years the oca harvest was good and there were large potatoes for consumption but this year most farmers harvested only medium and small potatoes. In addition to providing sustenance large potatoes can be used to barter for meat alpaca fiber or dairy products. But with smaller potatoes the only alternative was to make chuño a process that consists of dehydrating potatoes to preserve them. This ancient food is still consumed in the Andes and helps families mitigate the impact of food insecurity. Both chuño and potatoes are present in soups (chairo) stews and many other typical dishes. The highland’s low overnight temperatures and intense sunlight during the day allow the elaboration of this product in its various presentations such as tunta or moraya—white chuño or black chuño. By making chuño a portion of the harvest can be preserved for future consumption.

Many of the locally produced foods such as quinoa cañihua (an Andean grain) wheat potatoes and oca consumed by rural communities are rich in nutrients. Farmers complement these traditional agricultural products with dairy and vegetables usually purchased in local markets. With support from FONCODES (Fondo de Cooperación para el Desarrollo Social) vegetable gardens or biohuertos provide an alternative for families to grow their own foods. Although this project was put on hold due to problems with project management some families continue to maintain biohuertos on their own.

Many small farmers and agronomists that we spoke to attributed the problems with agricultural production to a lack of government investment at the central regional and local levels. Inadequate government support was especially disillusioning to those who voted for Pedro Castillo in the last presidential election. A former schoolteacher and union leader with a rural background Castillo promised a “second agrarian reform” that would benefit small producers.

According to one community member “for agriculture it has only been false promises. Everything has gone up there is no support for Puno which supported [Castillo]. He should support the countryside with projects.” Since the start of his presidency in July 2021 constant changes in his cabinet—including five agriculture ministers in 10 months—as well as corruption allegations and the opposition’s continued efforts to oust him have created social and political instability at a time when rural communities most need assistance.

One of the few sources of government support during the pandemic were “bonos” (cash transfers of between s./350 and s./700 or $90 to $180) given to low-income families. Some of these payments continued into 2022 and the government started distributing food vouchers of s./270 ($70) to offset high food prices in August. According to our interviewees the pandemic vouchers helped cover some basic expenses like payments for phones electricity water and school fees but they were not enough to make up for the higher cost of food.

Another challenge for rural families in post-pandemic times has been the increased cost of gas with the price of a gas cylinder increasing from s./30 to around s./60 ($15.50). As a result families in rural areas returned to cooking with cow manure (bosta) and firewood. Even in cities smoke coming from houses could be glimpsed in the distance a sign that they were preparing food. This was not a common sight before— most families only used gas rather than collecting manure and cooking with a traditional clay stove. But now in cities like Puno and Juliaca dung has been commercialized again and people use wood stoves on terraces in the street or on patios to prepare their food.

Between Rural and Urban Life

For many people striving to feed their families the only option has been to reduce their food rations. At the beginning of the pandemic some returned to rural areas. At first living in the countryside was a survival strategy. However this turned out to be complicated for those people who made their lives in big cities where they had access to basic services. Children who were in school required internet electricity media and telephone services. These communication gaps and barriers made it difficult to stay in rural areas.

For grandparents the return of their family members to the countryside was a dream come true. But it created additional challenges for unemployed heads of households who were forced to return to the city in search of new work opportunities. Yet the elderly also do their part working the land to produce food and safeguarding seeds and knowledge. Seed saving contributes to food sovereignty and the use of manual tools and traditional agricultural methods reduce production costs without relying on costly fertilizers or farm equipment rentals which have also gone up in price.

For the families of the altiplano agriculture is fundamental. In the Aymara tradition farmers make ritual offerings to the Pachamama as thanks for protecting them from hunger and providing nutritious food. Given the circumstances that the world is going through—from climate change to the war in Ukraine—family farming the raising of sheep and alpacas the sale of cow's milk and the making of handicrafts represent important ways of securing basic necessities in rural areas.

Traditional agriculture including the locally produced foods that make up the Andean diet can contribute to household food security in times of economic uncertainty and disruptions to the global food system. However the neglect of the agricultural sector by the government and low agricultural yields continue to pose significant challenges for small farmers. The rising costs of production and appealing employment opportunities in the city also disrupt the viability of small-scale agriculture. Still in spite of these challenges rural families persevere sustaining their traditional ways of life in the countryside.

The American Hospital Association released a report Thursday outlining the grim financial outlook for hospitals for the rest of the year. Kaufman Hall the healthcare consulting firm prepared the report.

Many hospitals have already been operating in the red through 2022. The report indicated a turnaround this year isn’t likely.

More than half of U.S. hospitals (53%) are projected to have negative margins for the rest of the year according to the report. Under more pessimistic scenarios more than two-thirds of hospitals (68%) could have negative margins this year the report stated.

“Hospitals stand to lose billions of dollars in 2022” said Lisa Goldstein senior vice president of Kaufman Hall.

Margins will remain depressed for the remainder of the year and hospitals are looking at their worst financial year since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic Golstein said. Health systems are wrestling with staff shortages higher labor and supply costs and shaky supply chains.

Rick Pollack president of the AHA said in a media call that hospitals can’t keep enduring such losses indefinitely. Congress and President Biden’s administration must offer more support to hospitals he said.

“This deserves the immediate attention of policy makers at every level of government” Pollack said adding “America can’t be strong without hospitals being strong.”

Pollack and other hospital leaders on the call emphasized they are treating plenty of COVID-19 patients even if hospitalizations are well below the peak of last winter. More than 32000 COVID-19 patients are being treated in hospitals according to The Washington Post. Hospitals are also seeing more patients who delayed treatment for other health problems during the pandemic.

“We’re seeing people that are much sicker than in the past and that means they’re more expensive to treat” Pollack said.

John J. Lynch III president and CEO of Main Line Health in the Philadelphia area said his system has lost $102 million in 2022 even after factoring in federal CARES aid. “These losses are unsustainable” he said during the media call.

Hospitals are being squeezed Pollack said. In the beginning of the year he said the top three concerns of hospital officials were “workforce workforce and workforce.”

Now Pollack said the top three worries are “financial stability financial stability and financial stability.”

“We are now dealing with the aftershocks and the aftermath of the most significant public health crisis in a century” Pollack said. “America’s hospitals are under severe financial pressure.”

‘The crisis is real’

Hospitals have been confronting much higher expenses this year. Hospitals’ expenses are projected to rise $135 billion in 2022 compared to the previous year according to the report. Labor accounts for the bulk of the increase a projected $86 billion with non-labor expenses rising $49 billion.

Much of the higher labor costs are driven by their employees: a projected $57 billion increase in 2022. But contract staff including travel nurse agencies are taking a toll too with a projected $29 billion increase. The AHA and other groups have previously asked lawmakers to investigate nurse staffing agencies to see if they’re engaging in price gouging.

Hospital leaders who participated in the media call all said they are struggling to find talent.

Mike Slubowski president and CEO of Trinity Health the nonprofit system based in Michigan said his organization is struggling to fill openings in the 25 states it serves.

“The crisis is real” Slubowski said. “The shortage of healthcare workers is nothing like we’ve seen before.”

At Main Line Health in the Philadelphia region Lynch said “We are experiencing one of the greatest workforce challenges we have ever seen.”

Peggy Abbott CEO of Ouachita County Medical Center said the labor crisis is particularly difficult for her rural health organization in Arkansas.

“There is absolutely a shortage of staff availability” Abbott said. The shortage includes nurses respiratory therapists and radiologists she said.

“The small independent hospitals are challenged as never before” she said.

The labor shortages are forcing hospitals to close beds and scale back some services hospital leaders said. Hospitals are seeing longer waits in emergency departments and surgeries and other procedures are being delayed.

Ultimately patients are paying the price hospital leaders said.

While hospital executives cite labor challenges as a pressing concern they are facing higher costs for supplies largely driven by inflation the report stated.

The report cited optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for operating margins but even the better forecast isn’t exactly cheery.

Under more optimistic scenarios hospital margins in 2022 will be 37% lower than before the pandemic. The more dire forecast which would include new surges of COVID-19 patients and higher expenses would see margins fall 133% below pre-pandemic levels this year.

Seeking help from Washington

Lawmakers and the White House need to step up and offer more aid to hospitals Pollack said.

While he acknowledged federal CARES aid was “a lifeline” to hospitals Pollack said the administration and Congress needs to offer more help.

Citing a recurring complaint Pollack said the government hasn’t provided any money - “not a dime” - to help hospitals deal with the surges of the Delta and Omicron variants. And those surges accounted for half of Americans hospitalized due to COVID he said.

In the near term the AHA and other healthcare groups are pressing Congress to preserve two Medicare funding programs for rural hospitals that are set to expire this month. Those programs offer $600 million annually to rural hospitals. Lawmakers have moved bills to extend the program.

Rural hospitals are on “life support” and more could close unless policymakers act the AHA said in a report released last week.

Congress also can help hospitals by approving extensions of telehealth waivers Pollack said. Lawmakers have pushed a bill that would extend telehealth waivers for two years though some advocates would like to see permanent extensions for virtual care.

Pollack and healthcare groups are urging Washington to restore planned cuts for Medicare. The cuts are expected under a federal spending law that imposes spending reductions when Congress can’t agree on budgets.

Hospitals are also hoping the Senate will pass a bill to reform prior authorization in Medicare Advantage plans. The measure which passed the House Wednesday would streamline the authorization process which hospitals and doctors said delays patient care and adds to staff burnout.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmliai5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdGVuc2lvbnMtYm9pbC1iZXR3ZWVuLWVyLWRvY3MtaW5zdXJlcnMtYXMtbm8tc3VycHJpc2VzLWxhdy1yb2xscy1vdXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tensions boil between ER docs insurers as no-surprises law rolls out – Indianapolis Business Journal,"Surprises might be fine at birthday parties fun houses and romantic getaways—but rarely in medical care especially when it comes to the bill.

That premise is now law of the land since the federal No Surprises Act took effect Jan. 1. It protects patients from receiving surprise medical bills resulting from unexpected out-of-network coverage for emergency services anesthesiology radiology and other medical care.

The landmark consumer law is already creating huge waves. In recent weeks emergency physicians in Indiana and elsewhere have sounded the alarm that since the measure went into effect large insurers—including Cigna and UnitedHealthcare—have threatened to terminate emergency service contracts if ER doctors don’t agree to pay cuts of up to 50% of the current in-network rates.

The doctors say the threatened rate cuts could compromise the quality of emergency rooms and could lead to long waits to see a doctor.

Emergency physicians who are notoriously independent are increasingly turning up the heat over insurance reimbursements. They say insurers have refused for years to reimburse them at rates they consider fair resulting in many ER groups remaining out of network.

“We’ve struggled over the years” said Dr. John McGoff a retired emergency physician at Community Health Network and past president of the Indiana State Medical Association. “We set a price [for various medical procedures] and if the insurers didn’t agree we would walk away. … Sometimes it was a bit of a cat-and-mouse game.”

As a result a growing number of Americans treated at hospitals that are part of their insurance networks were getting billed for out-of-network care for at least part of the bill. The proportion of emergency room visits to in-network hospitals that result in out-of-network bills surged from 32% to 42% from 2010 to 2016 according to a 2019 report in JAMA Internal Medicine.

“At some point emergency physician groups will not be able to adequately staff emergency departments” said the Emergency Department Practice Management Association a trade group based in McLean Virginia in an Aug. 1 statement. “This will lead to holes in the health care safety net which could lead to longer waits for emergency care or the inability to staff emergency departments.”

Out of network

A health insurance network is a group of doctors and medical care providers who have a contract to provide services to members of a health insurance plan usually at rates that are lower than the sticker prices for patients without insurance.

For years emergency physicians and insurers would often come to loggerheads over rates resulting in many doctors remaining out of insurance networks.

With the ER doctors out of so many networks patients who visited an emergency room at a hospital that was in their health network could get a huge unpleasant surprise in the form of a large bill often thousands of dollars from the doctor.

Since the doctor was out of network the insurer would pay only a small amount and the doctor would charge the balance to the patient.

But since the No Surprises Act went into effect out-of-network physician groups can no longer bill in-network patients for the balance of the bill that insurers refused to pay a practice known as “balanced billing.”

Instead they must work out the difference with insurers through a negotiation process—or if that fails through an independent dispute-resolution process set up by the federal government. Either way the patient is taken out of the equation and no longer receives a surprise bill.

Some experts in health care law say the No Surprises Act is providing much-needed protection for American consumers.

“I think this is a great thing for patients in general” said Matthew Reed an attorney with Hall Render Killian Heath & Lyman in Indianapolis. “… If you’re going to an emergency room in an in-network facility you shouldn’t be scared that you’re all of a sudden going to receive a crazy bill.”

Consumer protection

The federal law builds on laws enacted in 33 states including Indiana that extended a certain level of protections to consumers against surprise out-of-network bills.

Many hospitals and even emergency doctors say they supported the No Surprises Act chiefly for the protection it gives patients although they say it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.

“Taking patients out of the middle in these situations was imperative” said Brian Tabor president of the Indiana Hospital Association. “Patients would understandably be frustrated with the hospital even though the disputes were between independent physicians and insurers. But given the extremely low rates that Hoosier physicians are reimbursed by commercial insurers the solution has to be a balanced one that doesn’t further disadvantage providers.”

Some emergency physician groups seeking more leverage have joined forces with larger companies. In April St. Vincent Emergency Physicians Inc. was acquired by Vituity a physician-owned company based in Chicago.

The acquisition means doctors in Ascension St. Vincent emergency rooms at 21 hospitals across Indiana now work for Vituity a national group with more than 5000 physicians.

“We needed to partner with a larger national group that had a bigger scale and better leverage to negotiate with insurers” said Dr. Bart Brown an emergency physician at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital on West 86th Street and a board member of the Indiana chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians.

He added that the situation between small independent groups of emergency physicians and the huge national insurers such as Minneapolis-based UnitedHealthcare and Indianapolis-based Elevance Health Inc. (formerly Anthem Inc.) has been “pretty toxic.”

The small medical groups “don’t have the negotiating power or the time to dispute every bill” he said.

Insurers for their part say they support the No Surprises Act because it provides important consumer protection for patients. They point fingers at medical providers for the high out-of-network bills that used to get sent to patients.

The nation’s largest health insurance trade group AHIP (formerly known as America’s Health Insurance Plans) released a survey in May that found that in the first two months of 2022 the law prevented more than 2 million potential surprise medical bills across all commercially insured patients.

“No American should ever face a surprise medical bill that can lead to financial ruin” the Washington D.C.-based group said in a statement.

Indianapolis-based Elevance Health did not respond to emails from IBJ seeking comment on the No Surprises Act or the company’s relationship with out-of-network physicians.

Negotiating tool

But some insurers are using the federal ban on surprise out-of-network bills as a negotiating tactic with in-network providers according to Modern Healthcare an industry newspaper.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield North Carolina referred to the No Surprises Act in letters sent to providers in March and November 2021 writing that it would end contracts with anesthesiologists radiologists emergency physicians and others unless they agreed to payment reductions of up to 30% the report said.

UnitedHealthcare requested a 40% decrease in payments according to a letter the American College of Emergency Physicians sent to the North Carolina congressional delegation in March the paper said.

In response UnitedHealthcare said some out-of-network doctors were billing at more than 1000% of Medicare rates. “The No Surprises Act is bringing greater price transparency to the healthcare system and finally putting an end to the financially crippling surprise bills that consumers have struggled with for years” the insurer told Modern Healthcare.

The issue is even playing out in court to an extent. In July a startup that specializes in buying written-off medical accounts sued UnitedHealthcare for $15.1 million claiming it failed to fully pay St. Vincent Emergency Physicians for services it provided to its members.

Ecure Corp. said the cases in dispute involved medical visits where UnitedHealthcare did not have contracts with St. Vincent Emergency Physicians and thus were considered out of network. Ecure whose principal office is in suburban San Diego said the insurer usually paid part of each claim but typically less than the full amount.

Eliot Listman CEO of Ecure’s operating group Allia Group said the potential amount of underpaid claims to emergency physicians across the United States could run as high as $43 billion. “These emergency physicians of all sorts are victimized” he said.

His group has partnered with several medical coding and billing companies including Indianapolis-based Ciproms Inc. to analyze claims and go after insurers he said have underpaid emergency physicians.

“They give us access to both data and these provider groups and our interests are very much aligned” Listman said.

Ciproms for its part said unpaid and underpaid claim reimbursements from big insurers is a “perpetual problem.”

“I think it is important to note that generally emergency physicians do not want to be out-of-network” Andrea Halpern Bryan Ciproms’ president and CEO wrote in an email to the IBJ. “Emergency physicians were in support of the No Surprises Act and were active in advocating for a law that protected their patients.”

In another spat UnitedHealthcare and Nashville-based Envision Healthcare this month each filed a lawsuit against the other in a Tennessee federal court over a disagreement about payments for emergency care.

The two organizations have been out of network with each other since Dec. 31 2020 after the two parties were unable to reach an agreement over reimbursement rates according to Becker’s Hospital Review.

Envision Healthcare a physician services company sued UnitedHealthcare Sept. 8 for allegedly engaging in an unlawful scheme after the split to “enrich its overflowing coffers” by denying emergency room claims for its highest-acuity patients. UnitedHealthcare for its part sued Envision Sept. 9 claiming the company “deliberately upcoded thousands of claims” and deceived the payer into overpaying by millions of dollars for emergency care starting Jan. 1 2021.

At the root

Part of the problem is that the law did not address the underlying issues in how people get emergency care some observers say. In emergencies patients often have no idea in advance whether the ER doctors are in network. Nor can they choose a certain hospital when they are having a medical emergency.

“The root market failure that created the surprise billing problem is that patients lack meaningful choice of provider for certain services” according to a white paper published last year by the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy “In emergencies patients can unavoidably end up at an out of network facility or being treated by out-of-network physicians.”•

Description

This session investigated the potential role opportunities and challenges of implementing tax on unhealthy products including tobacco alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages as an option to improve population health outcomes and simultaneously expand governments’ fiscal space. Expanding fiscal space includes increasing tax revenues and reducing expenditures related to tobacco alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages use (e.g. healthcare public safety etc.). Earmarking of revenues for health may be viable in some jurisdictions and may also be important to increase political viability and public acceptability.

Session 10: Health Financing for Service Delivery Redesign

Description

This session summarized key findings from the Lancet Commission on High Quality Health Systems – especially the recommendation for service delivery redesign i.e. the intentional reorganization of a health system. The purpose is to improve quality and outcomes – rather than focusing on geographic access alone – when discussing how health financing levers could be better leveraged for facilitating service delivery redesign. It also discussed SDR in the context of maternal and newborn health using the case of India where health financing levers could be better leveraged to incentivize all women to seek quality antenatal and postnatal care at lower-level health facilities but to give birth at or near facilities with access to emergency obstetric care given the inability to predict the risk of adverse birth outcomes at the individual level. It considered additional health financing options from global experiences for incentivizing and facilitating service delivery redesign before finally canvassing issues and challenges for implementation from country representatives from Afghanistan Bhutan Bangladesh Indonesia and Cambodia.

ADB invested $10 million in Hermina Hospitals ' initial public offering and administered another $10 million from Leading Asia’s Private Infrastructure Fund. This anchor investment also played a significant role in attracting third-party investors and establishing confidence in Hermina’s access to capital markets. A successful IPO for Hermina demonstrated the viability of a business model that focuses on JKN adoption. It is expected that this partnership will encourage other private hospital service providers in Indonesia to partner with JKN and contribute to the overall improvement of health care services in the country.

Partnership with the private sector is key to expanding Indonesia's health coverage and delivering health care services efficiently under Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) its universal health insurance program. More accessible and affordable medical services across Indonesia will particularly help reduce maternal mortality and end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age.

Transcript

A prosperous future starts with healthy mothers and children. But in many densely populated developing countries in Asia and the Pacific pregnancy and childbirth still pose risks to mothers and their unborn children. In Indonesia ADB partnered with Hermina to deliver affordable accessible and high-quality health care services.

It is one of the largest private hospital groups in Indonesia. Though it has expanded its operations and developed a chain of multispecialty hospitals Hermina’s primary focus remains maternal health and childcare. Hermina serves current and emerging middle-income families especially in small cities and rural areas outside Jakarta like Wonogiri.

""Hermina Wonogiri has 100 beds. This makes us a C-type hospital with health facilities such as operating rooms five birthing rooms and also intensive care units for adults newborns and pediatric patients. Our prime service is perinatology and neonatal intensive care. It is aligned with Hermina's vision to maintain focus on maternal and child health care"" shares Dr Wenny Retno Sarie Lestari Hospital Director of Hermina Wonogiri.

ADB invested $10 million in Hermina's initial public offering and administered another $10 million from Leading Asia’s Private Infrastructure Fund.

""ADB's investment in Hermina will directly improve access of women to quality healthcare in Indonesia. In addition to that Hermina has committed to gender equity and women's empowerment in its business activities. The unique aspect of Hermina's business is catering to patients from JKN the universal health coverage program in Indonesia. It encourages other private health service providers to partner with JKN and went a long way in improving the access to quality healthcare in Indonesia"" discusses Aniruddha Patil Unit Head Education and Health Investments ADB.

Patil also underscored that ADB's role as an anchor investor in the IPO of Hermina helped the company successfully raise over $140 million from other third-party investors and also help demonstrate the viability of its business model.

ADB's anchor investment attracted other investors in the Hermina IPO. ADB worked with DBS Bank to mobilize private financing in the Indonesian capital market.

DBS Bank's Executive Director for Pharmaceutical and Health Care Eugene Hong M.D. explains ""The health care assets are a rarity especially in Southeast Asia. At the start of 2018 we decided to launch this transaction. It was a very bullish market at that time. But things took a quick turn for the worse and even within Indonesia we have an issue of a falling rupiah. So we took a step backward and assessed if we should proceed with this transaction. This is where ADB comes in where they address these issues with their due diligence before investing. Therefore it provides a lot of confidence for investors to take that jump to take that leap into investing in this transaction.""

Hermina is a great example of DBS Bank's support for developing Asia. ""This is exactly the type of transaction where DBS and ADB can really work together to provide social benefits and economic benefits to companies and clients in the region"" discusses Simon Ong Managing Director and Head of Financial Institutions DBS Bank.

A prosperous Asia and the Pacific needs healthy and well-nourished people. ADB and its development partners are helping the private sector to provide accessible and affordable medical care for women and children laying a foundation for healthy and prosperous lives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL29waW5pb24vb3Bpbmlvbi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1jYW5hZGEtdGFpd2FuLTEuNjU4NDE0NNIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42NTg0MTQ0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taiwan created a successful health-care system by learning from Canada. We should now be learning from them,"This column is an opinion by Harmeet Nanner a research analyst at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. For more information about CBC's Opinion section please see the FAQ.

In the 1970s Taiwan began an effort to radically transform its health-care system. Building up its supply of health-care resources to serve a rapidly industrializing country was the first priority but the more complex problem was how health-care services should be funded while providing equitable access for all.

In the late 80s an expert task force was commissioned to address this issue and William Hsiao a Harvard economics professor renowned for his work on health-care financing was selected as chief advisor.

Prof. Hsiao began an economic study of insurance schemes in six countries: the U.S. the U.K. Germany France Canada and Japan. The results were in favour of a single-payer system based on Canada's experience with medicare in the 80s at which time the quality of services was very high. This helped influence Taiwan to also adopt a single-payer framework a program they call the National Health Insurance (NHI).

The task force learned from both the successes and failures of Canada and over a dozen other countries to piece together a system that was ideal for Taiwan. Consequently our systems can look quite different even though they share the same basic framework.

Taiwan very good at controlling costs

The research and data-driven process has allowed for a finely-tuned system such that the NHI can provide comprehensive coverage for dental prescription drugs physical rehabilitation and more all while putting a tight lid on costs — and it is very good at controlling costs .

In 2017 Taiwan's national health expenditure (NHE) was 6.1 per cent of GDP; the OECD average that year was 8.8 per cent and Canada's NHE was 10.4 per cent. Most impressive is how much performance is squeezed out of every dollar; while Canadians have spent the last two decades increasingly haunted by wait times the Taiwanese system is notable for having minimal wait times.

Am I suggesting that Taiwan has the perfect system? Definitely not. There are some glaring issues and some aspects may be unacceptable to Canadians but the system's efficiency means that Taiwan has lots of room to increase its health-care budget to address shortcomings.

On the other hand Canada's health-care system is simply tragic. We're seeing it at its worst right now but our system has been failing Canadians for a number of years most obviously with wait times.

As Prof. Hsiao notes  Canadian health care began its descent in the 1990s when funding grew tight during a recession. However the Canadian system has always been missing certain features that would maximize how efficiently we use the resources we're paying for.

Even now Canada's NHE is among the highest in the OECD.

Ambulance paramedics unload patients at Toronto Western Hospital. With the tragic state of health-care services we may finally have the motivation we need to fix our system writes Harmeet Nanner. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

What exactly do we get for such high costs? According to the Commonwealth Fund which made a very comprehensive comparison of health care in 11 different countries (Taiwan is not one of them) Canada has the absolute worst system of universal care.

Some may assume that the message of this article is for Canada to emulate the specific policies and procedures that Taiwan has built their system out of but that's actually not it. What I want us to emulate is the process that Taiwanese officials used to achieve their health care success a process of mobilizing the world's knowledge and relying on a diverse group of experts to create effective policy solutions.

The task force which led to the creation of the NHI was notable for how it reached across borders in order to get the best information available. The Canadian federal government should similarly bring together an expert task force to make recommendations on comprehensive health care reform not just on the issue of funding and health insurance but for all components that make up the system such as policies that can enable more effective health care delivery.

Politics is the hardest part

The difficult part of this plan is the politicians and federalism. Our governments can be quite good about calling expert groups together to make recommendations but they're horrible at implementing them at least as it pertains to health care. Several government-sanctioned reports have been produced in the past to advise on methods of improving modernizing and sustaining the health-care system but those reports have largely been ignored.

In 2002 following the publication of the Romanow Commission report one poll found that a majority of Canadians approved of it but 39 per cent were pessimistic that its advice would be followed . Unfortunately those Canadians were right but had they been wrong we probably wouldn't have so many shuttered ERs at the moment.

Those who remember past advisory reports may scoff at my suggestion as another useless attempt to reform health care a waste of money to make recommendations that will go nowhere. I disagree.

The discussions I often hear about reforming the system in the public media and from governments are far removed from the solutions that are the most transformative and well-researched. In the worst case an expert task force would help thrust alternatives into the public dialogue and this would help the voters of today to understand just what sorts of policies their governments should be supporting.

The best case is of course that those policies go through. With the tragic state of health-care services droves of health-care workers pushed to the brink the clear failure relative to other OECD countries and a single-payer role model in Taiwan we may finally have the motivation we need to fix our beloved health-care system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlZm9ydW0ub3JnL2FnZW5kYS8yMDIyLzA5L2Jsb2NrY2hhaW4tc29sdXRpb24tZm9yLWZhaWxpbmctZ2xvYmFsLWhlYWx0aGNhcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is blockchain the solution for failing global healthcare?,"Global healthcare systems are under extreme stress.

Blockchain technology could create an efficient transparent safe and effective way of communicating data across global healthcare.

Blockchain technology can also support healthcare development save money and support further investment into essential resources.

The global healthcare system has been deteriorating for what feels like decades. With bed shortages long waiting lists increasing costs and global pandemics the state of the global healthcare system has never been more challenging for healthcare providers practitioners or patients.

According to Deloitte’s 2022 Global Health Care Outlook the industry is at breaking point. The COVID-19 pandemic has exhausted healthcare workers overwhelmed institutions disproportionately affected and further marginalised large sections of the population and decreased access and demand for non-COVID-19-related medical care.

In short the pandemic has exacerbated an already broken healthcare industry hampered by decades of inefficiency funding cuts failed reformation and over-centralisation. But this can be fixed.

To ensure that the global healthcare system does not completely fail drastic measures must be taken. The introduction of blockchain technology will allow for a decentralised and distributed environment that ultimately serves and protects all – as any good healthcare system should.

Improving communication and efficiency

Blockchain technology is massively under-utilised in global healthcare. It can ensure an efficient transparent safe and effective way of communicating data and information for all parties in the healthcare industry. Through tokenisation and the use of smart contracts it offers the opportunity to reduce or remove the process of pre-authorisation in the healthcare sector.

Blockchain-based solutions for health documentation offer secure encryption techniques that safeguard the integrity of individuals' information when communicating with different parties. Through tokenisation smart contracts and the encryption techniques that are involved in blockchain network transactions the process of pre-authorisation will be reduced massively enabling patients to receive the necessary and informed care more efficiently. This is a result of the healthcare provider being able to access the relevant information quickly when they would have previously been depending on the patient or on files physically mailed or emailed from disparate sources such as local physicians labs etc.

Not only can tokenisation facilitate more efficient interaction and communication between healthcare providers and insurance companies it can also support and improve the communication between the patient and healthcare provider.

Putting the patient first

Bringing a decentralised platform into the global healthcare system will bring different benefits to the patient. For one it will allow for medical records to be owned by the patient rather than the healthcare provider. Decentralisation will also allow for healthcare to become more accessible to all as it will remove the shackles and allow for patients to provide their medical records to any practitioner anywhere in the world.

The tokenisation of personal information means patients will be able to provide and receive information quickly and efficiently as they interact with different global healthcare professionals and providers along their healthcare journey. Essential information such as medical history insurance details and personal information will be provided through a platform to ensure information is accessed quickly and stored for every use.

By providing patients with access to their medical records they can ensure that the information held on them is accurate and correct. A study carried out to investigate the accuracy of medical records found that healthcare providers would input only 18% of the text in progress notes manually - leaving 46% copied and 36% imported. This leaves a large window for error and outdated data.

Supporting outpatient services

Outside the hospital setting people find themselves under the care of multiple providers: a primary care institution their GP; specialist practitioners such as dentists and physiotherapists; and everyone else across the medical profession spectrum. With so much to track and manage a system that ensures that all parties are up-to-date with appointments prescriptions and medication can be challenging particularly when providers are part of different global healthcare networks.

With blockchain-based medical records prescription data can be updated in real-time by any provider streamlining the information flow and reducing the risk of errors and contraindications between drugs.

Patients can even add information about their over-the-counter medication or homoeopathic remedies ensuring that care providers and pharmacies have all the information they need to give the right treatment and advice. From a user perspective this means there is a central single-access repository of information that is safely stored and housed across a decentralised blockchain.

The future of global healthcare

Blockchain technology can help support the development of the global healthcare industry save money and encourage further investment into essential resources. With so much at stake it’s impossible to think that the inefficient overly bureaucratic and failing healthcare industry that we are experiencing today can continue. For patients practitioners and executives it's time to accept the technology and systems-based advancements at our disposal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpZHNtYXAuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VwLTIwMjIva2V5LXBvcHVsYXRpb24tbGVkLXNlcnZpY2VzLW5vdy1hY2NvdW50LW1ham9yaXR5LXRoYWktcHJlcC11c2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Key population-led services now account for the majority of Thai PrEP users,"Domestic financing and policy reform has been key to scale-up of PrEP

Key population-led services are now supporting 82% of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users in Thailand — just three years after the country legalised key provider-led PrEP. The number of PrEP users from key population-led programmes has nearly doubled since the country moved to provide the services free of charge as part of its universal healthcare.

Key populations are groups of people who are disproportionately affected by HIV for example in Thailand men who have sex with men and transgender women. Key population-led programmes fill gaps in traditional HV programming around accessibility availability acceptability and quality according to the Bangkok-based Institute of HIV Research and Innovation (IHRI). Because services like these are co-created with key populations projects are located in areas with high need and offer stigma-free comprehensive services.

Glossary key populations Groups of people who are disproportionately affected by HIV or who are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. Depending on the context may include men who have sex with men transgender people sex workers people who inject drugs adolescent girls prisoners and migrants. community setting In the language of healthcare something that happens in a “community setting” or in “the community” occurs outside of a hospital. stigma Social attitudes that suggest that having a particular illness or being in a particular situation is something to be ashamed of. Stigma can be questioned and challenged. pilot study Small-scale preliminary study conducted to evaluate feasibility time cost adverse events and improve upon the design of a future full-scale research project. event based In relation to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) this dosing schedule involves taking PrEP just before and after having sex. It is an alternative to daily dosing that is only recommended for people having anal sex not vaginal sex. A double dose of PrEP should be taken 2-24 hours before anticipated sex and then if sex happens additional pills 24 hours and 48 hours after the double dose. In the event of sex on several days in a row one pill should be taken each day until 48 hours after the last sexual intercourse.

Using lay providers trained according to national standards key population-led programmes are also more likely to offer comprehensive gender-sensitive services free of stigma and discrimination that can accompany care in more traditional settings according to Rena Janamnuaysook of IHRI.

""Key population-led services are identified by key populations themselves and therefore are needs-based and demand-driven and client centred” she explained at the 24th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2022) in Montreal.

She added that some community-run projects also operate outside of traditional working hours to ensure services are convenient for key populations such as sex workers who work at night.

Expansion of key population-led programmes and domestic financing

Thailand became the first country in the world to pilot same-day PrEP through key-population led services in 2016 and a year later these projects integrated gender-affirming care. The services relied on funding from PEPFAR the Global Fund and other donors.

In 2019 the country amended regulations to allow key-population-led PrEP to move beyond pilot projects. With the move trained counsellors throughout the country could collect finger-prick blood samples and collect specimens for sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening. These healthcare workers could also perform point-of-care HIV and STI testing and report results. Importantly these workers were also permitted to dispense physician-prescribed PrEP post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and oral STI treatment.

Still key population-led services were not eligible for direct reimbursement for services under Thailand’s Universal Coverage Scheme until 2021. This is an insurance programme providing free access to a comprehensive health benefits package for all Thai citizens. It is funded through taxation by the National Health Security Office.

As of late July 82% of Thailand's nearly 32000 current PrEP users entered care via key population-led programmes. The number of PrEP users in the country nearly doubled since the introduction of key-population-led services in 2019. Community-based PrEP services now make up the majority of National Health Security Office-funded PrEP users as well according to data presented by Janamnuaysook.

Thailand shifting PrEP services out of hospitals

Still Thailand had only achieved about ten percent of its 2021 PrEP target according to the Ministry of Public Health’s Dr Cheewanan Lertpiriyasuwat.

For instance even though staff at 276 hospitals across the country had been trained to provide PrEP 40% of these sites had been unable to implement PrEP by June 2022 she said. Ministry of Public Health officials continue to coach staff and conduct monitoring and evaluation through a centralised national PrEP database PrEPThai.net. Meanwhile she said the country is working to scale-up best practice models of key population-led PrEP.

Thailand now aims to have at least one PrEP-providing clinic in each of the country's 76 provinces by 2025 Lertpiriyasuwat said. The country also plans to expand access to differentiated PrEP models via recently developed guidelines that allow for online appointment bookings telemedicine consultations and event-based PrEP.

Event-based PrEP is also known as on-demand PrEP or PrEP 2-1-1. It involves taking two tablets 2 to 24 hours before engaging in sex taking a single tablet 24 hours after the first two and another tablet 24 hours after that.

“To build a sustainable PrEP programme in Thailand we had to build the necessary foundation through evidence-based policy advocacy guideline development a commitment to government financing for PrEP robust monitoring and evaluation systems and continual capacity building” she said. “Thailand will still need to address challenges to uptake accelerating implementation of PrEP services at community-based organisations and government sites.”

Can other countries make the same shift?

Recently UNAIDS praised Thailand’s shift to nationally and sustainably funded community-led services as a milestone in the country’s HIV response. The model Janamnuaysook says can also be applied to new PrEP advances — such as injectable cabotegravir ­— and other health issues.

Still many countries do not have the regulations and domestic financing mechanisms to make a similar shift Janamnuaysook cautioned. She cited UNAIDS data showing that although 134 countries allow community-based organisations to provide HIV services almost half as many lack social contracting or other mechanisms to allow countries to directly fund community-led services.

“We need to shift the paradigm from community engagement to community leadership in the HIV response: Key populations cannot only be service recipients” Janamnuaysook said. “[But] domestic financing and enabling legal environment must be made available to sustain the community-led responses to HIV.”"

Verizon brings 5G Ultra Wideband service to Innovation Hub at University of South Carolina housed in the McNair Center.

With Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband innovators can develop and test real-world 5G solutions for use cases such as manufacturing healthcare and civil infrastructure.

Initial projects will include manufacturing quality inspection and defect detection healthcare connected asset management and drone-based visual inspection of roads and bridges.

NEW YORK – Verizon and the University of South Carolina are exploring how 5G Ultra Wideband can transform industries including manufacturing healthcare and civil infrastructure among others. To do this Verizon and the university launched the Innovation Experience Hub powered by Verizon 5G housed in the McNair Center in Columbia SC where students faculty entrepreneurs and corporate partners can collaborate to test and create new solutions powered by Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband which is available in select areas.

Innovators at the hub will leverage 5G connectivity and solutions to help improve manufacturing processes with quality sensing and defect detection. In healthcare they’ll test how 5G can enhance emergency response by enabling remote health monitoring and real-time analysis of patient vitals as well as hospital connected asset management to streamline asset retrieval and dispatch operations. When it comes to civil infrastructure researchers will examine how 5G communications can enhance monitoring of roads and bridges with condition analytics and reporting as well as drone-based visual inspection of roads bridges and buildings using AI-driven computer vision.

“Working with the University of South Carolina we have a great opportunity to collaborate with dozens of partners to ideate and develop new 5G-powered solutions leveraging the latest technologies including large-scale IoT artificial intelligence computer vision and augmented reality” said Jennifer Artley Verizon Business Senior Vice President of 5G Acceleration. “Verizon is the network America relies on. Giving researchers access to Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband with its high bandwidth and low latency can accelerate the innovation process leading to new solutions that will transform how enterprises operate and grow.”

“Our relationship with Verizon exemplifies the benefits of partnerships between the University of South Carolina and the business community” university president Michael Amiridis said. “This aligns with our focus on expanding research opportunities that solve problems and accelerate discoveries.”

This engagement is part of Verizon’s broader strategy to partner with enterprises startups universities national labs and government/military organizations to explore how 5G can disrupt and transform nearly every industry. Verizon operates several 5G Labs in the U.S. that specialize in developing use cases in industries ranging from healthcare to public safety to entertainment. In addition Verizon is collaborating with various customers to establish 5G Innovation Hubs on-premises as part of an ongoing initiative to co-innovate and create new 5G applications.

So what does that have to do with Android? Well typically when Apple does something like this the entire industry follows. Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 – citing “courage” as the reason. Then every other phone also removed the headphone jack. And there are other examples out there too.

While many Android phones do support eSIM already most carriers do not advertise it. That is because eSIM makes it easier to switch carriers at will and that’s not something the carriers like to have. So your phone that you’re reading this on might actually have eSIM support and you don’t even know it. For example every Pixel has eSIM because they work on Google Fi. And Google Fi is an eSIM first carrier.

So what we want to do today is go over how you can transition from a physical SIM to an eSIM on each of the three carriers in the US. But first let’s talk about what an eSIM actually is.

What is an eSIM?

So now that we know what a SIM is what is an eSIM? It’s an embedded-SIM or a programmable SIM that is built into the phone and you’ll never see it. This has been available for things like cellular-connected smartwatches and some tablets. Some phones are compatible with eSIM as well.

eSIM was first introduced in 2016 so it’s still fairly new. The Samsung Gear S2 Classic 3G was the first device to use an eSIM. Apple first introduced eSIM back in September 2017 on its Apple Watch Series 3 and the following year on the iPhone XS.

Interestingly some MVNO carriers like Google Fi use eSIM and prefer it over a regular SIM card. Likely because that’s one less thing they need to ship to the customer.

eSIMs give customers more flexibility for switching carriers. Which is something the carriers don’t like. Since you are able to just go into settings and add another carrier of course you do need an account and plan with that carrier for it to really work.

How to activate an eSIM in the US

After you get your phone you’re going to need to activate that eSIM on your phone. Now some MVNO’s like Google Fi makes this super easy but it does take a few minutes. The larger carriers like AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon don’t make it as easy because it makes it easier to switch carriers. Something they don’t want. So here’s how you can activate it on each carrier.

How to activate an eSIM on AT&T

Firstly you’ll want to sign into your AT&T account.

Next click on My devices.

Then you’ll want to find your device and click on Manage.

Next click Options & Settings.

Now click on Get a new eSIM.

From there you’ll just follow the prompts to complete the setup of your new eSIM. And within a few minutes your eSIM will be active.

How to activate an eSIM on T-Mobile

Over on T-Mobile you’ll want to head over to your T-Mobile account.

Then find your device and select the phone number.

Next you’ll be prompted to enter your EID number.

Now scan the QR code (which is pictured below).

And you’ll be walked through the process of setting up your eSIM on T-Mobile.

How to activate an eSIM on Verizon

With Verizon you’ll need to open the My Verizon app to activate your eSIM. This will work on phones you buy from Verizon and those that you brought over to Verizon.

Advertisement

The other way you can do this is by calling Verizon’s customer support at (800) 922-0204 to get help activating your eSIM. Obviously Verizon doesn’t make it as easy as other carriers.

How to download an eSIM to your Android phone

If you already have an eSIM activated on your carrier then when switching to a new Android phone you’ll simply need to download the eSIM to that device. Now Android phones are able to save multiple eSIMs so you can switch pretty easily. Here’s how you can download that eSIM.

On your Android phone head into Settings.

Next tap on Network & Internet.

Now tap on the plus button next to SIMs.

Tap on the Download a SIM instead button. It’ll be at the bottom of the screen.

Then tap on Next.

It’ll connect to the network. Then ask you to confirm your carrier. Select your carrier here.

Scan the QR code that you got from your carrier.

After your code has been confirmed tap on Done to complete the activation.

Now this may not work for everyone (I’ve had trouble doing this with Verizon myself) so you may need to call your carrier to get your eSIM switched over.

And that’s it. That’s how you can download an eSIM onto your Android smartphone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNW1hYy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNi9iZXN0LWlwaG9uZS0xNC1wcmUtb3JkZXItZGVhbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 14 launch day deals: Verizon AT&T and more,"Last week Apple took to the stage in Cupertino to officially reveal the all-new iPhone 14 for the very first time. Now following the Far Out event the new devices are beginning to ship as various carriers and retailers begin getting in on the launch day savings. Below you’ll find all of the best iPhone 14 launch day deals from AT&T Verizon T-Mobile and many other providers.

iPhone 14 pre-orders start at 8 a.m. ET

iPhone 14 pre-orders alongside the rest of Apple’s new smartphones are all set to launch at 8 a.m. ET/5 a.m. PT on September 9. This year’s refresh is delivering some of the best offers in years when it comes to getting shoppers to upgrade to Apple’s latest. Across all four of the new iPhone 14 handsets pre-order deals are giving you a chance to get in on the new action for less. The first iPhone 14 devices are slated to arrive next week on September 16.

This time around iPhone 14 series handsets arrive in four different form-factors starting with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. These devices iterate on last year’s handsets with new additions like battery battery emergency satellite SOS an upgraded camera and the removal of a physical SIM tray. There will be five different colors available for the 14 and 14 Plus with Midnight and Starlight being joined by some more vibrant styles of Blue Purple and the usual (Product)RED collaboration.

Stepping up to the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max Apple is delivering its latest flagship experience centered around the all-new Dynamic Island cutout. There are only four colorways for the higher-end handsets with a new Silver design pairing with Gold Space Black and Deep Purple. Get a closer look at the entire lineup right here.

We’ll be updating everything below as launch day discounts begin going live from additional carriers and retailers.

iPhone 14 Pro Max

Verizon

Starting things off for the iPhone 14 Pro Max Verizon is setting the pace by delivering an enticing offer for new customers. As you’ll find from competing retailers those switching to the network will score you up to $1000 in savings when trading in a smartphone. You’ll also have to activate a new Unlimited plan and Verizon is also sweetening the pot by throwing in a $200 eGift card to help make the switch away from the competition.

Those who have an existing plan with Verizon will be able to score upward of $800 with a trade-in as well. Those savings will be applied over the required 24- or 36-month contract as bill credits for each payment.

AT&T

Next up for the iPhone 14 Pro Max pre-orders AT&T is stepping in by offering the same savings whether you’re a new or existing customer. As for the flagship handset you’ll pay just $99 when trading in a device thanks to $1000 in credits applied across deductions each month on your bill. You’ll need to sign up for one of the carrier’s Unlimited plans in order to score the savings though AT&T is certainly one of the more enticing offers for those who are already signed up for the carrier thanks to not locking added savings behind switching.

T-Mobile

Combining what we’ve seen from Verizon and AT&T in terms of iPhone 14 pre-orders T-Mobile is offering some devices for free and others with deep savings attached. At the top of the lineup of Apple’s latest smartphones the iPhone 14 Pro Max is now sitting at $1000 off when you trade in an existing device. And if you’re switching from one of the other carriers T-Mobile will throw in an extra $200 for porting over a phone number.

T-Mobile is also doing something a bit different compared to other carriers offering multiple different plans to choose from for taking advantage of the savings. Those include Magenta MAX; Business Unlimited Advanced Ultimate or Ultimate+ for iPhone. Speaking of those who don’t want any of those plans can also save up to $500 with trade-in on nearly every other subscription the carrier offers.

The flexibility isn’t something we’re seeing from the likes of AT&T and Verizon so the Uncarrier is certainly worth considering if you’re not sold on a standard monthly plan.

Xfinity Mobile

Those who don’t have a device to trade in may find that Xfinity Mobile is the right carrier to go with as you’ll be able to bring home the new iPhone 14 Pro Max at $400 off. All you’ll need to do is port over an existing number and enjoy walking away on launch day with Apple’s latest.

Red Pocket Mobile

Another way to get in on the pre-paid savings Red Pocket Mobile is marking down devices. For the iPhone 14 Pro Max you’ll save $100 right at checkout with an extra $200 in savings applying after the fact. After three months of having autopay enabled on your account you’ll be credited a $200 rebate. Both ne and existing customers are eligble for the promotion too.

iPhone 14 Pro

Verizon

Over on the iPhone 14 Pro front Verizon is providing its best offer of the batch. Those who plan on making the switch to the carrier will be able to score the new flagship handset for nothing as long as you trade in a device. The same $200 eGift card applied to the iPhone 14 Pro Max is also applying for the next step down in Apple’s latest lineup.

Those who have an existing plan with Verizon will be able to score upward of $800 with a trade-in as well. Those savings will be applied over the required 24- or 36-month contract as bill credits for each payment.

AT&T

iPhone 14 Pro is also getting much of the same special treatment from AT&T now that pre-orders are going live with the carrier delivering the same savings for customers new and old alike. In this case trading in an eligible device will mean you get the handset for free. Those savings will be applied over the course of the Unlimited plan that you sign up for much like you’ll expect from other carriers who also deal in monthly bill credits.

T-Mobile

Moving over to the iPhone 14 Pro T-Mobile’s flagship offers this time around for pre-ordering the new device lets you score the 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display for free. You’ll of course have to trade in an eligible device and be signed up for one of the few unlimited-like plans.

The new smartphone is also going to be half off for those who want one of the more affordable monthly plans. In either case the savings will be applied at monthly bill credits.

Xfinity Mobile

Much like its larger counterpart the iPhone 14 Pro is also getting a direct $400 pre-order discount by going with the pre-paid Xfinity Mobile plan. There’s the same requirement of porting over a phone number but this is easily one of the best routes to choose for those who don’t have an existing device to trade in. Sure the savings aren’t quite as deep but it’s hard to be scoring an all-new Apple release without paying full price.

Red Pocket Mobile

Red Pocket Mobile is also getting in on the iPhone 14 Pro pre-orders by taking $100 off the new handset. There’s the same $200 rebate to enjoy as on the Pro Max model which will be applied to your account after three months of autopay billing. That brings the price of iPhone 14 Pro down to $699 when things are all said and done.

iPhone 14

Verizon

As for the most compact of Apple’s latest iPhones the new 14 is also included in the Verizon pre-order promotions. The same up to $1000 in savings apply when you open up a new Unlimited plan and trade in an eligible device and you’ll also get that extra $200 credit when signing up with the carrier after switching from another company.

If you’re already on Verizon there’s also up to $800 in savings to be had for trading in a device. It’s not quite as good of an offer as those who open a new line but there’s still some savings to be had for existing Verizon customers. Just keep note of the monthly bill credits and being locked into an either two- or three-year contract.

AT&T

AT&T is also carrying the savings over to the smallest version of Apple’s new smartphone with pre-orders going live on the base iPhone 14. Those who don’t want to go with one of the more pro devices stand to score the standard 6.1-inch handset for free. It doesn’t matter if you’ve been a loyal AT&T customer for years or plan on signing up for an entirely new plan as long as you are locked into one of the carrier’s Unlimited plans and trade in an eligible device you’ll be able to walk away next week with the new smartphone for nothing.

T-Mobile

Much as you’ll find from other carriers T-Mobile is offering Apple’s most compact new handset for free. Right now when you trade in an existing device you’ll be able to score the iPhone 14 on pre-order for nothing. On top of scoring an extra $200 credit for switching there’s the same plan flexibility as offered on the flagship handsets detailed above.

If you’re looking to pick up a device for you and a family member or partner T-Mobile also has you covered. Right now the Uncarrier is offering a pre-order promotion on iPhone 14 that lets you score a second device at $700 off when adding a line on almost any of its plans. The savings will apply over 24 monthly bill credits as you can expect from any of the other carries.

Xfinity Mobile

Much like the rest of Apple’s latest lineup the new iPhone 14 is also going to be getting in on the pre-order savings via Xfinity Mobile. The pre-paid carrier is doing things differently than the others and taking a flat $400 off for customers when they port over a phone number. There’s no trading in an existing device for locking into a several-year contact in order to score the new device which certainly makes this one of the more alluring ways to go with the iPhone 14.

Red Pocket Mobile

When it comes to the smallest handset in Apple’s new stable Red Pocket Mobile is also taking $100 off its list price to start the iPhone 14 pre-orders. Following three months of autopay billing you’ll also get an extra $200 in credit applied that effectively drops the price of your new device down to $529.

iPhone 14 Plus

Unlike the rest of the new handsets Apple won’t be officially releasing the new iPhone 14 Plus until later on in October. So while you can lock-in a pre-order today you won’t actually get your device until October 7. Many of the carriers are detailing what you can expect from launch promotions when it does go live. All of the details should also help you see if it’s worth just skipping the new Plus form factor and go with one of the other handsets that will arrive sooner which are also seeing sizable discounts from various carriers.

Verizon

Just like with the flagship offerings Verizon will be taking the same up to $1000 off iPhone 14 Plus. That final total of course depends on which device you end up trading in and which storage capacity you go for but the added $200 in credit as noted above still applies for those who plan on coming over from any of the other carriers. And if you’re already on Verizon there’s $800 in savings to be had for a phone trade-in. In either case those savings will stack up to monthly bill credits over the course of the 24- or 36-month contract.

AT&T

Following Verizon’s lead it’s not the just flagship handsets that are getting in on the deep pre-order discounts for the iPhone 14 series from AT&T. The new Plus version will be entirely free for anyone who opts to trade a compatible device in to the carrier. You’ll of course need to be subscribed to an existing Unlimited plan or sign up for a new one in order to cash in on the savings which will ultimately be applied at bill credits come October when pre-orders do begin shipping.

T-Mobile

Last up for T-Mobile those who don’t mind waiting another month can pre-order the upcoming iPhone 14 Plus and save $1000 when trading in a new device. The requirement of being signed up for any of the carrier’s unlimited plans remains just expect the savings to be applied to your bill each month.

Xfinity Mobile

While you’ll have to wait until later on in the fall those who have their hearts set on the new iPhone 14 Plus will be able to walk away with $400 in added savings later this fall. There’s no trade-ins required in order to lock in the savings making this easily one of the best deals right now for those who are looking to score a new iPhone 14 without all of the usual baggage.

Red Pocket Mobile

Last up Red Pocket Mobile subscribers looking for their ticket to iPhone 14 Plus can now score the handset at $100 off with $200 in credit down the road. You’ll end up paying just $629 for the handset when it ships in October following three months of autopay billing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy92ZXJpem9uLXNlbGVjdGVkLXRvLXN1cHBseS1wcml2YXRlLTVnLW5ldHdvcmstYXQtaGF3YWlpYW4tbWlsaXRhcnktYmFzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon selected to supply private 5G network at Hawaiian military base,"The operator will deploy its private network at the base in Hawaii after it was awarded the Tranche 2 contract worth $11.5 million.

Verizon has been selected by the US Department of Defense to install and maintain a 5G private network inside an aircraft maintenance hangar at joint military base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH).

This private network will provide personnel at the base with high-speed high bandwidth and low-latency connectivity.

Verizon SVP for public sector Maggie Hallbach said: “The private 5G network we’re constructing in an aircraft maintenance hangar at JBPHH is just the latest example of how we’re helping the U.S. Department of Defense deliver innovative mission-critical capabilities across a range of military operations through advanced network and communications solutions.""

The network design will cover a hanger at the base and will people at the base to trial and implement Foreign Object Detection (FOD) and other maintenance applications.

Verizon's 5G service will be provided by Ericsson with the Swedish vendor supplying its core and radio access network to the site.

Last week AT&T teamed up with aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin to incorporate 5G into military environments through the use of a private network.

The tests saw AT&T transfer UH-60M Black Hawk health and usage data through a private AT&T cellular 5G network to Lockheed Martin's 5G.MIL network with the pilot conducted at Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky headquarters in Stratford Connecticut on August 4."

Novartis has petitioned the U.S. regulator not to approve any Entresto copycats until the end of a three-year exclusivity period in February 2024. The move follows a similar appeal by the Swiss pharma juggernaut last November.

At the time Novartis argued greenlighting any generic before 2024 would violate the FDA’s “same labeling” standards for copycat drugs. The FDA slapped down Novartis’ prior bid in April stating it had “not made a final determination on whether to approve or not approve any [Abbreviated New Drug Application] referencing Entresto.”

Entresto which has patents protecting various aspects of its formulation into 2036 won an extra three years of intellectual property breathing room in Feb. 2021 courtesy of an expanded approval in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

In its latest appeal to FDA Novartis argues early Entresto generic approvals could create labeling inconsistencies.

The company's issue comes down to so-called skinny labeling which enables generic drugmakers to get their copycats approved for one of several—but not necessarily all—indications of their brand-name counterparts. A label is “skinny” when the generic doesn’t cover all the indications of its reference product.

Under FDA’s generic labeling guidelines generic applicants looking to avoid approvals for a drug’s patent-protected uses must “start with the currently approved [reference listed drug] and may omit sections or specific words and phrases to avoid disclosing the protected use"" Novartis says.

Problem is as Novartis sees it Entresto’s HFpEF nod in 2021 “precludes such an approach” by generic drugmakers.

Related Novartis hit with DOJ probe into Entresto marketing all while dialing up peak sales estimate

At least 18 drugmakers are circling the gates with potential Entresto copycats Novartis said in its latest FDA filing. Those companies—which include Teva Viatris Aurobindo and Lupin among others—are angling to bring their generic versions of the heart med to market in July 2023 when a regulatory stay that prevents the FDA from granting final generic approvals lifts.

Novartis has long held that Entresto—a combination of sacubitril and valsartan first approved in 2015—could deliver peak sales of $5 billion. In 2021 the therapy pulled down nearly $3.55 billion in global sales Novartis said in its most recent annual report.

FDA plea aside Novartis is involved in litigation with several generic drugmakers in a bid to delay Entresto copycats.

Last month however Novartis found itself on the receiving end of Entresto litigation when it was sued by the University of Michigan and the University of South Florida which alleged the company’s heart drug infringes a co-crystal patent held by the two institutions. The schools are pursuing a jury trial and damages to make up for the alleged infringement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mNHdvbmxpbmUuY29tL25ld3Mvd3dlL3d3ZS1hZGRzLXR3by1uZXctbWVtYmVycy10by1ib2FyZC1vZi1kaXJlY3RvcnMvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmF2aWdhdGlvbi1wcmV2aW91cyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWludGVybmFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE adds two new members to Board of Directors,"Update —

The WWE Board of Directors has a couple of new members.

WWE issued a press release on Friday announcing that Michelle McKenna and JoEllen Lyons Dillon have been named to the company’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors now consists of 11 members.

McKenna has experience working for Disney Universal Studios and the NFL. McKenna also currently serves on the Board of Directors for Ring Central.

Dillon “has 30 years of combined public company experience in global business M&A and legal.” She currently serves on the Board of Directors for Viatris.

WWE wrote about McKenna and Dillon:

From 2012 to 2022 McKenna served as Chief Information Officer for the NFL where she was responsible for the league’s technology strategy and served as the executive sponsor of the Women’s Interactive Group. She serves on the Board of Directors of Ring Central where she is a member of the audit compensation and nominating & governance committees. McKenna previously served on the Board of Directors of Insperity from 2015 to 2018. Dillon has 30 years of combined public company experience in global business M&A and legal. Dillon has served on the Viatris Board of Directors since November 2020 when Pfizer’s Upjohn division combined with Mylan to form Viatris a global healthcare and pharmaceutical company. She is a member of the Viatris Board’s executive audit and compliance committees and is chair of its governance & nominating committee. She previously served on the Board of Mylan from 2014 to 2020. From 2013 to 2017 Dillon was an executive officer in various roles including Executive Vice President Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary of The ExOne Company a global provider of 3D printing machines and services.

Posted on: September 17 2022 05:59h.

Last updated on: September 19 2022 01:56h.

Due in large part to rising interest rates the real estate sector is sagging. But casino real estate investment trusts (REITs) are shining bright amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The widely followed FTSE Nareit Equity REITs Index is down 20.31% year-to-date. But Gaming and Leisure Properties (NASDAQ:GLPI) and VICI Properties — the two publicly traded gaming REITs — are higher by 0.06% and 11% respectively. Casino landlords are the only segment of the broader real estate sector generating positive returns this year.

Casino REITs are the lone property sector in positive territory this year benefiting from an upward valuation ‘re-rating’ and hard-earned mainstream institutional acceptance after many years of strong operational execution” according to Hoya Capital research.

VICI and GLPI approach casino real estate fashion in divergent fashion. The former is the largest landlord on the Las Vegas Strip among other holdings while the latter prefers to own regional casino property assets.

Casino REITs Superior Inflation Protection

Inflation of which the US economy has plenty is often a catalyst for real estate stocks. This year Gaming and Leisure and VICI are living up to that billing.

Casino REITs have become a favorite for investors seeking inflation-hedged assets. VICI boasts inflation-linked escalators on 96% of its leases while GLPI benefits from indirect inflation hedges linked to tenant performance” noted Hoya Capital.

GLPI and VICI are what’s known as triple-net REITs meaning the lease terms they sign with clients are usually far longer than what’s seen in other commercial real estate segments.

Market participants tend to treat triple-net REITs on par with longer-dated bonds meaning these stocks can be vulnerable to rising interest rates. This year however investors are focusing more on the inflation-fighting advantages GLPI and VICI offer.

“Despite their ultra-long term triple net lease structures casino REITs are better protected from inflation than many initially presumed” added Hoya. “Inflation sensitivity is driven by several interacting factors including external growth potential lease structure and term tenant credit quality and the cyclicality of the underlying property type.”

Casino REITs Love Good Deals

The current iterations of GLPI and VICI are the result of deal-making. Lots of it. VICI has a knack for acquiring gaming assets with both large and small price tags and is agnostic in terms of geography. For its part GLPI largely eschews the volatility of Las Vegas Strip real estate owning only the Tropicana there. But the REIT has a knack for smart buys.

Since 2016 GLPI VICI and MGM Growth Properties acquired by VICI purchased approximately $50 billion worth of assets. There’s room for that figure to grow in the years ahead as casino operators look to monetize property assets and generate cash for other uses.

“Casino REITs now own 100 of the roughly 250-300 ‘investment grade’ commercial casinos in the United States one of the highest concentrations of REIT ownership within any property sector” concluded Hoya.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its latest transformation relies on validators with basic laptops and stable internet connections.

Ethereum the world's second-largest cryptocurrency protocol by market capitalization virtually eliminated its energy consumption overnight on Sept. 15 by successfully transitioning to a new consensus mechanism known as proof of stake.

Although the long-awaited change did not result in a sudden price action for ether the protocol's native crypto-asset industry experts expect the shift to gradually alleviate concerns about how the use of blockchain technology is impacting the environment and demand for energy.

The so-called ""Merge"" was executed as the energy intensity of cryptocurrency protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has become a hot issue in Washington D.C. On Sept. 8 the White House released a report required under an executive order signed by U.S. President Joe Biden that detailed the energy impacts of crypto mining operations.

Bitcoin miners who use a more energy-intensive consensus mechanism called proof of work accounted for an estimated 0.9% to 1.4% of all U.S. electricity usage in 2021 according to the report. That estimate rose to 0.9% to 1.7% when proof of work Ethereum mining was included.

The White House report called for further federal action to ensure the U.S. crypto industry develops in a sustainable way.

'All applications will benefit'

Electricity consumption is inherent in proof of work's design. Bitcoin miners secure the network by expending significant amounts of capital to purchase and run high-powered computers that solve complex math puzzles competing for the opportunity to produce new blocks in a distributed ledger of transactions. In return they receive transaction fees and new bitcoins from a diminishing supply that will eventually be capped at 21 million. Once the bitcoin supply reaches its hard cap proof-of-work miners will only get paid through transaction fees.

Until Sept. 15 Ethereum miners also used high-powered graphics processing units or GPUs in running a proof-of-work consensus mechanism that consumed roughly the same amount of energy as Finland. A consensus mechanism uses a decentralized network of users to propose validate and order batches of transactions onto a blockchain.

With the transition to proof of stake Ethereum's network security relies on validators who deposit ether as collateral into smart contracts dubbed staked ether. In exchange validators who have posted collateral earn block rewards by confirming and ordering transactions. Staked ether can be slashed or confiscated if validators propose or confirm fraudulent transactions.

As of Sept. 15 Ethereum's proof-of-stake Beacon Chain had nearly 430000 validators according to BeaconScan an Ethereum-based blockchain explorer. Annual staking rewards paid in ether were roughly 4.7% according to the data aggregator StakingRewards.com. Similar to bitcoin the cryptocurrency could also become deflationary over time if demand for ether — required to make any transaction on Ethereum's primary public production blockchain called a mainnet — outpaces new issuance to validators.

Instead of using expensive GPUs validators simply need a basic laptop and a stable internet connection. The change will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by more than 99% according to the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation. That could eliminate one of the main criticisms of Ethereum which settled more than $11.6 trillion worth of transactions last year — more than Visa Inc. and nearly three times the value settled by Bitcoin.

""Almost all businesses care about the environment and it goes without saying that most will prioritize sustainable solutions if they can"" the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance said in a recent report. The industry organization whose members include Microsoft Corp. Ernst & Young LLP and JPMorgan Chase & Co. was formed to drive enterprise use of Ethereum technology.

Use cases for Ethereum include decentralized finance; payment processing; minting and trading non-fungible tokens or NFTs; gaming; and supply chain management. But near-term adoption faces headwinds such as finding product-market fit forthcoming regulatory actions by the U.S. government and the European Union as well as the Federal Reserve's effort to tame inflation by reducing discretionary spending through higher interest rates.

Ethereum nevertheless has a blossoming ecosystem of what is known as layer 2 solutions that offer faster transaction speeds at dramatically lower costs by bundling large numbers of transactions together before they are posted to the Ethereum mainnet.

Individual transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet can range anywhere from $15 to $250 or more based on the network's level of congestion. On layer 2 the same transaction could cost between 10 cents to $3 and as layer 2 usage grows transaction costs decrease because the network fees become more socialized.

The Ethereum mainnet also has more upgrades on its development roadmap such as data sharding a change that will help the network scale further by breaking data for different use cases down into smaller chunks or shards which effectively operate as autonomous blockchains.

Starbucks Corp. announced Sept. 12 that it selected the Ethereum-aligned Polygon Network to launch a new loyalty program that rewards customers with limited-edition NFTs. Polygon a scaling solution company that also uses proof of stake ""uses less energy than first generation 'proof-of-work' blockchains"" Starbucks noted in its news release.

""All applications will benefit from a reduced energy footprint"" Yorke Rhodes co-founder and director of Microsoft's blockchain strategy and an Enterprise Ethereum Alliance board member said in a Sept. 14 email. ""This upgrade is very significant and I believe it will allow enterprises to consider public Ethereum blockchain approaches where they did not prior.""

Bitcoin still seen as store of value

Bitcoin proponents still see an enduring role for the world's first cryptocurrency.

Ethereum's transition to proof of stake means the network will become subject to governance by stakers who can vote on making further changes to the protocol. And consolidation within the staking community could eventually lead to a small number of entities controlling at least 51% of the ether supply said Andrew Webber co-founder and CEO of Digital Power Optimization Inc. a company that works with independent power producers and other energy companies to harness excess electricity for bitcoin mining.

""That's fine for booking plane tickets or for recording real estate on these blockchains or any number of different functions"" Webber said in an interview. ""But as a store of value for the entire globe I don't know that you want those tweaks and changes put in the hands of a handful of entities that happen to control 51% of the network's coins.""

Looking forward Webber predicted a continued push to green bitcoin mining operations in the U.S.

""Over time all of this mining activity is ultimately going to flow down to the least valuable power in the world"" Webber said. ""If you're competing with expensive power and a lot of other people need it that's not going to be a good place to mine for bitcoin. It's getting more and more competitive and there are built-in halving dynamics which make it harder and harder and harder if you don't have what is effectively obscenely cheap power.""

The next bitcoin halving event is anticipated in March 2024 when the rate of rewarding new coins will be cut in half algorithmically.

Webber said he expects to see bitcoin mining continue to grow in wind- and solar-rich states such as Texas.

The White House's Sept. 8 report noted that the Electric Reliability Council Of Texas Inc. has about 17 mining facilities connected to its system accounting for roughly 2 GW of the system's 76 GW of peak demand. ERCOT also expects to add 5 GW to 6 GW of new crypto-related demand over the next 12 to 15 months and could add another 25 GW in incremental demand from crypto mining over the next decade.

Among other things the report recommended that the U.S. Energy Information Administration work to create greater transparency in demand response programs that reward miners for shutting off their equipment when power prices spike. The report also said the U.S. Department of Energy in coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corp. should consider new or updated grid reliability standards if mining operations are shown to pose a risk to the bulk power system.

Ethereum's switch to proof of stake could also prompt former Ethereum miners to convert their operations to mine for bitcoins Webber added.

""Any substantial site that had been using a lot of GPU power for Ethereum mining may very well switch that over to a Bitcoin mining site now"" Webber said.

But for the Leader of the Opposition it's not that clear cut. On Monday we told you that Barrow found that it's not all the residents that oppose the US company. According to him he polled around 50-70 villagers out of Gales Point's almost 200 residents and was surprised by the answers he got.

Today during a small press briefing he explained that he doesn't believe the government should have closed the door on Vulcan without first hearing them out. And he also doesn't believe the government's decision is based solely on what the people want.

Shyne Barrow Leader of the Opposition

""In order for Belize to evolve and develop to a first world nation we need investment we need economic development we cannot have a nation identified with any kind of contempt or resistance to multinationals. It can't be the case totally contradicts the notion of Belize being open for business. Now that does not mean that we are without standards we are without boundaries. I just believe that it is the responsibility of those elected officials in government in the opposition to find solutions where no solution can be found then we rest with clear consciences that we made the best efforts. In this particular instance watching from afar that is not the impression that I got. When I listened to different members of the Cabinet saying that they refused to have a meeting with Vulcan refuse to even allow an EIA for Vulcan because we cannot assess the environmental impact that people are concerned about without an EIA.""

""That's why I visited the community because if their decision is based on the community I expected to go to Gales Point and from start to finish hear people say no brother Shyne we noh deh pan it for this reason for that reason but there were people that supported it I was there I've heard different people say that nobody supported it again if nobody supported it I would have gladly come back and said you know I went there it is unanimous people in Gales Point don't want this project.""

""There could be other special interest involved you know that there's a lot of corruption historically in this country where if you are not prepared to play to pay then you can't play and that's how they use the Belizean people as pawns oh well the people don't want it but that's because maybe Vulcan as a multinational who has done business all around the world is not prepared to engage in any nefarious activities to bring something to the table that they believe will be beneficial to the country as well as to them so I don't buy that narrative that this is what the people of Gales Point want so that is why the Cabinet won't support it.""

""To bias the process to prejudice the process and not allow for a process is not good for investor confidence.""

Find out at Blackbeard’s Pirate Jamboree Oct. 28 & 29,"Lt. Robert Maynard aka Alex Foster is victorious having severed Blackbeard’s head during the Battle of Ocracoke in Silver Lake harbor at the 2021 event. Photo: C. Leinbach

Are the history books correct about what happened when Blackbeard met his demise off Ocracoke Island at the hand of British Royal Navy Lt. Robert Maynard in 1718?

North Carolina historian Kevin Duffus will present new history of this fateful event in his talk at 11:30 a.m. Saturday Oct. 29 in the Berkley Barn during Blackbeard’s Pirate Jamboree.

“No chapter of American history is more horribly mangled and misleading as Blackbeard’s” Duffus says and that is what led him to “devote years to researching analyzing and revising Blackbeard’s story because Blackbeard provides us with an excellent example of how over time the crystal-clear waters of the past become muddied with misinformation.”

You can learn what Duffus found during the two-day festival Oct. 28 and 29 on the Berkley Manor grounds on which the festival will focus on history colonial life and family fun.

Sponsored by the Ocracoke Civic & Business Association events begin Friday evening in the Berkley Barn and will conclude at 6 p.m. on Saturday.

The weekend will kick off Friday at 7 p.m. with a showing of the 1952 movie “Blackbeard the Pirate” with Robert Newton who has been called the “ultimate pirate actor… and is the learning base for future ‘pirates’ of the silver screen.”

Described as rollicking fun the plot conflates some historical facts and is set in 1674 (Blackbeard was killed off Ocracoke in 1718).

There a reformed pirate known as Sir Henry Morgan is governor in Jamaica and given the job of ridding the ocean of Blackbeard the pirate. A young surgeon Edward Maynard believes Morgan is still a pirate and takes the assignment of becoming part of Blackbeard’s crew to get his large reward and hopefully take care of these two men. Blackbeard manages to kidnap Morgan’s adopted daughter Edwina Mansfield and now Maynard has his hands full if he wants to complete his mission.

Colonial minstrels the Motley Tones will be on hand with some songs at 6:30 and North Carolina historian Kevin Duffus will give a brief introduction to the movie.

Prior to that on Friday Duffus will talk about the event on WOVV 90.1 FM at 11 a.m. with Peter Vankevich.

At noon Duffus will hold a book signing for his book “The Last Days of Black Beard the Pirate” at Books to be Red.

Various vendors also will be set up around the Berkley Barn from 2 to 5 p.m.

Saturday (Oct. 28) will feature a colonial village on the grounds of the Berkley Manor along with more than a dozen artisan vendors in Brigands Bazaar from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

All are welcome to join in the Pirate Parade at 10 a.m. from Ride the Wind to the encampment.

At 11:30 in the Berkley Barn Duffus will present “Blackbeard’s Final Battle—What Really Happened.”

Among the living history re-enactors are The Cannon Crew out of Beaufort. Led by Capt. Carl Cannon the 17-member group will set up a colonial-era encampment with shipboard medicine navigation weaving and cooking.

Cannon’s period sloop “The Adventure” and Horatio Sinbad’s brigantine “Meka II” will circle in the harbor at 11 a.m. firing cannons.

They will be part of the three-ship “Battle of Ocracoke” at 2 p.m. along with the Beaufort Oars in their surf boat “Ranger.”

Duffus will narrate the events via WOVV radio. To hear it everyone can tune their phones or computers to http://www.Radio.Garden and drag the circle to Ocracoke or go to http://www.wovv.rocks and click “Listen live.”

Anyone is welcome to check out these boats at the NPS docks.

Also pitching their camps will be members of Leviathan Nautical Living History a group dedicated to the accurate portrayal of a ship’s company of the age of sail spanning the years 1680 to 1865.

The Sword Circle which hails from Raleigh will demonstrate sword fighting and will have a booth with candle making in which festival goers can try their hand. They also will have axe throwing and will set up a foam pit for kids to learn sword fighting.

The Shadow Players will return this year and give a stage fighting demonstration and participate in the three-ship battle.

A giant walking Blackbeard along with his sidekick Jimmy Bones will participate in the parade and will circulate throughout the day.

Colonial minstrels The Motley Tones will provide the musical soundtrack with period songs.

Back on Nov. 22 2007 Duffus was at Springer’s Point taking photos for his book “The Last Days of Black Beard” when he landed on having a memorial service for those killed in the Battle of Ocracoke on Nov. 22 1718.

He recruited some pirate living history re-enactors to join him in 2008 for a service among themselves on Springer’s Point.

For several years the event was just the memorial service until in 2011 when members of the community decided to create more of an event.

The schedule of events is as follows:

Caring for Our Communities

Image

Through Wabtec's ""Caring for Our Communities"" program we have long worked to meaningfully impact communities and support employee volunteerism efforts. We are committed to being stewards of the communities where we have facilities and where our people live. Earlier this week in Erie over 90 LEAD program members along with representatives from the MyAbilities and Veterans Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) worked on a Build-a-Wheelchair® volunteer project to build wheelchairs for two non-profit organizations (VA Medical Center and Chosen Inc).

Image

Build-a-Wheelchair® is a program born out of a desire to help American veterans and others with various mobility challenges. Wabtec groups used teamwork skills to learn how to assemble test and decorate these new wheelchairs for donation. Volunteers were grouped into nine teams each building two wheelchairs for a total of 18 wheelchairs built. As a fun twist the event was even a bit of a competition – each team had to answer questions to get the parts and materials to put the chairs together. After being built all wheelchairs were quality tested with head-to-head races and have been donated to the non-profit organizations. Kudos to event leaders Stephanie Spence LEAD Program Manager Brian Kelly Manager Product Safety & Regulatory Compliance and Jeremy Crist Senior Value Engineer along with all event participants on finding a new way to engage with the Erie community and help those in need.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But there are some ice cream lovers in the region who claim you can actually get something better than the stuff created by Mitchell if you take a short drive northwest of Broome County.

Raymond ""Pat"" Mitchell operated his ice cream mecca at the corner of East Main Street and Vestal Avenue in Endicott for three decades before he sold the business. Mitchell died in December 2002.

During an intense discussion of ice cream quality over the summer an Endwell resident declared that the stuff being made at Cornell University Dairy Bar in Ithaca was superior to the frozen concoctions churned out by Pat Mitchell.

The assertion prompted a half-dozen ice cream aficionados to take an investigative road trip to Ithaca.

Detailed results of the unscientific review aren't being made public. Those involved in the taste test agreed the Dairy Bar ice cream was very good or excellent.

Repeated efforts to discuss the highly-praised ice cream with Cornell representatives were unsuccessful. A university media relations specialist ultimately reported ""we do not have anyone from the dairy bar that would be able to interview with you.""

A 2021 story in a Cornell alumni publication reported the ice cream was made with ""milk produced by cows residing in the Vet College teaching barn a mere quarter-mile away.""

The Dairy Bar doesn't offer as many flavors as Pat Mitchell typically did but the selection is fairly comprehensive. At last check the place also won't accept cash as payment. If you decide to conduct your own investigation be prepared.

SACRAMENTO Calif. — At ABC10 'We Stand for You' so when an Elk Grove woman told us she thought she was the target of a scam targeting Walmart shoppers we looked into it. What we found could protect you and your wallet.

“The check looked super real” said Bianca Baluyut as she showed the fake check.

Baluyut received an envelope via UPS-certified mail. In it were a check and secret shopper instructions for her next trip to Walmart.

“It looks very real and I kind of thought like wow why me? You know this is a lot of money it is for $3345. That's a pretty big win just to go shop at Walmart"" said Baluyut.

She was instructed to deposit the money in her bank then go to Walmart and take out three money orders and grade the Walmart employee on specific criteria. It was the word 'money orders' that triggered alarm bells for her.

The next day a person claiming to be a Walmart associate contacted her on her cell phone.

""I'm thinking... Walmart has my information. I do grocery pickups maybe it really is from them"" recalled Baluyut.

ABC10 contacted Walmart to notify them of the scam. A Walmart spokesperson provided us with this statement:

“Unfortunately bad actors occasionally take advantage of Walmart’s reputation to carry out these kinds of scams. Walmart never solicits mystery or secret shoppers via email mail or any other public means.”

ABC10 followed up that call to Walmart with a call to Elk Grove police. Officers said if you receive something that seems too good to be true it likely is. So when you get something like Bianca did throw it in the trash.

If Bianca fell for the scam she would have been out $3000. It would have taken a few days for the check to come back fraudulent and by then the money would have already been lost.

She is warning you to watch out for these sophisticated tactics.

“The person watching ABC10 will go 'Oh my gosh I got that same letter and thank goodness I didn't deposit it or I was thinking about depositing it. And now I won't'"" said Baluyut.

ABC10 also called and emailed the contact information on Bianca’s letter. The phone number didn’t work and ABC10 still hasn’t received a response to the email.

ABC10 did find the Wisconsin company on the check. They said their name is being hijacked. The company has reported it to its bank and insurance company but is not affiliated with Walmart in any way.

HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change.

Dad sneakers as they’ve affectionately been meme-ified are still going strong. You’ll know them by their off-the-clock look – prioritizing comfort and sensibility usually employing a puffy sole and boxy fit. Nike Monarchs and New Balance 993s are classics but the champ of this look is Hoka.



Hoka One One founded in 2009 by two footwear designers Nicolas Mermoud and Jean-Luc Diard was created with runners in mind. Thanks to the shoes’ enormous ultra-cushioned soles and legendary comfort the brand took off attracting acclaim from athletes podiatrists and celebrities. Arguably the only hitch with Hoka’s kicks is their price tag — most pairs ring in between $150 and $200.

If you’re not quite ready to pony up the cash I’ve got some good news.

Walmart Avia Hightail sneakers available at Walmart.

Clocking in just under $28 Walmart’s Avia Hightail running sneakers look uncannily like Hoka’s Clifton 8s. The Avia sneaks are available in several colors but the tonal lavender pair and navy pair with an orange gradient trim really pass the Hoka vibe test. Their seamless breathable mesh uppers and molded lightweight EVA soles go toe-to-toe with the originals too.

Online reviewers and TikTok-ers alike are raving about the stylish similarities. “I found them on TikTok before buying and heard several reviews about how comfortable they were. I had been wanting some Hoka running shoes for comfort but was not a fan of the price” wrote a reviewer named Brooklyn. “Once I purchased these I have been obsessed! They are so stylish and comfortable for ONLY $20!” Reviewer Shannon32 notes that “the style looks athletic but still fashionable these could be worn to the gym or casually. I like how plush the sole of the shoe is it allows for a softer impact when running or being active.”

With a 4.4-star rating and 123 customer reviews they’ve left most customers satisfied with their fit comfort and style. Several reviewers mentioned scooping up the shoe in more than one color. (“I’m about to get like eight more pairs” said user Lauren Watson in a recent unboxing TikTok.) Others suffering from foot pain and plantar fasciitis praised the sneaker’s supportive properties.

It’s worth noting that some reviewers admitted these much-cheaper Walmart kicks aren’t a perfect copy of their pricier counterpart. “These are a great shoe for under $30!! But for those that are thinking it’s Hoka replacement it’s not” wrote a reviewer named Mom. “The Walmart version isn’t quite as soft and cushion-y” added TikTok-er Ashley in a recent post.

However if you’re looking for a pair of cool-looking sneakers that are going to offer reviewer-approved comfort get thee to Walmart to try on these convincing dupes. Thanks to their competitive price the sneakers are selling fast so scoop up a pair for back to school a new gym routine or at $28 just to try something new.

Rebecca Campbell chairman of Disney’s international content and operations (Courtesy of Disney)

ANAHEIM California -- The Walt Disney Co. is concentrating on local content to attract more viewers worldwide for its streaming services through domestically produced stories that resonate with consumers in each market.In Asia-Pacific the global entertainment giant spent a “large” portion of its production budget on South Korea and Japan although the content from the peninsula is more popular for global audiences its executive said.“We knew we needed to invest in local content to elevate Disney as an undisputed leader for bringing the best local talent and local stories to our DTC services” said Rebecca Campbell chairman of Disney’s international content and operations referring to its streaming business.“All of this fantastic content (produced from its US-based studios) is available globally but we know that some of it doesn’t resonate as well with our local audiences as it does here in the US which is why we focus our content development on what we refer to as our ‘content whitespace’” Campbell said during Disney’s global fan event D23 Expo last week.The company has been expanding its presence in the global streaming industry with content produced by US studios including Disney Marvel and Star Wars as well as programs created by productions in other countries such as South Korean dramas and Japanese animation.Disney has been actively investing in content creation with spending for its fiscal year 2022 to end this month on content for the whole group up 32% to $33 billion on-year.That helped the entertainment behemoth accelerate local content production.“We have released 147 titles to date and by the end of the year we will have released 210 total titles across all four regions” Campbell said referring to Latin America Europe Middle East & Africa India and the rest of the Asia-Pacific.“It appears our strategy is working. We’ve been really pleased with their performance and how they’re resonating with our subscribers.”The increase in content led to growth in subscribers. The total number of all of the company’s streaming services including Disney+ and ESPN+ stood at 221.1 million as of end-June slightly higher than 220.7 million of Netflix Inc. the global streaming giant.When asked about the company’s local content investment plan Campbell said it will focus on creating “the best content for customers.”“It’s not quantity but it’s a quality game” she said as the content creation budget is limited.Campbell picked South Korean cultural products as local content that can resonate with global audiences.“K-content is well adapted globally” she said in a separate press briefing. “It also resonates in Asia. And we know that it resonates globally as well.”She said BTS the world’s top boy band is the best music content for the global market. Disney+ has been showing “BTS: Permission to Dance On Stage – LA” the seven-member group’s live performance in Los Angeles Sofi Stadium in November 2021 since Sept. 7. Disney+ plans to release more than 20 Korean-language content including 12 originals such as a drama series Casino featuring Son Sukku a star actor in Netflix's hit drama D.P. this year.Carol Choi Disney’s executive VP of original content strategy in Asia-Pacific said South Korean content is more popular than that of Japan.“I'll be quite honest compared with Japan you will see that Korean content is more widely accepted” Choi said. “When we go back to the numbers game the proportion there will be more Korean live-action series compared to Japan.”Kiyeol Seo at philos@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDM1b3JsYW5kby5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlby1vbWlub3VzLXNjdWQtY2xvdWQtc3BvdHRlZC1hdC1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtaGVyZXMtd2hhdC1hLXNjdWQtY2xvdWQtaXPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gzNW9ybGFuZG8uY29tL25ld3MvdmlkZW8tb21pbm91cy1zY3VkLWNsb3VkLXNwb3R0ZWQtYXQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtYS1zY3VkLWNsb3VkLWlzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VIDEO: Ominous 'scud cloud' spotted at Disney World.

Discovery Going to Merge With NBCUniversal?,"Mere months after the completion of the Discovery-WarnerMedia merger the newly formed mass media and entertainment conglomerate may have its sights on yet another merger.

The Hollywood Reporter reports Warner Bros. Discovery could end up merging with Comcast’s NBCUniversal though negotiations would have to wait until April 2024 to begin due to the complicated structure of the possible merger.

After all in the so-called streaming wars the only way to succeed is to be big.

Through the merger Warner Bros. Discovery instantly became one of the largest content providers in the world which includes WarnerMedia’s superb scripted content – led by awards darling HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio. This ensured the new company was not only in a position to triumph but to take on Netflix Disney Amazon and Apple for global streaming superiority.

Therefore it stands to reason merging would offer NBCUniversal the same benefits allowing Comcast CEO Brian Roberts to give the company scale and worthwhile streaming service.

“Obviously Peacock sucks” one executive with knowledge of both companies told THR. “There are some good synergies. I’m sure [Roberts] is licking his chops because the [Warner Bros. Discovery] stock is so low. And I think that’s [Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David] Zaslav’s endgame. Get the place sold.”

In response a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson stated: “We are building Warner Bros. Discovery for the long term.”

All of this of course is still early and it may not even happen.

But many senior business executives are so certain that a merger will go through that they are already grieving an occasion that might never occur the news outlet reports.

“People feel like it’s Comcast for sure” the head of one company said to THR. “It’s going to be so depressing to lose another major studio [after Disney bought Fox]. And Warners was the Tiffany studio.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vY29tY2FzdC1wdXJjaGFzZS13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktbWVyZ2UtbmJjdW5pdmVyc2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,REPORT: Comcast Wants to Buy Warner Bros.

Discovery continues to slash $50 billion in debt analysts around Hollywood are speculating the company could be setting itself up to be sold to NBCUniversal.

An article in The Hollywood Reporter by Kim Masters points to industry observers who think Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has his eye on merging NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery. ""Obviously Peacock sucks"" an exec with knowledge of both companies said. ""There are some good synergies. I'm sure [Roberts] is licking his chops because the [WBD] stock is so low. And I think that's Zaslav's endgame. Get the place sold."" A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery responded ""We are building Warner Bros. Discovery for the long term.""

It's important to note that negotiations between NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery can't take place until April 2024. This is when Comcast has the right (but not the obligation) to sell its remaining 33% of Hulu to Disney for at least $27.5 billion. Speaking September 14th at the Goldman Sachs + Technology Conference Comcast CEO Brian Roberts suggested that rather than selling their minority stake to Disney in 2024 he would be open to flipping the script and buying the streaming platform outright.

""I believe if Hulu was put up for sale Comcast would be interested [in buying it]"" Roberts said. ""So would a lot of other tech and media companies. You would have a robust auction.""

He added ""Regardless 100% value of Hulu is what we are entitled to but if it were up for sale we certainly and I think others would want to get into that opportunity. I think our position [in Hulu] is very enviable for us and our shareholders. As a company Hulu has done a spectacular job.""

Of course NBCUniversal is also the owner of the Peacock streaming service. Just think if Comcast were able to gain full control of Hulu and bring it together with Peacock. If an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery were also to happen NBCUniversal would have a catalog of content to rival Disney. Roberts' comments also appear to indicate that if he were to sell Hulu that money could then be spun to help acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3dhcm5lci1icm9zLXNvbGQtbmV3LW93bmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Warner Bros. Getting Sold AGAIN?

The Climate Action Plan adopted in 2019 provides key action items in furtherance of the City’s goals to be carbon neutral by 2050 and net-zero energy by 2030. According to the plan solid waste accounts for approximately 10 percent of the City’s GHG emissions.

The concept of zero waste goes beyond recycling and composting at the end of a product's life cycle to focus on discarded wastes as resources that can be managed in ways that preserve value minimize environmental impacts and conserve natural resources.

The City will begin collecting data to inform the creation of a Zero Waste Plan that will outline the steps to achieve Zero Waste. To gather public input regarding solid waste outputs and current waste management offerings the City today released the online Zero Waste survey.

Residents and businesses can complete the survey at www.hobokennj.gov/ZeroWasteSurvey.

Next week the City and project team will conduct a waste audit to understand the composition of Hoboken’s waste streams from household commercial and institutional sources. The data gathered in the waste audit will inform the development of policies programs and services to be recommended in the Zero Waste Plan.

The waste audit will collect samples of waste and sort those samples into multiple material categories to produce statistically representative and generalizable information about what is in the City’s waste and in what quantities. This effort will provide the baseline against which to compare future waste volumes and diversion rates and provide insight into evolving waste types.

Professionals from the City's consulting firm will conduct the waste audit on Monday Sept. 19 through Friday Sept. 23 at 200 Harrison St. Sorting will occur Monday through Friday with site set up Saturday and break down Friday. Rodent bait stations have been placed around the site perimeter and will be serviced regularly before during and after the waste sorting process.

Currently the City collects waste for household commercial and institutional properties alike with no fees or varying collection requirements for commercial properties or businesses three times per week citywide and six days per week in the limited business area. Commingled recycling is collected once per week citywide as is paper recycling. The City collects paper recycling six times per week in the limited business area.

The City also launched a free residential compost drop-off program for organic recycling which began with one drop-off site in 2019 expanded to four in 2020 and expanded to 12 in 2021.

The bric-a-brac of objects far from being a disordered mess have been carefully collected sorted and deposited into 45 individual types of waste disposal containers by the town’s residents.

“Sorting waste into 45 different categories is much more difficult than you might imagine”says Hiroshi Nakamura the architect who designed and constructed the pioneering space “but they are willing to do it.”

Built on the site of a former incinerator the center has become the centerpiece of an ambitious goal: Kamikatsu’s effort to reuse or recycle everything it produces. In doing so the town of less than 2000 people set on the Japanese island of Shikoku has become a world-leading example of how a community can eliminate waste.

For starters to earn “zero waste accreditation” all of Kamikatsu’s businesses must adhere to a strict sustainability ethos that includes training employees on reducing waste and setting measurable goals. The Kuru-kuru store (a Japanese phrase meaning “to go round and round”) provides free second-hand items such as kitchen appliances and tableware and sells old kimonos bags and toys upcycled by local artisans. A brewery produces craft beer using yuko citrus peel provided by local farmers and in turn receive spent grain from the brewery for compost. Cafe Polestar only serves organic local produce and offers discounts to customers who bring their own coffee cups. Hotel Why which was built using local cedar wood as well as discarded doors and windows welcomes tourists to experience the town’s zero-waste philosophy. Even the signs in the Zero Waste Center have been crafted from recycled materials.

“We wanted to create an architecture that would be in tune with their behavior and sensibility always thinking and acting in ways that would allow them to reuse the waste instead of throwing it away” says architect Nakamura who also used spare mortar and ceramic pieces from flooring to make plastering material.

‘Turn garbage into a resource’

Kamikatsu’s target to eliminate waste without resorting to incinerators or landfills was set in 2003 when it launched the nonprofit Zero Waste Academy and became the first municipality in Japan to make a “Zero Waste” declaration. While the town has so far fallen short of that lofty goal initially set for 2020 Kamikatsu recycled 81 percent of all its waste in 2020 according to Ministry of the Environment data up from 58.6 percent in 2008 and much greater than Japan’s national average of 20 percent.

“It’s about how we can transform right now to have a sustainable life in the future” says Akira Sakano founder and director for Zero Waste Japan and former chair of Kamikatsu’s Zero Waste Academy. “We thought of developing Kamikatsu as a model and experiment for others to learn from and follow.”

Only very few kinds of waste are now incinerated — such as PVC and disposable diapers -- but even that is being addressed. Since 2017 Kamikatsu has been giving reusable “cloth diaper starter kits” to households with infants up to the age of one.

As a result Kamikatsu has cut its spending on incineration by a third and now brings in up to three million yen (around US$21000) annually through selling recycled materials like paper or metals. Those earnings cover a very healthy proportion of the six million yen that goes towards waste management each year.

“I think Kamikatsu is a very special case” says Misuzu Asari associate professor at Kyoto University’s Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies. “Although the population is small they were blessed with enthusiastic human resources and were able to effectively receive subsidies from the national government. It shows that if you do it thoroughly you can ultimately turn garbage into a resource.”

The roots of Kamikatsu’s reuse revolution go back decades. During Japan’s postwar economic boom the expansion of mass industry created huge amounts of waste which increased from 6.2 million tons in 1955 to 43.9 million tons in 1980. In response municipalities across Japan including Kamikatsu began to build incinerators to dispose of it all. But over time concern grew about the pollution being created. “Kamikatsu’s transformation started because it couldn’t incinerate or send things to landfill anymore” says Sakano. “There had to be a shift.”

That shift took years: In 1997 the town began recycling in nine different categories and the next year that increased to 22. By 2001 Kamikatsu shut down its large incinerators and began recycling in 35 categories. It reached the current 45 categories in 2016 and the construction of the Zero Waste Center was completed in 2020.

Given that door-to-door collection would be costly -- Kamikatsu’s 55 hamlets are spread across a wide area dominated by forested mountains -- the town decided to require residents to drop off their waste at the center. Those who can’t make the trip such as elderly residents can organize pickups.

Initially the implementation was met with resistance. For some residents it was a struggle to prepare and sort trash: a plastic water bottle must be washed and stripped of its label and lid; glass must be separated by color; everything from thermometers to chopsticks and printer cartridges must be sorted. Yet over time they were won over in part thanks to the fact they are awarded points for recycling that can be exchanged for eco-friendly products. “It was tough because it changed their day-to-day duties” says Sakano. “But people got used to it.”

Beyond promoting recycling the program also encourages behavior changes. The town is working with local manufacturers to help reduce waste and advises residents to either avoid using single-use items or if necessary buy products that can be disposed of easily. The sheer effort required to deal with trash meanwhile is seen as a deterrent for excessive consumption.

Customized recycling

Since 2020 Zero Waste Japan has focused on spreading eco-friendly policies to local governments across the country. Other Japanese towns such as Minamata in Kumamoto prefecture and Ikaruga in Nara prefecture are already on board.

Now Sakano is working in Obuse a town in northwest Japan helping the municipality to implement policies to reduce waste. For example agriculture is a significant part of the local economy and through cultivating apples chestnuts and pears sometimes trees must be cut. While previously they were burned the town is trialing the use of small-scale machines to create biochar a soil enhancer that sequesters a high amount of carbon. “We try to customize the policies to each location” she says.

According to Sakano Zero Waste Japan whose work is funded either directly by municipalities and businesses or through environmental partners is necessary to scale up from Kamikatsu to all of Japan’s 1700 municipalities. “The challenges in each place will be different” she says. “I can’t go into every single one. But how to build the policy is the same: How can we reduce waste and circulate resources locally?”

These efforts overlap with the traditional Japanese concept of “mottainai” which reprimands wastefulness and espouses respect for the world’s finite resources -- an ethos that has itself been upcycled for a modern era.

“We aim to spread a lifestyle that does not burden the global environment and build a sustainable society by empowering the circular economy” says Akira Yamaguchi of the Mottainai Campaign a project launched in 2005 promoting the philosophy as well as holding flea markets symposiums and cleaning tours of Mount Fuji.

Professor Misuzu Asari says that nationwide progress has been made as recycling laws for individual products have been established thermal recycling technology advances and waste sorting improves.

But there’s a long way to go. Japan known for its hygiene-oriented culture of packaging is the second highest packaging waste producer in the world with its citizens using as many as 450 plastic shopping bags each year. Globally plastic waste generation more than doubled between 2000 and 2019 to 353 million tons.

“Nowadays there are still many things that are excessive useless and disposable” says Asari. “We need to change our mindset to reduce them. We must now steer toward the realization of a sustainable circular economy.”"

The company undertaking this trial is Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI) a subsidiary of Canadian-owned The Metals Company (TMC) which is aiming to start annually extracting 1.3 million metric tons of polymetallic nodules from the CCZ as early as 2024.

The approval for this mining test the first of its kind since the 1970s was first announced by TMC earlier this week.

Mining opponents said the ruling took them by surprise and they feared it would pave the way for exploitation to begin in the near future despite growing concerns about the safety and necessity of deep-sea mining.

On Sept. 14 the Hidden Gem — an industrial drill ship operated by a subsidiary of The Metals Company (TMC) a Canadian deep-sea mining corporation — left its port in Manzanillo Mexico. From there it headed toward the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) a vast abyssal plain in international waters of the Pacific Ocean that stretches over 4.5 million square kilometers (1.7 million square miles) across the deep sea roughly equivalent in size to half of Canada.

The goal of TMC’s expedition is to test its mining equipment that will vacuum up polymetallic nodules potato-shaped rocks formed over millions of years. The nodules contain commercially coveted minerals like cobalt nickel copper and manganese. TMC a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq exchange announced that it aims to collect 3600 metric tons of these nodules during this test period.

This operation came as a surprise to opponents of deep-sea mining mainly because of the stealth with which they said the International Seabed Authority (ISA) — the UN-affiliated intergovernmental body dually responsible for overseeing mining in international waters and for protecting the deep sea — authorized TMC to commence the trial.

It is the first such trial the ISA has authorized after years of debate over whether it should permit deep-sea mining to commence in international waters and if so under what conditions. News of the authorization did not come initially from the ISA but from TMC itself in a press release dated September 7. The ISA eventually posted its own statement on Sept. 15 more than a week after TMC’s announcement. It is not clear when the ISA granted the authorization.

“We’ve been caught off guard by this” Arlo Hemphill a senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace an organization campaigning to prevent deep-sea mining operations told Mongabay in an interview. “There’s been little time for us to react.”

Mounting concerns sudden actions

Several weeks ago in July and August delegates to the ISA met in Kingston Jamaica to discuss how when and if deep-sea mining could begin. In July 2021 discussions acquired a sense of urgency when the Pacific island state of Nauru triggered an arcane rule embedded in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that could obligate the ISA to kick-start exploitation in about two years with whatever rules are in place at the time. Nauru is the sponsor of Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI) a subsidiary of TMC that is undertaking the tests. TMC told Mongabay that it expects to apply for its exploitation license in 2023 and if approved by the ISA to begin mining towards the end of 2024.

The ISA subsequently scheduled a series of meetings to accelerate the development of mining regulations but has yet to adopt a final set of rules.

The delay is due in part to the increasing number of states and observers from civil society raising concerns about the safety and necessity of deep-sea mining. Some member states including Palau Fiji and Samoa have even called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is understood about the marine environment that companies want to exploit. Other concerns hinge upon an environmental impact statement (EIS) that NORI had to submit in order for mining to begin.

NORI submitted an initial draft of its EIS in July 2021 as per ISA requirements and an updated version in March 2022.

Matt Gianni a political and policy adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC) a group of environmental NGOs calling for NORI’s testing approval to be rescinded said that the ISA’s Legal and Technical Commission (LTC) — the organ responsible for issuing mining licenses — previously cited “serious concerns” about NORI’s EIS including the fact that it lacked baseline environmental data. The LTC had also raised concerns about the comprehensiveness of the group’s Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) he said.

But then “all of a sudden” the LTC granted approval for the mining test without first consulting ISA council members said Gianni who acts as an observer at ISA meetings.

The fact that TMC announced the decision before the ISA did “reinforces the impression that it’s the contractor and the LTC and the [ISA] secretariat that are driving the agenda and states are following along” Gianni said.

Harald Brekke chair of the LTC sent Mongabay a statement similarly worded to the recent announcement made by the ISA. He said that the LTC had reviewed NORI’s EIS and EMMP for “completeness accuracy and statistical reliability” and that an internal working group had worked closely with NORI to address concerns. In response the mining group adequately dealt with the issues which allowed the LTC to approve the proposed testing activities he said.

“This is a normal contract procedure between the [ISA] Secretary-General and the Contractor on the advice and recommendations by the [Legal and Technical] Commission” Brekke said in the emailed statement. “It is not a decision to be made by the [ISA] Council. According to the normal procedure of ISA the details of this process will be [communicated] by the Chair of the Commission to the Council at its session in November.”

“I also would like to point out that this procedure has followed the regulations and guidelines of ISA” Brekke added “which are implemented to take care of the possible environmental impacts of this kind of exploration activity.”

Yet Gianni said he did not believe the LTC had satisfactorily reviewed the EIS for its full potential of environmental impact nor had it considered the “serious harmful effects on vulnerable marine ecosystems” as required under the ISA’s own exploration regulations for polymetallic nodules.

Questions about transparency

Sandor Mulsow who worked as the director of environment and minerals at the ISA between 2013 and 2019 said that the ISA “is not fit to carry out an analysis of environmental impact assessment” and that the grounds on which the ISA authorized NORI to begin testing were questionable.

“Unfortunately the [International] Seabed Authority is pro-mining” Mulsow who now works as a professor at Universidad Austral de Chile said in an interview with Mongabay. “They’re not complying with the role of protecting the common heritage of humankind.”

A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed that the ISA gave TMC critical information over a 15-year period that allowed the company to access some of the most valuable seabed areas marked for mining giving it an unfair advantage over other contractors.

The ISA has also frequently been criticized for its lack of transparency including the fact that the LTC meets behind closed doors and provides few details about why it approves mining proposals. The ISA has previously granted dozens of exploratory mining licenses to contractors although none have yet received an exploitation license. While NORI is not technically undertaking exploratory mining in this instance their testing of mining equipment falls under exploration regulations.

Mongabay reported that transparency issues were even prominent during the ISA meetings that took place in July and August this year including restrictions on participation and limited access to key information for civil society members.

The ISA did not respond to questions posed by Mongabay instead deferring to the statement from Brekke the LTC chair.

‘Full-blown mining in test form’

During the mining trial set to take place in the CCZ — which could begin as early as next week — NORI will be testing out its nodule collector vehicles and riser systems that will draw the nodules about 3000 meters (9840 feet) from the seabed to the surface. If NORI does begin exploitation in 2024 Gianni said the risers will be pumping about 10000 metric tons of nodules up to a ship per day.

“That’s a hell of a lot” Gianni said. “This is heavy duty machinery. This is piping that has to withstand considerable pressure.”

NORI intends to extract 1.3 million metric tons of wet nodules each year in the exploitation stage of its operation TMC reported.

The Metals Company argues that this mining will provide minerals necessary to power a global shift toward clean energy. Indeed demand for such minerals is growing as nations urge consumers to take up electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change.

Mining opponents however have argued that renewable technologies like electric cars don’t actually need the minerals procured from mining.

Moreover a growing cadre of scientists have been warning against the dangers of deep-sea mining arguing that we don’t know enough about deep-sea environments to destroy them. What we do know about the deep-sea suggests that mining could have far-reaching consequences such as disturbing phytoplankton blooms at the sea’s surface introducing toxic metals into marine food webs and dispersing mining waste over long distances across the ocean — far enough to affect distant fisheries and delicate ecosystems like coral reefs and seamounts.

“Every time somebody goes and collects some sample in that area of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone there’s a new species coming up” Mulsow said. “We don’t know how to name them and we want to destroy them.”

TMC has stated that the testing activities will be monitored by “independent scientists from a dozen leading research institutions around the world.”

However Hemphill of Greenpeace who also has ISA observer status questions whether the monitoring process will be unbiased.

“We’re thinking there’s a high chance that these risers might not work” he said. “But if there’s not a third party observer out there then we just have to rely on The Metals Company’s own recording.”

“It’s going to be basically a full-blown mining operation in test form where they’re not only using the [collector] equipment but they’re using the risers to bring the nodules to the surface” Hemphill added.

Nodule collection trials like the one NORI is undertaking haven’t been conducted in the CCZ since the 1970s TMC noted in its press release.

When Mongabay reached out to TMC for further information about its operation a spokesperson for the company said that they “believe that polymetallic nodules are a compelling solution to the critical mineral supply challenges facing society in our transition away from fossil fuels.”

“While concern is justified as to the potential impacts of any source of metals — whether from land or sea — significant attention has been paid to mitigate these including by setting aside more area for protection than is under license in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean” the TMC spokesperson said.

‘No way back’

Mulsow said he was sure that this trial would pave the way for exploitation to start next year not only giving TMC’s NORI access to the deep-sea’s resources but opening the gates for other contractors to begin similar operations.

“[In June] 2023 we will have … the application for the first mining license for the deep sea” he said “and then there will be no way back.”

Hemphill said he also feared the move would set a process into motion for mining to start next year — but added that Greenpeace would continue its fight to stop mining.

“We’re not giving up just because the two-year rule comes to pass” he said. “And then if things get started we’re in this for the long haul.”

Gianni said he was hopeful that the dynamic could also change at the next ISA meeting scheduled for November in which delegates will get the chance to discuss whether they’re obligated to approve the start of mining the following year.

“The fact that the LTC has done this … may finally get council members to start saying ‘Wait a minute we need to bring this renegade fiefdom [at] the heart of the ISA structure under control” Gianni said “because they’re going off and deciding things in spite of all the reservations that are being expressed by the countries that are members of the ISA.”

Correction 16/09/2022: This article has been updated to reflect the fact that TMC does not intend to start deep-sea mining in 2023 but expects to apply for an exploitation license at that time. If approved the company says it will begin mining operations in late 2024.

For BMS the layoffs are tied to a recent acquisition.

In separate Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) alerts filed this week AbbVie and BMS let California know they plan to lay off 99 and 261 employees respectively in November.

AbbVie’s workers are being let go from a single facility in Irvine which the city’s chamber of commerce lists as an Allergan manufacturing site. AbbVie bought Allergan for $63 billion back in 2019.

AbbVie did not immediately respond to Fierce Pharma’s request for comment on the layoffs.

Moving down the coast BMS’ workforce is shrinking across two separate sites in San Diego County one of which bears the same address as Turning Point Therapeutics’ home base. BMS snapped up cancer specialist Turning Point for $4.1 billion in August.

A BMS spokesperson confirmed over email that the slim-down relates to that deal. All told 261 staffers are being let go in connection with the acquisition.

“We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics to further strengthen our leading oncology franchise” BMS’ spokesperson said. “As part of the integration all incoming employees received retention packages tied to continued service to BMS for a period of time and have been encouraged to apply to long-term roles at BMS after their retention period ends.”

Alongside the biotech industry which has suffered a spate of layoffs and restructurings this year employees at Big Pharmas have been caught in recent job-cut crossfire too.

In July reports surfaced that Biogen employed around 300 fewer people in Massachusetts than it had in September 2021. Biogen telegraphed the job cuts in March when it rolled out plans to “substantially eliminate” the commercial infrastructure for its struggling Alzheimer’s disease drug Aduhelm. Altogether the company has laid out a cost-saving target of $1 billion.

Back out west Teva Pharmaceutical is downsizing in The Golden State too. Last month the Israeli-American generics giant said it would eliminate 305 jobs at its Irvine injectables plant—located in the same city where AbbVie’s workers are set to be dismissed.

A Teva spokesperson ultimately confirmed that the “Irvine facility will not resume production and the company is either transferring or ceasing production of medicines made at the site.”

But the layoffs underway at Novartis easily eclipse all of those other cuts. The company in June unveiled plans to ax 8000 jobs worldwide on a quest to save $1 billion. During a media event in Zurich last month the Swiss pharma added that of the 1400 jobs it plans to cut in its home country up to half will be leadership roles.

We compared the past five years of publicly owned supplier storage revenues in a chart normalized to HPE’s financial quarters. It shows Micron ruling the roost with its DRAM and NAND chip products augmented by SSDs:

Micron’s revenues are so far above the other suppliers that we can remove them from the chart to get a clearer picture of the rest:

It now shows four tiers with Western Digital and Dell both above the $4 billion/quarter level outstripping a second tier of just one vendor – disk drive manufacturer Seagate at the $2.5 billion level. WD Dell and Seagate far outstrip a third tier of two suppliers; NetApp at the $1.6 billion level and HPE at the $1.1 billion point. The NetApp-HPE gap is widening as NetApp sales have outgrown those of HPE storage since 2020.

Below these three suppliers is a fourth tier with Pure Storage and Snowflake appearing to move up. We’ve isolated the fourth tier vendors in a separate chart:

All-flash array supplier Pure Storage is growing fast at 30 percent year-on-year on its latest results and so is cloud data warehouser Snowflake.

Snowflake is now the top vendor in the fourth tier. Nutanix is next some way ahead of Commvault Quantum N-able and then Backblaze.

IBM (red line) was a member of this fourth tier group but has stopped publishing its declining storage revenue numbers so has no recent data points in the chart.

Overall Micron then WD and Dell reign supreme in the storage market and will continue to do so unless something catastrophic happens. Micron banks on its DRAM NAND and SSDs being widely used. WD is bolstered by supplying both disk drives and SSDs. Dell the leading storage systems vendor is present in many storage sub-markets and leads in virtually all of them. Neither NetApp nor HPE has a hope of catching it nor the two media vendors Micron and WD or Seagate for that matter.

It is hard to predict that current revenue trends will continue – particularly in light of the current economic outlook.

Nutanix‘s last two quarters show a slowing growth rate and Nutanix could need some accelerative measures.

Overall the charts show us with the exception of Pure Storage and Snowflake a fairly static and mature storage market. We are anxious to see Acronis Cohesity Rubrik Veeam and Veritas all IPO because then we could place them on this chart as well and directly compare them with the current crop of publicly owned storage vendors.

WRK,WestRock,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE2L3doeS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXBhcGVyLXBhcGVyLXN0b2Nrcy1qdXN0LWNyYXNoZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why International Paper WestRock and Packaging Corp. Stocks All Crashed Today,"Paper companies look cheap -- and as it turns out there's a reason for that.

What happened

There was a sell-off in cardboard packaging stocks this morning with shares of International Paper (IP -3.16%) down 9.4% at 10:30 a.m. ET on Friday Packaging Corporation of America (PKG -0.54%) shares down 9.7% and the stock of WestRock (WRK -0.12%) down 9.8%.

So what

Shares of FedEx (FDX 1.40%) plunged more than 22% this morning after the company issued an earnings warning predicated on softening global volume. The volume FedEx referred to was the number of packages wrapped in cardboard and shipped to customers. And if that volume is down then it makes sense that the demand for cardboard around the world might be falling as well.

Investment bank Jefferies cut its ratings on each of the three paper stocks this morning. International Paper and Packaging Corp. both suffered actual downgrades to underperform (sell) with price targets set at $31 and $112 respectively. WestRock barely dodged the downgrade bullet being left at hold but its price target was cut 7% to $42 per share according to a report from The Fly this morning. And that's not even the bad news.

In announcing its downgrades Jefferies didn't say its decision was based exclusively (or even primarily) on FedEx's earnings warning but rather warned that there's a ""massive inventory glut"" in cardboard.

Orders for cardboard packaging are slowing down sharply the analyst says. Manufacturers like International Paper Packaging Corp. and WestRock are likely to slash prices in the fourth quarter. And because new cardboard manufacturing capacity is still coming on line Jefferies expects this situation to get worse in 2023.

Now what

That's miserable news for the paper companies and for investors who are still expecting paper profits to surge this year. Expectations are for 2022 earnings growth of 10% at International Paper 18% at WestRock and 30% at Packaging Corp. according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence with at worst modest retreats in profitability in 2023.

At present we don't know exactly how bad the damage might get only that Jefferies is expecting it to get really bad. But there's good news here too.

All three of these stocks still trade at rather modest valuations: just 11 times trailing earnings for WestRock 11.2 times for International Paper and 12.2 for Packaging Corp. And all three pay very respectable above-market dividend yields. International Paper the most recognizable name of the three has nearly the lowest P/E ratio and by far the greatest dividend yield at 4.7%.

But if I were in the market for a cardboard company and interested in taking advantage of today's sell-off to buy just one stock I think I'd go with Packaging Corporation of America. At 12.2 times earnings it's more expensive than the others but its 3.8% dividend yield is more than generous. And if hard times are coming Packaging Corp.'s $2 billion net debt load is the smallest and the easiest to manage giving it the best chance of emerging from this downturn unscathed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now more than 42 years later the Forest Service says some long-lost artifacts from the blast are starting to turn up.

This news comes from Matthew Mawhirter an archaeologist for the U.S. Forest Service and the Heritage Program Manager on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Southwest Washington. Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is managed by the Forest Service.

“Items are eroding out of the landscape around Mount St. Helens that were there pre-eruption” Mawhirter told KIRO Newsradio. “The parking lot for upper alpine climbing of Mount St. Helens is eroding out of the hill. We found logging equipment that’s eroding out of hillsides [and] other items.”

“The landscape’s starting to give back up what it covered up in the 80s” Mawhirter said.

After 42 years the reason why these artifacts are revealing themselves now is pretty simple.

“Just time and erosion because it’s all loose pumice and ash” Mawhirter said. “And so as the weather takes place especially things on slopes or these kinds of steeper areas where erosion is heavier you’re getting that kind of stuff coming out. We found another Kenworth truck eroding out of the hillside.”

The presence of logging equipment – including trucks manufactured by local favorite Kenworth – isn’t a big surprise. Most of it likely belonged to Weyerhaeuser and any trucks bulldozers and other vehicles were probably sitting empty and just parked when the mountain erupted on that otherwise quiet Sunday morning. Also some rusty hulks have been visible for years on the South Coldwater Trail.

But Matthew Mawhirter says there is at least one recently revealed item near Coldwater Ridge that relates to a specific person – someone who occupies a unique place of honor in the mystique the stories and what might be called the “regional mythology” surrounding the 1980 eruption.

“We maybe found an object associated with Gerry Martin who was killed in the blast and nothing had been found of him” Mawhirter said. “But there are other things eroding around the landscape some of them we still have to confirm.”

The name of Gerry Martin might sound familiar to anyone who remembers the 1980 eruption or who has read the many accounts in books or online. For some Martin is a member of a small but indelible trio that would also count Harry Truman of Spirit Lake Lodge and David Johnston of the U.S. Geological Survey among its members.

In 1980 Gerry Martin was in his mid-60s. He was a Navy vet and a ham radio guy from the Skagit County community of Concrete who was part of a network of volunteer hams stationed at monitoring posts circling the mountain that spring.

Martin had parked his motorhome on a ridge about eight miles north of the mountain. He could look south toward Mount St. Helens and actually see USGS volcano scientist David Johnston’s trailer two miles away – two miles closer to the mountain. David Johnston didn’t survive the blast and neither unfortunately did Gerry Martin.

However Martin did manage to calmly transmit a detailed description of the eruption for a few minutes before the radio went dead and Martin too succumbed.

In the final moments of Martin’s remarkable ham radio transmission he can be heard actually describing Johnston’s observation post being inundated by the pyroclastic flow coming from the crater.

“Gentlemen the camper and car that’s sitting over to the south of me is covered” Martin can be heard to say. Then as the static overwhelms his words Martin says “It’s going to hit me too.”

Matthew Mawhirter of the Forest Service says the artifact connected with Gerry Martin which has emerged recently from the pumice and ash is an engine block and other vehicle parts.

Mawhirter shared with KIRO Newsradio a number of images of vehicles and equipment at Mount St. Helens from before the eruption to the present including a photo of this most recent tantalizing find.

“The last photo is of the engine from Gerry’s motorhome” Mawhirter wrote in an email. “We are 98% sure” the engine belonged to Martin he continued “which is good for archaeology.”

Over the past four decades no artifacts associated with Harry Truman have ever been found at Mount St. Helens and those found which were related to David Johnston were reburied at his family’s request. Now thanks to the realities of erosion – and because of the skill and dedication of Matthew Mawhirter and his colleagues – what could have been just a big piece of metal has the potential to bear witness to and memorialize the final act of a remarkable individual caught up in one of the most momentous events in Pacific Northwest history.

Editor’s Note: After this story was posted a local Mount St. Helens researcher named Steve Rosenow reached out to say that the engine pictured in the photograph shared by Forest Service archaeologist Matthew Mawhirter is not consistent with what Mr. Rosenow knows about Martin’s motorhome. Mawhirter could not be reached for comment as he is assisting with fire suppression on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest; KIRO Newsradio will share Mr. Rosenow’s information with Mr. Mawhirter.

With National Forest Week quickly approaching the committee is promoting education and awareness about an industry that is at the core of the Nicola Valley.

National Forest Week is taking place from September 18 to 24 this year and the newest theme is “Canada’s Forests: Solutions for a Changing Climate”. In preparation for this week which looks to promote education and inform the public on the different uses and values gained from BC’s forests the Herald sat down with a number of community organizations involved in Forestry Week. The Merritt Forest Week Committee is composed of representatives from the Ministry of Forests BC Wildfire Services Stuwix Resources and Weyerhaeuser Princeton. They promote a number of educational opportunities in forestry throughout the year.

“How we’re involved is through the Merritt Forest Week Committee” said Andrea Inwards a Tenures Forester with the Ministry of Forests.

“I think the committee is over 30 years old. We do tree planting with students and we generally do the Mike Morrison Memorial Bursary for $1000. We’ve given that out for a long time and it’s given to kids of forestry industry families and they generally have to write a thousand word essay about a topic that we chose to apply.”

Applicants are asked to outline how they contribute to their communities through volunteer work and other endeavors. As the bursary is meant to be awarded to someone who embodies the community values of a past leader of the committee well known volunteer Mike Morrison the latter part of the application is very important to the committee.

In addition to the bursary the committee supports a number of learning opportunities for younger generations. In 2022 the Ministry of Forests presented to Grade 2 and 3 classes at a local school about the role of a professional forester as they have for many years teamed up with BC Wildfire Service to take Grade 5 students from all the schools in the Nicola Valley tree planting. The tree planting event is coupled with the “Grade 5 Poster Contest” where students create posters based on the current year’s National Forest Week theme. Prizes range from a week at Silver Lake Forest Education camp to passes at the local pool.

Along with programming directed at youth the committee typically hosts an annual nine hole golf tournament raising money to support local forestry initiatives. While they offer information and promote forestry to all ages the Merritt Forest Week Committee is mainly focused on raising awareness in students and youth. The committee also regularly partners up with Home Hardware and Merritt Secondary for the “Amazing 2×4 Contest” where contestants create their own design from a single piece of 2×4 lumber celebrating the versatility of forest products.

“Our mandate is to promote education in youth. We do lots of educational things like our partnership with NatureKids. Though we would like to do lots of educational things we are a small group and don’t have the manpower to do all we would like to. To help us meet our mandate we have joined forces with NatureKidsBC ” added Inwards.

“We’re located in the Merritt Timber Supply Area which has an annual allowable cut (AAC) of 1200000 m³ per year and that gives us jobs in the woods in the mills and then all the supporting industries and businesses. It is important to us that the youth understand their local natural environment and appreciate how the forest industry contributes to the lives of the people in the timber supply area.”

Inwards added that in addition to these economic benefits the forestry industry gives Merrittonians a glimpse into their heritage. Forestry along with ranching and mining is an industry that has been a mainstay in Merritt’s economy culture and daily life since the community’s inception. Through the promotion of sustainable forest management practices engagement with local First Nations and other stakeholders and support of community building events the Merritt Forest Week Committee is building a solid foundation of knowledge in the community.

Human capital is key to ESG success and strategic total rewards can be the spark that inspires employees to put their all into contributing to an organization’s ESG priorities. Astute leaders get it. Twenty-five percent of North American organizations have aligned their total rewards programs with their ESG goals and 47% more are thinking of doing the same in the next three years. The icing on the cake? Tangible actionable ESG objectives advance your employee value proposition—and help you succeed in the ongoing war for talent.

Before your organization embarks on its journey to connect total rewards with ESG it’s important to remember that organizations start from different places with different goals. Make sure your employees and business leaders are on board with your plan. Do they understand how it will impact them? Are they aware of their role and the commitment required in the coming months and years?

Here are four steps total rewards leaders can employ to encourage your entire organization to support your ESG agenda.

Step 1: Know your organization’s current ESG status

Linking ESG and total rewards begins with a deep understanding of your organization’s current ESG state. Start by answering the following questions:

What are your organization’s current ESG commitments and priorities? When were they made and why? How far along are you in fulfilling them? What is HR’s role?

When were they made and why? How far along are you in fulfilling them? What is HR’s role? What are the ESG risks to your business? Has your organization inventoried the potential ESG risks to your business? Do these risks comprehensively cover all aspects of ESG across the E S and G categories? Have these risks been quantified to understand the potential impact on your business?

Has your organization inventoried the potential ESG risks to your business? Do these risks comprehensively cover all aspects of ESG across the E S and G categories? Have these risks been quantified to understand the potential impact on your business? Do employees know about your ESG goals? Do employees understand what your organization has committed to on ESG and why? Have they bought into your ambitions? Do they feel connected to your organization’s purpose and understand the role they can play in driving change? Employee listening tools provide a better understanding of employee expectations concerns and needs related to the organization’s ESG goals and whether employees are receptive and will share in the vision.

Possible ESG-related risks

Effect of carbon emissions on human health and social inequality

Effect on reputation if ESG commitments not achieved (or too lax)

Effect of supply chain interdependency (when replacing vendors is not feasible/unsustainable)

Do your homework. Asking these questions up front will provide you with a solid footing on which to make broader connections to your total rewards strategy.

Step 2: Set your destination to optimize and align the link between ESG and total rewards

Following your assessment connections between your total rewards strategy and ESG will become apparent and expose areas where your total rewards strategy may already be sometimes unintentionally contributing to or working against ESG objectives.

For example remote and flexible work policies may align with your broader business net-zero commitments or diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) goals (e.g. research shows that remote and flexible working arrangements can help reduce air pollution by around 8% and flexible work can improve gender equity in pay and career). Or you may already have practices in place to track whether your total rewards programs are properly considering affordability for your underrepresented employee groups (including those at lower income levels). Conversely a requirement for employees to have a four-year college degree to participate in upskilling initiatives may create career inequity among underrepresented employee groups.

Consider ROI as you think about how to modify enhance or eliminate elements of a current total rewards strategy to amplify your ESG goals. Total rewards investment should be commensurate with the benefit the organization may reap from an improved ESG profile. These benefits may vary significantly depending on business factors such as industry (e.g. some are under intense pressure to produce a robust net-zero plan) business lifecycle (e.g. high-growth companies may need to prioritize other critical business and infrastructure investments) and stakeholders (e.g. some businesses have more complex stakeholder interests to balance).

We’ve found that organizations find themselves in one of the following three categories as they think about where they currently are in linking their total rewards with ESG goals and where they want to go.

Compliance-driven : When ESG actions are primarily focused on satisfying compliance requirements regulators exchange rules and/or basic investor or consumer expectations total rewards’ role is largely focused on mitigating ESG-related risks (such as pay equity and workplace misconduct) as well as reporting on specific people-related elements that drive business outcomes (such as DEI wellbeing skill development and executive incentives).

Social responsibility-driven : For companies where ESG actions are based on values and company purpose and where stakeholders proactively invest in purchase from and work at companies that share their vision total rewards’ role tends to have ownership of the Social elements of ESG and meaningful input on Environmental and Governance issues as well. Examples include total rewards programs that highlight a commitment to net-zero transition and sustainability (e.g. green benefits and employee initiatives) and total rewards communications that highlight company purpose and connection to work and people.

Examples include total rewards programs that highlight a commitment to net-zero transition and sustainability (e.g. green benefits and employee initiatives) and total rewards communications that highlight company purpose and connection to work and people. Strategy-driven: For companies where ESG is integrated into company strategy to drive both purpose and profit and where there are well-defined ties between ESG and business performance risk management and value creation total rewards has strong linkages into all three elements of the environment social and governance agenda. Examples include pay-for-performance programs for both executive and employee behaviours that support ESG commitments and aligned climate priorities with program design when implementing remote and hybrid work policies. Further total rewards leaders hold health providers risk insurers and third-party administrators (TPA) accountable for demonstrating ESG commitments in products and delivery.

Step 3: Build the bridge

“The secret to getting ahead is getting started” - Mark Twain

Immediate priorities may include leveraging employee experience platforms to clarify and promote ESG programs and policies and to help employees understand how linking total rewards to ESG can benefit them. We recommend rebranding or re-promoting elements of your total rewards strategy that already support your organization’s ESG agenda.

Longer-term priorities may include developing a plan to ensure pay equity and wellbeing programs that consider the social determinants of health. For example an employee’s financial resilience is often linked to race and gender. Or you may want to support your strategy on net-zero commitments by redesigning workspaces to be environment-friendly incentivizing employees who use energy-efficient or low-emission transportation and/or subsidizing remote workers’ home energy assessment. If you’re focused on social equality prioritize equitable total rewards like pay transparency living wage and reskilling or upskilling programs to pave equitable career paths for underrepresented talent. While more subtle total rewards can also better align with governance priorities such as a greater focus on risk management data security ethics and vendor relations.

In either case the bridge you build between total rewards and ESG should be customized to your organization taking your current ESG state into account where you are headed and the role total rewards can play in influencing this journey.

Step 4: Sustain your momentum

To sustain momentum total rewards leaders should focus on three key areas:

A consistent measurement strategy is critical to success. Metrics should go beyond surface-level data and focus on employee impact and outcomes related to pay benefits wellbeing and careers. An ongoing communication plan helps keep the entire organization aligned throughout the journey. There are various digital solutions and methods to help leaders provide employees with regular updates about ESG initiatives what it means for them and how they can participate and share feedback. Embedding ESG and company commitments into your Employee Value Proposition also strengthens the employment brand and ensures potential new talent has visibility into total rewards sustainability alignment. Most importantly celebrate wins with everyone in the organization. A thoughtful governance process helps sustain momentum. Listening to employees regularly validates progress and helps identify new opportunities to connect ESG and total rewards. Leaders will inevitably have to decide how and where to invest in total rewards programs and a proper governance approach ensures ESG linkages continue to be considered in those processes. ESG risks will continue to evolve and employers will need a mechanism to track and address these emerging risks.

Around the world many regulators investors and shareholders are calling for organizations to improve and sustain their ESG initiatives. You will need all hands on deck to accelerate your ESG commitments and sustain that momentum. By linking ESG to total rewards you recognize that employees play a vital role in helping shape your ESG priorities and you can go farther with the whole organization rallying towards the same goal. Amidst continuous shifts in global markets and talent requirements a sustained commitment to ESG objectives can give the organization a competitive edge in its human capital strategy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0d2NvLmNvbS9lbi1jbS9pbnNpZ2h0cy8yMDIyLzA5L2JyYXppbC1hcHByb3ZlZC1jaGFuZ2VzLXRvLXRoZS1sYWJvci1jb2RlLXRvLXJlZ3VsYXRlLXJlbW90ZS13b3JraW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brazil: Approved changes to the labor code to regulate remote working,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0d2NvLmNvbS9lbi1jbS9pbnNpZ2h0cy8yMDIyLzA5L2JyYXppbC1hcHByb3ZlZC1jaGFuZ2VzLXRvLXRoZS1sYWJvci1jb2RlLXRvLXJlZ3VsYXRlLXJlbW90ZS13b3JraW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000239516A0DF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

With climate change we have both a growing base of knowledge (on drivers impacts) and yet many unknowns (e.g. tipping points feedback loops and dependency on projected emissions). There is a growing recognition that all this knowledge while taken seriously is not resulting in the urgent action needed to adapt to and mitigate climate change. What is missing? The answer has more to do with psychology and culture than with science.

The ‘levee effect’ or a false sense of security

In the 18th century the Enlightenment ushered a wave of scientific progress faith in knowledge and reason and the belief that by understanding the universe humans can improve their own condition. We have this urge to rationalize categorize and quantify and we get comfort that this knowledge somehow tames the natural world.

Up to a point. Improved understanding of natural phenomena (evidenced by risk maps estimation of frequencies and severities etc.) has underpinned the development of insurance which provides a cushion against adverse events allowing individuals communities and organizations to recover and thrive after a flood or a storm.

Tremendous progress in the science of risk has improved our knowledge but has this investment in modelling quantification prediction given us a false sense of security? This is akin to the “levee effect” the paradox that the construction of a levee to protect an area from flooding might encourage owners to invest more in their property thereby increasing the potential damages in case the levee is breached.

Even one of the Enlightenment philosophers saw his optimism shaken by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami. Shortly after Voltaire wrote Candide ou l’optimisme an unrelenting satirical novel attacking the optimism of Leibniz that we live in the “best of all possible worlds.”

How can science help with the ‘unprecedented’?

The risk management and insurance professions have become very reliant on risk models and risk probabilities. Existing tooling and ways of thinking are constraining adaptation to “unprecedented” changes or events with typical responses such as:

Incremental adjustments to the frequency and severity assumptions of existing risk models for risks impacted by climate change (e.g. flood) – but what about tipping points?

Continued underestimation of compounding risks – even with the proliferation of models there are still glaring gaps and vast areas of unmodeled perils e.g. wildfire

Continued reliance on a terminology (“1 in 100-year flood”) that is misunderstood by the public and decision makers limited by historical records and statements that would need to be constantly readjusted because of other factors (e.g. growing exposure in areas at risk climate change…)

Without meaningful complementary strategic action these tweaks are akin to (well-meaning) analysis paralysis. As amusingly put by James Vaccaro member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero advisory panel “If you’re driving towards the edge of a cliff it’s probably less important to calibrate instruments that will give you an accurate reading on how far you will fall and more important to steer in a different direction”.

Risk quantification remains important to support investment and risk transfer decision-making

Risk quantification remains important to support investment and risk transfer decision-making but we should ask ourselves whether decisions can simply be based on numbers or how ethical values can be considered? For example a recent review of corporate environmental disclosures shows how reductive numbers can be simplifying a lot of nuance and complexity in the environmental social and governance (ESG) ratings awarded by rating companies.

The ‘never normal’ is the new normal

As the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis shows people naturally long for stability and the return to the “new normal.” Yet as the innovation expert Peter Hinssen argues we should instead embrace the “never normal”1 an acceptance that would promote growth mindsets flexibility and elastic innovation.2"

Wynn Resorts Ltd. is partnering with a New York real estate company to pursue one of three new downstate casino licenses in a Manhattan neighborhood.

Related Cos. and Wynn announced the agreement Thursday to develop a casino resort and entertainment area near the Javits Center on the western side of the Hudson Yards near the Hudson River. The Hudson Yards — home to the copper-colored lattice-like structure called the Vessel — is a $25 billion development by billionaire Stephen Ross’ firm Related and Oxford Properties Group.

Under the companies’ plans the project would have residences office space retail restaurants cultural institutions residences 5 acres of public plazas gardens and groves the world’s first Equinox Hotel and a 750-seat public school.

In addition Hudson Yards is within walking distance of all of the region’s major public transportation including trains and the Hudson River Ferry.

“Wynn Resorts has a long history of utilizing a compact upscale casino floor to support the creation of spectacular resort experiences that appeal to an array of guests — travelers and locals alike” Craig Billings CEO of Wynn Resorts said in a news release. “We look forward to engaging with the community to hear expectations for our development.”

Related Cos. CEO Jeff Blau said in a release that his company is looking forward to working with Wynn.

“As New York City emerges from the pandemic the Western Yards provides the ideal site for a resort that will reinvigorate our tourism economy and provide billions in tax revenues for the city and state” Blau said.

In addition Wynn Las Vegas and Encore Wynn operates three resorts in Macao and Encore Boston Harbor in Everett Massachusetts.

Several casino companies including some based in Las Vegas have expressed interest in vying for the three downstate licenses to be awarded by the state.

Other companies expected to be in the running are Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International; Las Vegas Sands Corp. which owns resort properties in Macao and Singapore; Hard Rock International owned by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe which has purchased and is rebranding The Mirage to a Hard Rock Hotel; Bally’s Corp. which next week is expected to be licensed to operate the Strip’s Tropicana Las Vegas; Malaysia-based Genting Group which operates Resorts World Las Vegas; Reno-based Caesars Entertainment Corp.; and Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming.

When New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislative leaders fast-tracked the licensing of new casinos in April they revived interest in the state’s expansion of casino gambling in one of the most densely populated areas in the country.

A New York law approved by voters in 2013 permits a total of seven casinos including the three in the New York City area. Four already have been built in upstate New York.

Sen. Joe Addabbo D-Queens who chairs the committee on racing gaming and wagering said two operators of existing casinos near New York City would likely have the inside track in the awarding of the new licenses.

Resorts World New York City operated by the Genting Group is attached to the Aqueduct Racetrack and opened in 2011 after the Legislature authorized slot machines to be allowed at racetracks in 2001.

In addition to slot machines Resorts World New York City which has a sister property Resorts World Catskills in New York has more than 6500 slots and automated table games. The new license would permit live table games.

The Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway is operated by MGM Resorts International and also has slot machines and automated tables in a racing environment.

Reading time 2:22 min

Las Vegas gambling heavyweight Wynn Resorts is teaming up with New York City real estate giant Related Companies –developer of Hudson Yards– to bid on a casino in Midtown Manhattan. The parties want to put a casino on the western half of the Hudson Yards which remains undeveloped.

The casino would be situated next to the Javits Center on the still-undeveloped western portion of Hudson Yards the second half of the largest mixed-use private real estate development in American history reports New York Times. Building the Yards’ western portion which is now a sunken train yard has been a priority not only for Related but for Gov. Kathy Hochul as well.

The bid follows April’s approval by state lawmakers of up to three full-service casinos for the New York City area. While the move set off a frenzy among gambling companies and real estate developers to pursue the opportunity Wynn’s project for Midtown Manhattan represents the first publicly announced bid for one of the new casino licenses.



Hudson Yards in Manhattan

The Wynn deal confirms longstanding rumors that Related was chasing a gaming industry partner to put its chips down in the west side yard reports New York Post. Related Company has been struggling for years to formalize plans for the undeveloped western half of Hudson Yards which would require a nearly 10-acre platform to be built above a thicket of active rail lines.

Hudson Yards’ first part featuring a luxury mall and condominiums opened in 2019. While the $25 billion development plan for residential and office towers was stalled by the pandemic a green light to build a casino and entertainment complex could kickstart the project.

The Wynn partnership could give Related’s strategy a jump on its rivals. While its competitors have pursued gaming giants such as Hard Rock and Sands no other deals have been struck thus far. SL Green Vornado Realty Trust and Thor Equities are other developers that have been identified by The Post as interested in building a casino at various sites in the Big Apple. An alleged project involves New York Mets owner Steve Cohen who is reportedly eyeing redevelopment prospects around the Citi Field stadium in Willets Points.

It will likely be several months before the casino sites are announced. The state’s Gaming Commission has until October 6 to create the Gaming Facility Location Board which will manage the application process set to launch within 90 days of its formation. The gambling regulator has to also issue a formal request for proposals.

The Related-Wynn proposal’s fate will largely depend on the willingness of local elected officials to accept a casino in Manhattan says New York Times. In order for it to proceed it would have to win approval from a yet-to-be-formed six-person community advisory committee. Mayor Eric Adams will have a representative on the committee as will the governor the local City Council member the borough president the local Assembly member and the local state senator.

“The gaming commission will decide on where these casinos will be located but we are hoping two of the three downstate casinos will be placed in New York City” said Fabien Levy a spokesman for the mayor. While Manhattan has long been considered one of the best-untapped gambling markets in the country casino bidders will likely have to overcome significant resistance convincing local residents that a casino there is in their best interests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL25ldy15b3JrLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvcmVsYXRlZC1wYXJ0bmVycy13aXRoLXd5bm4tZm9yLWh1ZHNvbi15YXJkcy1jYXNpbm8tYmlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Related Partners Wynn Resorts to Bid for Hudson Yards Casino,"UPDATED Sept. 16 2022 4:30 p.m.: Viva Manhattan.

Related Companies announced Thursday it will be partnering with Wynn Resorts in the first publicly announced bid for one of three new casino licenses open to city developers Bloomberg and the New York Times reported.

The casino would be located next to the Javits Center on the undeveloped western side of Hudson Yards the mega-development by Stephen Ross’ firm in Midtown West.

The announcement from the developer and hotel giant marks the first publicly announced bid after lawmakers in April approved up to three full-service casinos for the New York City area.

Despite an initial rush of interest from developers decisions will likely take months. The state’s gambling commission has until October to create a board that will oversee the application process which will begin within 90 days after its establishment.

The six-person advisory committee that Related and Wynn will have to win over will have representatives from Mayor Eric Adams the governor the local City Council member the borough president the local Assembly member and the local state senator.

A spokesperson for the mayor said that they are hoping two of the three downstate casinos will be placed in New York City.

The city’s only nearest available option is Resorts World facility at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens which has video slot machines but no table games. The resort and mall operator last year brought in the most gambling revenue of any casino property outside Nevada.

Related and Wynn are in good company among some of the biggest names in business interested in developing a casino within city limits.

New York Mets owner and billionaire fund manager Steve Cohen has reportedly been in talks with Hard Rock to develop a casino near Citi Field. Thor Equities hinted at building a casino on Coney Island. In an earnings call earlier this year SL Green CEO Marc Holliday said Times Square would make an ideal location for a casino.

BECKER Minn. – A massive solar project that is expected to cost at least $575 million has been approved by Minnesota utility regulators. The state Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to Thursday to allow Xcel Energy to recover costs for the new solar farm from the taxpayers.

Commissioners touted the project for its environmental benefits and an expected economic boost. The plant would help replace electricity that will be lost when Xcel shuts down its three big Sherco coal-fired power plants in Becker between the end of 2023 and 2030.

Xcel is touting Sherco Solar as the largest solar plant in the Upper Midwest and one of the largest in the country.

Xcel Energy says Sherco Solar will provide clean energy while also being the lowest-cost solar on Xcel Energy’s Upper Midwest system. The decision is expected to create at least 900 union jobs and investment in the Becker community as the Sherco coal plant is retired in the coming years.

They anticipate the project will serve as a direct replacement for most of the capacity of the first coal unit retiring at the plant. Xcel’s regional president Chris Clark thanked the city of Becker and their labor partners in supporting the solar project.

The first phase of the Sherco Solar project will be completed in 2024 and the second phase in 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvc29sYXItcG93ZXItc3RhdGlvbi1zZXQtYmVja2VyLW1pbm5lc290YS1yZWd1bGF0b3JzLWFwcHJvdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota regulators OK building massive solar power station near Becker,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvc29sYXItcG93ZXItc3RhdGlvbi1zZXQtYmVja2VyLW1pbm5lc290YS1yZWd1bGF0b3JzLWFwcHJvdmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002395166EA70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

And now Pizza Hut is getting in on the conversation with a very pointed jab at its competitor.

The Italian-style delivery chain announced its ""Italian Taco"" on the same day as T-Bell's Mexican Pizza return Food & Wine reports. Now here's where the news gets shadier. The Italian Taco is just the same pizza...folded in half.

""Feast your eyes and mouths on a hand-tossed taco shell stuffed with a classic marinara sauce mouthwatering melted mozzarella cheese and whichever fillings you choose from pepperoni to jalapenos"" a Pizza Hut representative told the outlet before admitting it's just ""a slice of pizza folded like a taco.""

If you call something a taco does that make it a taco? And if you call something pizza is it actually pizza or just a tostada with a buzzy name?

""The best part? This nearly unbelievable innovation will never run out. The Italian Taco has been here and will be here forever"" the company said. And while it all seems rather shady F&W did point out that the pair of brands are owned by the same parent company Yum! Brands. Is it beef or just a classic marketing stunt? *Sigh.*",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWVuc2hlYWx0aG1hZy5jb20vbGlmZS9hNDEyNDU1MjMva2ZjLWNoaWNrZW4tc2VjcmV0LXJlY2lwZS1yZXZlYWxlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KFC Accidentally Revealed The Top-Secret Recipe For Its Fried Chicken,"KFC has made a real thing out of how guarded a secret their recipe is for their fried chicken.

But someone got their hands on what appears to be the recipe.

the Tribune test kitchen tried the recipe and compared it with the real thing.

You know the hot shame you feel when you want to say something mean about one friend to your other friend and accidentally text ""Nancy's being such a troll"" to the person you're shit-talking? But once it's out of the box you can never put it back in? That's a little bit of how Joe Ledington nephew of Colonel Harland Sanders must be feeling right about now.

Ledington's uncle is the Colonel—as in the guy who came up with KFC's original fried chicken recipe. You might call it marketing but KFC has made a real thing out of how guarded a secret the recipe is even going as far as to sue a couple that claimed to have found a handwritten copy of the recipe.

Ledington 67 met with Chicago Tribune writer Jay Jones at the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum in Corbin Kentucky to talk about the newly restored restaurant there. Ledington brought along a family scrapbook and went through the pages reminiscing about his uncle.

Then he got to the last will and testament of his aunt which is when shit got really crazy.

Jones spotted handwriting on the back page of the will and it seemed to list a recipe. He asked Ledington if this could be the recipe.

""That is the original 11 herbs and spices that were supposed to be so secretive"" Ledington said. (He would backpedal later.)

Here's how the recipe read on the document:

11 spices — Mix with 2 cups white fl 1) 2/3 Ts salt 2) 1/2 Ts thyme 3) 1/2 Ts basil 4) 1/3 Ts oregano 5) 1 Ts celery salt 6) 1 Ts black pepper 7) 1 Ts dried mustard 8) 4 Ts paprika 9) 2 Ts garlic salt 10) 1 Ts ground ginger 11) 3 Ts white pepper

Jones followed up with Yum! Brands KFC's parent company to check on the veracity of this recipe. They didn't confirm or deny only saying ""Lots of people through the years have claimed to discover or figure out the secret recipe but no one's ever been right.""

Hmmmm OK.

Related Story KFC Is Finally Releasing Its Vegan Fried Chicken

A spokesperson then told the New York Times ""Many people have made these claims over the years and no one has been accurate — this one isn't either.""

Of course the Tribune test kitchen tried the recipe and compared it with the real thing. ""How was it? Well really good. In fact tasters agreed the test kitchen fried chicken was even better than the Colonel's"" wrote Joe Gray. And when the test kitchen added some MSG to that blend of 11 herbs and spices they had an identical match on their hands. Which I guess means that the handwritten recipe on Ledington's aunt's will isn't ""accurate"" but it's pretty much there.

So try it for yourself or ... do what I would do and hit the drive-through for some KFC fried chicken. It's way easier.",,,,,,
