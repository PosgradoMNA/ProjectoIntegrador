Andrew Abbott delivered a mixed bag in Saturday's 2-1 loss to the Orioles tossing five innings where he allowed two earned runs on seven hits striking out eight without issuing a walk.

Fantasy Impact

Despite the high strikeout count and maintaining control by not walking any batters Abbott's effort wasn't enough to secure a win dropping his record to 1-4. His season ERA slightly improved to 3.32 and his WHIP remained steady at 1.16 reflecting his ability to manage hits and prevent free passes effectively. However his elevated 4.76 FIP suggests some underlying issues that could be of concern for fantasy managers relying on him for consistent starts. Abbott's solid strikeout numbers and decent ERA are pluses but his win potential appears limited on this Reds squad impacting his overall fantasy value.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZXJpZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wc29tMDE0NjQ3OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alice Pettigrew Abbott Obituary,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

Greg Abbott speaks at Amarillo Lincoln Reagan-Dinner for re-election campaign,"Running late due to multiple plane issues Gov. Greg Abbott spoke to an enthusiastic GOP crowd at the Amarillo Lincoln-Reagan Dinner on various topics promoting his re-election campaign Friday evening at the Amarillo Civic Center.

Gov. Abbott currently has seven other GOP gubernatorial candidates attempting to unseat him as the Republican candidate in primary for the upcoming election.

From the moment Abbott rolled onto the stage he started hitting upon his touted accomplishments as governor. He boasted of his defense as attorney general defending the 10 Commandments monument located at the state capital. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court with the state prevailing 5-4 to keep the monument on state grounds. Retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was the swing vote that decided for the state.

Praising his role in expanding the economy especially in the energy sector Abbott commented that under his watch Texas now had been named the number one state for doing business every year as governor. He also stated that Texas now has the ninth-largest economy in the world.

“Together we have created an economic juggernaut in Texas” Abbott said. “We know that the true heart of business in Texas is small business. There are more people in Amarillo with jobs than at any time in history.”

Following that statement he claimed that Texas was named the best place to start a small business and pledged that he would keep Texas number one in producing new jobs if re-elected.

Without any specifics he spoke about opposing the Democratic party’s Green New Deal and how it would destroy jobs in the Texas energy sector even though the current administration is not touting many tenets of the program. Also his statement did not address the jobs that would be created in the green energy sectors.

Shifting his talking points to education Abbott then went with the current hot topic of Critical Race Theory (CRT) touting the bill that he passed that banned the teaching of this curriculum. Overall the subject has left a muddled understanding from all sides of what can be taught in schools. He said this was a product of the radical leftist agenda.

“I was shocked when I learned it was being used in the state of Texas to students as young as elementary"" Abbott stated. ""I was astonished because what the leftists are trying to teach is hostile to the United States.”

Claiming that CRT was being used in government classes and history in public schools Abbott said he banned it for those reasons. As with most claims of CRT being taught in school the governor spoke in generalities and gave no specific examples of classes using it in their curriculum other than parents had shown them passages in books that they interpreted as such.

Abbott spoke about the issues on the border and the inability of the current administration to secure the border. Pledging with him as governor Abbott said the state will build its border wall for Texas.

“Instead of sending troops to secure the border in Ukraine President Biden should send forces to secure our border Abbott said.

More:New voting rules are in effect for upcoming primaries

He touched on topics of human trafficking the importation of fentanyl and funding of police. He stated that he was pushing bills to combat human and drug trafficking.

After his speech Abbott spoke briefly with reporters.

When asked about State Sen. Kel Seliger's deposition about his party’s redistricting of Senate District 10 violating the constitution and the voting rights act Abbott pushed back his claim.

“The way the Senate drew these districts is the way they have always existed” Abbott said. “I support the redistricting and it looks like the lines will be upheld as legal.""

Seliger had stated in his declaration in January: “Having participated in the 2011 and 2013 Senate Select Redistricting Committee proceedings and having read the prior federal court decision regarding SD10 it was obvious to me that the renewed effort to dismantle SD 10 violated the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution.”

Each February the United States celebrates Black History Month. Throughout the month The Farmville Herald will highlight a few of the individuals who have done much to advance the causes of Black people in the United States.

Born just five years after the end of the Civil War Robert Sengstacke Abbott founded a weekly newspaper The Chicago Defender in1905.

Born to former slaves Abbott studied at Claflin University Hampton Institute (now known as Hampton University) and Kent Law School in Chicago.

According to the Zinn Education Project Abbott received his law degree in 1899 but was told that he was “too dark” to practice law in America.

Unfortunately Abbott found it difficult to support himself as a lawyer.

Therefore he became convinced that he could defend his people in public print better than he could in a courtroom so he took a job learning the trade as a printer at his stepfather’s newspaper.

In 1905 Abbott established The Chicago Defender. His initial investment was just 25¢ roughly $600 today.

The Defender would become the most widely circulated black newspaper in the country and was nicknamed “America’s Black Newspaper”.

It was one of only two that was published on a daily basis out of 350 Black-owned newspapers in 1966.

He sold 300 copies of the four-page booklet by going door to door visiting every barber shop poolroom drugstore and church on the South Side of Chicago.

The Defender became a national newspaper with a circulation of 250000 in 1929.

In a feature on Abbott the Noire Histoir writes that The Chicago Defender struggled for several years but eventually began to show a profit.

Initially the paper was a weekly platform for expressing the concerns and voicing the issues of African Americans in Chicago.

According to Noire Histoir expanding beyond Chicago The Chicago Defender’s confrontational and militant tone became a loud voice in the anti-lynching campaign of the post-Reconstruction Jim Crow era.

According to the Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History towards the end of his life Abbott began training his nephew John Sengstacke to take over the business.

Abbott died on Feb. 29 1940.

Today his home has been designated as a National Historical Landmark.

The Chicago Defender is still in existence and continued to be published in print form until 2019 when it became online only."

Credit: Allergan an AbbVie company. Vuity was developed by AbbVie a biopharmaceutical company based in the US. Credit: Allergan an AbbVie company. Vuity works in as less as 15 minutes and continues for up to six hours as evaluated on day 30 to improve near and intermediate vision. Credit: Allergan an AbbVie company.

Vuity™ (pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) is a once-daily prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of presbyopia commonly known as age-related blurry near vision in adults.

Vuity was developed by Allergan a subsidiary of US-based pharmaceutical company AbbVie. It is an optimised formulation of pilocarpine that is an established eye care treatment delivered utilising AbbVie’s proprietary pHast™ technology which allows the drug to quickly adapt to the physiologic pH of the tear film.

The brand name Vuity was developed in partnership with Brand Institute a pharmaceutical and healthcare-related branding agency based in the US.

The drug is available as an isotonic colourless sterile ophthalmic solution containing 1.25% (12.5mg/ml) of pilocarpine hydrochloride.

Regulatory approvals for Vuity

AbbVie submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for investigational AGN-190584 (1.25% pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) for the treatment of presbyopia in February 2021 while the approval was granted in October 2021.

Presbyopia causes and symptoms

Presbyopia is a common and progressive eye disorder that develops gradually and affects adults aged about 40 years. It impairs the eye’s ability to concentrate on close objects. The disorder affects approximately 128 million adults in the US.

In a non-presbyopic vision the shape of the transparent lens behind the iris may change and concentrate light to the retina which makes it easier to see closely placed objects while in a presbyopic eye the clear lens hardens and does not change shape as quickly making it harder to concentrate on close objects.

Symptoms of presbyopia include blurred vision and/or feeling tired while reading or doing any activity that requires near vision headaches and eye strain.

Vuity’s mechanism of action

Vuity (AGN-190584) is a cholinergic muscarinic agonist that stimulates muscarinic receptors in smooth muscles such as the iris sphincter and ciliary.

The mechanism of action involves contraction of the iris sphincter muscle which constricts the pupil to improve near and intermediate vision acuity while maintaining some pupillary responsiveness to light.

The drug also contracts the ciliary muscle which may make the eye more myopic.

Clinical trials on Vuity

The FDA’s approval for Vuity was based on the positive outcomes of two pivotal 30-day randomised double-masked vehicle-controlled phase three clinical studies named GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2.

The studies assessed the safety efficacy and tolerability of the drug for the treatment of presbyopia.

A total of 750 presbyopia patients aged between 40 and 55 years were enrolled in the studies. In both the studies patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either one drop of Vuity or placebo once daily in each eye.

The primary endpoint of the studies was the proportion of Vuity-treated patients gaining the ability to read three additional lines on a reading chart or more in mesopic (low light) high contrast binocular Distance Corrected Near Visual Acuity (DCNVA) without losing more than one line (five letters) of Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (CDVA) on the third hour of day 30 compared to the placebo.

In GEMINI-1 study 31% of patients treated with Vuity achieved the primary goals compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo.

In GEMINI-2 study 26% of patients treated with Vuity achieved the primary measure outcomes compared to 11% treated with placebo.

On day 30 the drug showed its effect in as early as 15 minutes after administration and its effect continued for up to six hours improving the near and intermediate vision without impacting distance vision.

No major adverse events were reported among the patients treated with Vuity in either of the clinical trials. Headaches and redness in the eye were the most frequent adverse effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The divergence from traditional pre-pandemic work environments instilled greater demand for cloud-based services to replace legacy on-site infrastructure. Firms are being forced to respond to this reorientation by increasing investment and IT budgets. This has turbo-charged M&A activity in the sector.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcmhldHRwb3dlci8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L2FyZS15b3UtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1lbm91Z2gtYS1oeWJyaWQtc2V0dXAtY291bGQtaGVscC15b3UtZG8tbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are You Innovative Enough?

It also provided information to help organizations block this adversary's attempts to breach their networks and asked victims to urgently report such incidents to their local FBI Cyber Squad.

The LockBit ransomware gang has been very active since September 2019 when it launched as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) with gang representatives promoting the operation providing support on Russian-language hacking forums and recruiting threat actors to breach and encrypt networks.

Two years later in June 2021 LockBit announced the LockBit 2.0 RaaS on their data leak site after ransomware actors were banned from posting on cybercrime forums [1 2].

With the relaunch the ransomware gang redesigned Tor sites and overhauled the malware adding more advanced features including the automatic encryption of devices across Windows domains via Active Directory group policies.

The gang is now also trying to remove the intermediaries by recruiting insiders to provide them with access to corporate networks via Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

In January it was discovered that LockBit also added a Linux encryptor targeting VMware ESXi servers to its toolkit.

Among the technical details on how LockBit ransomware works the FBI also revealed that the malware comes with a hidden debug window that can be activated during the infection process using the SHIFT + F1 keyboard shortcut.

Once it shows up it can be used to view real-time information on the encryption process and trach the status of user data destruction.

LockBit ransomware status window (FBI)

This week's advisory follows an alert issued by the Australian cybersecurity agency in August 2021 warning of quickly escalating LockBit ransomware attacks.

Days later Accenture a Fortune 500 company and one of the world's largest IT services and consulting firms confirmed to BleepingComputer that it was breached after LockBit threatened to leak data stolen from its network and asked for a $50 million ransom.

Two months later Accenture also disclosed a data breach in October SEC filings after ""extraction of proprietary information"" during the August attack.

Companies asked to report LockBit ransomware attacks

While the FBI didn't say what prompted this flash alert it did ask admins and cybersecurity professionals to share information on LockBit attacks targeting their companies' networks.

""The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared [including] boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses a sample ransom note communications with the threat actors Bitcoin wallet information the decryptor file and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file"" the federal agency said.

""The FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local FBI field office.

""By reporting any related information to FBI Cyber Squads you are assisting in sharing information that allows the FBI to track malicious actors and coordinate with private industry and the United States Government to prevent future intrusions and attacks.""

How to defend your network

The FBI also provides mitigations that would help defenders guard their networks against LockBit ransomware attack attempts:

Require all accounts with password logins (e.g. service account admin accounts and domain admin accounts) to have strong unique passwords

Require multi-factor authentication for all services to the extent possible

Keep all operating systems and software up to date

Remove unnecessary access to administrative shares

Use a host-based firewall to only allow connections to administrative shares via server message block (SMB) from a limited set of administrator machines

Enable protected files in the Windows Operating System to prevent unauthorized changes to critical files.

Admins can also hinder ransomware operators' network discovery efforts by taking these measures:

Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware

Identify detect and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool

Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher

Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions

Maintain offline backups of data and regularly maintain backup and restoration

Ensure all backup data is encrypted immutable and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure

Paying ransoms is frowned upon but ...

The FBI also added that it does not encourage paying ransoms and advises companies against it since it's not guaranteed that paying will protect them from future attacks or data leaks.

Moreover giving into ransomware gangs' demands further finances their operations and motivates them to target more victims. It also incentivizes other cybercrime groups to join them in conducting illegal activities.

Despite this the FBI acknowledged that a ransomware attack's fallout might force companies to consider paying ransoms to protect shareholders customers or employees. The law enforcement agency strongly recommends reporting such incidents to a local FBI field office.

Even after paying a ransom the FBI still urges to promptly report ransomware incidents as it will provide critical info that would allow law enforcement to prevent future attacks by tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable for their actions."
ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hhZHZpc29yLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzc0NTc1My9ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LXBob3Rvc2hvcC1vbi1hbmRyb2lkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Get Adobe Photoshop On Android,"Adobe’s Photoshop is one of the most famous editing apps of all time. It offers a range of photo editing features you’ll struggle to find elsewhere especially when bundled with a Creative Cloud subscription.

However the full version of Photoshop is one of the more demanding apps reflected in it only being available on desktop operating systems and iPadOS.

But what if you want you use Photoshop on a phone or other Android device? Fortunately Adobe does make a stripped-down version for mobile known as Photoshop Express.

What is Photoshop Express?

Simply put it’s Adobe’s version of Photoshop specifically for phones and other mobile devices. As well as being optimised for touch input it’s geared towards sharing images you’ve just created online.

However this is about more than just a quick edit for Instagram – Photoshop Express has plenty of tools which make it a powerful photo editing app in your pocket.

How to get started with Photoshop Express

On your Android device open the Google Play Store Search for ‘Photoshop’ and tap ‘Photoshop Express Photo Editor’. It’s usually the first result Tap ‘Install’ then open the app once it’s complete When opening the app for the first time you’ll be presented with an overview of the key Photoshop Express features. Tap ‘Next’ 10 times to get to the next section If you already have an Adobe ID use it to sign in on the next screen. Otherwise use a Google or Facebook account to login Tap ‘Continue’ to accept cookie settings then ‘OK’ and ‘Allow’ to give the app permission to access your files and photos

You’ll now see all your photos displayed in a grid. This is what you’ll be presented with each time you open the app from now on.

Is Photoshop Express free?

As you’ll have seen when following the steps above it costs nothing to download the app and sign in with your details. Indeed most of the features you’ll find on Photoshop Express are completely free to use. These cover all the basics you’d expect from photo editing software:

Apply filters

Crop photos

Resize photos

Fix perspective

Adjust exposure contrast colours saturation clarity highlights and many more elements of photos

Add text

Fix red eye

Add borders

Remove blemishes such as spots dirt or dust

Auto enhancer

Add watermark

Lens correction

Learn more about all the features available in Photoshop Express on the Adobe website.

However there is some extra functionality you’ll have to pay for:

Advanced Healing – this lets you quickly remove or clone part of an image which can be used to smooth imperfections without the photo looking artificial

Selective Editing – this allows you to isolate a specific part of the image (such as the subject in the foreground) and edit it independently of the rest of the image

Raw Photo Editing – as the name suggests you can also edit in Raw which preserves detail thanks to minimal processing after the photo is taken

Other Premium exclusives include integration with Creative Cloud (if you have an existing subscription) and cloud storage. Adobe also advertises ‘many more creative features’ but it’s not clear exactly what these are. If none of the above appeal to you the free plan is probably sufficient.

How much does Photoshop Express Premium cost?

However a Premium subscription might be worth it for you especially as it’s much more affordable than the desktop version. After a three-day free trial a year of Premium will cost you £26.49/$34.99 – that works out at £2.21/$2.92 per month. You’ll pay £5.99/$4.99 for a month’s access but there’s no free trial with this plan.

On Android the easiest way to pay is via the Google Play Store. You can cancel at any time and will only be charged until the end of that billing period.

What are the differences between Photoshop Express and full Photoshop?

As you might have noticed the features included in Photoshop Express don’t cover everything that’s available on the desktop version of Photoshop. In Adobe’s official article comparing the two it highlights two key scenarios where the full version is necessary.

First is Layers which allows you to make big changes to one element of an image without affecting anything else. For double exposure photos composites photomontages and some landscape images layers are crucial. On a more basic level it’s what we use to drop screenshots onto laptop templates for many images across the site. Photoshop Express’s Selective Editing feature just doesn’t offer the same level of control.

Its other key advantage is what Adobe calls Interoperability. Essentially the desktop version of Photoshop can seamlessly pull in information from other Creative Cloud apps be it the background for a Premiere Pro video or a magazine colour scheme from InDesign. That’s simply not possible on mobile.

While Photoshop Express is designed for smartphone photography you can easily import edits into the main Photoshop or Lightroom for further editing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhZHdyaXRlLmNvbS9hZG9iZS1mbGFzaC0xMC0xLWhlYWRpbmctYmxhY2tiZXJyeS13ZWJvcy13cC1tZWVnby1zeW1iaWFuLTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Flash 10.1 heading to Blackberry WebOS  WP MeeGO and Symbian,"Adobe today announced in a press release that the latest version of their flash product will be available on more mobile platforms shortly.

Creative use of color is also a classic storytelling technique as color can be used to elicit certain emotional responses. So making sure you’re using color effects deliberately in your video projects is important.

Adobe Premiere Pro CC has plenty of color grading tools for you to use. They allow you to adjust blacks and whites hues brightness and more. Throughout this article you’ll learn what these tools are what they’re for and how to use them to color grade in your video editing.

Table of Contents

Using Lumetri Color

For color grading in Premiere you’ll want to acquaint yourself with the Lumetri Color panel. You can find this by selecting the Color workspace at the top of Premiere. In this panel there are a few different features you can use to change the way color looks in a selected clip or clips.

Basic Correction

This feature allows you to make basic general changes to the color within your video clip. Changes you can alter include white balance tone and saturation. This is also where you can import a LUT which are pre-made color correction settings you can download and use in your project. This is a good way to fix basics like skin tones.

Creative

Under the Creative dropdown you can choose a Look or upload one. These are easy ways to make your clip look a certain way without having to deal with all the settings. These are technically also LUTs but they change more of the appearance whereas LUTs themselves tend to be a more basic color correction.

You can also change settings under Adjustments here such as faded film sharpen vibrance and saturation. You can also change the shadow and highlight tints here.

Curves

These settings may look a bit intimidating at first with the graphs but once you begin to use curves you’ll understand what they do quickly. Curves are great for making detailed edits and getting your video clip to look just the way you want.

Generally the bottom-left of the graph is where you will adjust for shadows the middle for mid-tones and the top-right for highlights. Making subtle changes may be more difficult if it’s your first time using curves so try making big changes with curves so you can see what part of your clip is being altered.

Color Wheels & Match

Here you can change the hue of shadows mid-tones and highlights as well as the intensity of these hues. You can also use the color match to match these settings to other clips in your timeline.

To do this first select the clip you want to be the reference point color-wise. Then choose another clip in your timeline to match to the reference clip and select Apply Match.

HSL Secondary

This feature can be used after completing a basic color correction. It allows for correction of a specific color instead of the image overall. First you can select a color using the eyedropper tool or choosing a color channel. Then you can adjust for hue saturation and lightness using the sliders.

You can then also denoise or blur and use the color wheel to correct the chosen color.

Vignette

If you’d like to add a vignette as a video effect there are options here to do so and you can change the settings such as the amount midpoint roundness and feathering.

Using the Lumetri Scopes

Another color grading tool you’ll want to learn how to use in Adobe Premiere is the Lumetri scopes. These are waveform graphs that show you the exact levels of lightness in your video clips. There are a few different scopes you can use in Premiere but the main ones are Parade and Vecterscope.

The Parade scope allows you to see your red green and blue waveforms within your video image right beside each other so that you can easily compare between them. The 0 on the graph denotes black and goes all the way up to 100 or completely white.

As you make changes to the colors with Lumetri tools you’ll be able to see these waveforms move according to the changes you make. The more you use this feature the easier it will be to look at the graph and understand how it translates onto your image.

Another important scope to know about is the Vectorscope. This is a circular scope which shows you which parts of the color wheel your selected video image falls on. It also shows the amount of saturation in your video. More vivid colors will fall further from the center of the wheel while black and white images will be dead center.

Tutorial for Importing and Using LUTs

LUTs are an easy way to give your project an overall basic color correction or adjustment without messing with the Lumetri Color settings yourself. To use LUTs you’ll first want to find some to download online. You can find both free or premium LUTs it’s up to you which ones you choose. Just make sure to download them from a reputable source.

Once you have LUTs downloaded follow these steps to use one in Premiere:

1. Go to Lumetri Color > Basic Correction > Input LUT.

2. Click on the dropdown and select Browse.

3. In the file explorer find the LUT you wish to use and select it. It will then be applied to your clip.

A LUT can be used as a jumping-off point for further color correction and color grading. Simply adding a LUT to your clips and stopping there may make your color look inconsistent as the LUT will not look the same on every clip depending on the original lighting and coloring of the clips. So after adding a LUT you’ll want to go through your clips and color correct from there so that there aren’t any inconsistencies.

When Should You Color Grade?

You may be wondering at what point in the video editing process you should start to think about color grading. Truthfully you could begin at any point while editing but it’s better workflow-wise to only color grade after all your clip edits are finished and set in stone.

This is especially true if you’re editing LOG footage or the desaturated neutral footage many professional cameras shoot. This will require much more color grading work to achieve a finished look and you won’t want to have to make massive back steps if you need to change something like the clip order or length.

So make sure your footage is completely edited the way you want it to be before starting color work. It should be one of the very final steps in your editing workflow.

Color Grading in Adobe Premiere For a Better Video

Premiere is one of the best programs you can use to color grade footage as it has a wide range of color tools available for this purpose. Whether you just need some basic correction or want to give your video a creative makeover the tools outlined above will help you achieve it in your own video production.",,,

The Deadpool actor tends to have a comedic and somewhat snarky persona online and he and Lively love to tease each other. But this photo is just pure joy. In the picture Reynolds stands on the beach in matching blue pajamas holding a white mug and smiling like it is the best day of his life. He's wearing sunglasses and seems to be looking off across the shore — or possibly at Lively. Behind him is blue sky and idyllic white clouds.

The only thing written in the caption is the camera emoji and his wife's Instagram handle giving her credit for the sweet pic.

This year will see the couple's 11th anniversary and they are reportedly going strong. In November of 2021 Reynolds told Entertainment Tonight that he and Lively work very hard to maintain their relationship and the key is actually a deep friendship.

“We don’t take each other too seriously but we're also friends” he said. “Falling in love is great but do you like each other? That's kinda the question you gotta ask yourself you know going into it. We've always liked each other. We grow together. We learn from each other. So yeah I'm lucky to have a buddy in that.”

A month later Reynolds announced he'd be taking a break from acting to spend more time with his family. In an interview with LinkedIn News Senior Editor at Large Jessi Hempel Reynolds said he's focusing on other types of projects and his kids.

“I want my kids to have a pretty normal schedule” he explained. “For many years when my wife Blake would shoot a film I would not shoot a film and I would be with the kids and vice versa. So we would sort of trade off. We never really worked at the same time. But always we were away. So the kids were away too.”

He continued “Now that they're in school they have a somewhat normal schedule. I think it's totally important for their development and I really enjoy being a present dad. I love taking them to school in the morning I love picking them up.”

Anne Hathaway kicked off press for her upcoming Apple TV+ miniseries “WeCrashed” in style this week.

More from Footwear News

The “Locked Down” star shared her first press look on Instagram featuring a dazzling purple Valentino dress. The knee-length number featured a velvety bodice with a sheer skirt and 3/4-length sleeves. The ensemble gained dramatic flair from a waist-high slit as well as long fringe cascading from its sleeves and hem. The piece was complete with sparkly sequin accents for a burst of sleek glamour.

“@appletvplus #WeCrashed press kick off!” Hathaway captioned the photo complete with purple heart emojis.

When it came to shoes Hathaway went bold in a pair of Gianvito Rossi heels. The “Ocean’s 8” star elevated her look with a set of the brand’s $612 Gianvito pointed-toe pumps which featured glossy patent leather uppers in a dynamic red hue. Hathaway’s footwear was complete with towering 4.5-inch stiletto heels giving her look a slick finish. The pumps complemented her sparkling dress with their similarly dark color while making a punchy statement all their own.

Pointed-toe pumps like Hathaway’s add a sleek twist to any outfit ranging from dresses to jeans. The style’s popularity stems from its sharp pointed-toe silhouette as well as daring stiletto heels. Newer styles by Badgley Mischka Kurt Geiger and Nina have given pairs added punch from vibrant colors glitter and crystal embellishments. In addition to Hathaway stars like Manolo Blahnik Magda Butrym and Jennifer Lopez have worn sleek pumps by Dua Lipa Rachel Brosnahan and Casadei in recent weeks. The actress is no stranger to bold heels herself; in fact she recently shared a photo in a pair of towering Giuseppe Zanotti platform boots complete with new bangs reminiscent of her iconic “The Devil Wears Prada” character Andrea Sachs.

The boots fit Hathaway’s penchant for strong shoe statements which she’s made on and off the red carpet. The Oscar-winning actress regularly wears bright pumps and sandals from brands like Tom Ford Jimmy Choo Charlotte Olympia and more. Her off-duty rotation usually veers towards clean casual footwear: Valentino and Chanel flats Nike sneakers and a variety of pointed-toe black leather loafers are regularly on rotation.

As someone who has been publicly online for her adult life Barbie said that she feels the pressure “of being this person who ‘loves themselves.'"" She continued “It’s so funny that people just assume that. What — did I say that? I never said that. You guys just say that. You posted that on me.""

“It’s not radical for me to be wearing a crop top” she continued “[Comments like those are] just backhanded compliments. I’ve been doing this since I was 16. I’m 25.”

Despite her many inspirations and ideas for her own style Barbie says that shopping ""is the ultimate logistical stress.""

The Xtreme Couture trainer saw his student get his hand raised in the middleweight matchup with Jack Hermansson but not before one judge scored the fight against Strickland (25-3 MMA 12-3 UFC) making for a puzzling split decision result.

Although the other two judges managed to get it right Sal D’Amato turned in a dissenting scorecard 48-47 in favor of Hermansson (22-7 MMA 9-5 UFC). The reaction was a widespread confusion about how he could see the fight that way.

Nicksick doesn’t understand either. He criticized D’Amato in the aftermath of the event and cited MMADecisions.com (an site that tracks media scoring) where not a single outlet had the fight for Hermansson (via Twitter):

Not even one media member scored it for Jack. I know we won but if this guy is still judging he will continue to make egregious decisions and ultimately cost fighters their careers and livelihood. #fireSal pic.twitter.com/g70PizTsuO — Eric Nicksick (@Eric_XCMMA) February 6 2022

Not even one media member scored it for Jack. I know we won but if this guy is still judging he will continue to make egregious decisions and ultimately cost fighters their careers and livelihood. #fireSal

D’Amato is one of the most commonly used judges in the sport especially given the volume of UFC events that take place in Las Vegas like UFC Fight Night 200 did. It’s not the first time he’s turned in a controversial scorecard.

The Nevada State Athletic Commission has used D’Amato’s services for years. But Nicksick made it obvious he’s seen enough of him and stumped for D’Amato to lose his position to make way for someone else.

In November I spoke at a peaceful conference held by an organization that is deemed a “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League. The title of my talk was “Race Immigration and Con. Inc: How I Came to See the Light.” It was a wide-ranging discussion of my three decades of reporting on the nation’s demographic and cultural deterioration — which I’ve chronicled firsthand on college campuses at our borders and in every crime-ridden riot-prone and mass migration-transformed metropolis from Los Angeles to Seattle and Portland to Baltimore Washington D.C. New York and Denver.

As I’ve done throughout my career I lambasted both Swamp Democrats and establishment Republicans for selling us out. The speech delved into the K-20 metastasis of anti-white curriculum the corporate media’s whitewashing of black-on-Asian attacks and the long campaign to censor nationalist dissidents who put America first. A week after my talk San Francisco-based Airbnb notified me that I was banned from using its services ever again and imperiously deleted my account. Poof!

“My name’s Cedar and I’m with Airbnb’s Trust team” the Nov. 24 2021 email began. “It has come to our attention that you were a keynote speaker for the 2021 American Renaissance Conference earlier this month in Tennessee. Airbnb’s community policies prohibit people who are members of or actively associate with known hate groups. Due to your promotion and participation in a known white nationalist and white supremacist conference we have determined that we will remove your account from Airbnb. This is consistent with action we’ve taken to ban people associated with this conference in past years.”

Airbnb’s ideological witch hunts have claimed an unknown number of victims since 2016 as part of a woke company initiative to root out “bias” and expel anyone deemed an “extremist” with a “dangerous organization affiliation.” Press coverage of previous purges strongly suggests that the aforementioned character assassins of the Southern Poverty Law Center are involved through use of their far left anti-white anti-right “Hatewatch” list. Ever since I wrote my first book “Invasion” in 2002 the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League goons have sought to stifle my voice.

But this latest salvo crosses the line. It’s not enough that I — a “woman of color” (the left’s own descriptive label not mine) and mother of two multiracial children — was pronounced guilty of “hate” crimes and “promotion” of “white supremacist” ideas for delivering a speech whose full content Airbnb didn’t even bother to obtain from me. The Airbnb bullies also banned my equally nonviolent nonhateful husband — who did not attend the conference and who is not a public figure or activist.

Welcome to Guilt By Secondary Association.

“As we can see that your Airbnb travels are typically reserved via your husband’s account” Airbnb’s “Trust team” member “Cedar” told both my husband and me “We will also proceed in removing his account.” Neither of us had ever had a negative review complaint or policy violation of any kind. Are my kids next? Are yours? (Surprise: No response from Airbnb to my media inquiries on how many other family members of banned conservative and nationalist Airbnb customers have been swept into their thought police dragnet.)

“Cedar” closed his/her email by informing me that the only way to appeal Airbnb’s decision is “(i)f our understanding that you participated in the 2021 American Renaissance Conference is incorrect.”

Take note: You’re damned right I spoke peacefully and lawfully to the peaceful and lawful 2021 American Renaissance Conference and was honored to receive a warm welcome.

I resoundingly reject the notion that condemning Black Lives Matter and antifa terrorists constitutes “hate.” I defy the Airbnb thought police who consider my husband and me “untrustworthy” and “dangerous” threats to community safety on par with convicted felons and sex traffickers. God willing and with my readers’ and viewers’ help I will fight these speech-stifling bigots who think they can get away with retaliating against me and my family for my journalism and activism.

I’ve received feedback from astute lawyers who note that public accommodation businesses in California where Airbnb is based are subject to the Unruh Civil Rights Act — which forbids the very kind of anti-free-speech anti-free-association and anti-equal housing discrimination Airbnb has visited upon me and my family. Much more is at stake of course and there are other sound legal grounds for seeking relief.

As American Renaissance founder Jared Taylor told me this week: “Once again in what used to be known as the ‘land of the free and the home of the brave’ Big Tech is punishing people for what they say. After it gets finished with vaccine freethinkers election skeptics and people who think all lives matter who’s going to be left? Democrat toadies?”

America First Foundation president and America First Political Action Conference founder Nick Fuentes targeted by the feds investigated by Dems and deplatformed by a multitude of woke businesses for his peaceful political advocacy added: “Every day the list of digital services engaged in discrimination against Patriotic Americans grows longer. Deplatforming on Airbnb marks a chilling escalation in tactics used by Big Tech to silence American conservatives.”

Cancel culture has reached a new escalation and I don’t plan on rolling over. Never have. Never will. I’ve raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for other patriots and heroes over the past 30 years. Now I’m asking readers and viewers for help to fight my own battle — which of course is yours as well. Visit fundly.com/michellefightsairbnb to join the cause. It’s a time for choosing: Defiance over compliance.

The new rules are aimed at stopping large parties which Airbnb said it is also working to prevent. Read more

One house had a closet ripped out to make room for a DJ station. Others had raucous rooftop parties until the wee hours of the morning keeping the neighbors awake with loud music and fireworks leaving trash and bottles of booze in their wake. Another was the site of a nonfatal shooting with neighbors tracing the explosive fight to a dispute with party guests.

The houses rented out on Airbnb are seen by many residents as a blight on their neighborhood causing noise issues excessive litter and — in the worst cases — sometimes violent and unruly behavior.

In an effort to stem the tide of unauthorized house parties Philadelphia City Council passed a bill that will take effect in April and will require property owners who rent their homes through Airbnb and other rental marketplace apps to get short-term rental licenses. The bill will work alongside an Airbnb policy in place since summer 2020 that blocks or redirects people under 25 who attempt to book houses.

While some city officials and residents welcome these policies others see it as another obstacle for local businesses that thrive off of tourism and for people who rely on short-term rentals for income particularly during the pandemic.

According to proprietary data released last week Airbnb blocked or redirected around 12500 people under 25 from booking Philadelphia houses in 2021 a system they say is geared toward stopping parties. Anyone under 25 without enough positive reviews on Airbnb is unable to book an entire household in their area.

In neighboring New Jersey the system blocked or redirected approximately 10000 people from doing the same last year.

The “anti-party system” as Airbnb calls it came as a response to reports from neighbors of rental homes that consistently had noise or nuisance complaints said Ben Breit an Airbnb spokesperson. While Airbnb has a forum for neighbors to report issues the system was meant to prevent these “problem houses” from continuing to operate.

“With a party house we’re talking about a home where we’re getting calls weekend after weekend where it just appears to be a chronic problem with the actual property itself” said Breit. “Maybe the host is allowing parties or maybe the host isn’t doing enough to stop them.”

Kevin Devine a Point Breeze resident said he’s heard loud music coming right into his bedroom on many late nights and early mornings. A house directly across from his would have rooftop parties that lined up with his room.

“They would have parties and since the house has a roof deck the 2 a.m. blasting music would stream directly into my third-floor master bedroom” said Devine. “One party must have had 100 to 150 people Solo cups beer cans and bottles being thrown everywhere littering the alley.”

Devine reported the address to Airbnb but was told it wasn’t one of their listed properties. Devine then found the owner who told him directly he was renting via Airbnb.

Nina Smithe and her partner dealt with similar issues in Point Breeze when they moved into their rental home in October 2020.

“We didn’t have any issues really until late spring and all summer when people started renting out the home for parties” Smithe said. “Almost every other weekend we were woken up to screaming and raging from the roof deck and even out front at 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. Sometimes fireworks. We noticed trash being left on our side that consisted of old balloons and massive amounts of empty booze containers.”

Like Devine Smithe had trouble getting in touch with the property owner and Airbnb.

The city does not currently have data on issues with short-term rentals said Karen Guss a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Licenses and Inspections.

It was a lack of accountability and regulation coupled with resident reports of noise and nuisance issues at these homes that led City Councilmember Mark Squilla to introduce legislation last February.

“Starting about three years ago we started getting more and more complaints about nuisance properties and at the time not realizing that they were short-term rentals” said Squilla. “If they are a nuisance how would we go about citing them? We realized we had nothing that would be able to remove them from the short-term market.”

The bill which passed in June will require those who offer their primary residences as short-term rentals to own the properties or have written permission from the owner. The properties will be treated as businesses by the city and will be required to get free commercial activity licenses as well as proposed limited lodging operator licenses for $150 per year.

Under the new measure anyone who rents a home also must use licensed booking agents and adhere to local zoning requirements. If a property owner opts not to acquire the license they can still use the property for long-term rentals said Squilla.

For some residents the measure is just another mark against city residents who have taken to short-term rentals as alternate income.

Mitchell Nase a Point Breeze resident said party homes are the exception and most Airbnbs aren’t a problem.

“Making new laws and placing stricter requirements for Airbnb businesses in the city clearly benefits hotels and hurts small landlords or Airbnb managers” Nase said. “Those who are hosting the parties are not going to follow the regulations anyway so it won’t actually solve the problem but it will make it harder for people who do follow the rules to stay in business.”

Airbnb’s system is meant to find and filter out the proverbial bad apples said Breit.

“You can make rules all day long but we’re obviously realistic that even if the overwhelming majority of our guests are good people who are traveling for the right reasons — and they absolutely are — it’s those needles in the haystack with those who don’t care about the rules and seek to circumvent them that we need to focus on” said Breit.

With just months before the city’s measures take effect and the busy summer season Squilla assured residents that the policy was in place for the right reasons.

“This is not something to shut down a market” Squilla said. “It’s just saying ‘You have to comply with regulations being put in place.’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzNmNTUzYTI5LTg5YWYtNGQxMC1hZjM2LWRkMjdiNmFiMWYzONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Westminster council calls for curbs on Airbnb-style lets,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

For around $100 a night I stayed in a tiny home in Miami that I found on Airbnb to see if the lifestyle seemed right for me.

At 250 square feet the home was half the size of my apartment.

Dr. Philip Baldeo who the city said created an illegal Airbnb at 156 West 15th St. and ignored thousands in fines forced the unnamed 44-year-old handyman to work until he became too ill to carry on according to a Manhattan Federal Court lawsuit.

The handyman identified only as John Doe in court papers claims he met Baldeo in 2018 and was offered maintenance work at the doctor’s properties.

Baldeo paid the man just $200 a week but pledged to help him with his immigration papers and to pay for his diabetes medications according to legal papers.

Instead the family physician forced John Doe to “work 24 hours a day 7 days a week” threatened to call immigration authorities if he didn’t and required him to live “on the first floor of the building near a front window to provide overnight security” the handyman charges.

The worker claims Baldeo forced him to keep living at 156 West 15th St. even after the city slapped a stop-work order on the property.

Baldeo allegedly assaulted the handyman when he wasn’t happy with his work according to the lawsuit.

Baldeo was indicted in August on labor trafficking and coercion charges pleaded not guilty and released according to court records. The case is ongoing. He faces two to seven years in prison if convicted on the top charge.

The worker claims he was “too scared” to tell authorities about the arrangement and only revealed it after he became too sick to work in early 2021 and was hospitalized with COVID-19.

The man is seeking unspecified damages. Baldeo’s lawyer Richard Levitt declined to comment."

Good horse stock helped the world go ‘round for farmers and village-folk alike.

Lillian Gentry Kessler Bondurant was born during the winter of 1901 in Mint Springs Valley west of Crozet. Imprinted on her earliest memories were names of some of the Gentry family’s horses and the vital roles they performed.

“My Poppa John William Gentry [Sr.] was born in Crozet Albemarle County in 1854” she said in memoirs she recorded for her family in the 1980s. “I remember him telling some of his remembrances of the Civil War when he would take the horses up in the mountains to hide them when there were rumors the Yankees might pass near the farm. He was approximately ten years old then. Can you imagine having an experience similar to this?

“Grandpa [James Cornelius Gentry] rode on a white horse named Dandy. Poppa bought a horse from Grandpa sometime in their early farming days after he and Momma were married. He was going to pay for that horse as the crops came in. One time the harvest wasn’t very good and Poppa’s payments fell behind. There were some rough times along with the smooth times in those early days.”

Crozet like any up-and-coming railroad town worth its dot on the map had blacksmiths and liveries. At the blacksmith and wheelwright shops of J.P. Huckstep James G. Klise Presley E. Williams and James T. Woodson (the community garages of their day) one could have horses shod plus harnesses and equipment repaired or fabricated.

Liverymen Levi P. Maupin John H. Moomau and Ernest L. Sandridge maintained saddle horses and teams as well as buggies carriages and wagons to lease. Additionally one could hire a driver through their establishments. At the livery stables those departing from town by rail could arrange short-term board for their horses. E.L. Sandridge’s business also sold hay and mill feed.

On Main Street where Crozet’s Modern Barber Shop is located William H. Rogers operated a funeral parlor. A stable in the back sheltered his horses and provided safe dry parking for that business’s horse-drawn hearse.

“We walked the mile to school if the weather was good” said Lillian. “But if we had rain or snow Poppa took us to school in the buggy. We had a top buggy and an open buggy. That’s what we called them. If we were going to be out in the buggy long enough that we might get real cold then a lap robe was a necessity. Traveling slowly in a buggy that was likely to happen even if we were going just a short distance.

“Sometimes in real cold weather Momma would warm a couple of bricks in the oven wrap them in a piece of old blanket and put them on the floor of the buggy to warm our feet and warm our bottoms too if we sat on the floor in the buggy as sister Louise and I often did. We rode backwards of course leaning against the dashboard with our legs stretched out under the buggy seat cozy and warm. Some may not understand the need for a dashboard on a buggy which was a shiny leather-like board as a protection from the rain or mud or dust that was kicked up by the clip-clop of the horse’s feet. There was a socket attached to the dashboard on the driver’s side which held a buggy whip in case old Logan or Bessie seemed to be getting a little drowsy with the monotonous sound of their hooves on the road and needed a little urging with a light flip of the whip.

“During the school session each year there was great excitement when the teacher would come to our house to spend the night. One of our teachers always rode horseback to school sidesaddle. When she rode up to our house and came in she would take off her riding skirt which was a full skirt of real heavy material that covered her clothes and came down over her shoes to protect her and her clothes from the mud and the dust that was stirred up from the road.

“Another exciting time was after we’d had a spell of real cold weather. We had a freshwater pond near the house that was not only a source of fish for our table and in winter ice for the ice house but also a place for skating parties when the thermometer plunged and the ice was thick.

“We didn’t go out very much at night in the country but some of the young people didn’t mind going home from the skating party after dark snug in a buggy with your girl or your beau with a side curtain snapped in place and the lap robe tucked around your feet and your legs. The girls were already protected from the cold by long heavy skirts and underskirts and more than likely a flannel petticoat and long drawers of course. How the girls ever skated in such an outfit is hard to imagine. But looking feminine and looking pretty and appearing to be just a little bit helpless was just as important as being able to skate.

“Young people didn’t have cars so we went for walks or we sat in the porch swing with our date or out under the apple tree in the yard. One party is very clear to my memory when my date hired a horse and buggy from the livery stable to take me to a party on a winter night. There was snow on the ground a full moon in the sky the horse blowing puffs of steam from its nostrils into the cold air and a big warm lap robe to keep out the chill.

“Coming home from church one Sunday driving to their house ahead of us Aunt Lelia suddenly got out of her carriage ran back to Poppa’s carriage waving her arms and calling out in a shrill voice ‘Automobile’s coming! Automobile’s coming!’ An automobile had stopped just a little distance ahead. The driver got out of his car and patiently led the frightened horses past that outlandish machine. As he was ready to go on his way Aunt Lelia called out to him ‘I’ll be glad when these things go out of the country!’ The man called back ‘Lady I think they are here to stay.’”

The crash happened about 6:20 a.m. on southbound Highway 69 at Green Street.

When emergency responders arrived everyone in the home as well as the semi driver were safe although two people taken to a hospital by Belleville Area EMS for injuries that weren’t considered life-threatening Belleville Fire Department spokesperson Lt. Jake Myrland said in a statement.

Fuel from the semi and items contained in a utility trailer were leaking in the house. The semi also damaged the natural gas meter to the house so the gas was shut off Myrland said.

Agencies that assisted in the response include the Madison Fire Department Heavy Urban Rescue Team We Energies Alliant Energy the Wisconsin State Patrol and Belleville Public Works Department. A recovery team from Disch Auto also worked to pull the semi from the house Myrland said.

Authorities said they were working to determine the cause of the crash.

The integrated social media monitoring alerts you about hacked accounts watches over your retirement plans and student loans throws in $500000 in theft insurance (for both expenses and reimbursements) and also lost wallet assistance. In summary all of the typical features are here along with a few extras.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Our series on identity theft protection apps will evaluate the features pricing options competition and also the overall value of using each app. However these are not full hands-on reviews since evaluating identity theft protection apps is almost impossible. It would require several months of testing purposefully hacking accounts to see if the protection app works handing over personally identifiable information performing multiple credit checks and risking exposure of the reviewer’s personally identifiable information.

It happens suddenly when you least expect it. Imagine this scenario: you visit the ATM to deposit your check only to discover your account is inaccessible. You then check your Twitter feed and then notice someone has taken control of the account and is sharing links to your followers to malware sites. You then visit the bank sit down in a comfy chair with your banker and she gives you the bad news on why the loan was denied - your credit is in shambles.

Identity theft is really one of those unfortunate sinking feelings experiences in life and it often feels like where do you start to attempt to restore your good name. Fortunately a trusted brand in insurance (yes that Allstate with the “Good hands” ads) offers an identity theft protection app with some unique added features we haven’t seen in other products.

Allstate Identity Protection includes some nice alerts such as true social media monitoring (you get an alert if the account gets hacked) $500000 in insurance protection (although some other options offer $1 million) and even covers other accounts such as student loans and retirement accounts. While it’s not the most powerful identity theft app out there the price makes it a good deal as it would be a worthwhile app even at a higher monthly fee.

Plans and pricing

Allstate Identity Protection offers two plans for individuals: the Essentials plan for $9.99 per month and the Premier plan at $17.99 per month. The two plans differ in that for the Essentials plan there’s only $50000 in stolen funds reimbursement and $50000 for expenses related to fraud. (Allstate Identity Protection distinguishes between the two - so it’s $100000 total.) With the Premier plan those amounts go up to $500000 in stolen funds reimbursement and $500000 for fraud-related expenses (for $1 million total - matching the amount we’ve seen with other identity theft apps). Also the Premier Plan has some more features such as social media monitoring priority member support to get you to the top of the queue when you call and credit card transaction monitoring.

For a family plan you can choose either the Essentials plan for families ($18.99/month) or the Premier plan for families ($34.99/month). All the plans have a 30-day trial and we did not find a discount for paying annually.

The Essentials plan also doesn’t include tax fraud refund advance protection or enhanced financial monitoring. Although not specifically mentioned on their website all plans include credit monitoring but there’s no mention of how many credit bureaus are involved or if you receive an actual credit score on a monthly or annual basis.

Interface

We really hope that you like the color blue a lot. Allstate leans heavily on a deep shade of blue throughout their website and in the Allstate Identity Protection app. One more time we’re seeing a no frills approach with an interface that has more than a passing resemblance to TurboTax. Easily visible are categories like credit monitoring Dark Web monitoring and alerts for your finances.

Meanwhile the mobile app focuses heavily on alerts with questions posed about transactions that are possibly suspicious. We’d rather see the wizards and status indicators of apps such as Norton LifeLock as they breeze you through these identity protection issues and protections in a method that’s easier to follow especially for a novice.

Features

Overall Allstate Identity Protection covers all of the basics. The most essential is there’s a way to monitor your credit along with alerts regarding unusual financial activity. Also users can monitor the Dark Web to locate their personally identifiable information that’s being used fraudulently.

A unique attribute found here is that some other identity theft protection apps will monitor your own social media feeds and flag inappropriate discussions for example swearing drug references or criminal behavior. However Allstate Identity Protection takes it a step further and alerts the user that you’ve been hacked. You can then investigate the issue and take action to retake control of your accounts.

The competition

There are certainly some products in this identity protection sector that are extremely affordable including Complete ID (at a cost of $8.99 per month for Costco Executive members) and Zander Identity Theft (at a cost of $6.75 per month when you pay for the entire year up front).

Allstate Identity Protection was previously free until January 1 2021 but even now after the free period has ended the app is still worth considering due to the added monitoring features and insurance. However our top pick in the field remains Norton LifeLock.

Final verdict

If your main goal is choosing the best identity theft protection app available without taking into account the cost then Allstate Identity Protection falls short as the best pick. However from a value proposition and factoring in the added monitoring for social media and the Dark Web and the identity theft insurance Allstate Identity Protection is more than compelling.

At the end of the day though it’s not as powerful or useful as Norton LifeLock or IdentityForce. Still a choice for this product is a smart decision even to take a test drive and see if identity theft protection makes sense for you. That said Allstate Identity Protection remains an attractive pick at the level of features offered for this price point.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9nb29nbGUtZXhwbG9yaW5nLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tcHJvZHVjdHMtY2VvLXNoYXJlcy13ZWIzLXN0cmF0ZWdpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Exploring Blockchain Products — CEO Shares Web3 Strategies – Featured Bitcoin News,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA1LzMtcmVhc29ucy10by1idXktYWxwaGFiZXQtc3RvY2stYmVmb3JlLWl0cy1zdG9jay1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Stock Before Its Stock Split,"This cash-generating king has more than one trick up its sleeve.

Alphabet (GOOG 0.50%) has proven quarter after quarter why it is one of the best businesses on Earth. The Google search engine YouTube and Google Cloud parent company has a nearly $2 trillion market cap making it the third-largest company in the U.S.

During its fourth-quarter earnings report issued on Feb. 1 Alphabet announced an astounding $75 billion in revenue for the quarter and $257 billion for the entire year. These mind-boggling numbers become even crazier when the 32% quarterly and 41% annual year-over-year growth rates are accounted for.

Still these fantastic results were overshadowed by management's announcement to split the stock 20-for-one. The nearly $3000 stock will begin trading for around $150 after the Fourth of July holiday in 2022. While a stock split does not affect the business stocks often do well after announcing a split -- just look at Tesla's and Apple's performances during August 2020 after each company announced a split.

Despite this potential catalyst I believe there are three stronger reasons investors should consider buying shares now.

1. Cash stockpiles and generation

As of Dec. 31 2021 Alphabet had a jaw-dropping $139.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet and a mere $14.9 billion in debt. Having a war chest sitting around enables Alphabet to purchase whatever it wants. During its Q4 conference call CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned looking into a blockchain solution for Web3 (which could fuel the metaverse). Alphabet may go shopping for a company to fulfill this desire -- and can make it happen with its resources.

Should Alphabet blow even half its cash on an acquisition investors shouldn't fear; Alphabet will just generate more next year. Throughout 2021 Alphabet converted $67 billion of its $257 billion in revenue into free cash flow. If it doesn't spend its money on acquisitions management may repurchase more stock -- they repurchased $50 billion throughout 2021. Regardless of what management decides Alphabet's cash hoard and generation make it a fantastic investment.

2. The sun is starting to shine through Google's Cloud

In the battle for cloud computing supremacy Google has not overcome Amazon Web Services' and Microsoft Azure's leads. However Google Cloud is far from a lackluster segment. During Q4 its quarterly revenue grew 45% year over year to $5.5 billion and increased at a 47% clip throughout 2021. While Google Cloud still lost $890 million much can be attributed to costs associated with expanding server infrastructure -- showing Alphabet hasn't given up on its cloud offering.

Although Google Cloud may never overtake Azure or AWS the deals Alphabet saw during Q4 should give investors hope. Management cited ""backlog increasing 70% to $51 billion most of which can be attributed to Google Cloud"" during its Q4 conference call. Additionally it saw 80% growth in deal volume and a 65% increase in deals over $1 billion. Google Cloud is picking up steam and investors should consider owning Alphabet's stock because of it.

3. Google and YouTube are category leaders

Alphabet owns two businesses with an insane market share in their respective categories.

Segment Market Share Google Search Engine 86% YouTube 76%

Because of their dominance advertisers spend heavily on these platforms.

Segment Q4 2021 Revenue YOY Growth Google Search $43.3 Billion 36% YouTube Ads $8.6 Billion 25%

Altogether Alphabet's advertising segment brought in $61.2 billion and grew 33% with its Google Network division added in. These numbers lap 2020 COVID-suppressed revenue and growth numbers will not be as impressive throughout 2022. But advertising is not going away anytime soon.

Combined with its ""Google other"" segment its services division ran at a 37% operating margin and remained the only profitable segment within Alphabet. Advertisements keep the lights on at Alphabet headquarters and with two premium advertisement platforms investors should be confident in these two segments' futures.

Alphabet is trading at an attractive 26 times earnings -- not too shabby for a company with 32% revenue growth.

The stock isn't anywhere near its valuation peak even though it is close to setting all-time highs. And that should ease fears about buying a stock with inflated valuations as 26 times earnings is nowhere near expensive for the company.

Alphabet is a strong buy regardless of which way investors view the stock. Those who hold onto the stock for three to five years will reap the benefits of a stock split potential stock buybacks an acquisition or two and a lot of cash generated. Alphabet is a no-brainer stock. Even though it is near its all-time high investors of all backgrounds could find a place for Alphabet in their portfolios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL2lzLW1ldGEtdHVybmluZy1pbnRvLWEtdmFsdWUtc3RvY2stYWZ0ZXItY3Jhc2gvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkzNzgzMzguY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvaXMtbWV0YS10dXJuaW5nLWludG8tYS12YWx1ZS1zdG9jay1hZnRlci1jcmFzaC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkzNzgzMzguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Meta turning into a value stock after crash?,"You Might Also Like: Amazon surges to add $135 billion in wild market value swing

Amazon's shares jumped after the company reported better-than-expected profits late on Thursday and said it was hiking the price of its annual U.S. Prime subscriptions by 17%.

Amazon's surge comes a day after Meta Platforms' stock market value plunged more than $200 billion in the biggest single-day loss for a U.S. company after the social media giant issued a dismal forecast.

On Tuesday Cruise said that SoftBank Group Corp will invest another $1.35 billion in anticipation of Cruise launching commercial robo-taxi operations. Cruise needs one permit from California's Public Utilities Commission to start charging for rides around San Francisco in vehicles with no human driver.

Cruise Tesla Alphabet Inc's Waymo and Aurora Innovation Inc are among many companies aiming to deploy fully autonomous vehicle technology in the United States within the next two to three years whether or not federal regulators give them a clear legal framework for doing so. Autonomous vehicle (AV) startups and automakers are under pressure to start generating revenue from billions of dollars of engineering investment over the past decade.

Proposed legislation to create a national framework of rules to govern autonomous vehicles remains stalled in Congress despite the industry's lobbying. That has left autonomous vehicle companies free to deploy robo-taxis or self-driving trucks in some states such as Arizona and Texas but not in others. Waymo has provided thousands of rides in driverless robo-taxis in Phoenix though the service remains limited.

""Providing guard rails is helpful at the federal level"" said Chris Urmson chief executive of automated vehicle technology company Aurora Innovation. ""Today we have different regulations across the 50 states.""

Aurora is testing its Aurora Driver in Class 8 trucks but so far cannot operate those trucks in California without human drivers. That cuts off a potentially rich market for autonomous truck companies hauling loads from Southern California to distribution hubs to the east.

""We look at the Port of Los Angeles ... and the supply-chain challenges we see. There's a real urgency for this technology"" to address the shortage of truck drivers Urmson said to an audience at the Washington Auto Show last month.

AV industry lobbyist Ariel Wolf told a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Tuesday that autonomous trucks ""will not lead to mass layoffs."" Instead he said autonomous trucks driving long-haul routes will allow human drivers to ""spend more nights in their own beds instead of in the sleeper berth of a truck.""

Protecting Jobs

Unions however urged Congress to be skeptical.

""We are at risk ... of losing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing and frontline transportation jobs if Congress fails to act decisively and the AV industry is left completely unregulated"" Transport Workers Union President John Samuelsen told the House panel Tuesday.

Unions and trial lawyers also want autonomous vehicle companies to disclose more data about accidents and other aspects of their systems.

""All workers deserve to know that an autonomous vehicle or bot traveling next to them is safe enough to share the same road or worksite"" said Teamsters official Doug Bloch.

In the absence of new laws tailored to automated vehicles the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which oversees vehicle safety in the United States has put forward voluntary guidelines and last year required companies to report accidents involving automated driving systems.

But the agency has not issued comprehensive standards for robot-driven cars or trucks. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has the power to review new technology before it is used in aircraft. But motor vehicle manufacturers are free to certify for themselves that a feature is safe. The NHTSA steps in if new features turn out to be a safety hazard.

NHTSA officials have intensified scrutiny of Tesla's automated driving systems over the past year. The agency on Tuesday said it had pressed Tesla to change a feature of its Full Self Driving or FSD an automated driving system that allowed vehicles to keep moving through stop signs rather than come to a complete halt. So-called rolling stops are illegal.

In December NHTSA opened a review of a feature that allowed Tesla models to play videos over dashboard screens and last August opened a formal investigation of the Autopilot driver assistance systems in 765000 U.S. vehicles after a series of incidents in which Teslas collided with emergency vehicles.

Still Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk made no mention of regulatory concerns during an investor call on Jan. 26 when he said the company could soon use an over-the-air software download to enable its vehicles to drive themselves and be used to offer autonomous ride services.

""I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer than a human this year"" Musk said. When Tesla enables its vehicles to drive autonomously via an over-the-air software download Musk said vehicle owners could offer rides that would ""cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.""

One potential path for the industry and safety advocates involves voluntary agreements on standards said David Harkey president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety a vehicle safety research organization backed by the insurance industry. Harkey said the IIHS could be part of such an effort.

""We have to get to the point where it's not the Wild West"" he said.

Amazon's stock price remains down around 15% from its record high close of $3731.41 in July.

On Tuesday Cruise said that SoftBank Group Corp will invest another $1.35 billion in anticipation of Cruise launching commercial robo-taxi operations. Cruise needs one permit from California's Public Utilities Commission to start charging for rides around San Francisco in vehicles with no human driver.

Cruise Tesla Alphabet Inc's Waymo and Aurora Innovation Inc are among many companies aiming to deploy fully autonomous vehicle technology in the United States within the next two to three years whether or not federal regulators give them a clear legal framework for doing so. Autonomous vehicle (AV) startups and automakers are under pressure to start generating revenue from billions of dollars of engineering investment over the past decade.

Proposed legislation to create a national framework of rules to govern autonomous vehicles remains stalled in Congress despite the industry's lobbying. That has left autonomous vehicle companies free to deploy robo-taxis or self-driving trucks in some states such as Arizona and Texas but not in others. Waymo has provided thousands of rides in driverless robo-taxis in Phoenix though the service remains limited.

""Providing guard rails is helpful at the federal level"" said Chris Urmson chief executive of automated vehicle technology company Aurora Innovation. ""Today we have different regulations across the 50 states.""

Aurora is testing its Aurora Driver in Class 8 trucks but so far cannot operate those trucks in California without human drivers. That cuts off a potentially rich market for autonomous truck companies hauling loads from Southern California to distribution hubs to the east.

""We look at the Port of Los Angeles ... and the supply-chain challenges we see. There's a real urgency for this technology"" to address the shortage of truck drivers Urmson said to an audience at the Washington Auto Show last month.

AV industry lobbyist Ariel Wolf told a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Tuesday that autonomous trucks ""will not lead to mass layoffs."" Instead he said autonomous trucks driving long-haul routes will allow human drivers to ""spend more nights in their own beds instead of in the sleeper berth of a truck.""

Protecting Jobs

Unions however urged Congress to be skeptical.

""We are at risk ... of losing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing and frontline transportation jobs if Congress fails to act decisively and the AV industry is left completely unregulated"" Transport Workers Union President John Samuelsen told the House panel Tuesday.

Unions and trial lawyers also want autonomous vehicle companies to disclose more data about accidents and other aspects of their systems.

""All workers deserve to know that an autonomous vehicle or bot traveling next to them is safe enough to share the same road or worksite"" said Teamsters official Doug Bloch.

In the absence of new laws tailored to automated vehicles the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which oversees vehicle safety in the United States has put forward voluntary guidelines and last year required companies to report accidents involving automated driving systems.

But the agency has not issued comprehensive standards for robot-driven cars or trucks. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has the power to review new technology before it is used in aircraft. But motor vehicle manufacturers are free to certify for themselves that a feature is safe. The NHTSA steps in if new features turn out to be a safety hazard.

NHTSA officials have intensified scrutiny of Tesla's automated driving systems over the past year. The agency on Tuesday said it had pressed Tesla to change a feature of its Full Self Driving or FSD an automated driving system that allowed vehicles to keep moving through stop signs rather than come to a complete halt. So-called rolling stops are illegal.

In December NHTSA opened a review of a feature that allowed Tesla models to play videos over dashboard screens and last August opened a formal investigation of the Autopilot driver assistance systems in 765000 U.S. vehicles after a series of incidents in which Teslas collided with emergency vehicles.

Still Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk made no mention of regulatory concerns during an investor call on Jan. 26 when he said the company could soon use an over-the-air software download to enable its vehicles to drive themselves and be used to offer autonomous ride services.

""I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer than a human this year"" Musk said. When Tesla enables its vehicles to drive autonomously via an over-the-air software download Musk said vehicle owners could offer rides that would ""cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.""

One potential path for the industry and safety advocates involves voluntary agreements on standards said David Harkey president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety a vehicle safety research organization backed by the insurance industry. Harkey said the IIHS could be part of such an effort.

""We have to get to the point where it's not the Wild West"" he said.

(I’ve been trying to forget all this. Really.)I have never received a penny or a product from any vendor on amazon (or anywhere else .)In January or so (not gonna look at my large file on the history of this) I innocently wrote a review for a product that I of course had bought and used. I liked writing reviews because I love writing and I always tried to make my reviews entertaining but helpful since I used to rely so heavily on reviews when I was deciding whether to buy or not.So on that fateful day back in January (or whenever) I got my first “something suspicious in your account…..until we blah blah blah…. you can’t review on amazon anymore.”I took it very personally. I also began a two or three month journey of emailing or calling whoever I was told to email or call or whoever I could think of to do the same. In return I got form letter responses and/or directions to chase my tail down one black hole after another.I finally got an email “We’ve reviewed your account and there’s nothing fishy going on. Go on you crazy kid and go back to your reviewing ways.” I’m paraphrasing of course. Went to post a review and of course same angry red lined box - “no reviews for you Missy. If you have questions fill out this form(which you’ve already done two or three times) and send it to amazoncircularfile@hahaha.com .”Again I filled out form wrote emails made phone calls - nothing.I also am not allowed to ask questions about products I might be interested in buying. You know what I mean - questions about the fabric of a dress for example. If I try I get another red lined box telling me that “questions have to conform to community guidelines and your question of “Can you tell me if thie fabric of this dress is blah blah blah…” didn’t adhere to community guidelines so you can’t even ask a question.”In the meantime I get many emails weekly from vendors asking me to please post a review of their product that I’ve bought; they’re a small business reviews mean so much etc. And I feel like this is where the bots collide. If i’ve been banned from reviewingwhy does amazon pass along these requests for me to review by vendors? Don’t they know I’m some sort of nefarious hosebag who can’t be trusted to write five sentences about something I bought for one of my children?Sorry to be so vague. My father in laws funeral is tomorrow I feel like our dogs saved up all their shedded hair for months and now have dumped it on our bed and I don’t want to go back and relive all the pointless black holes I’ve been sent down and the continuous trashing of what I thought was a little more then a minor contribution to other potential buyers as I was a very passionate review reader myself.So even though I’ve been cleared - I haven’t been and even though I receive weekly requests from vendors to review a product Ive purchased - I can’t help them because I can no longer review anyones product on amazon.Sorry to sound so stupid. It’s the dog hair.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzIvNC8yMjkxODU5Ni9wZWxvdG9uLWFtYXpvbi1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1ydW1vci1maXRuZXNzLWJpa2Utd2VhcmFibGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon named as possible Peloton buyer in a suspiciously well-timed rumor,"Peloton’s no-good-very-bad downfall from its pandemic peak — losing over $20 billion in value since November and becoming a dangerous subplot in prime time TV — has attracted speculation that the connected fitness company is a target to be acquired but by whom? A Friday evening report from the Wall Street Journal tosses out Amazon as one of the “potential suitors” that may be considering a deal — just as markets closed for the weekend and only a few days before Peloton issues its Q2 2022 earnings report on February 8th. Just the suggestion caused a spike in Peloton’s stock price sending it up 20–30 percent in after-hours trading.

Peloton’s yo-yoing fortunes over the last two years have been well documented but combine the deep-pocketed tech giants trying to enhance their health and fitness portfolios and the reality of re-opening gyms there are some dots to connect. Over the last few weeks some reports have suggested Apple as a possible landing spot but that seems unlikely.

But KBC which was founded in 2016 is no longer just a handful of deal-makers working out of a WeWork near Amazon’s South Lake Union headquarters quietly tasked with growing the e-commerce giant's distribution network. The secretive firm has hired scores of high-level real estate professionals across the country signaling that its ambitions are to become something much greater than just Amazon’s broker of choice.

KBC Advisors has grown its ranks while it helped Amazon expand its logistics network.

Five years ago KBC had a headcount of roughly a dozen people based in one city but today it has more than 130 employees. It has hired more than 115 people since the start of 2019 alone according to a Bisnow analysis of employee LinkedIn pages. It opened offices in Atlanta Dallas and Nashville in 2020 sources told Bisnow before launching four new outfits last year alone: in New Jersey Chicago Phoenix and San Francisco.

Over the last three years it has hired at least 18 people from CBRE 13 people from Cushman & Wakefield and 11 people from JLL. Many of the hires were high-level brokers or executives at their previous firms including CBRE’s Philadelphia market leader an Avison Young principal a Cushman & Wakefield executive managing director and a JLL executive vice president.

The company’s growth has been fueled by the rapid expansion of Amazon’s logistics network. The tech giant leases more than 280M SF of industrial space across North America and industrial brokers and developers say KBC is typically involved any time Amazon builds or leases a warehouse.

“The first call you make when you have a new project is Amazon” said an industrial broker at a national firm who requested anonymity to talk about the e-commerce giant. “Except when you call Amazon you get KBC.”

But having the sector’s largest tenant as its client appears to no longer be enough for KBC. Recent hires and property listings indicate that the company is adding new clients and business lines which could become critical to sustaining KBC’s growth — its cash cow is getting set to slow down.

Amazon will start to “moderate” its physical warehouse investments Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call last week a move it says matches the slowing pace of growth of the underlying business.

“KBC is at the mercy of Amazon’s decisions. So if they’re not doing deals and if you own KBC wouldn’t you start looking at other stuff too?” said a source who has done business with KBC and spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I think KBC is also always going to have Amazon’s business but I think to be at the mercy of one client I think they want to get ahead of it if things slow down or change.”

Bisnow spoke to 11 industrial market sources for this story including brokers and developers across the country. Many of them chose to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of working with Amazon which often requires confidentiality agreements from its partners on real estate deals.

Bisnow also reached out to more than two dozen KBC employees who have joined the firm over the last three years but none agreed to participate in an interview. A KBC executive who runs the firm’s communications efforts declined to comment for this story.

The company doesn’t appear to have ever spoken publicly about its growth strategy but its website sheds some light on its philosophy.

“Many people remark how KBC is uncommonly different” the firm’s Careers page reads. “We’re proud of that. Long ago we traded bureaucracy for something much better. The chance to disrupt and revolutionize an industry.”

Industrial professionals have held largely positive views of KBC and its presence in the market given that the firm helped developers and their brokers land Amazon and the reliable revenue and increased value that comes with having the tech giant as a tenant. But that could change as KBC expands more into other business lines and begins competing more with other brokerage firms for talent and deals.

“They could become a force in the industry” a prominent industrial developer told Bisnow. “KBC is leaning toward becoming a full brokerage company who does all the services. Basically in competition to CBRE JLL and the others.”

Inside KBC’s Growth

KBC was founded in 2016 by John Hanson and Todd Meldahl but the duo had been working on Amazon’s industrial real estate strategy long before launching the firm.

The relationship between the brokers and the tech giant began in the late 1990s when Hanson was at CBRE and one of his colleagues at the firm Rick Diedrich left to join Amazon Insider reported last month. Diedrich then brought on Hanson to help scale up the company’s industrial footprint.

Hanson maintained Amazon as a client through the 2000s as he left CBRE to work for Trammell Crow and then Cushman & Wakefield according to a 2017 report by the Puget Sound Business Journal. Meldahl joined Hanson’s team at C&W in 2007 and the two then left to launch KBC in 2016. They were joined by several other C&W colleagues and as of September 2017 KBC had 13 employees operating out of a WeWork near Amazon’s headquarters the PSBJ reported at the time.

But the assignment of expanding Amazon’s industrial real estate footprint has for years been a rapidly growing job. The e-commerce giant added 100M SF of logistics space in 2020 alone to bring its portfolio to 285M SF across North America. It doubled its spending on its network last year it said in its earnings report last week outlaying $30B between leases and build-to-suit developments.

Amazon controls more than twice as much warehouse space as its closest competitor Walmart according to CoStar. Behind all of that growth is KBC development sources who spoke to Bisnow confirmed — it is involved in virtually all of Amazon’s logistics deals negotiating for leases developments and acquisitions on behalf of the behemoth.

“They do every single industrial deal with Amazon throughout the country and Canada” said a source who has done business with KBC. The source added that KBC even has dedicated brokers who lease parking lots for Amazon’s delivery vehicles. “There’s not a deal that would go by that they’re not involved.”

You would hardly know it if you were tracking Amazon’s deals in the press.

KBC’s name has been mentioned publicly on Amazon deals in only a handful of instances: It was connected to Amazon’s 1M SF lease at DFW Commerce Center in Dallas a 250K SF lease at Victoria Station in Sonoma California and a 125K SF lease in Loveland Colorado all in 2020 as well as Amazon’s 470K SF lease at Lakewood Logistics Center II in Colorado last year.

“They’re sort of like the Keyser Söze of real estate right now. When Amazon comes to a market no one dares say it’s an Amazon deal because they’ve got heavy nondisclosures” said MK Asset Management principal Hugh Williams a Chicago-based industrial broker. “Everyone knows it’s an Amazon deal. It’s a very interesting thing that when Amazon is doing a deal people know it’s Amazon but they’re not allowed to say the name. I think there’s a fear of Amazon in some ways.”

One of the many Amazon distribution centers that have popped up in major cities across the U.S.

In cities where KBC doesn’t have on-the-ground staff the secretive firm will partner with local brokers multiple sources said. Industry insiders say the finger-to-lips approach has to do with the level of intelligence KBC has from working with the biggest occupier in the industry which also happens to be a notoriously data-driven company.

“They likely don’t want to tout what they’re up to because they are operating ahead of the curve so they do fly below the radar” said Chesapeake Real Estate Group principal Matt Laraway a Maryland industrial developer who said he has worked with KBC on around five deals. “When they come to work with us they’re usually several steps ahead of their competition more well-informed and ready to go.”

KBC’s Hiring Spree

As Amazon’s logistics network has grown exponentially in the last three years so has its industrial broker of choice.

Five years after it had roughly a dozen staffers KBC’s website lists 126 employees on its “team” page. Insider reported its headcount has reached 160 people as of last month and a Bisnow review of LinkedIn pages found that more than 130 people list KBC as their employer on LinkedIn 117 of whom have joined the company since the start of 2019.

The hiring binge has happened stealthily over the last three years — KBC doesn’t issue press releases with announcements of major hires which is common practice at other brokerage firms.

These new employees have come to KBC with a variety of specialties including leasing acquisitions debt origination data research valuation accounting property conversions and geographic information systems mapping according to their LinkedIn profiles.

“They're out in the marketplace and they're trying to steal as many brokers as possible” said an industrial broker at a firm that has seen multiple departures to KBC. “They're poaching people left and right. And to be totally honest I don't understand what even their business model is going to be. And I don't know if they're quite clear yet.”

Many of these hires have come from the nation’s three largest commercial real estate services firms.

CBRE has lost 18 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including high-level professionals such as Adam Mullen the firm’s former Philadelphia market leader and Ryan Keiser a former Dallas-based executive vice president.

Cushman & Wakefield has lost 13 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including a four-person New Jersey-based leasing team — former Executive Managing Director Jason Goldman Executive Managing Director Marc Petrella Managing Director Michael Kimmell and Director Andrew Siemsen — plus former Southern California-based Senior Director Ryan Bos.

JLL has lost 11 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including former Nashville-based Executive Vice President Bo Fulk former managing director and Western U.S. head of industrial capital markets Bo Mills and former Los Angeles-based Managing Director Tony Muscio (who was in JLL’s hotels group).

CBRE Cushman & Wakefield and JLL all declined to comment on the departures.

KBC’s hires have been focused around its headquarters and the largest industrial markets in the country over the last three years according to employee LinkedIn pages. It has hired 50 people in Seattle 14 in Dallas nine in Atlanta seven in Los Angeles and six each in New Jersey and Nashville.

“They’ve picked up some of the best professionals in the country” Laraway said. “They have attracted best-in-class talent market-to-market.”

Bisnow spoke with two industrial brokers in different parts of the U.S. who have been approached over the past three years to work at KBC. The firm pitched to one of them the depth and richness of its data compared to global brokerage firms and data quality is a big factor for brokers in considering places of employment the broker said.

“These big firms the JLL the CBs are constantly touting their big data” the broker said. “I think [KBC is] well aware of how important that is to brokers.”

The office building converted from a former bottling plant where KBC maintains its Seattle office.

KBC’s ability to hire top-level talent away from the largest firms in commercial real estate signals to some industry insiders that it is offering generous compensation packages. The brokers who had discussions about working for KBC said the conversations were preliminary and compensation wasn’t discussed.

“I can tell you there’s no executive managing director from a big firm who’s going to go from one firm to another without significant financial upside they just don’t do it” Williams said. “So that alone tells me that there’s got to be a compensation model there that’s unique because it’s hard to get a group of people like that to leave.”

But even brokers working for firms that have been harvested by KBC and have seen their industry bend to Amazon’s will said they have had positive interactions with the brokerage firm.

“They’re great guys those KBC guys. They treated me overly fair” Cushman & Wakefield Senior Director Gordon Benedict told Bisnow. “I think you’ll be hard-pressed to find anybody that says anything bad about them.”

‘Are They Competitors Or Are They Friends?’

There are more than 120000 commercial real estate outfits in the U.S. with a combined annual revenue of $112B according to research firm Dun & Bradstreet. But there are few built like KBC.

“I don't know anyone [who] can look at the landscape and say ‘You know what the market needs? Another brokerage firm’” one Southeast-based broker said. “But they have Amazon in their back pocket.”

KBC is one of a few industrial-focused brokerage shops with national reach and its access to Amazon’s wealth of data could give it an edge in a crowded competitive market if it wants it.

“They have talent. Having that client as your customer is such a big hammer” one landlord told Bisnow. “Everybody wants to do business with them. A lot of the big landlords are going to give you listings because they’re going to want to be in your good graces.”

KBC’s run of notable hires has many speculating about the future of the Seattle firm and whether that future will remain tied to Amazon. Many of the brokers KBC has hired have books of business and years of relationships they brought with them.

“I think when you build your business I don’t want to say on the back of but in relationship with one client one of the things it does is it gives you confidence” said Wendy Berger the CEO of Chicago-based industrial developer WBS Equities.

Berger founded WBS in 2004 developing food storage facilities for Arbor Investments. Her business has diversified since then although Arbor still accounts for some 70% of WBS revenue. While Berger said she is unfamiliar with KBC it makes sense that the firm would look to add other customers outside of Amazon.

“Maybe [KBC is] saying they know they've had this amazing momentum now we need to build off of it” she said. “When you build your business on one client you're not focused on the external factors you're focused on your client.”

On its website KBC lists four main lines of business: capital markets agency leasing tenant representation and site selection. It has beefed up each of these divisions with its wave of hires.

The Prologis-owned warehouse in Hayward California that KBC has on its listings page.

The firm has a property listings page where it highlights industrial properties that KBC brokers are marketing for lease across the country. The page features 59 total listings across the U.S. including 28 in the Seattle market 10 around San Francisco 10 in New York and New Jersey and six near Nashville.

It is marketing buildings for national landlords many of whom have leased millions of square feet to Amazon including Prologis Black Creek Group Principal Nicola Wealth Management Duke Realty Velocis and CenterPoint Properties.

“They’re seeing every single site around the country and Amazon’s not taking every single site so why not approach that owner and try to lease it for them?” said a source who has done business with KBC.

“They are doing more deals with all these national industrial companies — Panattoni Seefried Ryan Hillwood — these guys are doing so many deals with them it’s like why not start an agency leasing and go rep Panattoni or Ryan? They’re doing so many deals with those guys those guys need to hire brokers as well. So it’s a perfect marriage.”

In at least a handful of publicly reported projects KBC was engaged in real estate deals that didn’t involve Amazon. The firm filed permits last year to begin construction on a $1.5M 350K SF warehouse in DeSoto Texas according to the Dallas Morning News. In December KBC's Goldman and Himmel — two former C&W brokers — helped sell a 13500 SF warehouse in New Jersey to an epoxy company.

KBC has infused itself with both capital markets and development acumen in the past couple of years. Multiple sources noted that KBC’s hire of Mills the former JLL leader as its president of capital markets suggests KBC is aggressively looking to list more just than Amazon-leased warehouses.

“Are they trying to become a national brokerage firm? We’ve seen them ask for listings. Been told they’re doing brokerage work for other people” one Mid-Atlantic industrial developer said. ""Are they trying to create an independent brokerage shop that handles not only Amazon but everything else? Or are they trying to milk this for everything they can?""

The skill sets KBC has acquired along with its access to a treasure trove of site selection and real estate data amassed by Amazon over the years means the firm “could become a force in the industry” someday soon one national developer told Bisnow.

“I think there are a lot of questions: Are they competitors or are they friends?"" a Chicago-area broker said. “I think people are still trying to figure that out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2JleW9uZC1yaXZpYW4tYW1hem9uLWhhcy1hLXNsZXctb2YtZXYtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtZm9yLWEtZ29vZC1yZWFzb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Makes a Big Bet on Rivian But That's Not Its Only EV Play,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/beyond-rivian-amazon-has-a-slew-of-ev-investments-for-a-good-reason on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2JleW9uZC1yaXZpYW4tYW1hem9uLWhhcy1hLXNsZXctb2YtZXYtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtZm9yLWEtZ29vZC1yZWFzb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndsa3kuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYW1hem9uLW9wZW5pbmctZmlyc3QtYnJpY2stbW9ydGFyLXN0b3JlLWxvdWlzdmlsbGUvMzg5OTAyMDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon opening first brick and mortar store in Louisville,"Amazon is planning its first brick-and-mortar store in Louisville according to Louisville Business First.The e-commerce giant filed a permit last week for a store in Oxmoor Center.Amazon's website said every product in 4-star stores which this is expected to be is rated 4 stars and above by customers a top seller or new and trending on Amazon.com.The company's website shows a 4-star store is coming soon to Lexington Kentucky as well at the Summit at Fritz Farm.

It became legendary when George Clooney was portrayed as a Concierge Key member on a quest to earn 10 million miles in Up In The Air. The benefits of this status include top priority for upgrades (and no cash copay when spending miles for upgrades); airport escorts and even occasional vehicle transfers on the tarmac; access to Flagship business class lounges (and regular invites to First Class Dining); and a next flight guarantee to ensure they get to their destination.

American usually sends chocolates each year to Concierge Key members. This year’s package is better. A reader generously shared photos of the chocolates and model Boeing 787-9 that they received. The base of the model 787 is personalized with the name of the member.

The gift also contains “an exclusive American Airlines NFT custom made for ConciergeKey members.” So there’s that.

Three years ago the chocolate company that provided American Airlines with the Concierge Key gift published that American had ordered 11300 of them. That’s consistent with the 10000 to 15000 estimate for number of Concierge Key members I’d been using since 2014.

You cannot qualify for Concierge Key with a specific amount of flying or a published amount of spending. Over $50000 has historically been enough – at least buying a $50000 ‘AAirpass’ of prepaid travel would come with the status. Spending alone isn’t the only driver. Margins matter more. For instance spending $50000 and flying 300000 miles isn’t likely to earn Concierge Key while there are members spending $45000 to fly no more than 100000 miles who will make it.

American has run ‘challenges’ for Concierge Key membership. A targeted fast track has included four spend levels for American Airlines flights that had to be met during a 90 day period. Different members received different amounts $10000; $12000; $14000 EQDs; $16000. (Those are annual run rates between $40000 and $64000.)

Concierge Key is also given out to decision-makers of big corporate contracts. There are also more than one tier of Concierge Key. There are a handful of members (perhaps a dozen) that are tagged ‘Do Not Miss’ because of their commercial importance to the airline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1tYXktMjAyMi1yZWR1Y3Rpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Pulls Down May As It Rationalizes Its Schedules,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1tYXktMjAyMi1yZWR1Y3Rpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L2RlbHRhLWFpci10cmF2ZWwtcmFnZS1uby1mbHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines asks Justice Department to help set up national 'no-fly' list of unruly passengers,"Delta Air Lines has asked the Justice Department to help set up a national “no-fly” list of unruly passengers that would bar them from boarding any commercial air carrier amid a surge in “air rage” incidents during the pandemic.

Corpus Christi IceRays





The franchise that would eventually become known as the Corpus Christi IceRays came into existence in 2001 first as the Pittsburgh Forge before moving to the Texas Gulf Coast and their current home at American Bank Center in 2010. The IceRays are members of the National American Hockey League (NAHL) one of the top junior hockey leagues in the country.





A previous incarnation of the IceRays existed from 1998 to 2010 as members of the Central Hockey League and Western Professional Hockey League before the current team’s owners decided to venture into junior hockey with the current club.





The new version of the IceRays has seen some success making the playoffs five times. The team has also brought another layer of professional sports to this often-underserved region of Texas and the fans have responded in kind. The IceRays are one of the highest-attended teams in the NAHL and play in one of the nicest facilities in minor league hockey.





Food & Beverage 4

There are two levels of seating at the American Bank Center and that means there are two levels of concessions as well. On the first floor there are two main concession stands near the entrance areas that specialize in your traditional stadium fare – your hot dogs nachos popcorn etc. There is also a similar stand on the second floor that carries the same items. The stand on the second floor also sells cheese and pepperoni pizza by the slice which is always nice to have at a game.

In terms of specialty dining American Bank Center has a Chick-fil-A kiosk on the first floor that sells its signature sandwiches and chips. There is also a gourmet popcorn stand that sells slices of local Corpus Christi dessert favorite The Ultimate Cheesecake Bakery. Also on the first floor is The Dogfather a specialty hot dog and sausage stand; this is a good alternative to your standard variety of hot dogs.





A personal recommendation would be to hit up the Hurb’s Burgers stand on the second floor. This is another local joint that offers a $10 double cheeseburger and chips combo; it’s dang tasty and I recommend getting it with their special sauce. It also happens to be right next to the arena’s full-service bar which if that’s what you’re into is a great spot to be.





Atmosphere 3

American Bank Center is truly a top-notch facility and is home to numerous events throughout the year for Corpus Christi. In addition to being the home of the IceRays it is also home to Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi’s basketball teams and plays host to pretty much every big entertainment act that comes through the region as well. As such it has the look of a big-time entertainment venue.





The hockey setup for IceRays games at American Bank Center is a basic horseshoe with one end of the arena closed off and without seating; it’s draped off with black curtains and is where the Zamboni enters from at the end of each period.





That being said it doesn’t detract from the sightlines or acoustics. The black of the seats and curtains couples with the exposed piping in the ceiling which has been painted an almost neon-lime green to create an interesting effect. The other point of interest in terms of atmosphere would be the team store which is located on the first floor near the main entrance.





The glass windows on the second floor look right out onto Corpus Christi harbor and from some exits you can go out onto balconies and sit outside. It’s one of the best views in the city and you’d be hard-pressed to find another one like it in all of minor league hockey.





Neighborhood 4

Corpus Christi has long been a destination retreat for many South Texas residents. Less than a two-hour drive from San Antonio it is the closest beach for most Texans and it is the first destination most head to during the summer months. The prime spot to head to is North Beach which is across the Harbor Bridge from American Bank Center. With 1.5 miles of beachfront that is open year-round during the day and at night for camping and anchored by fishing jetties North Beach is the prime spot for visitors to Corpus Christi.





In addition to its beachfront restaurants and hotels (more on those momentarily) North Beach is also home to two of the city’s main tourist attractions the USS Lexington and the Texas State Aquarium. Commissioned in 1943 the USS Lexington is a retired naval aircraft carrier that saw service during World War II and the Korean War before being retired. It now serves as a fully interactive museum of military history. The Texas State Aquarium is home to numerous species and is one of the top facilities of its kind in the country. Both are great spots to visit when checking out an IceRays game.





In terms of dining options there are quite a few to choose from in the downtown area of Corpus Christi near the arena. One popular option is Brewster Street Icehouse – serving up a line of signature burgers like their Hello Sunshine and Brewster Bucket List as well as sandwiches like their Seafood Po’Boy and their South Texas Philly Brewster Street is a popular sport in the Concrete Street entertainment area.





For something a little more “of the place” since you’re on the Gulf Coast why not seafood? The Railroad Seafood & Brewing Co. is a relatively new sport and combines locally sourced seafood with craft beer brewed onsite; it is a real taste of what the Gulf is all about.





In terms of lodging numerous spots up and down the shore are sure to fit within anyone’s budget. Some of the closest options include the Omni Corpus Christi Hotel and the Holiday Inn Corpus Christi Downtown Marina. Just be forewarned depending on the day and time of year that you head down hotels in this part of the city tend to be very popular and thus tend to fill up fast.





Fans 3

In my experience minor league sports fans tend to fall into two categories: very casual or very loyal. The IceRays have traditionally been at or near the top of the NAHL in average attendance every year since they joined the league; for the current season they are averaging just under 2100 fans per game and sit at third in the league.





The crowd from what I experienced is a good mix of the casual and the diehard fans. There is also an apocryphal story which I can’t find confirmation of but you need to see about how passionate this fanbase can be (scroll down to item #6 when you click this link).





You will see plenty of IceRays fans kitted out in their sweaters and they will be loud and cheering throughout the night but you will also see a ton of college-age fans out for an inexpensive night of fun (the team frequently runs college nights where students with a college ID get a free ticket). All in all it’s a great crowd and a fun atmosphere with good energy especially at weekend games.





Access 3

American Bank Center is located right along the shore (on Shoreline Drive in fact) before you cross over Harbor Bridge in downtown Corpus Christi. The city itself is located about a two-hour drive from San Antonio which also puts it at close to three hours from Austin and three-and-a-half hours from Houston. Corpus Christi International Airport does feature daily flights to and from Houston and Dallas if that’s the route you want to go.





Once on site parking is ample in the lots and will run you $10 per car. There is free parking in certain spots on the street at certain times; just be mindful of those areas and those times or you will find yourself with an unwanted souvenir parking ticket courtesy of the Corpus Christi Police Department.





The Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority (CCRTA) the city’s public transportation option does offer a line that makes a stop at American Bank Center. If you choose not to drive you can plan your route from their website.





Return on Investment 4

The great benefit of minor league sports is that they offer the chance to see the pro game at an affordable rate; this holds for the Corpus Christi IceRays where general admission tickets start at $10 per person. When you factor this in with the relatively inexpensive concessions ($10 for a double cheeseburger combo at Hurb’s y’all!) and the parking costs you’re getting a good bargain. For young fans this is a great way to introduce them to the sport.





Extras 3

The IceRays like a lot of minor league teams do a lot of hustling to get fans into the building. They have a Pucks and Paws night Thirsty Thursdays family skate nights after games and much more. There are also games and contests during intermission periods including a chuck-a-puck contest for a year’s worth of Whataburger.

The IceRays also have their mascot Stinger Ray who patrols the stands skates the ice and tosses t-shirts from the back of a pickup truck during one of the aforementioned intermissions. Like most mascots Stinger Ray is around quite a bit for photo ops throughout the game.

Final Thoughts

I have always enjoyed my visits both to Corpus Christi and to American Bank Center. As a lifelong resident of this region of Texas I am pretty nostalgic about trips to the coast and what they signify. I imagine that’s the way folks on the East Coast feel about going to the Jersey Shore each summer. Regardless Corpus Christi is a special place with a lot of things to do and see.





The IceRays and American Bank Center both do a great job of making the games feel big. The fans also have a passion for their club; the venue is great the view is great and the city is great. I wouldn’t mark it down on your bucket list necessarily but make a stop in and catch an IceRays game if you’re down on the Texas Gulf Coast during the season. I think you’ll have a great time.

The Belmont College Foundation has received a $10000 donation from American Electric Power for a live burn training facility.

The purpose of this facility will be to provide local first responders with training for structure fires flammable gas and flammable liquids as well as confined space instruction search and rescue operations and rope rescue education.

According to college president Dr. Paul Gasparro “Recent Ohio rule changes requiring NFPA safety regulated and inspected burn buildings have left a void for this type of training in our region said college president Dr. Paul Gasparro. ""Currently there are no approved burn-building structures within a nine-county radius of Belmont County which places an undue burden of travel time and expenses on area first responders.

“Belmont College has been a chartered fire school for nearly three decades. Through building this facility we hope to ensure that those who answer the call when tragedy strikes are well prepared with the training they need to respond in a safe and confident manner"" he added.

The facility will be located on the 54 acres of property that Belmont College owns between Hammond Road and Ohio 331 in St. Clairsville.

The February 2021 storms showed the fragility of the grid at a time when climate change is contributing to an increase in extreme weather.

But the most enduring legacy of the 2021 blackouts may be the spread of a falsehood: the idea that the crisis was mainly due to the failure of renewable energy.

Sen. Joe Manchin D-West Virginia invoked this idea in December when he announced he was voting against President Joe Biden’s climate and social spending bill saying that a rapid transition to clean energy “will have catastrophic consequences for the American people like we have seen in both Texas and California in the last two years.”

Fossil-fuel industry groups and elected officials across the country have made similar claims part of a trail of distorted facts that has helped to obscure the true story of the Texas power crisis. That story as told in a succession of reports by outside experts is that the most consequential failures were in the natural gas industry and at gas-fired power plants.

Yet many Texas officials have responded as if they believed the warped version of events choosing not to engage with what really happened.

“The idea that wind and solar were the problem when our grid is dominated by fossil fuels doesn’t add up in any way” said Michael Webber an energy resources professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

In the aftermath of the 2021 storms Gov. Greg Abbott a Republican oversaw a complete change in the leadership of the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the grid operator the Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT. But he and other state officials did much less to require changes to the gas industry which is regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas.

Meanwhile various reports have confirmed the central role of the gas industry in the power outages. These include a joint investigation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation; a detailed timeline of events by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin; and a paper in the journal Energy Research & Social Science the authors of which include energy researchers from Texas and across the country including Webber.

The reports showed that every major energy source including wind had problems that contributed to a shortage of electricity but that the grid’s heavy reliance on gas meant that the breakdowns in the gas delivery system were a leading factor. Much of the gas system was not winterized so many parts of it couldn’t function in extreme cold.

“I’m concerned that our regulators over the natural gas industry don’t appear to even be interested or curious about the capabilities of the system they have oversight of” said Beth Garza a Texas-based senior fellow with the R Street Institute a think tank that promotes open markets. Until 2019 she was head of the office that serves as the independent watchdog for ERCOT.

“I don’t know what’s in the railroad commissioners’ heads” she said. “But publicly their comments seem to be ‘Natural gas wasn’t the problem we were the solution.’”

Among those comments was a March 19 opinion column in The Wall Street Journal with the headline “Texas’ Blackouts Blew in the Wind” by Wayne Christian a member of the commission.

“Regardless of your thoughts on climate change last month’s storm made painfully clear that climate catastrophists have an oversize influence on public policy” he wrote. “An obsessive focus on reaching the unattainable goal of zero carbon emissions led to decades of poor decisions that prioritized and subsidized unreliable energy sources (wind and solar) at the expense of reliable ones (natural gas coal and nuclear).”

This commentary and many others like it helped to underscore that Texas officials did not seem interested in a serious investigation of what went wrong.

The shortcomings of Texas’ response to the 2021 crisis led some analysts to worry that the state was not prepared for another storm of similar magnitude. Luckily Texas hasn’t yet faced that kind of test even with the storm that hit this week which turned out to be shorter and less cold than what happened last year.

Freeze Cut Supply and Spiked Demand

Winter storms hit Texas in February 2021 bringing snow ice and sub-zero temperatures.

The extreme cold led to a spike in demand for natural gas and electricity for home heating. The high demand for gas was happening at the same time as a drop in the supply of gas. Many of the companies that extract and deliver the fuel were going offline because of frozen equipment or because they were shutting down equipment to avoid weather-related damage.

The sudden decrease in the availability of gas meant that some gas-fired power plants Texas’ leading source of electricity could no longer get fuel and had to shut down. Other gas-fired plants shut down because of the effects of freezing on valves air systems and other equipment.

ERCOT was faced with record-high demand for electricity and a plummeting supply. In response the grid operator initiated blackouts starting on Feb. 15 over much of the state leaving some residents in the dark for days.

The sudden loss of natural gas supplies led to a nationwide spike in gas prices. Gas producers that were still online made billions of dollars in just a few days while utilities and other gas buyers across the country were bound by contracts that forced them to purchase it at prices that would take years or even decades to pay off.

ERCOT records showed that all electricity sources were impaired in some way except for the state’s small share of hydroelectric power.

But the majority of the power losses were from gas plants including 25 gigawatts of capacity that went offline. Coal and nuclear outages cut another 4.5 gigawatts and 1.3 gigawatts respectively according to the University of Texas at Austin report. Considering that peak demand was about 70 gigawatts losing about 30 gigawatts from gas coal and nuclear was a disaster.

Wind energy also performed poorly starting with ice accumulation that led to some wind farms needing to shut down early in the crisis. Wind power outages peaked at about 9 gigawatts a number that takes into account wind levels on those days according to the UT Austin report.

Solar power is rapidly growing in Texas but it remains a tiny share of the state’s electricity supply and had little effect positive or negative during the crisis.

“It’s not like wind is blameless but (the power crisis) wasn’t caused by wind failure” said Webber. To say otherwise is “at best misleading at worst an outright lie.”

About 4.5 million Texans lost power many of them living in homes that were not built to withstand frigid temperatures. At least 246 people died of causes related to the storm and power outages according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

The deaths included a mother and her seven-year-old daughter who died of carbon monoxide poisoning and a 60-year old man with disabilities who died of hypothermia according to reporting by the Houston Chronicle KTRK television in Houston and other local media outlets.

The Texas power crisis turned out to be the largest example in U.S. history of grid operators forcing blackouts because the electricity supply was not enough to meet demand according to the FERC/NERC report.

Hot Air Blames Wind but Cold Facts Implicate Gas

During the crisis when many Texans were still without power Abbott said on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show that failures in wind and solar “thrust Texas into a situation where it was lacking power [on] a statewide basis.”

This framing was widely repeated across Fox News’ schedule. On the Fox & Friends morning show images from the state were shown above a chyron saying “Frozen wind turbines cause blackouts in Texas.”

Fossil-fuel industry groups and sympathetic think tanks also trumpeted this message.

“This week as the state and nation are blanketed in ice we can expect most of our wind turbines to be still and solar panels to produce little to no electricity” said Katie Tahuahua communications manager for the Life:Powered campaign a pro-fossil fuel public relations project from the Texas Public Policy Foundation. “Fortunately our abundant natural gas and clean coal power plants can be ramped up to meet our power needs at any time.”

William Pendley who had been the top official in the federal Bureau of Land Management in the Trump Administration tweeted a link to a post from the Texas Public Policy Foundation and added this comment: “Read the whole thing but; short answer: Texas—home to vast oil and gas supplies—drank the renewable energy Koolaid. Sad.”

But there also was substantial news coverage about the actual causes of the crisis with outlets like The Texas Tribune and many others reporting what really happened.

Doug Lewin a Texas-based clean energy advocate and consultant said any discussion of the attempts to distort the facts should also include that many media outlets succeeded in holding leaders accountable.

“There are definitely a lot of people that believe the misinformation but I think most people understand what happened” he said.

Post-Blackout Legislation Only Tackles Part of the Problem

In the months that followed Texas political leaders vowed to take action to fix the systems that had failed.

But the steps they took were in line with the view that the problem was in electricity regulation and management not in the gas industry’s inability to deliver its product during extreme weather.

To be sure there were many issues with the state’s electricity regulation and management but this was just part of the problem.

On June 8 Abbott signed several bills inspired by the crisis. Among them Senate Bill 3 aims to make the electricity system more reliable by requiring power plants to winterize among other steps. Some gas wells and other gas infrastructure would be designated as critical infrastructure which would mean that they would have priority to receive electricity during times of forced outages so that they could continue to deliver fuel.

The bill also said that natural gas production and delivery facilities would need to winterize if they were part of the supply chain of gas for power plants. A new state panel is determining which gas sites should be included and will issue a report by September 2022. After that the railroad commission would set the rules for winterization.

“We promised not to leave session until we fixed these problems and I am proud to say that we kept that promise” Abbott said. “These laws will improve the reliability of the electric grid and help ensure these problems never happen again.”

Abbott’s office did not reply to a request for comment.

Lewin said the legislation fell far short of what was needed by not doing enough to require prompt action by gas companies and by not addressing the larger problem that millions of people live in homes with inefficient heating systems and inadequate insulation.

“Overall the system is very vulnerable” he said.

Public Disapproval of Response Officials Silent on Climate

After the state legislature did little to address reliability issues in the gas system there was backlash from the public and some legislators.

A poll released in November by the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune showed that 60 percent of respondents disapproved of the way state leaders and the legislature handled concerns about reliability of the electricity grid and only 18 percent approved. It was the lowest level of approval for any of the 13 issues covered in the poll.

One flashpoint was that the legislation didn’t change an existing rule that said gas producers could apply to opt out of having to follow winterization rules by paying a $150 fee.

“Your rulemaking proposal sucks and we need a different direction” said Texas Sen. John Whitmire D-Houston in a September hearing with leaders of the railroad commission.

That comment was indicative of broader public criticism of the legislature and the railroad commission for providing little assurance that the gas system would be ready for the next winter crisis.

In response the railroad commission made changes to the opt-out rule before approving it saying that the largest gas producers were no longer eligible to apply for an opt-out.

“Despite what you may read in the news no one is getting a bailout and no one is getting a loophole” said the commission’s Wayne Christian in November as it adopted rules to comply with the new law.

Christian did not respond to a request for comment.

Texas leaders’ statements about the causes of the crisis were also notable for the almost complete lack of discussion about climate change and its role in the rising frequency of severe storms.

But university researchers and former officials have been more open to discussing these subjects.

A group of former members of the Public Utility Commission of Texas wrote a report in June with 20 recommendations for improving the state’s power system including that “ERCOT should design and explore multiple climate change and extreme weather forecasts.” Among the co-authors was Pat Wood who was the commission’s chairman in the 1990s and later FERC chairman in the George W. Bush administration.

“Texas is the world’s ninth-largest economy” said Wood and his co-authors. “We owe it to our families and fellow citizens to learn from this event plan for the future and do the right thing for the good of Texas.”

The Energy Research & Social Science paper also discusses the role of climate change saying that Texas leaders have the opportunity to learn from what happened last winter to build a cleaner and more reliable grid.

“Getting this balance of cleanliness affordability and reliability right is not simply a technocratic question as it has major implications for health equity and human well-being” the paper said. “As such the big freeze of 2021 provides a cautionary tale that others can learn from.”

Kristen Gonzalez is a product manager for American Express — but the 26-year-old scrubbed any trace of that work from her online presence deleting her LinkedIn and locking her Facebook account.

And her campaign website and Twitter account make no mention of her employment with the financial giant which reaped $9.8 billion in interest and $4.6 billion in credit-card fees in 2020 according to securities filings.

Gonzalez filed for political candidacy with the office undeclared on Dec. 21 2021. She announced her bid for Senate District 17 on Wednesday a day after the state’s Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment published its partisan recommendations. The new district includes parts of Woodside Ridgewood Maspeth Greenpoint and Long Island City.

Gonzalez grew up in Elmhurst and after her father died attended the elite Dalton School on scholarship according to her campaign site and social media. She matriculated at Columbia University where she majored in political science and ethnicity and race studies ran the College Democrats and attended an “information session” hosted by a Goldman Sachs managing director for students interested in finance.

Her political and civic activities since graduating have consisted of involvement with the Democratic Socialists of America and being appointed to Queens Community Board 4 — though rarely showing up according to board meeting minutes.

She also interned for President Obama and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) the latter through a Congress Hispanic Caucus Institute program funded by anti-union Walmart.

Gonzalez makes no mention of her employer on any of her campaign material. gonzalezforny.com

Nowadays she lives high above the proletariat in a 58-story luxury building in Long Island City where rents range from $2700 to $6397 according to StreetEasy. Building amenities include an indoor pool movie theater and sauna and steam rooms.

“Kristen grew up watching her mother struggle to keep a roof over their heads and put food on the table” her campaign said in a statement. “She made a decision early in life to put herself in a position to provide for her family at the first opportunity and that’s exactly what she did. She’s a working-class kid from Queens who made it — and she makes no apologies for it. She also recognizes that while she was able to work hard and find success with the support of her family hard work isn’t always enough. The deck is stacked against the working class.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldHJvaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZi8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L3RvbS1ob2dlLXN1cmdlcy1wYXN0LXNwaWV0aC1wZWJibGUtMXN0LXBnYS10b3VyLXdpbi82Njg2NDYxMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Hoge surges past Spieth at Pebble for 1st PGA Tour win,"Doug Ferguson

Associated Press

Pebble Beach Calif. — Another cliff-hanger at Pebble Beach this one memorable for Tom Hoge delivering all the right shots on the back nine to surge past Jordan Spieth and win the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am for his first PGA Tour title.

Hoge one of seven players who had at least a share of the lead Sunday came within inches of holing out from the 16th fairway tapping in for birdie to catch Spieth. Then after Spieth made bogey from the bunker on the par-3 17th Hoge rolled in a birdie from just outside 20 feet.

He closed with a par for a 4-under 68.

Hoge a 32-year-old who grew up in North Dakota had been runner-up twice in his previous 202 starts on the PGA Tour most recently at The American Express two weeks ago.

His time came amid the magnificent setting of Pebble Beach under a clear sky and it didn't come easily with so many players in the mix for so long.

Spieth looked like a winner when he birdied the 12th and 13th holes and he reached the 15th tee with a two-shot lead. But he missed a 5-foot par putt on the 17th and only as he stood under the pine in fairway on the par-5 18th did he realize he needed an eagle.

He caught a sandy lie that left him in a fairway bunker and the best he could do was par for a 69. Hoge had to wait for Beau Hossler one of three players who shared the 54-hole lead who needed eagle on the 18th to force a playoff.

Hossler sent his fairway metal right into a bunker blasted out long and three-putted for bogey for a 71 to finish alone in third.

Hoge earned his first trip to Augusta National for the Masters along with getting a two-year exemption. Until this year his best season on the PGA Tour was in 2020 when he was 50th in the FedEx Cup and won just over $1.8 million.

Hoge who finished at 19-under 268 earned $1566000.

So many others had chances including Patrick Cantlay at No. 4 the highest-ranked player in the world at Pebble Beach. He opened with two birdies and was still atop the leaderboard until a bogey at the eighth that left the final three hours wide open.

Cantlay didn't make another birdie until the 18th when it was too late. He spent most of the back nine scrambling for par and his luck finally ran out on the 15th and 16th hole. He shot 71 and tied for fourth along with Troy Merritt (67).

Joel Dahmen (72) and Andrew Putnam (73) also had a share of the lead during the final round. They were in the group that tied for sixth.

Spieth won at Pebble in 2017 had a two-shot lead going into the final round last year and had everything seemingly in his favor. That includes the signature moment of this week when he had his left foot planted on the edge of a 60-foot cliff on the eighth hole Saturday that only gave him anxiety after he realized the risk he had taken.

His hopes began to fade with an 8-iron he was starting down on the 17th shocked that it came up short and in the sand.

“Maybe my best swing of the day” he said. “I thought it was going to be 2 feet.”

Instead he blasted out 5 feet long and hit the putt too hard to take the left-to-right break.

Hoge hit the ball so pure on the back nine that he had a birdie putt from inside 20 feet on every hole until he got to the 17th and that's where he made the biggest putt of his career.

“It's awesome” Hoge said. “I've worked through so many hard times.”

Hoge who played college golf at TCU has been on the PGA Tour since 2015. He started out on the Canadian tour where he won in 2011.

“I'm almost a little in shock” Hoge said. “It's been so long since I won anything that I forgot how to celebrate.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS90b3AtcG9pbnRzLWhvdGVscy1wYWxtLXNwcmluZ3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The top points hotels in the Palm Springs area,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Palm Springs California has long been an oasis for Southern Californians — and those from farther afield — looking to escape the busyness of daily life or the cold of winter with a trip to the warm desert.

Set in the stunning Sonoran Desert and surrounded by mountains (that often have snow at the top even in the summer) the Palm Springs area has something for everyone. The weather is great year-round (though it gets very hot in the summer; it is the desert after all). There's an abundance of golf courses and tennis courts plus a plethora of cultural attractions and a vibrant dining and drinking scene.

As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on travelers — and the travel industry — have realized the potential of this destination as a perfect escape.

The city and surrounding area have actually benefitted tremendously from the shift in travel preferences away from crowded cities and international destinations for places closer to home with lots of outdoor space. In fact the nation's major airlines added new flights to the desert city betting that it'll remain a popular destination for Americans looking to get away from the monotony of everyday life during the pandemic.

Predictably as the popularity of Palm Springs has increased over the years there are numerous top-notch resorts that cater to a wide range of people from a solo traveler looking to get away from it all to those seeking a family-friendly spot to let the kids burn off some of that pent-up energy in the great outdoors.

The four major hotel chains — Hilton Hyatt IHG and Marriott — all have properties in the area (along with some great independent properties) but as you'll see in the list below those with Marriott Bonvoy points to burn are spoiled for choice whereas those loyal to any of the other three chains won't be able to be as picky.

Let's take a look at the top points hotels in the area should you want to take advantage of all the new flight options into Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) and enjoy a desert vacation.

It features what appears to be 37000 skiers and snowboarders all descending one trail at the same time.

Check it out below if you haven’t seen it yet. I’ll provide my less-than-enthusiastic commentary afterwards.

Okay now that you’ve seen it did you also feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety? It’s posed as a happy commercial but I felt the exact opposite.

Are we supposed to enjoy the thought of the slopes being so crowded that you can’t even make a turn without close-lining a little girl learning how to pizza?! I mean what the hell was VISA thinking?

I’m about to sign up for every goddamn Mastercard and American Express possible if this is what VISA wants to happen to the ski industry.

However I bet the execs over at Vail Resorts are happy as a pig in mud. Their vision for the North American ski experience has been recognized by another company and now we’re all doomed.

I’m obviously kidding but I just couldn’t get over this damn commercial. Nothing about it is pleasing for me to watch.

I’m all for equal opportunity and inclusion in skiing and snowboarding. We certainly need to provide ways for more people to have access to the moutnain.

With that being said VISA really missed the mark on this one. Showing thousands of people descending a single slope isn’t making me feel inspired to making skiing and snowboarding more accessible…😂

The answer has wide implications not just for easing the suffering of more than 35 million Afghans but also for international efforts to get the militant group to moderate policies seen by many as harsh even brutal.



""It is an almost impossible needle to thread"" said Jordan Strauss a managing director at risk consulting firm Kroll who worked as a Justice Department official in Afghanistan from 2014 to 2015.



When the Taliban seized Kabul wide-ranging sanctions dating back to their first rule followed them. To deny them access to funds the Biden administration then froze more than $7 billion in Afghan government reserves held in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.



The asset freeze exacerbated a simmering economic crisis.



“The absence of a functioning banking sector and risk of economic collapse continue to pose obstacles to mounting the scale of response needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis” Bernice G. Romero executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) told VOA.



Under pressure from aid groups the Biden administration issued sanctions exemptions in September and December.



This has allowed nonprofit organizations to deliver food and other assistance into Afghanistan. But many aid groups NGOs and banks remain wary of violating U.S. sanctions according to NGO officials.

To reassure them they won't be penalized for doing humanitarian work Treasury officials have met with representatives of non-profit organizations in recent months.



Last week Under Secretary of Treasury Brian Nelson spoke with NGO leaders to highlight a new list of Frequently Asked Questions ""designed to provide clarity and further facilitate humanitarian aid and commercial activity in Afghanistan""

Here is a look at current U.S. sanctions and exemptions:



What sanctions are currently in place against the Taliban?



U.S. economic sanctions against the Taliban date back to their first time in power in the 1990s. The curbs were tightened after the attacks of September 11 2001 which prompted the U.S. to invade Afghanistan.



Under an executive order issued just days after the attack by then-President George W. Bush both the Taliban and the Haqqani Network were labeled Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).

The designations allowed U.S. authorities to block and seize the assets of the two militant groups while making it a crime to do business with them.



With the Taliban now the de facto government of Afghanistan it remains unclear whether the 20-year-old restrictions apply to their current regime or only to individual officials previously named under U.S. sanctions.



""It needs to be clarified"" Strauss said.



Asked whether the sanctions apply to the Taliban government or individual Taliban officials a Treasury Department spokesperson noted that both the Taliban and the Haqqani Network are Specially Designated Global Terrorists adding that the Haqqani Group also is designated ad a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

She did not elaborate.

What exemptions have been issued by the Treasury Department?

Concerned the sanctions were impeding the flow of aid into Afghanistan the Treasury Department has carved out broad exemptions for NGOs and other organizations working in Afghanistan.



Since September the Treasury Department has issued six ""general licenses"" — essentially permits to carry out activities otherwise prohibited under U.S. sanctions.



These licenses allow international organizations to deliver food and agricultural produce support public hospitals and pay the salaries of teachers and healthcare workers. They also authorize banks to process transactions related to these activities without being punished.



For example a U.S. company can ship food to Afghanistan and a U.S.-based bank can carry out financial transactions to facilitate the shipment. Neither would face any penalties according to the Treasury Department website.



The latest Treasury Department license issued on December 19 goes further allowing NGOs to conduct a broad range of activities that fall outside traditional humanitarian work such as supporting human rights access to information and government transparency.



Even as some Taliban and Haqqani Network officials remain subject to U.S. sanctions NGOs and other organizations are now allowed to work with them an inevitable consequence of the change in government in Kabul.



For example a nonprofit may enter into a memorandum of understanding with Taliban officials to coordinate the delivery of aid provide descriptions of their projects and share office space according to the Treasury website.



NGOs are also permitted to pay taxes dues and import duties to the Taliban the Haqqani Network and entities they control as long as the payments are related to the authorized activities.



What the licenses don't allow



While allowing NGOs and others to work with the Taliban and Haqqani Network the Treasury Department licenses prohibit the transfer of funds to officials who remain under U.S. sanctions.



Despite Treasury's assurances some commercial players are not taking their chances.



Crowdfunding giant GoFundMe recently reportedly suspended an Afghan journalist's campaign to raise funds for his struggling news site.



The Treasury Department spokesperson said crowdfunding platforms can allow individual fundraisers ""so long as transactions or activities do not involve sanctioned individuals entities or property in which sanctioned individuals and entities have an interest.""



GoFundMe did not respond to a request for comment.

Additionally as part of its global R&D strategy the company opened its doors on an all new Innovation Center in Florham Park New Jersey.

According to Beiersdorf both new facilities represent a strong commitment to the region and will help drive growth for the group and its brands including Aquaphor Eucerin Nivea La Prairie and Coppertone.

New Headquarters in Stamford Connecticut

In total 180 employees will work out of the new Stamford office at 301 Tresser Boulevard. The new space sits within a one-million square feet campus that comprises 2.5 acres of green space in the center of the city of Stamford. It is one of the largest office complexes in Connecticut and is ideally located - just off Interstate 95 a short walk from the Stamford train station and within driving distance of the three major local airports.

The LEED-certified open-concept office has over 250 workpoints collaboration areas plus natural air venting and a panoramic view of the Long Island Sound.

OTC and Sun Care Products

The Stamford office is within driving distance of Beiersdorf’s newly built Innovation Center in Florham Park N.J. Only 35 miles west of New York City this area of New Jersey is considered a “science hot bed” as it is also home to other large research and development centers and has excellent access to talent and universities suppliers and testing institutes.

The new LEED-certified center in New Jersey spans about 32000 square feet of office and laboratory space collaboration spaces a consumer sensory panel focus area and room for expansion. It is one of only two Beiersdorf regional Innovation Centers in the world; the other in Shanghai. The Innovation Center in N.J. is the first global center of excellence for over-the-counter and sun care products outside of Hamburg.

“Already a globally recognized leader in sun protection Beiersdorf - by establishing a new regional hub for innovation in New Jersey - will gain further local insights to help identify unmet consumer needs and further fuel innovation” said the group in a statement.

Apart from the two regional Innovation Centers in China and now in the U.S. Beiersdorf has regional development labs in Brazil India Japan and Mexico.

Beiersdorf recently strengthened its premium skin care offering with the acquisition of luxury brand Chantecaille.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vZnV0dXJlLXBlcmZlY3QvMjI5MTgwMDAvYmVpamluZy1vbHltcGljcy13b3JsZC1wZWFjZS1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Olympic ideal is about world peace. The Olympic reality is far from it.,"The Beijing Winter Games that opened on Friday are officially the XXIV Winter Olympics. They could have been the XXVI Winter Games — that’s the 26th for those of us who have forgotten our grade-school Roman numeral lessons — save for a historical interruption: World War II which led to the cancellation of the Winter and Summer Games of 1940 and 1944. (The Summer and Winter Games began alternating every two years with the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games.)

The idea that sporting competition between nations can play a role in promoting peace has been part of the Olympics since its origins in ancient Greece. Greek city-states that otherwise spent much of their time at war with one another observed (with some exceptions) a truce during the Olympics allowing safe travel and participation for athletes and spectators during the Games.

Baron Pierre de Coubertin the French aristocrat who spearheaded the relaunching of the modern Olympics beginning in 1896 believed that “the Olympic Games may be a potent if indirect factor in securing world peace.”

Since 1993 the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the Olympic Truce resolution two years before every Games unanimously calling for “all hostilities to cease during the Games thereby mobilizing the youth of the world in the cause of peace.” In 2000 the committee behind the Games established the International Olympic Truce Centre in Athens “to promote the Olympic ideals to serve peace friendship and understanding of the world.”

Take away those lofty-sounding ideals and the Olympics are essentially a glorified international athletics competition that is 100 percent guaranteed to run over budget for its host city. But as the example of World War II shows — not to mention the many Games over the years that have been at least partially disrupted by international conflict including this one — more often it is war that has stopped the Olympics rather than the Olympics stopping war.

When a truce isn’t a truce

Questions about what role the Olympics play in promoting world peace are especially acute as the Beijing Games begin. Even as the ice hockey and curling matches have already begun tens of thousands of Russian troops are stationed along the Ukrainian border raising fears of an invasion that President Biden has said would be “the most consequential thing that’s happened in the world in terms of war and peace since World War II.”

While a full athletic boycott of the Beijing Olympics over the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghurs failed to materialize the US has led a number of allies in a diplomatic boycott of the Games with India deciding to join on Thursday. (The diplomatic boycott meant that observing countries are not sending official government delegations to Beijing so Chinese President Xi Jinping was mostly joined at the opening ceremonies on Friday by fellow autocrats.)

And the Olympic truce didn’t stop Washington from launching a commando raid on Thursday that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi and reportedly a number of women and children.

As the international relations scholar Kimberly Kim wrote in 2020 “most of the Games held in the modern Olympic era have failed to live up to the Olympic values and ideals.”

Olympics in 1972 and 1996 were directly marred by deadly acts of terrorism. Ten days before the opening of the 1968 Mexico City Games the Mexican government opened fire on student protesters in the capital’s Tlatelolco plaza leading to the deaths of hundreds of people by some estimates though the final death toll remains unknown.

The 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics featured alternating full boycotts from the US and the Soviet Union as well as their respective allies. The 1936 Berlin Olympics were explicitly presented as a showcase for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s vision of Aryan supremacy — though American sprinter Jesse Owens had something to say about that — and the 2014 Sochi Olympics the most expensive in history were staged in large part to display the strength of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Nor was peace universally observed in the classical Olympic Games. City-states were only forbidden from invading Olympia where the ancient Games were held or from stopping an athlete or spectator on their way to the competition; otherwise warfare often continued during the Olympics.

Even the Games weren’t always safe — in 364 BCE troops attacked the sacred site of Altis in Olympia. Athletes stopped their competition and spectators turned from watching the participants to watching the soldiers.

Peace as we understand it now was never a goal of the original Olympics. What the Greeks observed during the Olympics was ekecheiria which more accurately translates to “truce.” What the Olympics offered was a partial interruption to the normal background of near-constant conflict between the Greek city-states.

Pierre de Coubertin’s vision that an athletic competition between nations could help lead to universal peace would have been utterly alien to the Greeks.

Descending from Olympia

For all its faults there have been times when the modern Olympics have played a meaningful role in promoting international peace.

In Barcelona in 1992 athletes from members of 12 former Soviet republics competed as a unified team taking home more medals than anyone else. At the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea athletes from both Koreas marched under a single flag and fielded a unified women’s ice hockey team.

But that unified team in 1992 included Russia and Ukraine — two countries now on the brink of what could be Europe’s first conventional land war in decades. And relations between North and South Korea are arguably worse now than they were in 2018.

Even though Olympic ideals played little role in it the absolute number of war deaths has largely been declining since 1946 part of a long-term trend in human history away from our often violent past. But as the nature of global conflict has changed the ideals of the Olympics — nations in friendly competition — seem an increasingly poor fit. What may happen in Ukraine notwithstanding conflict primarily occurs not between countries but within them as world wars are superseded by civil wars and open-ended campaigns against non-state actors.

The Olympic truce has little to say about how the Chinese government is treating the Uyghurs or the civilian casualties that mount in America’s war against ISIS and other terror groups. How nations treat their citizens — let alone citizens of no nation — isn’t in the purview of de Coubertin’s heirs the sport autocrats of the International Olympic Committee.

The Olympics today are an anachronism layered on top of an anachronism — an ancient religious rite first reimagined for a Victorian era of gentlemen amateurs and then again for capitalistic excess and geopolitical prestige.

Given China’s draconian Covid policies spectators won’t be able to attend and even athletes from different countries will have little chance to mingle and learn from each other as de Coubertin once envisioned. No doubt the athletic performances will be extraordinary as they are at every Olympics. But the truce won’t hold because there was never any truce to begin with.

FORT MILL S.C. — MorningStar Ministries leaders spoke Monday evening about their Heritage Tower plans during a York County Commission meeting.

MorningStar is the current owner of the Heritage Tower a 21-story tower that sits empty and in disrepair on the grounds of what was once Heritage USA a Christian theme park launched by American televangelist Jim Bakker of PTL fame.

In an email to WCNC Charlotte on Sunday MorningStar wrote they believed York County officials are threatening to reinstate a lawsuit over the property. When WCNC Charlotte inquired with York County about the possibility of a lawsuit a spokesperson said the county does not comment on any pending lawsuits or litigation.

Rick Joyner CEO of MorningStar spoke before York County Commissioners asking that they immediately dismiss the lawsuit. If not Joyner says they will be forced to take action of their own.

“We’re saying you guys have to do your job and get control of this or we’re going have a huge escalation and lawsuits far more expensive than we’ve had in the past"" Joyner said.

So far we're told York County has spent up to $320000 of taxpayer money fighting these legal battles against MorningStar but the reason why still isn't clear.

""We have never been given an explanation why the county wants to block our finishing that building"" Joyner said.

History of the Heritage Tower

Heritage Tower was initially part of Heritage USA a Christian theme park launched by Bakker and his wife Tammy. At one point the Fort Mill theme park billed itself as the country’s third-largest theme park during its run from 1978 through 1989 according to the Washington Post. The park itself eventually closed as Bakker faced a sexual misconduct scandal and the park faced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the late 1980s. Bakker resigned from PTL and was later convicted on federal fraud charges.

While Bakker only publicly confessed to having an affair with a woman -- claims brought forward by former church secretary Jessica Hahn -- he was found guilty on two dozen federal fraud counts and faced a federal prison sentence. He was originally sentenced to a 45-year prison term but saw his sentence reduced to eight years in 1992. He was released on parole in 1993. While he was still in prison his first wife Tammy Faye Messner divorced him.

The tower which was under construction at the time was never completed and has never been lived in. By 1990 the Bakker's empire had crumbled and for the last three decades the tower has been crumbling too.

MorningStar which is helmed by Rick and Julie Joyner bought part of the Heritage USA site in 2004. The site was then made into MorningStar's ministry headquarters renamed Heritage International Ministries Conference Center.

In 2009 Rick Joyner discussed plans for the tower with WCNC Charlotte which included the possibility for it to become a retirement home complete with in-house services and amenities like dental care a pool and a health club.

Joyner told us at the time it would be aimed at seniors seeking to further their own faith-based missions later in life.

But the tower already crumbling and in poor condition had already dodged a date with the wrecking ball. In 2012 WCNC Charlotte reported MorningStar planned to file a lawsuit against York County if repair plans weren't accepted. The county claimed MorningStar violated a 5-year-old development agreement requiring MorningStar to fix the tower or use their own money to tear it down.

In 2018 the fate of the tower moved to federal court. In their lawsuit MorningStar Ministries said religious discrimination from York County was part of the issues they faced. MorningStar said emails from county leaders painted them as the ""old PTL"" and made claims the ministry was trying to bilk investors of their money.

In August 2020 both parties reached a mutual agreement to dismiss all the legal back and forth.

In June of 2021 MorningStar said the tower would be renovated and transformed into a Christian retirement community. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in June 2021 but WCNC Charlotte learned from York County no building permits had been filed. A month later the county filed a new lawsuit.

This past year the collapse of the Christian empire was revisited on the big screens when the movie ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" premiered last fall.

He started working for the family of future President Lyndon Baines Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson at Austin's KTBC in 1956 just 16 years after Lowell Thomas hosted the first-ever regularly scheduled news broadcast on television in 1940.

The Johnson-owned KTBC founded in 1952 remained the only VHF TV channel in Austin until 1965. Its program director late humorist Cactus Pryor cherry-picked the best shows from the national networks — CBS ABC NBC and before 1956 the now-gone Dumont Television Network.

Born in 1936 Spelce is perhaps best known as the newsman who broadcast live on the scene as Charles Whitman shot anyone who moved from his roost atop the University of Texas Tower on Aug. 1 1966. His voice was heard across America as the first mass shooting on a college campus exploded all around him.

Spelce also enjoyed a long career as a TV news anchor and a media consultant. Along the way he met the famous and the infamous sweetening each encounter with a bit of his Arkansas country charm.

Tower Books UT Press and the Briscoe Center for American History recently joined forces to publish his lively memoir ""With the Bark Off"" a phrase that LBJ used when he opened the LBJ Presidential Library in 1971 as he promised a ""warts and all"" access to history.

I interviewed Spelce as soon as I finished the last page of this intriguing set of yarns that is also filled with crucial Texas Austin and American history.

American-Statesman: You started your broadcast journalism career at an amazingly young age right out of UT’s journalism school. To what do you attribute your fast start?

Neal Spelce: First of all TV news was in its early stages. Very few experienced hands were in the business. You didn't need any technological expertise. In fact the first camera I used to cover a story was a black-and-white still Polaroid that took one picture at a time and you had to wait to see the image.

More:Statesman at 150: Who was D.E. Kissman and how did she land so many letters in the Austin newspaper?

As far as content we pretty much had a blank slate and only 15 minutes to fill. Good journalism though was the undisputed standard. By the way (humorist) Cactus Pryor told me: ""Neal you started at the right time. Back then you didn't have to be good-looking to be on TV.""

For decades you worked closely with the Johnson family who owned a powerful radio station KLBJ and for a while the only VHF TV station KTBC in town. How did that affect your reporting of the news?

The daily challenge was simply to do the best job you could. The Johnson family kept hands-off the news operation. We were free to excel — or screw up. I do recall getting a call from (a) Time magazine (reporter) who was surprised when we led our prime newscast about a scandal involving the LBJ administration. I didn't think a thing about it. Why not cover the scandal? It was the biggest story of the day.

I was fascinated by your stories about the early TV years and how you shared material with your colleagues in other Texas cities making up an informal statewide news network. What was that like?

We were ahead of our time before technological advances showed just how primitive our effort was. My fellow TV news directors — Eddie Barker (KRLD-TV Dallas) Dan Rather (KHOU-TV Houston) and Al Anderson (WOAI-TV San Antonio) — shared our top stories of the day with one another.

More:Texas history: When Texans read their news in German

How did we do that? Well we made black-and-white film duplicates of our stories stowed them in yellow grapefruit sacks and handed the bags to flight attendants on the local Trans-Texas Airways flights — fondly called ""Tree-Top Airways"" — to be grabbed upon arrival by our local TV staffers.

Bingo! Each of our stations had statewide content long before satellites and other means of instant communication made it simple. I was really proud of our pioneering effort.

One of the most charming aspects of the book is your modesty. Most of the jokes are on you. Was this your secret weapon? And if so please share a story related to your lack of ego.

I don't know if it's a secret weapon. Believe me TV can be pretty humbling. Your mistakes your flaws are hanging out there for everyone to see.

Basically I love humor — especially the self-deprecating kind. I mean why not join others in laughing at you? I also am a great believer in candor. I don't agree with that old political bromide about ""sincerity: once you learn to fake that you've got it made!""

Maybe that works for politicians but not for on-camera personalities. Viewers can see through that deception night after night. No sir I believe in telling it ""With The Bark Off"" like the title of my memoir. And if you are not cast in the best light well that's just the way it is.

For 90 minutes are or so yours was the voice that everyone in America tuned in to hear as your live report of the UT Tower shooting on Aug. 1 1966 was broadcast around the country. So many articles books and movies have retold that story but you were not only there but in the line of fire. What do we still get wrong about Charles Whitman and the Tower shooting?

The more I think about it the more I realize what we get wrong is ""why."" This event has been reported and analyzed over and over during the past 56 years. And I have been a part of many of those reports.

Oh there have been many conclusions put forth about ""why"" one man killed 15 people and badly injured 31 others. A brain tumor? Brain experts dismissed that. Hatred of his father? True the sniper wrote about that. But does hatred of one man in Florida lead his son to climb to the top of Austin's UT Tower and commit the worst mass school shooting in history at that time?

Guns? Yes he was a military marksman but he had never had a previous firearms conviction. Mental derangement? Of course something was wrong but what exactly? Pure evil? That has also been suggested just as have other theories. After a half-century I'm afraid the definitive ""why"" will never be known.

I love your Darrell Royal stories. Please recount the encounter with truckers in an Oklahoma bar.

Darrell Royal was one of the greatest college football coaches of all time. And even though a former president of the United States thought Darrell had all the qualities to become a leader of the Free World Darrell was as down-to-earth a person as you will find.

Let me give you an example. Darrell and I were invited to attend a ceremony in tiny Chickasha Oklahoma. He grew up in Oklahoma and folks there treated him like a rock star. After the hugely attended ceremony they invited us to a banquet.

More:Look in your own backyard for unexpected authentic Texas

Darrell declined and instead called an old friend and suggested we go have a beer before returning to Austin. His friend whose name I never did get took us to a little roadhouse bar out in the country where lots of 18-wheelers were parked outside a modest frame house.

After a while I played some country songs on the juke box that Darrell might like. Darrell by then was talking to some truckers. When I walked over to Darrell one of the truckers looked at me and asked ""Is this guy a friend of yours? Says he's Darrell Royal. That right?"" Yep I said. ""No he's not he's a trucker.""

He didn't believe me or Darrell. Turns out Darrell had been talking truck talk to these guys not a word about football. Typical Darrell. By then I asked Darrell if he was ready to leave. He said we needed to wait for his friend who had gone to the back of the roadhouse bar. Not sure but I think we were drinking beer in a whorehouse.

You were chosen to plan the grand opening of the LBJ Presidential Library in 1971. What’s your favorite anecdote from that challenging event?

You don't mean the times LBJ chewed my butt out? Or the time I lied to President Richard Nixon right?

Actually one of my favorite incidents in retrospect had to do with the powerful chairman of the UT Board of Regents Frank Erwin. Erwin was responsible for UT building the LBJ Library. As such I answered to him as well as to LBJ.

For purposes of this story you need to know Erwin was no amateur when it came to drinking. So when he suggested the thousand VIP guests would want a drink after the noontime ceremony I said ""Mr. Chairman we can't do that."" It was illegal at that time to serve whiskey on UT property. What if we get busted?

""OK Neal I understand."" That was that. I thought. But at the moment the nationally televised ceremony ended with a flourish bartenders wheeled out portable bars fully stocked with premium brands all over the library area. Whiskey flowed.

I went looking for Erwin. He just looked at me and grinned sipping a Scotch. I won't mention what I muttered under my breath. Not sure if he paid for the liquor personally or somehow hid the expenditure inside the UT budget. Wouldn't be surprised either way.

Here’s a part of your amazing life that I didn’t know about: You coached the TV convention speeches or debate appearances of Mario Cuomo Ann Richards John McCain and Sarah Palin. What are the highlights of your advice to all of them?

John McCain admitted he was not a good speaker. The others were excellent speakers. But my advice to all four was the same.

Look a speech to thousands of screaming applauding convention-goers is a very disconcerting experience. It can knock you off your game. And the audience in the convention hall is supportive no matter if you belch mid-sentence.

The most important audience is the millions of TV viewers sitting in the relative quiet of their homes. When talking to a massive crowd the natural tendency is to speak loudly — to be heard. But Joe and Jane SixPack sitting at home don't wanna be yelled at.

So my advice was simple: Treat the momentous speech as a one-to-one conversation. Don’t try to win the William Jennings Bryan Oratory Award. Don't make it a performance. Be conversational. Keep an even tone. Persuasive. Convincing. Candid. Believable. Look directly into the TV camera so you come across as speaking directly intimately with the viewer.

There’s so much history in this book that we can’t elaborate on here but among the other personalities and world leaders that you interacted with who were the most memorable and why?

Oh my Michael there were so many. For many different reasons. But since you pin me down I have to single out John McCain.

He wasn't a president or a world leader or a well-known cultural celebrity. But he was so genuine — someone you enjoy sitting down with and sharing stories over a beer — which we did.

But more than that after he told me during a small quiet dinner about the torture and horrors he endured as a prisoner of war I saw deeply into the man's character. Let me tell you the word ""respect"" is way too weak when I think about what this man went through.

Feisty yes. Resolute even more so. Determined most certainly. And the understanding of his own failings and strengths came through loud and clear. Memorable? Oh yeah by all means.

The book is peppered with sound lessons for budding journalists — congrats by the way on the naming of the Neal Spelce Broadcast Journalism Studio 4E at UT's Moody College of Communications — but how would you condense those lessons into a few sentences?

This may be naïve and Pollyanna-ish but to be a successful and respected journalist you must be objective thorough and fair with personal biases removed as far as possible from your reporting.

For those who aspire to be a TV journalist first learn to write carefully crafted coherent reports. The word ""write"" is all-important. It's not enough to look good and have a gift of gab.

Writing gives structure to your thoughts. And builds your skills for ad-libbing.

•First Place – “The Pickle Tower” submitted by Dutchtown Middle School Students Cahleb Thornton Shiv Patel Kush Patel and David Bui; teacher Debbie Sechrist.

•Second Place – the “Cup of Water” submitted by Chrisette Small from Austin Road Middle School; teacher Garynne Parks.

•Third Place – “Chug Away” submitted by Carter Ivey from Locust Grove Middle School; teacher Christy Collier.

•Best Interview & Presentation was awarded to “The Mushroom House” submitted by Mina Nguyen Vivian Tran Alicia Truong and Keyani Furtch from Dutchtown Middle School.

•Best Engineering Design also was awarded to the aforementioned team from Dutchtown Middle School for “The Mushroom House.”

•Most Artistic Design was awarded to Caeden Henry from Austin Road Middle School for his “Senor Eggington” model water tower.

Winners received gift cards t-shirts and certificates of achievement for their award-winning entries. The competition was held virtually as students dropped off their model towers at HCWA Headquarters for judging by the Authority’s staff followed by interviews held virtually as well.

The purpose of the Georgia Model Water Tower Competition is to challenge Middle School students across the state to design and build functioning model water towers according to specific size and height requirements. The student towers are judged based on three primary criteria – structural efficiency hydraulic efficiency and design ingenuity. The towers may be designed and constructed from any materials although students are rewarded for using creative designs and recycled materials such as everyday household items.

The Henry County Georgia Model Water Tower Competition is one of several regional competitions held across the state. The annual event which reinforces STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) curricula middle school students learn in the classroom is sponsored by the Georgia Section of the American Water Works Association (GAWWA) and the Georgia Association of Water Professionals (GAWP).

“The greatest benefit of the competition is to make students more aware of the importance of reliable drinking water and water conservation while introducing them to the various career opportunities we have in the water profession” says Lindsey Sanders HCWA Environmental Compliance Coordinator who organized the event locally. “We were very pleased with the level of participation and the experiential learning that took place. We’re looking forward to continued growth of the event as we are already planning for another successful competition next year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdS1zLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWZhY2VzLWNyaXNpcy1pbi1oYXdhaWktYWZ0ZXItbGVhay1wb2lzb25zLXdhdGVyL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvdS1zLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWZhY2VzLWNyaXNpcy1pbi1oYXdhaWktYWZ0ZXItbGVhay1wb2lzb25zLXdhdGVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. military faces crisis in Hawaii after jet fuel leak poisons water,"In the first six weeks since the water crisis emerged the Navy spent more than $250 million addressing the public health emergency.

“Frankly it’s been a nightmare and a disaster. A total disaster” said U.S. Rep. Kaiali‘i Kahele.

Kahele a combat pilot who still serves as an officer in the Hawaii National Guard is the lawmaker who characterized the crisis as astronomical at a hearing in December. An admiral said that the Navy takes the blame.

“The Navy caused this problem we own it and we’re gonna fix it” Navy Rear Adm. Blake Converse the deputy Pacific Fleet commander told lawmakers last month.

The military built the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the early 1940s by excavating caverns within the mountain ridge to protect 20 fuel tanks from aerial attacks. Each tank is about the height of a 25-story building and can hold 12.5 million gallons (47.32 million liters.)

The tanks are connected to underground pipelines that send fuel about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) to Pearl Harbor and to ships and planes used by the Air Force Army Coast Guard Marines and Navy.

The Navy hasn’t determined how petroleum got in the water. Officials are investigating a theory that jet fuel spilled from a ruptured pipe last May and somehow entered a fire suppression system drain pipe. They suspect fuel then leaked from the second pipe on Nov. 20 sending it into the drinking water well.

Within a week military families started complaining about health problems.

Lauren Wright remembers her skin peeling feeling nauseous and vomiting. Her symptoms disappeared only when she stopped drinking showering and washing dishes with her home’s water.

“I’m a proud Navy spouse but this is not right — to do this to your families” she said.

Since early December Wright her sailor husband and their three children ages 7 to 17 have been among the thousands of military families living in Honolulu hotels paid for by the Navy so they can have clean water.

The Navy has been trying to clear petroleum from the contaminated well and pump it out of the aquifer. Officials are also flushing clean water through the Navy’s water system — which serves 93000 people in military homes and offices in and around Pearl Harbor. Teams have separately visited homes and workplaces to flush individual water pipe systems.

But Wright said Marines sent to flush a neighbor’s home received two days of training failed to follow a checklist for the work and had to be taught how to do the job by a neighbor with expertise.

“We’re all afraid that we are going to be forced into our toxic homes and go right back to it” she said.

The first major complaints about the fuel complex came in 2014 when 27000 gallons (123000 liters) leaked from one tank but didn’t get into the drinking water.

The Navy blamed contractor error and ineffective oversight. The Sierra Club of Hawaii and Honolulu’s water utility warned leaks could seep into one of Honolulu’s most important drinking water aquifers located just 100 feet (30 meters) below the tanks but the Navy resisted calls to move the facility.

The aquifer normally supplies more than 20% of the water consumed in the city. After the latest spill Honolulu’s water utility shut off three wells to prevent petroleum from migrating through the aquifer into the utility’s drinking water.",,,,,,

[IMSAI Guy] saw a batch of OP-07 laser-trimmed op-amps at a bargain price so picked them up for an investigation. You can take a look at the video below the break.

A perfect op-amp has a zero volt output when both of its inputs are at the same voltage but in practice no real device approaches this level of perfection. It’s referred to as the offset voltage and for instrumentation work where a low offset voltage is important there are parts such as the OP-07 which have each been adjusted using a laser to trim their components for the lowest offset. This process is expensive so naturally so are genuine OP-07s.

Identifying real versus fake op-amps in this case is as simple as hooking the chip up as a unity gain non-inverting amplifier and measuring the voltage on the output (we can’t help a tinge of envy at that Keithley 2015 THD multimeter!) from which measurement the fakes should be clearly visible. First up are some 741s with their > 1 mV offsets (though an outlier 741 had a 40μV offset) to show what a cheap op-amp could be expected to do then we see the OP-07s. Immediately with an offset of > 1.2 mV we can tell that they’re fake which as he admits for the price is hardly a surprise. Meanwhile we’ll keep an eye out for Korean-made 741s like the outlier low-offset device.

If you’re interested by op-amp internals may we suggest a look at the first IC op-amp meanwhile this isn’t the first fake chip we’ve seen.

Washington DC – In an era of hyper-partisanship in the United States a new bipartisan consensus appeared to emerge on Capitol Hill this week: condemning Amnesty International over its report accusing Israel of committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians.

Dozens of US lawmakers from both major parties including powerful legislators and heads of key committees in the House of Representatives and Senate have released statements rejecting Amnesty’s findings – with some accusing the group of fuelling antisemitism.

These forceful condemnations analysts say illustrate the level of support Israel enjoys in Washington despite mounting allegations of abuse – but they do not reduce the validity of the rights group’s report.

“They want to nip this in the bud but the bud has already broken ground and developed roots and it’s going to be a losing battle on their part” said James Zogby president of the Arab American Institute (AAI) a Washington-based think tank.

Zogby told Al Jazeera that domestic political pressures have compelled many legislators to condemn the Amnesty report but the group’s status and international credibility make it difficult to dismiss its conclusion that Israel is systematically oppressing Palestinians.

He added that while many US legislators are demonising the report and accusing Amnesty International of bias they have not discussed specific allegations. “They’ve decided to just focus on the use of the word ‘apartheid’ because that’s the only case they can make … ‘How dare you use apartheid to describe Israel.'”

Amnesty’s findings

In its February 1 report Amnesty said Israel is committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT) as well as within Israel. Human Rights Watch Israeli rights group B’Tselem and Palestinian rights groups have all reached the same conclusion.

“Israel has imposed a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians wherever it exercises control over the enjoyment of their rights – across Israel and the OPT and with regard to Palestinian refugees” Amnesty’s report (PDF) reads.

“The segregation is conducted in a systematic and highly institutionalized manner through laws policies and practices all intended to prevent Palestinians from claiming and enjoying equal rights to Jewish Israelis within Israel and the OPT and thus intended to oppress and dominate the Palestinian people.”

The response from US Congress members was swift.

A day after the report was released nine centrist House Democrats including former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz called it “baseless” “biased” and “steeped in antisemitism” saying it was “part of Amnesty’s broad decades-long campaign to criminalize and delegitimize the world’s only Jewish state”.

Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin also attacked the rights group. “Amnesty International is a so-called ‘human rights organization’ that routinely hurls false accusations of oppression against Israel ignores violent attacks on Israel from its hostile neighbors and fans the flames of antisemitism around the world” he said in a statement on the day the report was published.

The Israeli government also had called the report “false biased and antisemitic” – even before it was released.

“It’s pretty clear that these accusations of antisemitism are meant to avoid having a real conversation about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians” said Morriah Kaplan spokesperson for IfNotNow a youth-led anti-occupation US Jewish group. “And I think that it actually does a disservice to the larger and necessary fight against antisemitism.”

The chairs and ranking members of the foreign policy panels in the House and the Senate also denounced the report with Bob Menendez who leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee saying he was “deeply disturbed” by it.

“This report diminishes the very real Apartheid that brutalized Black South Africans for decades” Menendez said.

But Amnesty explicitly stated that its report does not argue that the situation in Israel-Palestine is “the same or analogous to the system of segregation oppression and domination as perpetrated in South Africa between 1948 and 1994”.

Moreover Palestinian rights supporters have pointed out that South African anti-apartheid leaders including the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu have likened the struggle of Palestinians to that of Black South Africans.

Amnesty International USA did not return Al Jazeera’s response for comment but the group released a statement in response to congressional concerns earlier this week stressing that the group’s “sole mandate” is to document human rights abuses wherever they occur.

“The US Government is uniquely placed to meaningfully pressure Israeli authorities to repeal discriminatory laws and policies issue reparations where appropriate and uphold its obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law” it said.

‘Not going away’

Meanwhile a handful of progressive Democrats explicitly endorsed or appeared to back the report through social media posts including Congresswomen Betty McCollum Cori Bush Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.

“Congress can no longer ignore or excuse Israel’s occupation & system of oppression” McCollum who has proposed a bill that would restrict Washington’s $3.8bn-a-year military aid to Israel over human rights abuses wrote in response to the report.

Palestinian rights advocates had been counting on the rise of progressives who have tried to push human rights issues to the fore within the Democratic Party to shake Washington’s unconditional support for Israel.

Kaplan of IfNotNow told Al Jazeera that the adamant opposition to the report demonstrates that rights advocates are “effectively moving the conversation” prompting Israel’s supporters to strongly defend the status quo.

“It’s showing that there are cracks that we’re pushing on the right levers but we just can’t expect for change to come overnight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b3RpbWVzLmlvLzIwMjIvMDIvMDUvbWFuY2hlc3Rlci11bml0ZWQtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC10ZXpvcy1vbi0yN20tc3BvbnNvcnNoaXAtZGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manchester United Partners with Tezos on $27M Sponsorship Deal,"In Brief:

Manchester United Unveils a $27M Sponsorship Deal with Tezos blockchain.

Tezos’ logo will appear on Manchester United’s training kits as part of the agreement.

Manchester United has started to promote the sponsorship on its club’s center.

One of the top football clubs Manchester United collaborates with Tezos blockchain on a $27 million sponsorship deal per year.

According to the Athletic’s report Tezos’ logo will be featured on Manchester United’s training kit as part of the multi-year deal.

This partnership follows Manchester United’s previous eight-year alliance with American insurance firm AON which expired at the end of last season.

The deal with AON spanned over 8 years with a combined $162M and that means Tezos is offering 33% extra than the insurance company.

“The Red Devils” have begun to promote the sponsorship on its club’s center. The Carrington ground which houses the team’s youth academy will not feature Tezos Logo.

Just last month FC Barcelona announced plans about a collaboration with the blockchain protocol Polkadot. If the partnership is finalized Polkadot will become the team’s official jersey sponsor.

Tezos is expanding its influence in the sports industry with multiple collaborations. Recently Tezos blockchain partnered with Team Vitality a global eSports group to develop a three-year fan interaction programme. It is one of the largest collaborations in European esports history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2JvbmRzL2EtcGVlay1pbnNpZGUtaW5kaWFuLWVzZy1mdW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTM4MTkwNi5jbXPSAWVodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9ib25kcy9hLXBlZWstaW5zaWRlLWluZGlhbi1lc2ctZnVuZHMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MzgxOTA2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A peek inside Indian ESG funds,"You Might Also Like: Sovereign green bonds may need to be more attractive

Globally ESG investments continue to rise. ESG assets are on track to exceed $53 trillion by 2025 and represent more than a third of the $140.5 trillion in projected total assets under management (AuM) according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Increased investor demand emerging regulatory requirements and the launch of several ESG funds have fueled a surge in ESG-focused asset allocations.The Indian investment management industry has also seen the launch of nine ESG-focused funds in the last few years. It is still early days but what can we say about this class of funds in terms of investment objectives or how they integrate ESG issues in their investment process?A recent study done by CFA Society India and CFA Institute on Indian ESG funds suggest that the ESG integration practices are understandably in relative infancy and wide variability exists across ESG funds w.r.t their investment approaches ESG scoring methodology and outcomes. For example the number of stocks in these funds ranged between 23 and 54 and many funds held a significant portion of assets outside their benchmark universe as of November 2021. They also had varying exposure to carbon intensive sectors like oil and gas with some funds exceeding the exposure vis-à-vis their benchmark.What explains this variability? One reason is the variation in ESG ratings whether based on internal analysis or sourced from third-party providers. The rating disagreements in turn reflect the heterogeneous views among market practitioners about which factors are important in assessing the ESG performance of a company. It may be impractical and undesirable to impose homogenous views on ESG but it is important for managers to be able to document and communicate reasons for disagreement especially for those stocks in the fund which are not part of the benchmark.There are also challenges with respect to issuer level disclosures. SEBI’s business responsibility and sustainability reporting (BRSR) mandates companies to produce an array of metrics but there are definitional issues which makes comparisons difficult. For example when companies say they derive a portion of energy from renewable sources they could mean either just electricity or include fuels used in production. There are also interpretational issues – if one company reports increasing sexual harassment complaints and another reports no complaints year after year does it mean the latter is doing better or is it a reflection of a more open culture of reporting in the former? It is possible to improve definitions over time but the interpretations will always remain somewhat subjective.In addition to BRSR SEBI has proposed a number of ESG rules recently relating to the improvement of ESG integration practices ESG rating providers firm level policies and disclosures by ESG funds in India.However there is a potential concern that the supply of ESG products and enabling regulations have raced ahead of investor demand. Globally asset owners like pension funds have been vociferous supporters of ESG investing  but in India their voice is still largely absent from the conversation. What about retail investors? According to a recent CFA Institute global survey of retail and institutional investors 60% of Indian investors (sample of 200 retail and 75 institutional investors) cited higher risk-adjusted returns as the primary reason for investing in ESG funds far higher than global sample (29%) and only 30% expressed personal values or making a positive impact as a reason for investing in ESG funds.To generate and sustain the growth of ESG investing there is a need for focused investor education. Investment advisors should work with investors to identify their ESG and financial preferences when recommending ESG products. Investors should do their own research and understand the investment objectives and features when investing in such products.(Sivananth Ramachandran is CFA CIPM - Director Capital Markets Policy India at CFA Institute.

A two-tier damage award of damages of $270.2 million against Broadcom and $837.8 million against Apple that involved different royalty rates from each company is “legally unsupportable"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled. The January 2020 verdict was one of the largest jury awards in a patent case in U.S. history.

The court also affirmed the jury finding that Apple and Broadcom infringed two CalTech patents but ordered a new trial of infringement on a third patent. One of the three judges on the panel said he would have thrown the whole case out believing none of the patents were infringed.

The case was remanded to a court in Los Angeles for a new trial on infringement of one patent and to determine how much Broadcom and Apple should pay.

CalTech said it was pleased that the validity of the patents and part of the infringement findings were upheld.

“This is recognition of Caltech’s inventions in the field of data communications which are now widely used in Wi-Fi products because they significantly improve the quality bandwidth and range of wireless data transmission"" the school said in a statement Friday. “We are confident that the value of the patents will be fully recognized at the damages retrial.""

Officials with Broadcom and Apple didn’t respond to queries seeking comment.

The high damage award was based in large part on the broad range of Apple products that were accused of using the university’s inventions for wireless data transmissions. The case targeted Broadcom chips and any Apple smartphone tablet or computer that that has one.

CalTech argued that it would have negotiated two licenses -- one with Broadcom for chips that weren’t sold to Apple and then with Apple for the devices that included Broadcom chips “at a vastly different royalty rate"" according to the opinion.

“The mere fact that Broadcom and Apple are separate infringers alone does not support treating the same chips differently at different stages in the supply chain and does not justify submitting such a two-tier damage theory to the jury"" the Federal Circuit ruled.

“In the absence of a compelling showing otherwise a higher royalty is not available for the same device at a different point in the supply chain"" according to the court.

In an unrelated case involving patent claims against Apple a different three-judge Federal Circuit panel ordered a new trial on damages in a $85.23 million verdict won by Quarterhill Inc.’s Wi-Lan over a way to allocate bandwidth in wireless communications.

The court ruled that Wi-Lan’s damages expert used a “flawed"" methodology that was “untethered to the facts of this case"" but also that the trial court erred in ruling that Apple iPhones with Intel Corp. chips had a perpetual license to the Wi-Lan patent.

The cases are California Institute v Broadcom 20-2222 and Apple Inc. v. Wi-Lan Inc. 20-2011 both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington).

AUSTIN Texas — For the last couple of days Central Texas has experienced freezing temperatures. While many have a place to stay warm there are others sleeping out in the cold.

Bianca Bangor is currently experiencing homelessness. The summer of 2019 was when it all started.

""We had never been homeless before"" said Bangor. ""We got this desperate feeling that we never felt before.""

She ended up finding a place to live but about two weeks ago she and her family were asked to leave their home. They were struggling to pay rent and the landlord told them to pack up their things.

""We tried to see if we could you know afford any other places"" said Bangor. ""At this point it's not something that we could do.""

Now they're back to being homeless. She and her husband were able to sleep at her parent's home but they couldn't stay there for long and with the winter storm coming they knew they had to find a place.

""It's been a struggle trying to find enough money to pay for the room each night"" she said.

Bangor said once the temperatures go back up she and her family will start camping.

""As soon as it gets warm enough we're just going to be camping you know at a campsite somewhere"" said Bangor. ""If it was the summer we would have just gone straight there. You know we have a nice tent. We would have found a camp place. We would have figured it out and it would have helped us save money.""

Bangor is happy she had a warm place to stay but she can't help but think about those who don't.

""There are thousands of people in the streets at this point"" said Bangor. ""Just waiting for a possibility of a place to live and just intense and freezing.""

Bangor is tight on money and with two dogs she's doing everything she can to pay for another night inside.

The City of Austin activated its Cold Weather Shelter Plan on Saturday Feb. 5 in anticipation of a widespread freeze overnight. For more information on how to get help click here.

AUSTIN Texas — A city-wide precautionary boil water notice has been issued for all Austin Water customers the utility provider announced late Saturday.

Any water used from plumbing systems should be boiled before drinking or cooking with it according to the City's boil guidelines.

Austin Water's Ullrich Water Treatment Plant was out of service due to ""an internal treatment process issue that resulted in high turbidity within the plant"" a release from the utility provider stated. As of Sunday the Ullrich Water Treatment Plant was back online and fully operational.

Austin Water Director Greg Meszaros provided updates on the situation during press conferences on Saturday and Sunday nights. On Saturday he said the issue arose when the Ullrich plant experienced a ""treatment process upset"" that resulted in a spike in the water's turbidity.

Meszaros said water turbidity is a measure of the water's clarity with higher turbidity meaning that the water appears murkier.

He said the company has been working with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality throughout the weekend regarding the turbidity spike which led to the decision to issue the boil notice Saturday night. Meszaros said Saturday that the spike was a ""low-level"" event with no water contamination reported.

""We have no indication that there's a contamination"" he said Saturday. ""This was a very short-term event internal process water very low risk but regulations are regulations and we have to do this boil water notice.""

According to Meszaros the ""turbidity spike"" went out to the public for nearly 30 minutes.

In Sunday's press conference Meszaros said there are five steps to get through in order to rescind the notice:

Get Ullrich Water Treatment Plant back online Ullrich is operating at normal production levels Water sampling begins Water sampling results show no water quality issues TCEQ authorizes lifting the boil water notice

As of Sunday evening Austin Water had completed the first two steps of the five Meszaros said. During steps three through four Austin Water will gather samples and submit them to the TCEQ so the agency can authorize rescinding the boil water notice. Meszaros said the target date to receive authorization from the TCEQ to rescind the boil water notice was by the end of day on Tuesday Feb. 8.

We know you're wondering when the Boil Water Notice will end. Here are the steps that are involved with lifting the notice. We're hoping to check them all off by end of day Tuesday. pic.twitter.com/RxRIFqYMG8 — Austin Water (@AustinWater) February 7 2022

Possible human error

Meszaros told KVUE Senior Reporter Tony Plohetski on Sunday morning that officials believe the boil water notice may have been the result of human error but cautioned that information is preliminary.

He said that the issue appears to ""a staff operations issue"" and ""how we operate the plant.""

""We will go through a review of our data and interview people and do other steps to see what happened with the operations"" he said. ""I don't want to speculate on details until we go through that process.""

The incident did not have to do with the recent winter storm that moved through the area earlier this week and Meszaros said the timing between the storm and the incident was a coincidence.

""This did not have to do with the winter storm. We were through that event and actually were feeling pretty celebratory that everything went well and then today we had this event"" he said. ""Nothing suggests that this is related to the winter storm.""

The incident itself had to do with an internal process at the plant and not any issue with the river water Meszaros clarified. Other systems at the plant are still functioning at this time including the disinfection system and the Ullrich plant was cleaned and ready to restart operations on Sunday.

In Sunday evening's press conference Meszaros said it had ""become clearer"" that the notice resulted from errors with the operating staff at the Ullrich plant. He said that an operational issue like this has never happened before and called the situation unacceptable.

Austin Water will hold water distribution events in the coming days with two distribution sites open now Meszaros said. One is open at the Glen Bell Service Center located at 3907 S. Industrial Drive and another at the North Service Center at 901 Koenig Lane. More distribution sites are expected to open Sunday.

Questions from City Council

City of Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the issue ""will be over in a couple of days"" in a statement.

""We all need to do our part when something like this happens and we will. We can also be frustrated as I am that there's yet another situation to deal with"" Mayor Steve Adler said in a release. ""We can be thankful too that the situation was noticed quickly and steps taken any public health risk is very very small and we're much better prepared right now with equipment and supplies as we open water distribution stations. It appears this will be over in a couple of days and the city will keep everyone informed along the way. Please help your neighbors.""

A City-wide boil water notice has been issued effective immediately. Customers are advised to boil water for 2 minutes before consuming. More at https://t.co/8tvi6PPNeP pic.twitter.com/hO1zQ8Xb07 — Austin Water (@AustinWater) February 6 2022

The boil water notice has also begun triggering demand for answers among Austin city councilmembers who are seeking a meeting as early as this week for water utility officials to explain what happened.

The notice was the city's third in five years. The first city-wide boil water notice ever occurred in 2018 following a flood event. The utility also issued a notice last year during the historic winter storm.

""I intend to hold the manager accountable for implementing any necessary changes as soon as possible and developing a communication process with the public and the council to provide people information they need when they need it"" City Councilmember Kathie Tovo said.

Austin Water is maintaining water service to customers by increasing water production at Davis and Handcox Water Treatment Plants and by ""carefully managing pumping"" within the network of water pipelines. No power disruptions have occurred at drinking water plants the provider said.

Conservation requirements lifted

Meszaros issued emergency water use restrictions starting at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday. As of Monday evening conservations requirements have been lifted.

Customers were previously asked to cut down on indoor water use as much as possible and all outdoor water use was prohibited until further notice according to the release.

Meanwhile commercial customers were required to reduce water use unless needed for health and safety. Manufacturing customers specifically those that use an average of over 100000 gallons per day are asked to reduce water use as much as possible.

As of Monday all three water treatment plants are fully operational and are producing normal volumes of water. Austin Water also received approval from the state to begin the water sampling process also known as Step 3.

The boil water notice and emergency water use restrictions are in effect for retail customers of Austin Water Wholesale Districts and utilities including:

ADM,Archer-Daniels-Midland,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVkaW5naGVhcnRsYW5kLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L25vdy1pcy10aGUtdGltZS10by1hY3QtYWdhaW5zdC1jYXJib24tcGlwZWxpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Now is the time to act against carbon pipelines,"Jessica Wiskus is a rural landowner in Linn County whose property lies in Navigator’s proposed pipeline route.

You may have heard about the three proposals to build carbon pipelines crossing Iowa: one by Summit Carbon Solutions one by Navigator CO 2 Ventures and the newest for the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM). My neighbors and I in eastern Iowa are standing together to fight these pipelines (see “Against Navigator Pipeline” on YouTube with more than 2000 views). Here’s why.

Carbon pipelines have known safety concerns. Ongoing research using explosions in controlled environments seeks to determine the impact of ruptures. We do know that at concentrations of 10-15 percent carbon dioxide causes loss of consciousness convulsions coma or death. Accidents sometimes happen (see the pipeline rupture outside of Satartia Mississippi in 2020).

Our communities are vulnerable.

Installation of a pipeline wrecks the integrity of our land ruining soil structure and lowering yields. The threat of eminent domain to seize farmland for these projects undermines the property rights of the very farmers who supply grain to the ethanol plants.

Finally carbon capture and sequestration is not necessary to secure ethanol’s future as a low-carbon fuel. No one knows this better than ADM. The company’s own Carbon Reduction Feasibility Study from March 2020 concluded that carbon capture and sequestration is the least effective option for lowering their greenhouse gas emissions.

Why? Because while carbon capture is supposed to address the carbon dioxide from the fermentation of corn the real problem for ADM is the carbon dioxide emitted from coal-fired energy production. Coal is responsible for 70 percent of the company’s on-site emissions. That’s why ADM’s own report recommended that the company wean itself off coal and tighten up efficiency.

In other words ADM already has a plan to stop the majority of its carbon emissions from being generated. The company can lower its carbon footprint without attempting to bury sins by shoving a toxic waste transportation system through Iowa farmland.

Another large producer of bioethanol POET published a Sustainability Report in 2021 that also suggests multiple ways to address climate change without carbon capture and sequestration.

It is plain that carbon pipelines are dangerous destructive and unnecessary. The real reason corporations are aiming to capture carbon dioxide from ethanol plants is not for ethanol’s sake but because ethanol is a “pure” and inexpensive source of liquid CO 2  which the oil and gas industry uses to extract more fossil fuels in a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

It’s no coincidence that the proposed pipelines connect Illinois and North Dakota. That builds a national system transporting carbon dioxide from the biofuels industry to where the oil and gas industry needs it most.

One example from researchers at Princeton University with funding by BP and Exxon showing the capture of CO 2 from biofuels and other sources transported for fossil fuel recovery. “A key early enabler of cost-effective CCS is anticipated through enhanced oil recovery (EOR)” the report states (“CO 2 Transport and Storage Infrastructure transition analysis” December 2020).

We can keep our state from becoming a toxic waste transportation system. Republican State Senator Jeff Taylor of Sioux Center has introduced a bill (Senate File 2160) that would stop the use of eminent domain for private projects. The bill has been assigned to the Iowa Senate Commerce Committee and needs our support since no subcommittee hearing has been scheduled.

We the people can make our voices heard and protect our land and our communities. Please—today—call State Senator Jason Schultz (712-269-2178 or 515-281-3371) who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee. Let him know that you want Senate File 2160 to pass.

Also call your local Iowa House or Senate members (you can find contact information here). Please tell them you support SF 2160 and expect protection from the threat of eminent domain now—before these corporations have shoved their pipelines through our ground.

I believe we can succeed if we stand shoulder to shoulder. Your neighbors will thank you and I thank you for helping to protect the communities and the land we love.

Netflix’s latest true-crime hit follows a group of women who attempt to track down a dating app user who tricked them out of millions of dollars.

As many watched the series that exposed Shimon Hayut’s crimes he swiftly deleted his social media account.

The series estimates that over the years Hayut (known to his victims as Simon Leviev) stole $10m (£7.4m) after luring his victims with expensive dates in order to gain their trust.

Hayut went on to serve just five months of his 15-month prison sentence. Ahead of the deletion of his instagram account he was criticised for posting numerous photos depicting a lavish lifestyle including multiple holidays and designer clothes.

His account gained 200000 followers days after the documentary was released on the streaming service.

Before deleting the app he thanked his followers for their “support” adding: “I will share my side of the story in the next few days when I have sorted out the best and most respectful way to tell it both to the involved parties and myself.”

He then stated: “ Until then please keep an open mind and heart.”

The Tinder Swindler regularly posted videos of his lavish lifestyle before deleting Instagram (Instagram)

The Tinder Swindler which was released on Wednesday (2 February) has proved a Netflix hit.

This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as presented in the recent SEC filings providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of AJG's market position and potential investment value.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Le président de la République en déplacement au ministère de l’Intérieur dans la soirée d’hier samedi 5 février 2022 s’est adressé au ministre Taoufik Charfeddine assurant qu’il était nécessaire de lutter contre le trafic de drogue qui ne cesse de détruire la société.

Le président de la République a assuré que cette question est d’une très grande importance « Ils veulent porter atteinte à l’Etat et à la société. Ils veulent empêcher les jeunes de réfléchir à leur avenir comme il se doit. Ils veulent les empêcher de rêver. Il faut mettre un terme à ce fléau et faire face à ces réseaux responsables des diffamations et des dénigrements ».

Dans un autre contexte le président de la République a assuré qu’il existait encore des plans d’assassinats soulignant qu’il ne craint pas ces menaces et que la mort était bien meilleure que la vie sans dignité. Il a ajouté qu’aucun retour en arrière ne serait possible et que le banditisme de certains ne passera pas sans reddition de comptes.

His attacker is now suing the venue but not the comic. (Evan Agostini / Invision / Associated Press)

The man who tackled comedian Dave Chappelle onstage two years ago has sued the Hollywood Bowl and its security team alleging negligent security and battery.

Isaiah Lee who pleaded no contest to charges relating to the 2022 incident and was sentenced to jail because of it alleged in a civil lawsuit that security guards employed at the venue for the ""Dave Chappelle and Friends"" event pulled Lee off of Chappelle and began beating him ruthlessly spitting on him and dislocating his arm intentionally.

In a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday — exactly two years after the incident — the 25-year-old who identifies as bisexual and has experienced homelessness said he tackled Chappelle after ""The Dreamer"" star ""unleashed a barrage of homophobic and transphobic jokes"" and joked about homelessness during the inaugural Netflix Is a Joke comedy festival. The complaint obtained Monday by The Times said Lee ""became upset by the discriminatory nature of the comedian's jokes and rushed the stage in protest as the show ended.""

""Instead of intervening to protect Lee [the defendants] allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee"" the lawsuit said. The complaint also said that a knife fell out of Lee's pocket well after the altercation was underway and that its presence ""did not justify the force"" used against him.

Jonathan D. Evans Lee's attorney argued that the Hollywood Bowl and the unidentified ""Doe"" security companies were aware of Chappelle's history of making offensive jokes that target the LGBTQ+ community as well as his ""propensity for making discriminatory remarks"" but ""took no measures to prevent or mitigate the potential harm caused by such offensive material."" The firebrand comic who is not listed as a defendant in Lee's lawsuit made headlines for months ahead of the incident because of jokes he made in his 2021 Netflix special ""The Closer"" which resulted in an employee walkout for the streaming giant and broad criticism of Chappelle's work.

""We cannot comment on ongoing legal matters"" a spokesperson for the Hollywood Bowl said Monday in a statement to The Times. ""However the safety and security of our audience and artists are of the utmost importance to the Hollywood Bowl. Security procedures are updated regularly to provide the safest possible environment for those who attend and perform at the Bowl.”

A spokesperson for Chappelle did not immediately respond Monday to The Times' request for comment.

Any company the Bowl might contract with for security could not be contacted for comment due to lack of identification.

Lee's attack occurred only months after Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on live television at the 94th Academy Awards and violence reaching onstage was one of many issues concerning live performers at the time.

According to previous reporting Lee emerged from the Bowl audience on May 3 2022 and appeared to lower his head and charge Chappelle knocking the Emmy-winning actor backward. Lee then fled to the back of the stage where he was apprehended by security and sustained minor injuries. Chappelle who was not hurt later made quips about Lee and the incident and how the events played out.

Lee pleaded no contest to one charge of misdemeanor battery and one charge of entering a restricted area during a live event and was sentenced in December 2022 to nearly nine months in county jail. He completed his sentence and is currently in a transitional living facility his attorney confirmed Monday to The Times.

In the lawsuit Evans argued that the security company employed by the Bowl ""had a duty to exercise due care"" in the performance of its security services and failed to reasonably perform them resulting in the injuries suffered by Lee.

Instead of detaining or arresting Lee using a reasonable amount of force or intervening to protect him from the beating the security company ""allowed members of the comedian's entourage encouraged by the comedian to beat Lee senselessly"" the complaint said. Employees of the security company ""joined in the beating"" and ""took no action to prevent it the assault"" the document said.

""As a direct and proximate result of the above-mentioned conduct of and omissions by Defendants ... [Lee] was placed in great fear for his physical well being and has suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain suffering anguish fright nervousness anxiety grief shock humiliation indignity embarrassment and apprehension all to his damage in a sum to be determined at trial"" the complaint said.

The filing also said that Lee ""was placed in great fear for his physical well being suffered and continues to suffer extreme mental and physical pain anxiety humiliation and apprehension among other issues. He has since experienced a significant loss of enjoyment of life and his injuries required immediate surgery it said and he cannot fully use his shoulder or engage in certain physical activities that he regularly did before the incident.

Lee is seeking a judgment against the defendants in a jury trial as well an unspecified amount in damages coverage of his medical and related expenses legal fees and further relief the suit said.

""He’s not after a set dollar amount. He just wants the security company or whoever else was beating him twisting his arm out of socket and spitting on him to answer for going overboard"" Evans said Monday in an email to The Times. ""He should have been detained and taken into custody. That’s it. What the security guards did to him and allowed others to do him goes beyond the scope of what’s acceptable.""

(1:09)

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program. During this three-week period coaches are allowed to work with players on the field and teams are allowed to run plays at a walk-through pace under certain conditions.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

ADP,Automatic Data Processing,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlYmlnZGF0YS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNS8zLXdheXMtYWktYW5kLW1hY2hpbmUtbGVhcm5pbmctYXJlLWhlbHBpbmctaW52b2ljZXMtcHJvY2Vzc2luZy1hdXRvbWF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Ways AI and Machine Learning are Helping Invoices Processing Automation,"by

AI and machine learning have come a long way over the past few years. But are businesses efficiently implementing them to simplify processes increase productivity and reduce error margins? Data suggests that the answer is no – especially in the financial sector.

Data from April 2020 shows that the most widespread use of AI in financial services pertained to fraud detection with 58% of businesses using it for this process. This number is followed by:

41% of respondents using AI for finance processes and analysis

33% for cybersecurity

33% for personalization of products and services

31% for customer care; and

25% for asset maintenance.

From these numbers it’s clear to see that there’s one task where AI and machine learning may help businesses save both time and money: invoice processing automation.

So how exactly can AI and ML help businesses improve the process? Let’s look at the three ways the two can help invoice processing automation.

Speeding up Invoice Processing

One of the most significant gains of implementing AI or ML in invoice processing is of course speeding up the task.

Data suggests that the average time between receiving and settling an invoice for a small to mid-size company is 25 days. Automation however can significantly shorten the process. Some fintech companies even go as far as to state that their solutions cut down on invoice processing time by 5-10x confining the entire process to 3-5 days.

Of course it’s not just time that businesses gain by implementing the right AI and ML solutions. They also stand to make significant savings.

According to Finanz Nachrichten manually processing invoices can cost up to $30 on the AP (accounts payable) side and $4 on the AR (accounts receivable) side. Based on the survey discussed in this article e-invoicing reduces these costs by as much as 90%. Yet if according to the Statista research only 41% of organizations automate their financial processes it’s easy to say that more than half of business organizations worldwide are throwing away their budgets unnecessarily.

Collecting Better Data

Another considerable benefit of implementing AI and Machine learning in invoice processing automation is of course the fact that it helps businesses gain access to better data.

For one this is because non-automated e-invoicing has one significant barrier to get over every day. And that’s the existence of multiple data points.

In 2022 invoices are still being sent in multiple formats including XML documents PDFs image files and (rarely but still present) hardcopy files. Getting these formats into a single system takes not only time and effort but a lot of care as well. And even the best teams can make mistakes when manually entering or classifying information.

That’s why AI solutions can be of such great help to businesses looking to streamline their workflows.

For example automated invoice data extraction is an AI-driven process. It works quickly intelligently and with minimal error. It allows finance teams instant access to accurate data takes less than a minute per invoice and becomes smarter the more it’s used allowing companies to streamline the invoicing process.

Machine Learning for Improved Cash Flow

The last benefit of implementing AI and ML in invoice processing automation is a significant increase in productivity. Now the gains of boosting productivity may seem to reflect only in the time and cost it requires to process invoices. However higher finance team productivity also means two things.

On the one hand the newfound efficiency in handling accounts payable leads to better cash flow. AI and ML automation software allow businesses a bird’s-eye view of all outgoing costs. More importantly they can also predict upcoming operational costs. The latter results in the benefit of insightful data-based cost prediction that’s invaluable in any organization’s operation.

On the other hand enhanced invoice processing productivity also drives scalable growth. In addition to the data received from financial forecasting AI and ML in invoice processing also save time and money. And most importantly it gives them the resources they require to focus on value-adding tasks.

In Closing: Do AI & ML Decrease Control in Invoice Processing?

One of the main concerns business owners have when implementing AI and ML solutions is that they fear giving up control over high-value processes like invoice processing. But the truth is it shouldn’t be so.

These solutions are always made to serve the user. This means that they eliminate time-consuming manual tasks and present the data through comprehensible dashboards where experienced operators can choose how to best use that data.

And sure they will decide to automate some of the processes to reduce errors delays or lost time. But they’ll also have access to accurate and timely information at all times giving them all the insights they need to make the best decisions for your business.

Big Developments In Big Data Businesses and organizations have long used business reporting and data analytics on a tactical basis answering such questions as “just what were sales in Wisconsin in 2021?” But in recent years big data management and analytics has become more strategic spurred by digital transformation initiatives efforts to leverage data for competitive advantage and even moves to monetize data assets. More immediately with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic disruptions businesses now realize the need to better utilize data for such tasks as managing supply chains and retaining employees. And the wave of cybersecurity incidents making headlines has brought home the importance of stepping up their data governance operations. All this is changing how businesses collect manage utilize and analyze their growing volumes of data. Here‘s a look at 10 big data trends that the channel should keep an eye on in 2022. Analyzing Data Across Multiple Clouds Businesses and organizations are increasingly storing data in cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services Snowflake and Microsoft Azure even creating networks that distribute data storage across multiple clouds. But business analytics initiatives can be a challenge when data is scattered across on-premises and multi-cloud platforms. In 2022 we’ll see increased use of new software tools such as the Alluxio Data Orchestration Platform Qlik Forts and Starburst Galaxy that provide a unified view of data scattered across multiple on-premises and cloud systems and access that data – wherever it resides – for data analytics tasks. Gaining a virtual view of dispersed data and being able to access it with everyday business intelligence tools is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to the traditional data warehouse where data is collected from multiple sources and managed in a central location.

The Shift To Predictive And Prescriptive Analytics Accelerates This idea comes from a recent report from data cloud platform company Snowflake on data science and analytics trends. Data analytics has traditionally been used to understand what happened. But there is growing use of data analytics and machine learning technology to predict what will happen and offer suggested prescriptive responses – even automated actions – to the analytical results turning data into “an actionable asset.” This shift is accelerating thanks to the growing availability and adoption of easy-to-use machine learning tools by analysts and data scientists the ability to manage and deploy at scale machine learning features with next-generation feature stores and a new generation of distributed frameworks for training and deploying machine learning models. More frequent releases of machine learning tools and libraries are a factor here as are consolidated platforms (like Snowflake) that are closing the gap between analytics and machine learning.

Data Fabric Vs. Data Mesh “Data fabric” and “data mesh” are emerging architectures for integrating accessing and managing data across multiple heterogeneous platforms and technologies. But there are differences so expect to hear more about both in 2022 along with some debate – and possibly some confusion. The data fabric concept has been around for a few years but it’s become more prevalent as data is increasingly scattered across hybrid-cloud/multi-cloud networks. Data fabrics weave together data from internal silos and external data sources to create data networks to power business applications AI and analytics according to a definition from Stardog which develops an Enterprise Knowledge Graph platform. Major big data players such as Tibco Talend and Informatica along with newer companies like K2 develop software used in data fabric implementations. Stardog founder and CEO Kendall Clark believes data fabric will become more mainstream in 2022 noting in an email comment that “the maturity of enterprise data fabric as the key to data integration in the hybrid multi-cloud world will become more commercially evident.” This year “will see significant growth and interest in data fabric solutions as companies seek to leverage a common management layer to accelerate analytics migration to the cloud ensure security and governance and quickly deliver business value by supporting real-time trusted data across hybrid-multi-cloud – all in driving digital transformation” said Buno Pati CEO at big data software vendor Infoworks in a statement. “We believe this technology will be broadly adopted over the next five years.” The “data mesh” concept developed by Zhamak Dehghani a director at IT consultancy Thoughtworks is focused on the logical and physical interconnectedness of data from producers through to consumers according to Starburst which targets its data analytics engine for use within data mesh systems. Data observability software vendor Monte Carlo says data mesh is an alternative to a monolithic data lake and “embraces the ubiquity of data in the enterprise by leveraging a domain-driven self-service design.”

Data Observability Goes Mainstream “Data observability” became a hot buzz term in 2021. But 2022 will be the year the implementation and application of data observability technology really catch up to the hype. Data analytics and data-intensive applications are key components of many digital transformation and machine learning initiatives – making it critical that the quality reliability and completeness of the data used for those projects meet high standards. Just as there are service level agreements for applications and IT infrastructure data observability provides a way to monitor data for its quality behavior privacy and ROI says Sanjeev Mohan a consultant and advisor at data and analytics firm Eckerson Group in a recent blog post. Data engineers data scientists chief data officers data privacy officers chief information security officers CIOs and CTOs “can all benefit from a richer view of their data assets” Mohan says. The data observability space is crowded with established companies like Cisco Systems Splunk Sumo Logic New Relic and Data Dog as well as startups including Cribl Monte Carlo and Bigeye. Some like Splunk and New Relic offer data observability tools for systems management and DevOps purposes while others like Monte Carlo and Bigeye are more focused on the quality of the data itself – what some call “data health.” In an Observability Trends Report released in December based on a survey of nearly 1300 IT leaders software engineers and developers New Relic says data observability will become mission critical in 2022 for managing the entire software lifecycle not just troubleshooting problems.

Increased Deployment And Large-Scale Use Of Machine Learning Machine learning has been a hot area in the last few years with both established IT vendors and – especially – startups offering software for developing training deploying and managing machine learning models and the data they use. This year will see the use of ML tools become more widespread due to several developments according to a report from Snowflake on data science and analytics trends. Easy-to-use machine learning tools including “AutoML” or automated machine learning software will automate the technical aspects of data science tasks. That will allow data scientists to do their jobs more quickly and even make data science capabilities available to a wider audience of data analysts. Managing and deploying machine learning features at scale will become easier with increased use of feature store technology that has become available in the last year according to the report. And continuous releases of machine learning tools libraries and frameworks offer more options for data scientists. Machine learning projects will increasingly be housed in cloud data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks predicts Eckerson Group. And some see machine learning and data analytics essentially merging into one operation. “Automation business intelligence and AI will converge into one practice fueling the proliferation of citizen data scientists across the enterprise” said Florian Douetteau co-founder and CEO of Dataiku an AI and machine learning platform developer in an email.

The Rise Of Comprehensive Data Governance Platforms Until recently data managers looking to automate data governance processes have had to rely on point products and tools with specific functionality including data catalogs data lineage data quality data access control data security master data management and more. That made it difficult to protect data against unauthorized access and misuse and ensure that data met corporate policy and government regulatory requirements notes industry analyst Wayne Eckerson of the Eckerson Group in a recent report on big data trends for 2022. Over the last year a number of big data companies have been combining these tools and capabilities into increasingly comprehensive data governance platforms Eckerson notes including Ataccama Alation Collibra Hitachi Vantara Informatica Precisely Talend and Zaloni. As we enter 2022 look for data managers to adopt and implement these platforms to improve their data governance efforts.

Increased Use Of DataSecOps Technologies As a corollary to the need for better data governance businesses and organizations will also increasingly turn to DataSecOps software from vendors such as Immuta and Satori to ensure data protection and data privacy policies are being followed. The need for DataSecOps tools is being driven by the increasing distribution of data across data fabric and data mesh architectures noted Satori founder and CEO Eldad Chai in an email. More sensitive personal data is migrating to the cloud for analytical and machine learning tasks he notes and “over-privileged” employees at startups in financial and healthcare technologies have broad access to customer data. And attackers are increasingly targeting data held by analytics and AI service providers he said. “As data volumes grow and usage expands it has become impossible to control who has access to what data ensure proper compliance and enable safe data sharing” said Matt Carroll CEO of Immuta a Boston-based developer of universal cloud data access control software in an email. “Without automatic data access control organizations have no way of monitoring who is accessing what data when and for what purpose jeopardizing the data’s security and privacy.”

Supply Chain Analytics Becomes A Strategic Imperative For many businesses managing their way through supply chain disruptions has been the biggest challenge associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While the disruptions were triggered by shuttered manufacturing plants around the world those problems were compounded by the lack of visibility many businesses have into their supplier networks making it difficult to shift plans find alternative suppliers and adjust distribution to match supply with demand. In an Eckerson Group report analyst Rich Fox notes that supply chain management has evolved from a tactical function to a strategic imperative. Look for many businesses in 2022 to step up their digital tracking of data from manufacturers and transportation companies using sensors and other technologies analyzing supply chain interdependencies and developing contingency plans using machine learning and AI capabilities.

Expanded Use Of Predictive Analytics To Overcome “The Great Resignation” Just as the COVID-19 pandemic has created supply chain problems for businesses it also triggered what has become known as “The Great Resignation” where millions of people have quit their jobs to retire change their life direction – or because they were dissatisfied with where they were working and felt they could do better elsewhere. Data analytics has traditionally been applied to human resource management for basic reporting tasks such as compiling employment data for tax purposes. But some forward-thinking businesses and organizations have begun applying the same kind of predictive technologies used to monitor customer churn to identifying key employees that may be on the verge of quitting by analyzing data around compensation job satisfaction productivity and other metrics. Look for that trend to accelerate in 2022. “As organizations grapple with employee turnover amidst the ‘Great Resignation’ they will increasingly look to predictive analytics to help save the day” says Nick Curcuru vice president of advisory services at Privitar a developer of data privacy management software. “By embracing predictive analytics organizations can identify key trends in employee engagement and key moments in time to intervene enabling them to take action and possibly save relationships that might be on the brink. It can cost as much as four times an employee salary to replace someone as it does to keep them so being able to prevent churn can provide a huge value to an organization” Curcuru said in an email. But Curcuru cautions that HR analytics efforts must include safeguards for both employees and their personal data and management must be transparent about policies to protect data and its ethical use.",,,,,,,,,

“Thank you everyone for spending the last two days with us at this year’s Annual Meeting” said Mr. Simonelli making sure to shine a spotlight on the people behind the scenes who rose to the challenge of creating a very dynamic virtual event.

With more than 40 leading speakers from across industries he said “I appreciated how everyone was candid provocative and willing to dig into the tough issues we are facing today.”

Mr. Simonelli hoped everyone left the event with greater insights and an accelerated commitment to the energy transition.

“It’s even clearer to me now that change presents a tremendous opportunity and we play a critical role in the quest for net zero. As I said yesterday how we get there it’s up to us. It truly is up to us. We are the drivers of the future the world wants. Let’s make 2021 our year to accelerate into the energy transition. Let’s make it a year not just focused on recovery from 2020 but a year we remember as the start of a new energy landscape for decades to come.”

Justice Zaynab Bashir made the ruling on Friday after listening to arguments from both counsels. She held that findings showed that the firms complied with the contract of employment in terminating Joshua‘s employment but failed to comply with the Labour Act in terms of payment for the redundancy.

Section 20 of the Labour Act speaks on Redundancy. It provides that the employer shall inform the trade union or workers’ representative concerned of reasons for and the extent of the anticipated redundancy.

What happened in court

Mr Umoren the claimant submitted that he was employed in 1992 and was issued a letter for the termination of his employment and a Notice of Redundancy in 2009. He told the court that the consequences of the firms non-compliance with the provisions of the law on redundancy are unlawful and null and void.

Mr Umoren’s counsel argued that the firms breached the statutory obligation to abide by both national Laws on redundancy for determining his client employment by other means not contained in the Contract.

The Defence counsel contended that the claimant notice of redundancy showed that he had discussed it with his supervisor and as such he was not disengaged abruptly or summarily.

He submitted that the claimant was not a member of a trade union while he was employed and as such the firms could not enter into discussions regarding his impending redundancy.

The firms prayed the court to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was statute-barred because it was not filed within the 6 years provided by the Limitation Act.

In her judgement Justice Bashir held that the employment of Joshua Umoren was determined on the basis of redundancy rather than being summarily dismissed.

She said no evidence of payment was made to the claimant tagged ‘Redundancy Payment’. She held that the claimant’s employment was determined on the basis of redundancy rather than being summarily dismissed.

What you should know

Section 20 of the Labor Act states that “The employer shall inform the trade union or workers’ representative concerned of the reasons for and the extent of the anticipated redundancy;

(b) The principle of “last in first out” shall be adopted in the discharge of the particular category of workers affected subject to all factors of relative merit including skill ability and reliability; and

(c) The employer shall use his best endeavours to negotiate redundancy payments to any discharged workers who are not protected by regulations made under subsection (2) of this section.” The Act reads

While the A part of the section talks about the employer’s obligation to inform the trade union representative of the reason for redundancy section b implies that workers who have been in contract employment longer will be considered for discharge before the latest workers to come into the employment.",,,,,,,,,

Mr. Moynihan earned $32 million in 2021 which includes $1.5 million in base pay and $30.5 million in restricted stock half of which is tied to the bank’s performance over the next three years according to a securities filing released Friday.

In 2020 the bank’s board of directors cut his pay to $24.5 million because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the bank’s performance.

Profit roared back last year after the Charlotte N.C.-based lender released reserves set aside for loan losses which so far haven’t materialized.

A flurry of deals drove up investment-banking revenue. Bank of America minted $32 billion in profit last year and its stock jumped 47%.

Mr. Moynihan’s 2021 payday is his biggest since he took the helm in 2010 but still puts him behind other big-bank CEOs. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon earned $34.5 million in 2021 while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Solomon and Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman each took home $35 million.

The pandemic economy has stoked a war for talent that has filtered down to the ranks at the largest lenders prompting bigger paychecks and bonuses for bankers. Bank of America’s total compensation expenses rose to $36.14 billion in 2021 up 10% from 2020.

With roots dating back to the mid-1800s credit unions have become a pillar of America’s financial landscape but their popularity could be waning. According to a new survey by GOBankingRates Gen Z and millennials are less likely to bank with credit unions than they are with national and/or online banks.

The survey found that 26% of people ages 18 to 24 use credit unions while 36% of people in this age group opt for national banks such as Chase Bank of America U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. People between the ages of 25 and 34 are even less likely to use a credit union with only 14% being members of one. They too prefer to do business with a national bank (28%) but are even more likely to use an online bank with 31% saying they bank with these institutions. People ages 35 to 44 also drastically favor online banks (36%) while only 19% of this cohort banks with a credit union.

Meanwhile older generations show far more loyalty to credit unions; 35% of people ages 45 to 54 use credit unions as do 54% of people between the ages of 55 and 64. Of those surveyed who are 65 and older 60% are members of a credit union. So what does all these mean for credit unions now?

Credit Unions Need To Do a Better Job Appealing To Younger People

One key reason that credit unions are lagging behind national and online banks lies in their own shortcoming: a failure to make themselves known as an option.

“In general young people have less exposure to and understanding of credit unions than previous generations” said Matthew DiGangi a MassMutual executive in the strategic distribution division and a Bank Insurance and Securities Association leadership advisory board member.

Consumers should not be expected to stumble upon credit unions or to innately understand their offerings and perks (or inherit recognition from their parents); rather credit unions should be expected to reach out and connect with young people who may be in the dark about their values.

“What is truly the issue for credit unions trying to serve the younger generations is educating them on what a credit union is and how their relationship works as an owner” said Brian Abner economist and senior market strategist at Market Research Group LLC.

Gen Z Does Appear More Interested In Credit Unions Than Millennials

Though GOBankingRates’ survey shows that older millennials are favoring online and national banks over credit unions the research also shows an uptick in popularity with Gen Z. This suggests that credit unions could be course-correcting and doing more to appeal to young consumers.

“Credit unions are making strides to better educate millennials and Gen Z by adding products and services to add relevance with their young members” Abner said.

Credit Unions Need To Seize the Digital Day

Still credit unions need to grow their digital presence and capabilities in order to generate interest among a generation that is unwaveringly devoted to online and mobile convenience.

“[This] is an opportunity for credit [unions] to reposition themselves embracing digital” said Matthew Williamson VP of global financial services at Mobiquity. “It could in fact trigger growth opportunities for them servicing existing clients more efficiently while attracting a new generation who won’t need to find another provider if they move states and that credit union is no longer available to them. Technology has also leveled the playing field — cloud services platforms and open APIs provide cost-effective access to building engaging customer experiences.”

In-Person Banking Is Shrinking but Not Disappearing

That so many young consumers prefer online banking over credit unions implies that the days of brick-and-mortar banking are coming to an end — which would be terrible news for credit unions who live by the “people helping people” philosophy. In-person banking will shrink — it already has — but to leap to the conclusion that in-person banking will die out leaving the credit unions that so crucially rely on it in the lurch is hasty and shortsighted.

“In-person banking is still a key component of building a relationship with a customer and the more consultative discussions such as college planning retirement planning insurance needs investment advice etc.” DiGangi said.

Ultimately what credit unions need to do is strike a balance between in-person services — which are still highly important for those making major financial decisions — and digital fluency. And they need to focus their digital advancements on attracting new customers as well as on highlighting their strong points such as the fact they are not for profit unlike banks. That fact in itself could go a long way in winning over more Gen Zers who tend to be wary of if not strongly opposed to blatantly capitalist motives.

There’s a Place for Everyone

“The big picture is there is a place for both banks and credit unions when serving communities” Abner said.

Moreover we must consider the bizarre and tragic times we are living in. With the pandemic raging on as furiously as ever the world of banking — and what consumers want out of financial institutions — is in flux.

“From a financial sector perspective the last 24 months have created a shift in how services are provided to consumers” Abner said. “Technology relevant financial products and services and point of sale will be different.”

Going forward consumers will likely want a taste of both: the personal unbiased service of a credit union along with the flashy convenience touted by a national or online bank.

“The future will see a hybrid type of exchange between institution and customer as more mundane interaction will use varied high-tech systems while more sophisticated transactions such as loans and wealth services will be more customized one-on-one interaction” Abner said. “The result should be more confidence and ease of transaction for consumers and their choice in a financial partner whether a bank or credit union. Each holds merit.”

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Farmer Joe has formed several connections this season but still hasn't had much luck after Susie walked out on him when she realised farm life was not for her.

However fans believe he will ultimately end up with Sarah a livestock administrator who grew up on a cattle farm because of their similar backgrounds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YWhvby5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3RoaXMtMTItbm8tMS1iZXN0c2VsbGluZy1zb2xhci1iaXJkLWJhdGgtd2lsbC1sZWF2ZS1tb21zLWhlYXJ0LWFmbHV0dGVyLS1hbmQtaXRzLW92ZXItMzAtb2ZmLTIxMjEyMTQ1Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This $12 No. 1 bestselling solar bird bath will leave Mom's heart aflutter — and it's over 30% off,"Moms are the best and they deserve the best gifts. If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bed Bath & Beyond’s new parent company working on winning back repeat customers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-new-parent-company-says-its-still-working-on-winning-back-repeat-customers-1d6abda3 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Image: Courtesy Photo

On Feb. 5 Rebecca Baxter died and with her went not just the eyes of Sarasota Magazine but part of its heart and soul as well. For more than 30 years she was our official photographer the one who took all the party pictures that did so much to define and document the town’s social life as it transformed from small Florida backwater to international glamour capital. It was through her eyes that the world saw our town.

For many years I was the magazine’s social columnist and Rebecca and I were partners in crime. We attended what seems like thousands of events and it was her pictures that everybody wanted to see. Did she include them in the current issue? Did their dresses look as good as they hoped they would? The right picture from Rebecca could give them immeasurable status and satisfaction and she became a friend and confidant to some of the most powerful people in town.

Her style was ultra-high-energy paparazzi with a touch of social satire. She had the gift of making a party look more exciting than it was. Her specialty was the surprised expression and the unexpected pose that said everything. And a confession on my part—many of those humorous cracks I made in my Mr. Chatterbox column were actually first uttered by Rebecca. She was an astute observer of human nature and one of the wittiest—as well as one of the kindest—people I’ve ever known.

It was also Rebecca’s job to photograph the various visiting celebrities and here she approached genius. No one intimidated her in the slightest. I fondly remember a night at the Ritz when she photographed film star Leslie Caron. ""Twirl around more goddammit!” she yelled and far from being offended Ms. Caron knew exactly what she meant. The result was a spectacular set of photos of an aging star delighted at being once again the center of attention.

On another memorable occasion she photographed President Bush’s visit on Sept. 11 2001 and her pictures of that morning—the shock and the chaos—are an important record of a crucial moment in American history.

Occasionally—not often but it did happen—we got a complaint about Rebecca. She used the wrong filter and it made someone's dress look green. Or she was “too bossy” in staging a group shot. I guess they expected us to slap her wrist but instead the opposite happened. Such was our loyalty and respect for Rebecca that we made sure the complainer was never again mentioned in Sarasota Magazine.

Social media made Rebecca’s career—and mine—obsolete. Now everybody is a photographer and people plaster their parties all over Facebook and Instagram. I suppose that’s good but we’ve lost something too—seeing our town and our lives through the eyes of an artist.

Confined to a wheelchair these last few years Rebecca would roll herself out to the street and snap people walking by posting her Front Yard series pictures with a brief recap of her lively interrogation of her subjects. Their expressions often show a mix of shock and delight at encountering this fierce life force. It’s hard for us to even imagine that Rebecca has left us. Our hearts go out to her husband Rick daughters Alex and Julia and their husbands and her adored five grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVtaWR3ZXN0Lm9yZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L2JheHRlci1lbGVtZW50YXJ5LXRha2VzLXN0YXR1cy1uZXdzLWFzLWNoYW5jZS10by1pbXByb3ZlLWFkZHMtMzAtbWludXRlcy10by1kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baxter Elementary takes status news as chance to improve adds 30 minutes to day,"Editor’s note: IowaWatch in a year-long investigation found that although each state is required to identify the bottom-scoring 5 percent of Title I schools every three years it doesn’t mean these schools are “failing” as some Iowa policymakers label them. Iowa’s 34 schools are on a “comprehensive” list. IowaWatch is featuring some of them.

Baxter Community School in central Iowa may be small with preschool through 12th grade all under one roof but it is also a top choice for those living in surrounding communities.

“As many as one-fourth of our population is open-enrolled into our district” said Principal Jason Aker. “Those people choose to come to our district for whatever reason not their home district. So that’s always been a real positive for us.”

Baxter Elementary serving grades kindergarten through five was identified as comprehensive one of 34 comprehensive in Iowa. These schools are the Title I schools that score in the bottom 5 percent in the state based on students’ performance on the Iowa Statewide Assessment of Student Progress test and/or for high schools have a graduation rate below 67.1 percent.

Baxter Elementary has met its comprehensive and targeted status within two years. Based on scoring outlined by the Every Student Succeeds Act the state average score for schools is 54.94. Baxter has an overall score of 57.51.

“I remember telling the staff when we got our comprehensive status and there were a lot of shocked looks” Aker said. “I think that’s why our jump happened as much as it did because we were fully dedicated we looked at it as an opportunity to improve. We worked very closely with the state and with our local [Area Education Agency] and just got to business as far as what we were going to implement.”

The school put an emphasis on planning time and professional development for teachers and extended the school day by 30 minutes which they call “win time.”

As part of a new multi-tiered system of supports that 30 minutes of win time rotates throughout the day so each grade level has a specific win time in their day.

During that win time the grade level has their two classroom teachers as well as the talented and gifted teacher a reading teacher and two paraprofessionals which the school hired in the first year of comprehensive status.

“So how we did things is a little different. It’s not two teachers trying to work with 40 kids it’s six teachers working with 40 kids and really focusing on the specific needs of those kids” he said.

Being a small rural school helped Baxter Elementary to implement changes and see results quicker than a large school. But being small also has drawbacks.

“We’ve given that speedboat tanker ship analogy. We’re a little speedboat. We can maneuver quicker we can make changes quicker. We can set up systems because we have less moving parts” Aker explained. “The opposite of that though is we don’t necessarily have the resources that those bigger schools have.”

When a school receives a comprehensive designation funding is put in place to help support changes some of which can be implemented with one-time funding but others such as hiring paraprofessionals cannot.

“When those dollars go away then it becomes tough for our district to provide that again. We’re using that money to help pay for these salaries for people and when that money goes away we’re back to what we typically get which isn’t as much as we all would like it to be” he said. “So throw money at school improvement and then you improve and then we take all the money away so where’s the sustainability piece to it?”

A common misconception is that all schools are the same and these generalizations lead to incorrect beliefs like thinking that schools are failing he said.

“‘Thirty-four failing schools’ is a really crummy way of saying that because the answer is simple; it’s the bottom 5 percent. So there will always be a bottom 5 percent. So if every school in the state scored 90 percent or higher the bottom 5 percent of that 90 percent would still be considered comprehensive” he said. “So it’s really a tragedy on some level to lump schools in there and say that they’re failing because that is not the case.”

Warren Buffett welcomes volatile markets as they serve up bargains and near-term price moves don't affect his long-term returns.

The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO has argued that owning stocks is safer than holding cash or bonds in the long run even though share prices move a lot more. He's also ridiculed the use of volatility as a measure of risk.

Here are 8 of Buffett's best quotes about volatility lightly edited for length and clarity:

1. ""As an investor you love volatility. You love the idea of wild swings because it means more things are going to get mispriced."" (1997)

2. ""The true investor welcomes volatility. A wildly fluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will periodically be attached to solid businesses. It is impossible to see how the availability of such prices can be thought of as increasing the hazards for an investor who is totally free to either ignore the market or exploit its folly."" (1993)

3. ""It doesn't make any difference to us whether the volatility of the stock market averages 0.5% a day or 0.25% a day or 5% a day. In fact we'd make a lot more money if volatility was higher because it would create more mistakes in the market. So volatility is a huge plus to the real investor."" (1997)

4. ""Erratic markets are ideal for any investor — small or large — so long as he sticks to his investment knitting. Volatility caused by money managers who speculate irrationally with huge sums will offer the true investor more chances to make intelligent investment moves. He can be hurt by such volatility only if he is forced by either financial or psychological pressures to sell at untoward times."" (1987)

5. ""If the investor fears price volatility erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk he may ironically end up doing some very risky things."" (Buffett argued that holding currency-denominated assets such as cash or Treasury bonds which have their value eroded by inflation over time is riskier than owning stocks for the long term.) (2014)

6. ""No one ever gets that in a private business where daily you get a buy-sell offer by a party. But in the stock market you get it. That's a huge advantage. And it's a bigger advantage if this partner of yours is a heavy-drinking manic depressive. The crazier he is the more money you're going to make."" (Buffett was referring to his mentor Benjamin Graham's allegory of Mr. Market a character offering to buy from or sell to investors at a different price each day.) (1997)

Advertisement

7. ""We regard volatility as a measure of risk to be nuts."" (Buffett said short-term price movements are meaningless and pose no threat to a long-term investor whereas active trading paying excessive fees and borrowing money are real ways to damage future returns). (2001)

8. ""The riskiness of an investment is not measured by beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the probability of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing power over his contemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period.""

Would she and her people have an attitude? Would her office be a disorganized mess? And then I wondered why did I have those preconceptions?

The answer to the latter question says something about me no doubt and maybe something about our current political environment as well.

As it turns out AOC’s people were polite and professional and her office — in a blue-collar commercial neighborhood near the Zerega Avenue 6 train stop — was spare and seemingly well-coordinated.

AOC’s PR person told us she might be running a few minutes late — which comes with the territory for politicians blue and red — but as it turned out she wasn’t. And so very much on time AOC walked over to greet me.

My first impression was that AOC is smaller than I thought (aren’t we all though) but more to the point she too was cordial and linear. Her EQ is very much in order and as they say in the business of politics she has ""it.""

I’m sure I speak for a great many of you when I say that I don’t agree with all of AOC’s politics by any means (though to be clear some I do especially the part about holding power accountable). But even for the rest where we disagree — to paraphrase the Beatles — I do appreciate her being 'round.

AOC broadens the political conversation. She gives voice to and speaks for a group of Americans who sorely need to be heard that being primarily working class people particularly of color. Not only does she challenge the Republicans in that regard but also her own party. Again you may not agree with AOC but understand that what she fights for is what the people in her district want from her.

Ocasio-Cortez is of course a rock star to millions — she has 12.8 million Twitter followers — and anathema to millions of others. She really seems to get under the skin of some people in a way that Bernie Sanders her political comrade-in-arms (there is a photograph of the two of them together in her office) doesn’t. Bernie is seen by the opposition as this crotchety (even lovable) old socialist while AOC they maintain is destroying our country — even though the two of them are saying the exact same thing. I think that has everything to do with the fact that AOC is a young woman.

Progressive Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) known as AOC appears on an episode of Yahoo Finance's ""Influencers with Andy Serwer."" (Influencers with Andy Serwer)

Anyway you can watch the entire interview here and read stories from that conversation to get her take on capitalism stock trading by lawmakers inflation and Facebook. Below I wanted to touch on a few things we didn’t write up.

Story continues

I asked her off-camera how she reconciles taking strong positions and compromising to align with the mainstream Democrats. She essentially said that it was important for her to stick to her guns even if it rankles moderates in part because it motivates young people and diverse populations to come out and vote for the Dems in general elections. Not sure Nancy Pelosi with whom AOC has had her differences buys that but fair enough.

Besides the substantive stuff I was curious about the nickname AOC.

AS: I want to ask you maybe a funny question about the moniker AOC.

AOC: OK. (laughs)

AS: Is that what your friends and family call you?

AOC: No. (laughs)

AS: How did that evolve? When did you become AOC?

AOC: AOC really emerged after I won my primary. I think it actually kind of came from the media overnight. There were a lot of pundits on television that were kind of like stumbling because my name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ... And there were just all these folks on TV that I think were kind of like struggling to say my name. In the past there were some folks that would sometimes say it like jokingly but it was never a nickname that stuck. My friends don't call me that.

AS: Do they call you Alexandria?

AOC: They'll call me Alexandria or they'll call me Alex. My friends will call me Alex. But yeah [AOC] it's shorthand. I now embrace it welcome it accept it.

I also asked about her legacy which might seem strange to put to a 32-year-old but she had a thoughtful take.

AOC: I actually think that it is important for young people to ask themselves questions of legacy very early. The reason that that's important is because we should root our legacy in a position or a job or a role — but we should really root it in a mission of what we want to do qualitatively and how we want to be remembered. I don't think it's ever too early to consider that because it helps us make decisions it helps us root ourselves in our values and our morals. I just hope that what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels from me as their representative is someone that always puts the people of this country first that doesn't allow herself to be dissuaded or distracted by power influence et cetera. And that we are relentless and honest and authentic in our pursuit for a better world. And in that pursuit we just tell it as it is and try to do everything we can in every moment that we can. And I think that's pretty much it.

What’s next for AOC? Some say U.S. senator. Some say president down the road. I’m not really sure she could win either one of those races — she might just end up being an incredibly powerful Congressperson and movement leader. To advance further AOC might need to compromise which to her credit she doesn’t seem interested in doing right now.

At some point AOC may in fact evolve in her thinking. Or maybe America will change to match her. A convergence or not? It will be oh-so interesting to watch.

Key points

High oil and gas prices mean Shell generated $40bn of spare cash last year

Buffett is known for liking business that’s generate plenty of cash

Shell (LSE: SHEL) shares are trading at the highest level seen since the start of the pandemic. Soaring oil and gas prices mean the company is currently producing huge amounts of surplus cash even though investment in low-carbon energy is increasing.

Is Shell the kind of cash-generative mature business Warren Buffett might buy? I’ve been taking a look.

Bumper profits

Shell’s 2021 results were expected to be good but they turned out to be better than forecast. The FTSE 100 group generated adjusted earnings of $19.3bn last year up from just $4.9bn in 2020.

Oil companies’ profits can be hard to understand due to some complex accounting. I prefer to focus on a much simpler metric — free cash flow. This represents the surplus cash generated by a business each year. This money can be used for dividends for example.

Shell generated free cash flow of $40.3bn in 2021 more than double the $20.8bn it reported in 2020. This tidal wave of cash helped to support a $23bn reduction in net debt. Some of this cash will also be used to fund $8.5bn of share buybacks and Shell’s quarterly dividend which will rise by 4% this quarter.

I can see lots of elements that Buffett might like here but is Shell really his kind of stock?

Would Buffett buy Shell shares?

Buffett once said that “our acquisition preferences run toward businesses that generate cash not those that consume it”. Shell certainly ticks that box at the moment.

And although he is known to have a liking for defensive businesses like Coca-Cola he’s not shy about owning energy stocks. Buffett’s firm Berkshire Hathaway reported a $3.9bn holding in US oil giant Chevron at the end of September.

So would he buy Shell? Ultimately I don’t think so. But I suspect the main reason for this might be that it’s a European business.

Buffett believes strongly in the importance of staying within his circle of competence when he invests. For him one element of this is his deep knowledge of the US market and American business. As a result he rarely invests outside the US. Given that there are suitable alternatives to Shell on the US market — such as Chevron — I think he’s unlikely to buy Shell shares.

Here’s what I’d do

My experience suggests that the best time to buy commodity stocks is when prices are down. That’s not true at the moment. Oil and gas are both trading at levels which haven’t been seen since 2014.

The problem with this is that history suggests prices won’t stay high forever. When they fall Shell’s profits are likely to drop and investor sentiment will weaken.

Admittedly Shell shares look quite cheap at the moment on around eight times 2022 forecast earnings. However these could be peak earnings.

I think the dividend yield is a better measure of valuation. Shell’s share price surge has pushed the stock’s yield down to around 3.4%. I’d want a yield of 4-5% to invest in this mature — and possibly declining — business. That means a share price of around 1600p.

I might buy Shell shares but not at the current price.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbWVyaWNhbnMtZGl0Y2hlZC1oaWdoLXRheC1zdGF0ZXMtMTQ1NjIyMTE3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Americans ditched high-tax states during pandemic study finds,"Americans flocked to states with low or no income taxes during the pandemic according to a new report reaping savings from their work-from-home flexibility.

“People move to states with low-income tax for a multitude of reasons sometimes it's the most direct and obvious reason that it reduces their own tax liability” said Jared Walczak vice president of state projects with the Center for State Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation. “Especially now that people have more capacity to move where they want that will be a higher priority for some.”

States with higher income tax rates saw significant population declines whereas states with lower taxes had accelerated population growth according to the Tax Foundation analysis that used U.S. Census Bureau population data and commercial datasets from U-Haul and United Van Lines.

For example the District of Columbia — which raised income taxes in 2021— saw its population downsize an estimated 2.8% between April 2020 and July 2021 while New York which has some of the highest taxes lost 1.8% of its residents. This was followed by Illinois Hawaii and California — all high-tax states — which make up the top five states with the largest population losses.

By contrast low or no personal income tax states saw the biggest population increases including Florida Texas New Hampshire South Dakota Nevada and Tennessee.

While the last two years of the pandemic have allowed people with increased mobility to make this move high tax levels are not the only reason some have packed up a U-Haul according to Walczak.

“There are also second-order effects” Walczak said. “States with lower tax burdens and with more pro growth tax codes have higher rates of growth and higher economic opportunity – and people will move to seek out those things even beyond their own tax burdens.”

You could have significant savings

While no or low income states may have higher sales or property taxes the total tax burden often remains lower. Take Texas for example which has higher property taxes than the average.

“But even then for most people the combination of Texas’ higher than average property taxes and no income taxes is still a significant tax savings over most of the states they might have moved from” Walczak said.

Nine states with population gains either implemented or enacted cuts to the individual or corporate income tax rates last year. Meanwhile New York which had the highest population loss and D.C. actually raised income taxes in 2021 — the only places to do so.

Local taxes can also add to people’s overall tax burden. For instance the analysis found that the average top marginal state and local income tax rate is 3.5% for states that saw population gains while the rate is 7.3% for the third of states with the highest tax rates.

“I’m one of the people that’s trying to leave New York City to minimize tax burdens” said Ramona Cedeño CPA and founder of FiBrick an accounting firm for tech companies and small businesses. “Just up north of New York in the county of Westchester. New York can be so expensive.”

If she relocated she could save around 5% to 6% on taxes she said.

“In the past before COVID we stayed in these high-tax states because there was another reason to. My office was based in New York City and I had clients in California which required me to be there physically” Cedeño said. “Now that we can work remotely and you don’t have to see clients all the time you can live anywhere.”

Typically state-to-state migration is led by retirees leaving colder and high-tax states for ones with low or no income taxes that often have warmer climates. Not now necessarily Walczak said.

“This isn’t a migration of just retirees but more and more a migration of people looking for better economic opportunities” Walczak said “people moving or looking for jobs lower cost of living lower taxes and overall opportunity.”

Price Drop: WD Black SN850 M.2 SSD

PS5 Compatible

PS5 Compatible WD Black SN850X 1TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000MBps) 40 $129.99 save 54% $59.99 at Best Buy

The WD SN850 is currently the most popular (and probably the best) SSD to get for your PS5 storage upgrade. It's blazing fast drive with transfer speeds rated at up to 7000 MB/s and a PCIe Gen4 interface. It's $30 cheaper than the model without heatsink so you can buy a cheap $12 heatsink off Amazon and put it on yourself to save some money.

Price Drop: WD Black SN850 M.2 SSD with Heatsink

PS5 Compatible

Without Heatsink WD Black SN850 1TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000MBps) 23 $229.99 save 39% $139.99 at Amazon With Heatsink WD Black SN850 1TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000MBps) 0 $249.99 save 40% $149.99 at Amazon

The WD Black SN850 model with pre-installed heatsink hovered at around $250 for most of the time since it was released last year which made it overwhelmingly the better deal to just buy the non-heatsink version. The price has dropped significantly over the past few weeks that this model now actually makes sense. It's still roughly $15-$20 more expensive than buying the non-heatsink model and slapping on your own heatsink but peace of mind and out-of-the-box readiness makes up for the price difference.

XPG GAMMIX S70 Blade 1TB M.2 SSD with Heatsink

PS5 Compatible

Use code: 93XSN24 Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus 1TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000MBps) with Heatsink 32 $179.99 save 15% $152.99 at Newegg Use code ' 93XSN24 '

This Black Friday deal is back. The XPG Gammix S70 Blade is one of the more recently released SSDs that's specifically designed for your PS5 storage upgrade. It also happens to be the lowest priced PS5-compatible 1TB SSD with heatsink available. In fact it's even less expensive than most compatible SSDs without heatsink. The S70 Blade boasts transfer rates up to 7400 MB/s and a PCIe Gen4 interface. It includes a PS5-compatible low-profile aluminum heatsink. It's not beefy but it works and it fits.

New Release: XPG ATOM 1TB M.2 SSD with Heatsink

PS5 Compatible

with Heatsink XPG ATOM 1TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 5000MBps) 1 $119.99 save 17% $99.99 at Amazon

XPG has released a new PS5-compatible SSD that's even cheaper than the S70 Blade which was already the least expensive PS5-compatible SSD you could buy. Whereas the S70 Blade has read speeds of 7400MB/s the ATOM has read speeds of 5000MB/s. That's still good enough to meet PS5's requirements and if your sole intent is to use this in a PS5 console you'll hardly notice the difference between the two. Like the S70 Blade this SSD includes a thin aluminum heat spreader.

More PS5 SSD Options in Stock

These PS5 SSD options are in no way less capable or deserving of your PS5 upgrading. The Firecuda 530 for example is actually considered the fastest drive compared to all the other models listed here. The Samsung 980 PRO is a tried and true model that's extremely popular in PC builds. All of these SSDs have seen decent price drops in 2022.

WD Black SN750 500GB Gen4 PCIe M.2 NVME SSD

WD Black SN750 500GB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 3600MBps) 2 $69.99 save 29% $49.99 at Amazon

This is the best price we've seen for a WD Black SN750 500GB SSD. It's a perfect candidate for a boot drive thanks to its generous amount of storage for your OS and core apps and fast transfer speeds of up to 3600MB/s. It's not recommended for your PS5 though since it doesn't hit the 5000MB/s threshold.

The Dell XPS gaming PC is equipped with an 11th gen Intel Core i7 processor 8GB of RAM 512GB SSD and the RTX 3060 video card. For faster performance we'd definitely recommend adding in an SSD as your boot drive. The low price tag might imply that the RTX 3060 is not up to snuff but nothing could be further from the truth. The RTX 3060 is about 20% faster than the RTX 2060 SUPER and is on par with the RTX 2070. That means it handles 1080p gaming beautifully and has the chops to take on 1440p and VR gaming as well. That's pretty impressive for a budget $1099 gaming PC no matter how you look at it. It's also future proofed with DLSS 2.0 which can significantly improve your fps without taxing your system.

Alienware Aurora R12 RTX 3080 PC for $2199.99

This particular LG Ultragear monitor is one of the best 32"" gaming monitors you can get. The 2560x1440 resolution is nice and sharp on the 32"" display yet it's low enough to allow mid-range cards like the RTX 3060 Ti or RTX 3070 to handle it beautifully even at the maximum 165Hz refresh rate for many games.

Associate Research

Got dividends?

That’s the pervasive sentiment in equity markets at the moment.

As the work-from-home trade unwinds one thing is certain—investors are becoming more discerning about investing in companies that pay dividends.

Within the S&P 500 the highest dividend yield companies have outperformed the lowest yield companies by a whopping 933 basis points (bps) this year. That margin is even greater—1017 bps—when compared to the roughly 100 S&P 500 companies that don’t pay a dividend.

According to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices S&P 500 dividend-payers outperformed non-payers in January by the greatest monthly performance spread (6.58%) since July 2004.

As we discussed in a recent post high dividend yield companies have a shorter duration so the group’s outperformance given the sharp move higher in rates does not come as a surprise.

S&P 500 Index Dividend Yield Quintiles Year-to-Date

This trend is even starker when looking at the top and bottom performers in the S&P 500. Among the 10 best performers nine do pay dividends (with the exception of Discovery).

One could argue this is largely a sector/inflation story as this list is entirely comprised of Energy companies aside from Discovery.

S&P 500 Top 10 Year-to-Date (as of 1/31/22)

The below chart of bottom performers is more diverse across sectors. What these companies have in common is that eight of the 10 (with the exception of Bio-Techne Corp. and Teradyne) do not pay a dividend.

S&P 500 Bottom 10 Year-to-Date (as of 1/31/22)

FANAMA Revisited

Last fall we wrote about the outperformance of Facebook Amazon Netflix Alphabet Microsoft and Apple over the last several years. We dubbed the group FANAMA (this was before the Facebook rebrand to Meta Platforms).

As a group FANAMA outperformed the S&P 500 by over 20% annualized between 2015 and 2020.

Of this group only Apple and Microsoft pay a dividend. As a result dividend-focused investments have struggled to keep pace with the broader market given such an unprecedented rally in non-dividend-paying shares.

Naturally after years of steady outperformance investments into FANAMA and similar tech-enabled companies had become a crowded trade.

A month into the new year only Apple is outperforming the S&P 500. Relative to the S&P 500 Equal-Weight Index—a benchmark that mitigates the disproportionate influence these companies have on the performance of the cap-weighted index—the underperformance is even greater.

FANAMA Stocks Year-to-Date Returns

Of WisdomTree’s large-cap dividend ETFs the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW) and the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund (DLN) both have sizeable weights to Apple and Microsoft. However each Fund has an under-weight allocation to Apple and Microsoft by over 100 bps relative to the S&P 500.

The WisdomTree U.S. High Dividend Fund (DHS) does not hold Apple and Microsoft as they each have relatively low dividend yields of less than 1%.

FANAMA Weights

For holdings of the Funds mentioned in the table above please click the respective ticker: DGRW DLN DHS.

The start to 2022 has been a favorable backdrop for WisdomTree’s family of U.S. dividend ETFs.

A few highlights in January:

DHS bested the Russell 1000 Value Index by over 500 bps and is the only Fund that has held onto a positive return (2.96%)

DGRW has shown resilience during a turbulent market environment outperforming the NASDAQ Dividend Achievers Select Index by 193 bps and the S&P 500 by 205 bps

Behind DHS the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRS) had the second-best performance relative to its benchmark outperforming the Russell 2000 by 465 bps as unprofitable speculative small caps struggled amid rising rates and inflation fears

Standardized performance and performance data for the most recent month end is available by clicking here.

For definitions of terms in the chart above please visit the glossary.

Conclusion

As we have written recently we believe investors should continue favoring dividend-paying equities in this environment of high inflation and negative real yields from fixed income.

Value generally and the dividend-yield factor specifically have been challenged for most of the past 15 years relative to growth. We believe the rotation that has occurred over the past several months is just the beginning of a longer-run mean reversion in favor of value/dividends.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Vancouver's Capsigen says yes,"Can harmless viruses target only the cells that need treatment? Vancouver company says yes.

In December 2019 John Bial sat in a coffee shop in Portland’s South Waterfront trying to grasp what the representatives from Oregon Health & Science University sitting across from him were saying. He almost couldn’t believe it.

A few months prior Bial had quit his job at Yecuris Corp. in Tigard Ore. to get back to his true interest of entrepreneurship. Now he was hearing about a technology that could answer what he thought was the biggest unsolved issue in medicine: gene therapy using viruses as a vehicle to deliver treatment to targeted tissues. It’s bleeding-edge biotechnology with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of some diseases.

Buy This Index ETF Instead,"Why spend time picking stocks when you could just buy the S&P/TSX 60 Index instead?

Canada has some great blue-chip stocks trading in our market. These large-cap companies have excellent fundamentals with strong business models a long history of share price appreciation solid dividend growth and good competitive advantages.

Canadian investors should strongly consider making these blue-chip stocks the backbone of the Canadian equity portion of their portfolio. However choosing which one to buy and hold can be tricky. Keeping up with the news re-balancing and staying on top of earnings reports can be tiring.

Fortunately there are a variety of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) out there that take the hassle out of stock picking. For a very low fee and zero effort you can own an ETF that holds 60 of Canada’s largest most traded stocks.

The best Canadian ETF

You might not know but the first ETF actually originated in Canada. In 1990 BlackRock launched the first version of the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF (TSX:XIU). Since then it has grown to become the largest and most liquid ETF in Canada with assets under management of $11 billion.

XIU works as an accurate barometre of the Canadian stock market’s performance because it tracks the S&P/TSX 60 Index net of expenses. This is a market cap weighted index of the 60-largest stocks trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).

The top 10 holdings of XIU contain many solid companies that should be held by Canadian investors for the long term. They include Royal Bank of Canada Toronto-Dominion Bank Shopify Bank of Nova Scotia Enbridge Brookfield Asset Management Canadian National Railway Bank of Montreal Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian Natural Resources.

What the numbers say

Holding XIU will cost you a management expense ratio (MER) of 0.18% per year. That means you’ll pay $18 a year if you own $10000 worth of XIU. That is an absolute steal especially compared to mutual funds that have an average MER 10 times that at over 1.8%!

XIU also pays a respectable dividend thanks to its many underlying Dividend Aristocrat stocks. Currently the 12-month trailing yield stands at 2.41% and is paid quarterly. Reinvesting this dividend can significantly boost your returns.

Finally the share price of XIU can be attractive for investors with a smaller account. Imagine trying to buy one share of each of the 60 companies in the S&P/TSX 60 Index. You would need to spend a lot! Fortunately XIU trades for just $32 giving investors affordable exposure to every stock without the need for fractional shares.

XIU has done very well over its lifetime. Below is a backtest from 2000 to present with all dividends reinvested versus the venerable U.S. S&P 500 Index. They’re both neck and neck in terms of risk and return. Notice that most of the outperformance of the S&P 500 came in recent years with XIU doing better in the years prior.

The Foolish takeaway

If you want an absolutely hands-off approach for your Canadian equity portfolio XIU is the way to go. For a small annual fee you get the performance of the top 60 stocks in the Canadian market.

You’ll never have to worry about rebalancing or monitoring the holdings trying to figure out which stock will do well or poorly. Set the dividends on to be auto-reinvested and enjoy watching your gains compound!",,,,,,,,,

According to information from the local media the Boeing 737 that was carrying 50 passengers and 6 crew members took off from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas (LAS) and with only 30 minutes of flight time the crew decided to return to the airport of origin after detecting a failure in the train. landing.

With that the aircraft performed the emergency landing procedure and part of the fuselage dragged on the runway generating sparks and smoke due to the impact.

In a video that is circulating on social networks it is possible to follow the moment when the Boeing 737 makes the forced landing where a team of firefighters was on standby to provide emergency assistance in case the aircraft caught fire.

After landing emergency teams were triggered to help passengers no one was injured.

Deliveries of these 30 additional planes will happen in 2023 and 2024. When delivered complete the Dallas/Fort Worth-based carrier will have a fleet of 130 MAX aircraft.



The airline announced that it had purchased a total of 23 additional 737 MAX 8 aircraft. These 23 aircraft are options that American has exercised. The other seven are purchase options in 2022 that American intends to convert to firm orders bringing the carrier's order by an additional 30 aircraft. 15 of these 30 aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2023 and the remaining 15 will be delivered in 2024. At the end of the third quarter of 2021 American Airlines outlined this delivery schedule for their MAX aircraft excluding these 30 additional jets. American will not receive any MAX aircraft in 2022 but it will receive 12 in 2023 and six in 2024. With these 30 options American will have 27 deliveries in 2023 and 21 deliveries in 2024.

It is unknown what the official goal of these aircraft will be. However there are certainly opportunities for replacement in American's fleet. Particularly with retirements of older Boeing 737-800s and Airbus A320s. The MAX aircraft can also be growth aircraft allowing American to add more routes and grow its schedule. Since the planes will not start arriving until 2023 Americans will have plenty of time to figure out how to integrate these aircraft into its system.

American Airlines was one of the first customers of the Boeing 737 MAX and the first airline in the United States to bring them back to revenue service after the 20-month grounding. The 737 MAX is an integral part of American's fleet and primarily operates out of Miami. The MAX is used on a variety of short and medium-haul domestic flights and flights to South America Central America and the Caribbean.

The economics and the improved fuel efficiency of the 737 MAX make it a suitable choice for longer routes that do not justify a widebody aircraft. American has been very public about putting the MAX as a significant component of the airline's sustainability and environmental goals. American 737 MAX 8s seat 172 passengers in a three-class layout. With 16 recliner-style seats in first class 30 in the extra-legroom economy and 126 regular economy seats. The aircraft also has power outlets in each seat and streaming entertainment. WiFi is also available for purchase so travelers can respond to emails stream entertainment or use the internet."

Ground was broken on the 200000-square-foot 10-story tower at 220 Eleventh Ave. at West 26th Street in the anxious days of February 2020. But work paused once the pandemic took lethal hold in the terrible weeks that followed.

Now a JLL team of Cynthia Wasserberger Peter Riguardi Frank Doyle and Michael Pallas are ready to market the project which should open for tenant buildouts in the first quarter of 2024. It’s one of a handful of entirely speculative buildings — meaning without pre-signed tenants — to go up since the coronavirus arrived.

“Our tenants won’t all necessarily be arts-related” Wasserberger said. “They’ll likely also be fintech media and financial services.” But the building “will have a lot of art in it” appropriate to the neighborhood that’s home to the Gagosian Pace and other premier galleries.

The Hudson Arts project aims to exploit the West Chelsea neighborhood’s ongoing resurgence. It’s close by the massive Terminal Stores warehouse-to-offices conversion site in which L&L Holding Company is a partner. Other neighbors include the born-again XI condo towers that were recently rescued from foreclosure by Steven Witkoff and Len Blavatnik.

It’s also across the street from the leviathan-scale Starrett-Lehigh Building where famed chef Marcus Samuelsson is launching a new full-block restaurant.

As at the other spec office buildings now underway owners Joseph and Mitchell Moinian are aiming high on rents — $200-plus per square foot for the penthouse floor and in the low-mid $150s for lower floors.

The structure will have a 12000-square-foot roof deck and terraces on several tenant floors — more than 15000 square feet of outdoor space in all. It boasts ceiling heights up to 17 feet and tenant amenities including a lounge fitness area and even a dog park.

The Moinians are also part of a joint venture with Boston Properties to build a nearly 2-million-square-foot office skyscraper known as 3 Hudson Boulevard in the Hudson Yards district — but that project won’t go up until an anchor tenant is signed.

The redesign and repositioning of 80 Pine St. has begun to pay off. Rudin Management has completed five new leases and expansions at the 1.2-million-square-foot tower that the Rudin family developed in the late 1950s.

Three new tenants are coming to the building: New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association AccuWeather and health information systems provider CureMD. Meanwhile media analytics firm January Digital expanded its space at the address.



The deals follow completion of the capital improvement program’s first phase which included a redesign of the ground floor entrances and lobby by Fogarty Finger Architecture. The next phase will see construction of an interconnected indoor-outdoor amenity center on the 22nd and 23rd floors.

Asking rents were in the mid-high $50s per square foot.

Global Management Group’s 99 Park Ave. has signed three new leases totaling 65428 square feet. The new tenants are Garan a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary; AKAM Associates a residential property management company; and CardWorks the parent company of Merrick Bank.

The area’s commercial real estate status shifted twice recently as Boston’s Novaya Foxfield bought a plot in Langhorne and sold a warehouse in Upper Merion. Natalie Kostelni mapped the activity for the Philadelphia Business Journal.

The Langhorne transaction was a $50 million outlay for “underutilized” land from Reedman Toll Auto World. A pair of transactions encompassing 80 “underutilized” acres transferred title on 37 parcels along Lincoln Highway Old Lincoln Highway and Virginia Avenue to Novaya.

Reedman Toll’s site at 1700 Lincoln Highway was not part of the sale and the lot continues as a viable car dealership.

The properties are zoned for light manufacturing and warehouse use industries flourish in that part of the county owing to its proximity to long-distance trucking routes.

The River Road transaction in Upper Merion divested Novaya Foxfield of its first CRE acquisition in the Phila. area made in 2019. The building leased to Target Corp. while it was still under construction netted $116 million. The property was formerly a Johnson Matthey Inc. chemical plant.

More on these transactions is at the Philadelphia Business Journal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyYW50LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L2hhcnRmb3Jkcy1zb2FyaW5nLWhvbWUtdmFsdWVzLWNvdWxkLW1lYW4tc3RpY2tlci1zaG9jay13aGVuLXRheC1iaWxscy1jb21lLWR1ZS1vZmZpY2UtaG90ZWwtdmFsdWVzLXNsaWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hartford's soaring home values could mean sticker shock when tax bills come due; office hotel values slide,"Many homeowners in Hartford face property tax bills that could soar by $1000 or more after a recently-completed real estate revaluation found strong gains in home values fueled by the pandemic’s hot housing market.

The overall value of single-family houses surged nearly 30% compared with the last revaluation in 2016. Two- and three-family houses — also considered residential real estate — saw even larger overall jumps of 38% and 46% respectively in appraisals according to the city.

The whopping increases have caught some homeowners in the city off guard while they are still struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus.

“A lot of people are really hurting” said Donna Thompson-Daniel chairwoman of the Blue Hills Neighborhood Revitalization Zone. “Not only are property taxes going up but we also know food went up. Gas went up. Clothing has gone up. But our paychecks have not gone up.”

Thompson-Daniel a retired school crossing guard who now works as a substitute teacher saw the appraisal on her 1100-square-foot 3-bedroom 1.5 bath Cape on Lyme Street jump nearly 40% to $165400 from $118400 in 2016.

Donna Thompson-Daniel at center and her children Robert Daniel II at left and Renbrook live in Hartford’s Blue Hills neighborhood. The appraisal on Thompson-Daniel’s Cape jumped nearly 40%.

“I’m waiting to see how many people are going to be able to afford to live where they are living right now” Thompson-Daniel said. “Some of these people are going to have to go and get a second job. And some of them are not young people.”

The city is going to have to figure out how to get some relief for property owners Thompson-Daniel said.

“If I was looking to sell I would be making some money” said Thompson-Daniel who has lived in her house for 34 years. “But I’m not looking to move out of my neighborhood because I love it here.”

Another equation

While residential real estate saw big gains the fallout from the pandemic had the opposite affect on most segments of commercial real estate.

The value of larger office buildings hotels and restaurants generally tumbled the revaluation found as uncertainty swirls around emerging from the pandemic. It is still unclear as to what extent companies will bring back workers to the office if they will downsize or renew leases and how business travel will be reshaped.

The city said office property values could fall by as much as 10% overall.

CityPlace I downtown Hartford’s tallest office tower for instance had its appraised value fall from $103 million in 2016 to $82 million in last fall’s revaluation a 20% decline. City Place’s owners Paradigm Properties of Boston declined to comment.

The appraised value of CityPlace I at left fell 20% in the city’s recently-completed real estate revaluation.

Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said the revaluation confirmed what the city has observed throughout the pandemic: the surge in the housing market — seen in towns and cities across the state — and the struggles in the office market.

“There is no question in this reval that residential properties will make up a larger share of the total taxable property than it did in the previous reval” Bronin said. “We are going to do our best in our budget process to mitigate the impact on homeowners by reducing the mill rate modestly if we can but that will only cushion the blow a little bit.”

Owners of larger apartment buildings with four or more units also are bracing for possible hefty tax increases. Larger apartment properties — considered commercial rather than residential real estate — was a bright spot in commercial real estate.

In Hartford and across the country investors have been shoveling funds into apartment projects and purchases pushing up values.

City officials point out that the trends aren’t all bad for office buildings downtown however with some signing leases with new tenants despite the pandemic.

For example the owners of One Financial Plaza the “Gold Building” inked a lease with Sun Life Financial last summer for 47000 square feet enough space for up to 450 employees.

Appraisals

The decline in appraisals for office and other commercial properties — the largest segment of taxable properties in the city — is taking on even greater significance in Hartford than elsewhere because of how the city’s property taxes are calculated.

Hartford’s One Financial Plaza the “Gold Building” recently signed leases including one for 47000 square feet that could eventually bring 450 workers downtown.

Property tax bills are based on a percentage of the appraised value or the assessed value. Hartford unlike all other towns and cities in Connecticut figures the assessed value differently for residential and commercial property.

Commercial property is assessed at 70% of appraised value while residential is pegged at 36.75%. The two-tiered system dates from the late 1970s and was intended to soften increases to homeowners after a long period between revaluations.

State law now requires property revaluations to be conducted every five years.

Bronin said the city could seek approval for delaying the revaluation but he is wary of doing that worried about further erosion in commercial property values in the next few years.

“This may be one of those situations where the best choice is simply the least bad option” Bronin said.

Tax exempts complicate things

Hartford has struggled with its tax rate of 74.29 mills with commercial property owners paying the highest real estate taxes in the state and some of the steepest in the country.

On top of that the value of tax-exempt real estate — government buildings hospitals and churches — exceed the value of taxable real estate by a third.

Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the tax rate by the assessed value and dividing that number by 1000.

City Assessor John Philip said Hartford is just at the beginning of the process that will lead to the tax bills that come due July 1.

The new appraisals and assessed values mailed two weeks ago to residents and commercial property owners are a key indicator of how tax bills will play out. But they are not the only piece of the puzzle Philip said.

The city’s grand list — the total of all taxable property — is expected to increase potentially pushing the tax rate down The city’s grand list now stands at about $4 billion but the grand list for 2021 is still being drawn up Philip said.

How much local tax money the city budgets to provide services to taxpayers also weighs heavily on the tax rate.

Property owners who do not agree with their appraisals and resulting assessments can discuss them with the consultant that performed the appraisal. If still not satisfied a formal appeal can be filed with the city Philip said.

Bronin said the two-tiered assessment system which is much lower for residential property actually puts Hartford in line with — or in some cases lower — than some surrounding suburban towns when it comes to taxing residential properties.

Studies showing higher rates of complications were based on older devices and anaesthesiologists were better at installing them now he said. “The complication rate is about one in 10 over the lifespan of the device which could be anything from a little bit of discomfort to where the battery lies to full-blown infection requiring removal.”

Adam Young received a stimulator to treat back pain caused by two prolapsed discs in his spine. The $40000 device now lives in his cupboard. “It’s just a big waste of time and an absolute money grab” he told The Age and Herald. The scar on Adam Young’s back Credit: Paul Harris “It was supposed to help me in all regards. And yet I couldn’t walk with it on. I couldn’t walk for 20 minutes. It felt like it was setting off other nerves as well. I tried to go to bed with it and I’d just toss and turn. No matter what setting I had it on. So I had to turn it off. “Don’t do it. Exhaust every other avenue that’s possibly out there first.”

Michael Johnson president of the Spine Society of Australia between 2018 and 2020 told The Age and Herald he was calling for the development of a spinal stimulation registry in Australia to monitor how well the devices were actually working and how much harm they were causing. “I think there are a moderate number of stimulators being put in inappropriately” he said. “In the last year I have operated on three people … and taken out a stimulator and thrown it in the bin. That’s a pretty substantial investment to just throw in the bin. And none of these people had received an opinion from a spinal surgeon.” Lauren Iacobucci did receive good relief from her stimulator at first. But then after a fall she felt the electrodes come out of her spine. “I had surgery to fix the leads and then they became displaced again. A month after that surgery I had another surgery to fix them again. And then the wound just wouldn’t heal. It just kept opening up and the leads would just pop through my skin.” Mrs Iacobucci had six surgeries in total before she gave up and demanded the device be removed. “It was horrendous. I can’t describe it. It is only recently I’ve started processing what I went through.

“But don’t let my story put you off. I think it’s a rare occurrence. It could work really well for them and be a really good option. But go into it do your research because it’s not just a simple fix.” ‘Don’t do it. Exhaust every other avenue that’s possibly out there first.’ Adam Young Mrs Iacobucci’s story is not uncommon according to data obtained by The Age and Herald in response to a Freedom of Information application. In America spinal cord stimulators have the third-highest number of medical device injury reports made to the US Food and Drug Administration. In Australia device manufacturers are required to notify the TGA when serious adverse events occur and when it is suspected – but not certain - the injury was caused by the medical device or the operation to insert it. Some events may simply be random chance – a patient having a stroke during an operation for example.

However the true number of events may be much higher. A 2019 analysis by the TGA’s own medical device staff suggest just 0.5 per cent of all problems may end up being reported. Among the complaints to the TGA two patients lost use of their legs until the stimulator was removed and even then they only regained partial movement. Another lost feeling in their pelvis. Another had “arm weakness”; an MRI showed spinal damage. Another’s knees gave way; they fell hit their head and ended up in an induced coma. An x-ray showing Lauren Iacobucci’s spinal cord stimulator in situ. Some patients suffered from incontinence for long periods of time. Others suffered tears and punctures to their spinal cord. Another suffered cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Another suffered a spinal cord tear which caused incontinence.

One patient developed infection at the surgery site which caused multiple organ failure or sepsis killing them. Another suffered a stroke due to spending a long time in the operating theatre and died. In addition there were more-common side effects. These include overstimulation constantly being shocked the stimulation not working device malfunction headaches infection pain at the surgical site or the leads detaching from the spine and moving around in the body or protruding through the skin. Of the reported events 296 were for device malfunctions with movement of the electrode wires the most common problem; 83 per cent of problems required further surgery to fix. For every 10 stimulators implanted in Australia four are removed. Some patients chose to write directly to the TGA about their experiences. “It shocked me painfully and uncontrollably until I struggled to reach my remote control to turn it off” one patient wrote in a complaint to the TGA. If he had not been home with the remote the device would have continued to cause him “torturous pain”.

The stimulator was removed by his surgeon but the pain did not go away. A later X-ray showed the surgeon had left a lead in which was now growing through his skin. “The fact that the [device manufacturer] people showed no concern and made me feel like a worthless guinea pig leaves me with a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness as to my future and quality of life” he wrote in the complaint. “Please help ASAP.” “Since I have had it in I have had six revisions” another patient wrote. “Surely this can’t be right… All these procedures the trauma and the pain. What am I to do? I don’t know who to talk to or get advice. Do I need legal advice?” The Age and Herald supplied the database of TGA reports to Professor Christopher Maher director of the Institute for Musculoskeletal Health and one of the world’s leading experts on back pain. Professor Maher and a team of researchers led by Ms Jones published an analysis of the dataset in the Journal of Patient Safety this month.

Of the 520 events in the database the team classified 93 per cent as serious or life-threatening. More than half were caused by the stimulator itself malfunctioning. For every 100 stimulators inserted 31 are later removed the researchers noted. Adam Young’s stimulator now lives in a cupboard. Credit: Paul Harris How well they work – or whether they work at all – remains deeply controversial. A 2021 Cochrane review – generally considered gold-standard evidence – concluded a stimulator probably did not provide clinically important improvements in pain compared to a placebo although the overall evidence was of very-low-quality.

Stimulators are often implanted to help patients wean off opioids but a study of more than half a million patients published in Anesthesiology in January found a negligible difference in opioid use over 12 months. “People considering this procedure should be aware that while some people who receive a stimulator seem to experience substantial pain relief. We are currently very uncertain how much of that relief if any is provided by the specific technology and how much is the result of placebo effects” said Dr Neil O’Connell the Brunel University London researcher who led the Cochrane review. A 2011 industry-funded study put the complication rate at 34 per cent. One patient in every 10 will have a lead move or fracture typically requiring surgery to fix the study found. “Thirty per cent for a reasonable human being seems really high” says Dr Chris Hayes director of the Hunter Integrated Pain Service and a former dean of the Australian Faculty of Pain Medicine. Early in his career Dr Hayes regularly implanted spinal cord stimulators. He no longer performs the procedure.

“We decided the outcomes were not good. We were getting quite a few take-backs to theatre. Patient harm. With stimulators it’s not that uncommon for the lead to move – then you have to take the patient back to theatre and put the lead back to where it’s meant to be. “And these devices can be get infected. We found a reasonably high complication rate even trying to be very careful. “Maybe there is a place for stimulators in very select patients. But we’re saying given the current evidence we’re not offering that treatment at this point in time.” A spokeswoman for the TGA said that the reports of incidents associated with use of medical devices does not necessarily mean that the device was at fault and the cause of the incident. “Spinal cord stimulators used quite widely both in Australia and worldwide are high-risk devices and are known to have complications associated with their use” the spokeswoman said.

Loading “The current information indicates that the safety and performance of these devices are acceptable. The TGA continues to monitor adverse event reports associated with these types of devices.” After a class action in 2019 Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay millions of dollars in compensation to Australian women affected by its defective pelvic mesh implants. The TGA received 95 pelvic mesh failure complaints before that issue turned into a medical device regulation scandal said Danny Vadasz chief executive of the Health Issues Centre. “Five hundred and twenty is a heck of a lot” he said. “That’s enough for a class action.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdC1qdWRlLWZvdW5kZXItYW5kLW1pbm5lc290YS1tZWQtdGVjaC10cmFpbGJsYXplci1pcy1kcml2ZW4tYnktaGVhcnQvNjAwMTQzMzY0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Jude founder and Minnesota med-tech trailblazer is driven by heart,"It would be easy to overlook the headquarters of Medical 21 Inc. tucked in a low-slung brick building in a Plymouth business park. The unremarkable exterior belies the personality of the company's founder and chief executive inside.

Manny Villafana is a legend in Minnesota medical technology and beyond — but not someone who rests on past successes. At age 81 he is on his eighth startup with Plymouth-based Medical 21 which he founded in 2016.

From his desk surrounded by a museum-like collection of old pacemakers Villafana explains his vision through parables. Only they aren't parables but true stories from his past that showcase his entrepreneurial zeal.

For half a century he has launched expanded and sold medical startups that have helped define shape and amplify Minnesota's medical technology industry.

His legacy is anchored by two companies he started in the 1970s: Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. (CPI) and St. Jude Medical Inc. Abbott Laboratories bought St. Jude for $25 billion in 2017.

""He really is one of those early serial entrepreneurs that has really shaped the ecosystem for medical technology"" said Scott Ward chief executive of New Brighton-based Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and a Medtronic veteran.

With the next medical frontier always beckoning Villafana just won't quit.

""When golf is as exciting as what I'm doing maybe I'll play golf"" said Villafana.

Every weekday morning he wakes up 5 o'clock goes to the gym eats breakfast and is at his desk by 9 a.m.

Medical 21's concept is to develop an artificial artery that can be used in cardiac bypass surgery replacing the need to harvest blood vessels from elsewhere in the body — such as the legs arms and chest. For decades dozens of companies have tried to do the same thing with no success. Villafana calls the quest ""the holy grail of cardiac surgery.""

With an entrepreneur's optimism and ambition he is undeterred.

While working at Medtronic early in his career Villafana suggested that it start making pacemakers with lithium batteries. Medtronic wasn't interested. At the time several companies were making pacemakers that lasted only 18 to 24 months. Villafana saw an opportunity and left his job to found his first startup Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. in 1972.

From a telephone booth in the downtown Minneapolis skyway he raised $50000 to start CPI.

""I didn't have an office"" Villafana said. ""I used to plug in the 25 cents or nickel or whatever it was and that's how I raised money.""

The company's first pacemakers used lithium batteries and came with an initial guarantee that the device would last three years. Lithium batteries have long since become the standard for all pacemakers.

CPI was sold in 1978 to Eli Lilly and Co. for $127 million which was later spun off with the medical device unit and eventually acquired by Boston Scientific Corp.

Villafana founded St. Jude Medical in 1976; the company introduced the first bileaflet all-carbon heart valves that soon became the industry standard. Before St. Jude heart valves were ball valves; the bileaflet version had two flaps that pivot for better blood flow.

In 1987 Villafana founded Helix BioCore Inc. which later changed its name to ATS Medical Inc. and was acquired by Medtronic in 2010 for $370 million.

Villafana's influence and impact locally is still felt today. Boston Scientific has more than 10000 employees and Abbott has about 5000 employees in the state. Manny's Steakhouse a downtown Minneapolis dining institution is named after Villafana who seeded the restaurant owner's startup costs.

The Manny approach

Perhaps as important as the technological advances made by his companies was Villafana's pioneering approach to relationships.

""He began that process of closely interacting with cardiac surgeons interventional cardiologists and really understanding their needs for the product and for education"" Ward said.

In the 1970s it was rare for medical device companies to train surgeons and medical fellows on their product. But that's exactly what Villafana did.

""The reason that [St. Jude Medical] retained their market share for so many years is because they trained and educated all the fellows all the cardiac surgery fellows on how to do heart valve implants and what they were trained on was the St. Jude product"" said Ward. ""That was all Manny. Manny is all about those close customer relationships.""

Today that's common practice in the business.

Villafana grew up in the South Bronx the son of Puerto Ricans who had — as he put it — ""nada nothing."" His mother father and his three brothers all died of heart attacks so it's no coincidence his career has focused on cardiac health.

""My entire family died of cardiac disease"" Villafana said. ""They all died too young.""

Cardiac bypass procedures are a very common surgery. The market is estimated at $8 billion Villafana said ""much bigger than anything I've worked with before.""

Villafana never went to college and holds an honorary doctor of science degree from the University of Iowa. Yet when talking about the human heart and the device his company is developing Villafana could pass as a doctor to a layman's ears.

Successes and failures

The key to creating an artificial artery is ensuring that the body will accept the material and won't itself lead to other complications. Medical 21 has licensed its technology from the University of Iowa but is making updates. The artificial artery itself looks like a very soft pipe cleaner made with a synthetic material and a nickel-titanium alloy wire.

Medical 21 wrapped a financing round in December; the company has raised $11 million since its inception. Villafana has taken seven companies public and expects Medical 21 to be his next. The company is looking to raise an additional $30 million to $40 million through a regulation A+ offering sometimes called a ""mini-IPO.""

In 2017 Medical 21 began testing the product on animals first in pigs and then in sheep.

Lyle Joyce a professor of surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin is on Medical 21's medical advisory board. His son David Joyce also a cardiac surgeon is also on the board.

Villafana ""is working in an area where there is a tremendous need"" Lyle Joyce said.

The father and son duo have implanted grafts in some animals. ""It went very well"" said Lyle Joyce. ""The present design is beautiful.""

Medical 21 hopes to start clinical trials of the artificial artery in the second half of the year in the United States and Europe. Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals are still several years away.

The company is collaborating with Mayo Clinic which owns an equity stake in the company. Juan Crestanello a cardiovascular surgeon at Mayo said he and his colleagues have seen some of Medical 21's work.

""The results so far have been very encouraging"" Crestanello said. If clinical trials proceed Mayo would be interested in being a trial site.

And while Villafana has found great success he's also failed like many serial entrepreneurs do. Medical 21 is his third consecutive company aimed at improving bypass surgery. CABG Medical Inc. developed an artificial graft but shut down in 2006 after unsuccessful clinical trials. And Kips Bay Medical created a mesh designed to support natural vein grafts. That company shut down in 2015.

Ward of Cardiovascular Systems believes Medical 21 may ultimately succeed where others have failed because of its persistent leader.

""Manny never moved on"" Ward said. ""He just keeps at it. He's going to keep working on it.""",,,,,,,,,

Immatics Bristol Myers Squibb Expand Strategic CAR-T Alliance

Represents an important part of the companies’ continued investment in next-gen cell therapies for patients with cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbWVkY2l0eW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvYXJjZWxseHMtaXBvLXJhaXNlcy0xMjRtLXRvLWZ1ZWwtY2hhc2Utb2YtYmV0dGVyLWNhci10LWNlbGwtdGhlcmFweS1mb3ItY2FuY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arcellx’s IPO raises $124M to fuel chase of better CAR T-cell therapy for cancer,"Bristol Myers Squibb was the first company to win FDA approval for a CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma and Johnson & Johnson could soon become the second. Arcellx has some catching up to do but its technology could offer some key advantages compared to the first-generation CAR T-therapies of its larger rivals. The biotech has encouraging early clinical data for its multiple myeloma CAR T and it now has $123.8 million in IPO cash to advance that therapeutic candidate to a pivotal clinical trial.

Gaithersburg Maryland-based Arcellx priced its offering of 8.25 million shares at $15 apiece which was the low end of its planned $15 to $17 per share price range. Those shares began trading on the Nasdaq Friday under the stock symbol “ACLX.” Arcellx’s stock price opened at $19 before settling down to $16.80 at the market close.

The “CAR” part of CAR T stands for chimeric antigen receptor—the receptor that recognizes and binds to an antigen on a cancer cell. CAR T-cell therapies are made by harvesting a patient’s T cells and genetically engineering them to express antigen-specific CARs on the cell surface. The first CAR T therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences won FDA approvals for certain types of blood cancer that had not responded to earlier therapies. BMS’s CAR T-therapy Abecma was approved for multiple myeloma last year.

While CAR T offers a way to address blood cancer cases that have failed earlier lines of treatment some patients do not respond to these therapies or they relapse later. CAR T also introduces the risk of dangerous side effects. Arcellx aims to overcome those challenges with technology that enables it to produce synthetic binding scaffolds that are “deimmunized” which is the company’s way of saying that they are engineered to avoid causing an immune response.

The synthetic binding scaffolds which Arcellx calls D-Domains are smaller than the binding domains in currently available CAR T therapies. In its IPO filing Arcellx said that the smaller size allows it to reduce the size of the lentivirus construct used to deliver its genetic cargo. Consequently these therapies may have better transduction which is the transfer of the genetic material into a T cell. In preclinical research Arcellx said D-Domain led to higher transduction efficiency a higher expression of its binders on the surface of T cells and lower signaling that can lead to off-target activation of the T cells.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Arcellx’s lead program CART-ddBCMA is a CAR T-therapy designed to target BCMA a protein found in abundance on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. The company noted in the IPO filing that it has achieved transduction efficiency higher than published Phase 1 data for BMS’s Abecma and Johnson & Johnson’s experimental CAR T therapy ciltacabtagene autoleucel both of which target also BCMA. Arcellx’s comparison comes with the caveat that it is looking across trials with different designs and methodologies rather than head-to-head studies. Nevertheless more efficient transduction is one sign that the Arcellx drug could be competitive to BMS’s Abecma and J&J’s CAR T which is expected to receive an FDA decision by the end of this month.

At the 2021 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December Arcellx presented data for the first 24 multiple myeloma patients dosed with CART-ddBCMA in a Phase 1 expansion study. Of those patients 22 could be evaluated for safety 17 of whom had disease that was unresponsive to five earlier lines of treatment. As of the Nov. 4 2021 cutoff date 19 patients could be evaluated for efficacy. Arcellx reported an overall response rate of 100% in all 19 and a complete response or a stringent complete response in 68% (13 of 19) patients. The median follow-up period for these patients was 283 days.

CAR T therapy’s side effect risks include cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Arcellx reported that these problems were manageable and resolved with standard treatment measures at the two dose levels tested. No off-target effects were observed. Arcellx now plans to advance CART-ddBCMA to a pivotal 100-patient Phase 2 clinical trial by the end of 2022. In the IPO filing the company said that based on its discussions with the FDA successful data from this study combined with the Phase 1 results should be enough to support a biological license application submission. The company also hopes expansion studies from the Phase 2 test will support use of CART-ddBCMA as an earlier line of treatment. For context Abecma’s approval covers its use treating multiple myeloma unresponsive to at least three earlier lines of treatment.

The synthetic binding domains Arcellx produces are key components of a second platform technology that the company calls ARC-SparX. This technology produces CAR T-cell therapies engineered to target multiple antigens in order to adapt as a patient’s cancer changes. Also the dose of these therapies can be controlled in order to minimize toxic effects. The most advanced drug from this platform ACLX-001 is on track to enter Phase 1 testing as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; ACLX-002 is being developed for acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

The potential competitive advantages of Arcellx’s approach could go beyond blood cancers. CAR T-therapies have not been able to hit solid tumors. Arcellx contends its technology produces binders that do. The tech can also be applied to off-the-shelf cell therapies. These applications are not limited to T cells. Natural killer cells are among the other cell types listed by the company for potential use of D-Domain. Longer term the company is looking outside of cancer.

“Ultimately we hope to develop multiple therapeutic options incorporating different mechanisms cell modalities and targets to treat hematologic cancers solid tumors and indications outside of oncology such as autoimmune diseases” Arcellx said in its filing.

Arcellx was founded in 2014. Prior to the IPO Arcellx had raised $234.8 million in financing most recently a $115 million Series C round of funding that closed last April. New Enterprise Associates is the biotech’s largest shareholder owning a nearly 14.5% post-IPO stake according to the filing. SR One owns 11.4%; Novo Holdings owns 9.5%.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2021 Arcellx reported its cash position was $131.2 million. That money combined with the IPO proceeds will be deployed across the biotech’s pipeline. Between $75 million and $85 million is budgeted for the Phase 2 test of CART-ddBCMA. Another $10 million to $20 million is earmarked for drug candidates from the company’s ARC-SparX platform.

In reality you’ll be checking in more often when dramatic stock price movements happen or corporate events take place. Today we’re going to check in on a company we haven’t written about in several years – Schrodinger Inc (SDGR).

The last time we wrote about the firm was in a piece titled A Computational Chemistry IPO From Schrodinger which looked at the S-1 filing document which accompanied their initial public offering (IPO) which took place in February 2020. Simply put Schrodinger has developed a physics-based computational platform that uses artificial intelligence to help drug developers better predict which novel molecules will successfully pass the FDA drug approval gauntlet. The business model derives revenues from two main sources:

Licensing software to customers – largely on-premise

Capturing some downstream upside through royalties and milestone payments – large rewards if drugs are successful

A two-tier damage award of damages of $270.2 million against Broadcom and $837.8 million against Apple that involved different royalty rates from each company is “legally unsupportable"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled. The January 2020 verdict was one of the largest jury awards in a patent case in U.S. history.

The court also affirmed the jury finding that Apple and Broadcom infringed two CalTech patents but ordered a new trial of infringement on a third patent. One of the three judges on the panel said he would have thrown the whole case out believing none of the patents were infringed.

The case was remanded to a court in Los Angeles for a new trial on infringement of one patent and to determine how much Broadcom and Apple should pay.

CalTech said it was pleased that the validity of the patents and part of the infringement findings were upheld.

“This is recognition of Caltech’s inventions in the field of data communications which are now widely used in Wi-Fi products because they significantly improve the quality bandwidth and range of wireless data transmission"" the school said in a statement Friday. “We are confident that the value of the patents will be fully recognized at the damages retrial.""

Officials with Broadcom and Apple didn’t respond to queries seeking comment.

The high damage award was based in large part on the broad range of Apple products that were accused of using the university’s inventions for wireless data transmissions. The case targeted Broadcom chips and any Apple smartphone tablet or computer that that has one.

CalTech argued that it would have negotiated two licenses -- one with Broadcom for chips that weren’t sold to Apple and then with Apple for the devices that included Broadcom chips “at a vastly different royalty rate"" according to the opinion.

“The mere fact that Broadcom and Apple are separate infringers alone does not support treating the same chips differently at different stages in the supply chain and does not justify submitting such a two-tier damage theory to the jury"" the Federal Circuit ruled.

“In the absence of a compelling showing otherwise a higher royalty is not available for the same device at a different point in the supply chain"" according to the court.

In an unrelated case involving patent claims against Apple a different three-judge Federal Circuit panel ordered a new trial on damages in a $85.23 million verdict won by Quarterhill Inc.’s Wi-Lan over a way to allocate bandwidth in wireless communications.

The court ruled that Wi-Lan’s damages expert used a “flawed"" methodology that was “untethered to the facts of this case"" but also that the trial court erred in ruling that Apple iPhones with Intel Corp. chips had a perpetual license to the Wi-Lan patent.

The cases are California Institute v Broadcom 20-2222 and Apple Inc. v. Wi-Lan Inc. 20-2011 both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington).

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc3RlcmxpY2h0LWJyb3duLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktZG9ub3IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Donor Barry Sternlicht Assails Brown’s Deal With Protesters,"One of Brown University’s major donors the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel calling it “unconscionable” and saying he had “paused” donations to the school.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9qYW5lbGxlLWJyb3duLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtYmlydGhkYXktdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1zb24tZ2Fycmlzb24tZGVhdGgtODY0NDI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janelle Brown Celebrates 55th Birthday Two Months After Son Garrison's Death,"Janelle Brown is marking a milestone two months after the death of her son Garrison Brown.

The Patriots met with Maye on multiple occasions including a trip to North Carolina for the Tar Heels Pro Day. During that trip Mayo and company spoke with longtime and well-respected coach Mack Brown. Mayo specifically said he received a “glowing recommendation” from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.

Brown a 46-year coaching veteran met with a handful of New England reporters on a video conference Monday and relayed what he told Mayo and company during the pre-draft process.

“I’ve learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting so I’m very honest with the NFL coaches” Brown said. “This is important to them.

“So with Coach Mayo I knew this is huge for him just starting out in this first year. So I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players and that’s what you’re (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.’

I just told him ‘If I was the coach of the Patriots I would want Drake Maye.’ Mack Brown on conversations with Jerod Mayo

Brown’s recommendation to Mayo was echoed throughout the pre-draft process and again Monday. Brown praised Maye for his toughness competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

Brown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family along with the quarterback’s longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.

“He’s an unbelievable person” Brown said. “He’s one of the nicest toughest most competitive young people I’ve ever been around. I’ve said often I would adopt him. He’s that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny but it’s true.”

Brown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.

“So if they came and said ‘We want you to do this advertisement.’ He said ‘Well the offensive linemen need to be with me and they need to be paid.’ Or ‘Well we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.’ And he said ‘That’s great the receivers and their families need to get fed too.'”

But Brown made it clear to New England’s organization the competitor they were getting too.

“He is not coming to Boston to lose” Brown said.

It seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization."

As he meandered through Red Rock Resort Aaron Bettale gravitated toward a slot machine featuring animated video of stampeding buffaloes and explosions of gold coins ringing bells and the refrain of a disembodied voice exclaiming “Buffalo.”

“I like the flashy stuff” Bettale who is in his 20s said as he examined the Buffalo Link machine. “I don’t like the ones that just have the three sevens.”

For casino operators gamblers like Bettale who recently moved to Las Vegas from Colorado represent the coveted young adult demographic. The hope is young players can be cultivated into lifelong casino patrons.

The average age of U.S. casino customers declined from about 50 in 2019 to 43 last year according to the American Gaming Association. And 25% of casino patrons were under age 29 the group noted.

The trend can at least partly be attributed to the coronavirus pandemic said Jon Hanlin a senior vice president of commercial strategy and business analytics for slot manufacturer Aristocrat Gaming.

After movie theaters concert halls nightclubs and other entertainment venues closed during the early months of the pandemic in 2020 casinos were some of the first to reopen Hanlin said.

“That created a new bubble of people who had never frequented casinos before” Hanlin said. Sign-ups for casino players club cards have skyrocketed among 21- to 35-year-olds he said.

Red Rock has recently introduced a number of games geared toward young adults including a skills-based offering called Megamatch-Jelly Kingdom a cross between a video game — similar to Candy Crush Saga — and a traditional slot machine.

Jelly Kingdom which is now on the casino floors at six Station Casinos properties is made by an Australian company called Wymac Development.

Sally Bernard a Las Vegas local who works as vice president of business development for Wymac said young people “are more interested in slot machines these days compared to before the pandemic.”

“There are many variables to understand slot demographic behavior and how and why things have changed over time. When looking at data over the last dozen years prior to COVID-19 it had been on a steady decline” she said.

Another Wymac skill-based game Fortunes of the Brave-Dragon Forge recently went through testing at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson Bernard said.

The game which has a feature where players can create a customized character is expected to be formally introduced later this year.

Last year Aristocrat shipped out slot machines based on the 2021 remake of the science fiction movie “Dune” to some Las Vegas casinos Hanlin said.

The game was released about the same time as the remake creating a cross-promotion opportunity at some Station Casinos properties with theaters.

“We noticed that people coming out of the movie were more likely to try the game out” Hanlin said. “We tried to capture that younger segment with our ‘Dune’ machines.”

“Something else that has driven a younger audience is the willingness of casinos to allow for filming on the floor” said Hanlin who has previously worked as a regional vice president of slots for Caesars Entertainment.

“When I was a casino operator we’d tell people to put their phones down. That’s changed in the last three or four years” Hanlin said. “People are filming and I can tell you they’re not posting anything about losing on social media. They’re posting about hitting jackpots. It creates a younger vibe.”

Brian Christopher a California resident and slots aficionado who runs a YouTube page with more than 450000 subscribers is one of the most well-known personalities in the slot machine social media world.

Aristocrat welcomed Christopher last year to its Las Vegas complex to play the Buffalo Link game before it hit the casino floor.

“Even just in the past year and a half our audience has gotten a lot younger” Christopher said. “The pandemic may have helped a little in the beginning when people just needed a place to go but it’s more than that. Right now it’s the male millennial that is driving the YouTube page and my videos.”

Christopher said his YouTube channel which features live game demonstrations and video blogs can help familiarize people with the casino scene.

He said certain casinos seemed to “get it” by having an active presence on social media channels which can help to market to a younger demographic. In Las Vegas he mentioned the Plaza and Cosmopolitan as being forward-thinking in that regard.

“My fans make the comment a lot that they try new games that we highlight” Christopher said. “What we do is important in helping people understand what’s going on. It can be very overwhelming to sit at a slot machine that you’ve never played before. We’re no longer talking about a three-wheel game.”

“There are fun and exciting games with fun and exciting bonuses” Christopher said. “If I look at the games that my parents or grandparents played they don’t excite me. Now we’re always on our mobile devices or in front of a TV screen and these games match that.”

Michael Green an associate professor of history at UNLV who follows the region’s gaming industry said technological advances in the presentation and complexity of slot machines have played a big role in attracting more millennial and Generation Z players.

“Younger people have grown accustomed to smartphones and devices on their wrists and slots have advanced technologically too” Green said. “I think back to when people used to stand there pull a handle and watch a wheel spin and pop up cherry cherry lemon. The technology has advanced a lot.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55c3BvcnRzZGF5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L2NhZXNhcnMtc3BvcnRzYm9vay1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWFkLXdpbGwtYmUtZmlyc3Qtb2YtaXRzLWtpbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caesars Sportsbook Super Bowl Ad Will Be First Of Its Kind,"The Super Bowl long has been the most highly bet single-day sporting event and this year there will finally be televised sports betting ads played during the game.

But before it’s too far behind we wanted to talk about an anniversary at the end of the year. The Flamingo Hotel turned seventy-five. It opened on December 26 1946.

Let’s face it: The Flamingo’s origins have been the subject of endless myths and endless study. The Mob Museum hosted a discussion involving authors who have done a lot to straighten it out: W.R. Wilkerson the third grandson of the original builder and Larry Gragg a historian who wrote a biography of the ultimate builder Bugsy Siegel. There were plenty of news stories about the anniversary too. But let’s provide a little background.

The original idea apparently was Billy Wilkerson’s. He was a force in Hollywood. He founded The Hollywood Reporter the first paper that really covered the film industry. As for Las Vegas connections he got some financial help from Howard Hughes… and helped start the Hollywood blacklist in the McCarthy era when one of the big anti-communists was Nevada’s Pat McCarran. Wilkerson was big on the nightclub scene too. He opened Ciro’s and LaRue’s both top southern California spots to see and be seen.

He wanted to replicate that sort of thing in Las Vegas. He had the idea for a resort on Highway 91 where he and his Hollywood friends could hang out. Wilkerson also liked to gamble so that attracted him. He got construction started on the Flamingo.

This is where it gets even more interesting. Wilkerson needed money. Siegel invested on behalf of his organized crime friends. Eventually Wilkerson was out of money and Siegel took over. He got the property completed and opened it. Does that mean it really was Wilkerson’s idea? Almost certainly. But remember that organized crime figures never have been big on writing things down. So we don’t know for sure just what Siegel was up to before he became the official boss.

You know the rest of the story pretty well despite the myths. When the Flamingo opened the hotel wasn’t ready. The claims have included that the casino was deserted that torrential rain kept people away. Neither was true. But it was hard to run the casino without the hotel. After it reopened the Flamingo did better but Siegel died at his lover Virginia Hill’s Beverly Hills home in June 1947. Whodunnit? We still don’t know. There’s plenty of speculation ranging from mobsters upset with a lack of profits to Hill’s brother resenting Siegel’s treatment of her. We may never know… The Beverly Hills police department still lists it as an open case but there don’t appear to have been many recent leads.

The night Siegel died was probably best described by Robert Lacey a biographer of Meyer Lansky. Into the casino walked Gus Greenbaum Moe Sedway and other associates of Siegel and Meyer Lansky. Lacey described them as looking like “generals mopping up after a coup.” Whatever it was the mob had controlled the Flamingo and still did. They made it into a big success. Lansky’s allies operated it for the better part of two decades followed by Kirk Kerkorian who then sold it to Hilton. Through mergers and buyouts it’s owned by Caesars Entertainment which Eldorado Resorts out of Reno recently took over. None of the original building stands but the history and the legends remain fascinating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvZm9udGFpbmVibGVhdS1icmFuZC1oYXMtbG9uZy10aWVzLWJldHdlZW4tbGFzLXZlZ2FzLW1pYW1pLTI1MjQ4NDMv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLWNvbHVtbnMvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtaW5zaWRlci9mb250YWluZWJsZWF1LWJyYW5kLWhhcy1sb25nLXRpZXMtYmV0d2Vlbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtbWlhbWktMjUyNDg0My9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fontainebleau brand has long ties between Las Vegas Miami,"The Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel in Florida is seen Tuesday Dec. 7 2021.

In the fall of 1954 a newspaper columnist quipped that he had been invited to the upcoming premiere of the “trillion dollar” Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach.

Rooms at the new South Florida spot included a $262-a-day suite he later wrote — or more than $2700 today when adjusted for inflation.

“Meals are extra of course” the columnist noted.

Not long after the now-iconic hotel also boasted a link to Las Vegas — a connection that following a volatile run on the Strip continues today.

Developer Jeffrey Soffer owner of Fontainebleau Miami Beach reacquired Las Vegas’ Fontainebleau a year ago well over a decade after he originally broke ground on the towering hotel-casino only to see it go bankrupt after the economy crashed change hands a couple of times and then get derailed by the pandemic all before Soffer came back to finish what he started.

Construction is underway on the 67-story Fontainebleau Las Vegas which is slated to open in late 2023 and feature 3700-plus rooms.

Long before Soffer acquired Florida’s Fontainebleau in 2005 and unveiled plans that year for the one on Las Vegas Boulevard a contractor named Morry Mason linked the swanky Miami Beach hotel to America’s gambling capital.

According to published accounts Mason owner of Taylor International Corp. built numerous hotels in South Florida including the Fontainebleau.

He then ventured to Las Vegas and built the Riviera which opened in 1955 and the Tropicana which debuted in 1957 according to his grandson Jim Mason president of Taylor International.

Morry Mason moved to Las Vegas in the mid-1960s and his family construction business had a hand in several other well-known casino resorts on or near the Strip.

Among other projects the firm built Caesars Palace the former International (now Westgate Las Vegas) and the original MGM Grand (now Bally’s) Jim Mason told me.

More recently the company acted as owners’ representatives for the Hard Rock Hotel’s conversion to Virgin Hotels Las Vegas he said. Virgin opened last March following the hotel’s roughly $200 million overhaul.

Taylor International also worked as caretakers at the Fontainebleau under billionaire owner Carl Icahn who acquired the project in 2010 for around $150 million and left it largely untouched until he sold it in 2017 for $600 million to developer Steve Witkoff Jim Mason said.

Jim Mason who owns Taylor International with his brother Bill said they ensured the Fontainebleau’s central plant was operational and that systems such as fire sprinklers and generators were still working.

“There’s a lot of moving parts even when it’s not occupied” he said noting the firm also took care of the property for a period under Witkoff.

Towering over the north Strip the Fontainebleau was for years a glaring reminder of Las Vegas’ wild real estate boom and devastating crash. It stood there unfinished as the economy regained its footing from the Great Recession and as other stalled projects around the valley were completed.

More recently it was also a sign of the pandemic’s early spillover effects.

Witkoff who had set out to open Drew Las Vegas as he called the project in 2022 halted construction in the early chaos of the outbreak when much of the economy including Nevada’s casinos rapidly shut down.

Plenty of work remains on the Fontainebleau. But with a crane now in the air an “fb” logo near the top of the tower work trucks on site and other visible signs of construction the long-unfinished skyscraper is yet again on a path to opening.

Costco’s Kirkland Signature brand is perhaps America’s weirdest private label. You can put Kirkland Signature AA batteries alongside Kirkland Signature cashews in your shopping cart.

It’s also shockingly successful.

Kirkland raked in $58 billion in sales during Costco’s latest fiscal year making up around a quarter of the company’s total revenue. Kirkland is America’s biggest consumer packaged goods’ brand measured by sales. It’s larger than Hershey (HSY) Campbell Soup (CPB) or Kellogg (K).

But it wasn’t always this way. It took Costco a couple decades to get its Kirkland strategy right.

If you shopped at Costco in the United States three decades ago you’d find about 30 different Costco private-label brands alongside the big-name food and household staples’ lines.

There was Simply Soda. Chelsea toilet paper. Ballantrae wine. Clout detergent. Nutra Nuggets dog food. These brands were sold only at Costco which was called PriceCostco at the time after Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 (Costco dropped ‘Price’ from its name four years later).

But Jim Sinegal Costco’s co-founder and CEO at the time decided these brand names were forgettable. He sensed a major opportunity to overhaul the company’s private-label strategy.

Sinegal was inspired by a 1991 article in Forbes about rising profit margins for leading consumer goods’ companies at the time like General Foods H.J. Heinz and Nabisco and the emerging growth of private-label brands. Consumers are “starting to switch to house brands…The trend so far is only a trickle but it shows signs of growing fairly rapidly” the article said. Sinegal underlined key passages from the article and sent it around to Costco’s top merchants.

Costco at the time was also expanding internationally including in the United Kingdom and Canada where stores’ private-label brands were better quality and more popular with shoppers than in the United States. Most US chains’ private brands had been boring knockoff brands with white labels.

“We found that there was a resurgence of private-label product and that was driven an awful lot by the fact that the prices of brand-name products were growing so rapidly” Sinegal said at a talk in 2019 at Georgetown University. Rising prices for big-name brands “created an umbrella” for Costco to develop its own brands at 15% to 20% below branded alternatives he said.

Sinegal told Costco’s merchants that he wanted the quality of Costco’s private labels to replicate those found overseas. And he had an unusual request — one name for all of them.

“The conventional wisdom said that you had to have a different name for every class of product that you had — a la Sears Roebuck with the Kenmore appliances and the DieHard batteries and the Craftsman tools” Sinegal said in 2019. “We looked at it and we said you know we’re in so many countries and we have such a wide array of products we’ll have a room full of attorneys that are doing nothing but trying to clear these names.”

Sinegal asked staff for suggestions for a name and someone floated Kirkland Signature a spin on the location of the company’s Washington State headquarters and came to executives with a design. (“Seattle Signature” was also considered but Costco couldn’t trademark the name.)

“We liked it” Sinegal said. “We cleared it for every country and every product category that we would have. That made it simple.”

So in 1995 all those private brand names disappeared at Costco and were replaced by a new logo with a simple black white and red design reading Kirkland Signature.

Although Costco soon moved its headquarters to nearby Issaquah the Kirkland name stuck: “Nobody could spell Issaquah so we kept it.”

‘KS’

Kirkland Signature known as “KS” at Costco would soon be slapped on everything from diapers to tires to golf clubs.

Last year Costco introduced a 24-pack of 12oz Kirkland hard seltzer and a 750ml Prosecco rosé. This year Costco is adding Kirkland cauliflower pizza furnace filters and a set of saute pans among other items.

The sole private-label brand at Costco is an essential part of the retailer’s positioning with customers and a way for Costco to stand out against competitors.

Kirkland which is exclusive to Costco draws members into warehouses and leads them to renew their $60 and $120 annual memberships every year. Perhaps more important to the company Kirkland helps Costco solidify its image as a value store with quality products say analysts.

“Kirkland is a proxy brand for Costco. It really means Costco” said Christopher Durham president of Retail Brands Institute a trade group representing the private brand industry. Kirkland is designed to appeal across demographic groups he said unlike many other retailers’ array of private labels that are each targeted at a specific segment of shoppers.

Having one name signals consistency to shoppers — exactly Costco’s goal — and also creates cost efficiencies for the no-frills retailer. Costco doesn’t have to pay for different packaging and can put all of its buying power with suppliers behind Kirkland. A single private brand is emblematic of Costco’s broader approach to merchandise at warehouses: Less choice is better.

“Kirkland has a one-note strategy and it’s really good at that one note” Durham said. “It creates a reason and a point of differentiation for people to shop there.”

‘Don’t get it wrong’

Many retailers have made developing their own brands a priority in recent years. Store products carry higher profit margins than national brand products and don’t incur the same advertising costs.

But Costco’s approach is novel. It’s still one of the only large retail chains to carry all of its private brands under a single banner. Costco rival Sam’s Club in 2017 streamlined its 21 private brands into its Member’s Mark brand.

Kroger (KR) says in filings that it produces and sells its private brands in three “tiers” — premium mainly under the Private Selection label a middle brand called Kroger (KR) and value brands such as Big K and Heritage Farm. Kroger (KR) also produces a natural and organic brand called Simple Truth.

Costco is unusual in its approach to developing private-label brands. Kirby Lee/AP

Most supermarkets take a similar tiered strategy known as “good better best” said Scott Mushkin a retail analyst at R5 Capital. But Costco has “positioned Kirkland as a premium brand at value prices.”

Other retailers also sell a wider variety of labels in an effort to target different types of consumers for various products.

Walmart (WMT) has more than a dozen private brands such as Great Value household staples and George men’s clothing. Target (TGT) has dozens like Cat & Jack kids’ clothing and Good & Gather food. Amazon (AMZN) has more than 400 different private brands according to estimates.

Going all in on the Kirkland label remains a risk for Costco.

“Maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability” of Kirkland products is “essential” to keeping members loyal to Costco the company says in its annual filings. If Kirkland “experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence” sales and profit margins may suffer.

“If you get 99 things right and one thing wrong people are going to remember the one thing. So you don’t get it wrong” said Costco finance chief Richard Galanti. “From an opportunity standpoint Kirkland is known. It’s a brand.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLW9mLWJyYW5kcy9jYW4taGVybWVzLWFuZC1uaWtlLXN0b3AtdW5hdXRob3Jpc2VkLW5mdHMvODkzNjU1NDfSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9icmFuZGVxdWl0eS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLW9mLWJyYW5kcy9jYW4taGVybWVzLWFuZC1uaWtlLXN0b3AtdW5hdXRob3Jpc2VkLW5mdHMvODkzNjU1NDc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Hermes and Nike stop 'unauthorised' NFTs?,"Advt

As digital objects in the form of NFTs have exploded in popularity and value over the past year so too have the legal headaches and complications. Nike became the latest company to file a lawsuit over the issue on Thursday -- suing shopping platform StockX for creating and marketing NFTs with its logo and branding.It follows a lawsuit last month by French luxury brand Hermes against artist Mason Rothschild  who has auctioned 100 ""MetaBirkins"" -- a digital ""homage"" to the label's famous Birkin bag -- some fetching tens of thousands of dollars.- Can these cases succeed? The Hermes case could go either way said lawyer Annabelle Gauberti whose firm Crefovi specialises in creative industries.Rothschild has argued that he is protected by the First Amendment as an artist which often has validity in US courts.In Europe too: Gauberti recalled the example of a case from a decade ago in which Louis Vuitton lost in its attempts to prevent a Dutch artist placing one of its bags in a picture of a Darfur refugee.""The 'fair use' defence works well particularly in UK and US law in which an artist can use a trademarked word or product to make a point or as a parody"" Gauberti said.But she said Rothschild may struggle to convince a judge that his work had artistic merit.""It's hard to see on the face of it what message he is trying to convey other than that he wants to make a lot of money so it's going to be a lot of work for his legal team"" she said.The Nike case is a more directly commercial affair since StockX has never claimed its NFTs are a form of art.But it remains to be seen how trademark law holds up in the digital realm.""The extent of these protections in the digital world as well as what remedies can be granted are yet to be explored"" wrote lawyer Danielle Garno in a briefing note for Lexology.- Should NFTs be treated differently to physical art? In his response to Hermes published on Twitter Rothschild compared his MetaBirkins to Andy Warhol's famous Campbell soup paintings.""The fact that I sell the art using NFTs doesn't change the fact that it's art"" he wrote in a response published on Twitter.However Edward Lee of Chicago-Kent College of Law told Bloomberg Law that the Warhol comparison was not perfect since the Campbell Soup Co. was never likely to get into the business of selling paintings whereas Hermes could well choose to create its own NFTs.The technology can also confuse matters since an NFT is actually just a receipt of ownership rather than the thing itself.""Many people assume that when you talk about an NFT the content of the NFT is inside the token which it is not and because it is not there is no unauthorised reproduction"" Primavera De Filippi co-author of ""Blockchain and the Law"" told Business of Fashion magazine.- What can companies do to protect themselves? - Hermes has demanded that Rothschild remove and destroy his MetaBirkins and at least one NFT platform OpenSea has already agreed to remove them from sale.But Gauberti said enforcing the law online is very tricky.""Even if lawsuits are successful how do you go after the guy who has already bought the item or stop them being sold on secondary auctions? It's the wild west in terms of enforcement online"" she said.The best option she said is for brands to get ahead of the copycats and dominate the space with ""official"" NFTs.Nike has done exactly that acquiring RTFKT a company that specialises in designing digital sneakers in December.""A strong offence is the best defence"" said Gauberti.""At the moment a lot of these brands are on the fence (about creating their own NFTs) because their core products are physical and they're still watching the space to see if the metaverse will really take off.""",,,,,,,,,

Wisler was working for Capital One in the Washington D.C. area when M&T Bank recruited him to be its chief information officer. After much deliberation Wisler accepted the offer in 2018.

Now he advocates for making Buffalo an appealing place for tech workers and other recruits through new assets like the tech hub in Seneca One tower and playing up the region's strengths like its cost of living and higher-education system:

Q: Buffalo's population has grown for the first time in a long time. What opportunity does that bring?

A: If you think the theory of what we're trying to accomplish is creating a place that is attractive that's a really good sign.

Think about the attraction of companies and what comes with that. You think about the mission that we're on with M&T and our hiring and bringing a significant amount of the more modern tech workforce but not exclusively tech into Buffalo. I think all those things are contributing. I think this is a place that is starting to show up on the map.

I have a theory and I don't know how useful this theory is. On the one hand we look at the talent war that we're in. And we stare at one of the components which is lots of companies are so starved for talent that you can work anywhere.

And many of us – I am definitely in this category – feel like the winners in the future are going to design teams that have the mission that we have that are part of the community. And I think the proximity to others is going to be an important differentiator.

My theory is I think that while locally we feel like we're losing talent I think that we might be in this competition losing it to companies but not losing it to the region. I think folks are taking advantage of the fact that they can work from different places without the move.

I think that in the near term that feels like a real painful thing. But I think in two to three to four years we're going to experience this feeling that there's more talent available as we create this place that's relevant for those who might have left a company but didn't leave the area and want to be back in that kind of community setting the things we're building here.

I think ultimately human beings particularly the creative class – those of us who are solving problems that we don't know yet who have to huddle around them in order to be most effective – are going to figure out that being in proximity to each other being in a place that's conducive being around others who are solving the same types of problems is a differentiator.

It's hard right now for us to maintain that conviction because of the tension that currently exists.

Q: You had to be persuaded to move here. What won you over?

A: On paper it wasn't an obvious career move.

[While being recruited] I came up here up like six or seven times. One time I came I didn't even tell anybody. I didn't tell [chairman and CEO] René [Jones].

I stood in the middle of Main Street in February which is not prime recruiting season around here and I just kind of looked around. Because I was asking myself the same question that people who cared about me were asking which was some version of ""What are you thinking?""

And I'm looking around Main Street in 2018 in February and I'm like what's going on? Why do I feel compelled to come be a part of this community? Because if you measure the things that are tangible and you can calibrate across this community there's no bustling downtown you don't see billboards with software companies up like you do now.

Those are the signals that when we're trying to attract somebody who's been living and working and their experiences are those types of things that we just weren't sending.

For me it was about can I go below those types of tangible-measure things?

It's like do you want to be part of a tribe that's on a mission? Do you want to be part of something bigger than yourself? Do you see the kind of opportunity in taking the gifts and experiences that you're just lucky to have in my case and apply them to a different context? Is it screaming at you like ""This will immediately be applicable and can you make a difference?""

Those were really the questions that made the difference for me. I was sitting in D.C. surrounded by tech companies and big banks and they're throwing all kinds of money around – not just for me personally but you have at your disposal the kind of assets and wealth inside a company that can solve the biggest problems at the biggest scale in any way you want.

But an individual can't make a difference in D.C. like they can make a difference in Buffalo.

We're starting as a community being able to pull in folks who had choices just like I did. Their ledger is starting to look a little bit better because we're sending some of those signals.

Q: You talk a lot about a race for relevance. What does that mean?

A: If you think about the successful ecosystems or communities that are already on this journey I think what you see are these concentric circles of communities.

The people at the center are the highest risk takers the real entrepreneurs. There's a lot of volatility there's some success but there's a lot of losing. It's just the nature of the beast.

You've got to have that hot core and it's got to be supported by the things around it. It's got to be a place where they can find talent it's got to be a place where they can find capital it's got to be a place where they can create a runway for the company. But that's got to be healthy. Ours is healthy.

But around it needs to be a place that's supporting it. You need small- medium- and large-sized institutions around it that have an appreciation for the risk and the environment that's in there. We're supporting them bringing to bear assets that help them be successful. But there's also this kind of life cycle that happens.

There's a lot of failure in there and that failure needs a place to go. A founder starts a company. … The majority of them don't work they need a place to fall out and continue be able to survive.

Oftentimes what you see in these communities is a founder has an idea. The idea doesn't work. They have to be able to fall back into the community go work for an M&T go work for somebody. They'll get back to the center if the ecosystem is supportive and healthy.

Q: What about developing talent already here?

A: Four-year universities aren't going to solve that problem for us. That's not a criticism of four-year universities. We need to think about the skills that it takes to be part of a modern technical services based company as the 21st century blue collar trade.

And we need to think about how we create talent in the same way that we think about that.

In many ways it's staring right in front of us. We've got to think about apprenticeships going into communities who in the technical area are just simply underrepresented for a million different reasons and plant those trees that are going to take a long time but they need to be a part of this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vcGVubmNhcGl0YWwtc3Rhci5jb20vYnJpZWZzL2Zvci1zYWxlLW9uZS11LXMtc2VuYXRlLXNlYXQtZ2VudGx5LXVzZWQtcGVyc29uYWwtZm9ydHVuZS1wcmVmZXJyZWQtZWRpdG9yaWFsLWNhcnRvb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For sale one U.S. Senate seat gently used.

View the current offers here.

JetBlue's Mint is one of the best business-class products in the skies with excellent service and top-notch seats. Better yet the airline recently rolled out all-new Mint Studios and Suites on planes operating JetBlue's London routes and a handful of domestic jaunts too.

That said booking JetBlue Mint is tough if you're on a budget. Cash tickets are expensive on most routes and JetBlue's own TrueBlue loyalty program prices Mint awards accordingly. In most cases this means you'll need tons of points.

Thankfully there's a workaround: Booking with Emirates Skywards. Let's take a closer look at how to leverage JetBlue's partnership with Emirates to get a great deal on JetBlue Mint business-class awards.

Why it's a good value

JetBlue TrueBlue prices award tickets based on the cost of a cash ticket. Mint tickets aren't cheap so you'll often find sky-high award prices as a result. For example this mid-January flight from New York-JFK to Los Angeles (LAX) costs a whopping 82200 points one-way.

Thankfully there's a way around this: Using miles from Emirates Skywards. Emirates and JetBlue have a long-standing partnership and Emirates recently revamped its JetBlue award chart to include Mint flights. This isn't to say that Mint flights are cheap this way but you can expect predictable pricing that's consistently lower than booking with TrueBlue points.

Here's a look at Emirates' JetBlue award chart. The JFK to LAX example above clocks in at 2465 miles flown so Emirates would charge just 52000 miles for the same flight. This is a huge saving especially if you need to transfer points from a credit card to book your ticket. By opting to transfer to Emirates Skywards instead of JetBlue TrueBlue you could save over 30000 points.

Or you can book shorter routes like New York-JFK to Aruba (AUA) — which clocks in at 1951 miles flown — for 40000 points in business class. Again this is usually far cheaper than booking with JetBlue TrueBlue.

But perhaps the best deal is booking JetBlue's new flights to or from the U.K. These flights weren't initially bookable with Skywards miles when Mint redemptions went live but that changed in early 2022. You can now book transatlantic Mint flights between the Northeast and London for a very reasonable 64000 miles each way. These tickets typically cost around $1500 each way when booking a round-trip ticket so you will get well over two cents in value per mile.

There's one downside to booking with Emirates though. Emirates Skywards has access to more limited award space than JetBlue TrueBlue so you may need some flexibility to find bookable Mint award space.

Booking JetBlue awards through Emirates is pretty straightforward and can be done online — here's a step-by-step look at how to do so.

Step 1: Log in to your Emirates Skywards account

You'll need an Emirates Skywards account before you can search for an award ticket. If you don't have an account yet you can create one easily.

Step 2: Search for award availability

In the search box on Emirates' homepage click ""Advanced search: multi-city promo codes partner airlines.""

(Screenshot courtesy of emirates.com)

Then click the ""Book Classic Rewards Flight"" and ""Search partner flights only"" buttons and enter your desired itinerary. Based on our experience you shouldn't check the ""Flexible dates"" box as that results in an error message. Also make sure to select ""Business Class"" to find Mint seats.

(Screenshot courtesy of emirates.com)

Step 3: Pick your flight

You'll then be shown all of the flight options available for your date. As long as there is ""I"" fare availability it should be bookable through Emirates. Your best bet would be to use ExpertFlyer to search inventory and set alerts if there's no availability. (ExpertFlyer is owned by TPG's parent company Red Ventures.) If you see a flight you'd like to book click on it to start the booking process.

Step 4: Confirm and pay

Now follow the on-screen prompts to book your ticket. Although minimal you'll want to pay the taxes and fees with a card like The Platinum Card® from American Express or Chase Sapphire Reserve so that you're protected if something goes wrong during your trip.

How to earn miles for this award

The beauty of this sweet spot is how easy Emirates Skywards miles are to earn. You can transfer points to the Dubai-based carrier from all the major transferable points programs. This includes Chase Ultimate Rewards Amex Membership Rewards Bilt Rewards Citi ThankYou Rewards Capital One Miles and Marriott Bonvoy. All transfers are at a 1:1 ratio with the exception of Marriott which transfers at a 3:1 ratio with a 5000-point TrueBlue bonus for every 60000 Marriott points transferred.

If you need to stock up on points to book your own JetBlue Mint ticket consider earning Capital One miles. Here's a look at our favorite credit cards that earn these miles and their respective welcome offers:

(Capital One Field)

Score: #2 Maryland 21 High Point 13

Records: High Point 0-1 #2 Maryland 1-0

COLLEGE PARK Md.— High Point University men's lacrosse fell 21-13 to the 2021 NCAA Runner-Up #2 Maryland on the road on Saturday (Feb. 5). Going back to last season it was HPU's second straight game against the #2 team in the nation after playing Duke in the NCAA Tournament in May. Brayden Mayea picked up where he left off following his tremendous freshman season against Maryland Mayea had five goals. Matching the game-high as UMD's Logan Wisnauskas had five of his own. This is the fourth time in his career that Mayea has scored five or more goals. Asher Nolting had seven points on the day as he had one goal and six assists.

HPU was looking to defeat Maryland in their home opener something that has not been done since 1924.

Jon Torpey : Hats off to Maryland they had a great game plan and executed all day long. Looking at us I think we really dug ourselves a hole early and at this level against an elite opponent it's tough to play catch up for 60 minutes. It seemed like every time we were going to get back in the game we did things uncharacteristic of our team and gave Maryland 2nd chance opportunities. Our program has always been eager to play the best teams in the country early in the season as it gives us tremendous answers both schematically and personnel-wise. We certainly figured some things out today and I'm excited for what lies ahead. We have a great week in front of us with two incredible opponents. I'm excited to see how the staff and our guys respond. I'm honestly hoping the version that lies in front of us is better than the one in the rearview mirror. I have a feeling it will be.

Panther Particulars

HPU was able to hold UMD to only two goals with 3:33 to play in the first quarter. Nick Rizzo stopped the 4-0 Terp run as he supplied a goal with 2:09 in the first to make it 4-1. The first goal of Rizzo's collegiate career came against the #2 Terps in just his fourth appearance ever in college lacrosse.

And while the Capitals are still in the thick of the battle at the top of the Metropolitan Division the team is apparently no closer to identifying the team’s number one goaltender than they were at the beginning of the season or the beginning of last season for that matter.

The performances of Vitek Vanecek and Ilya Samsonov have been mixed to this point. Neither netminder has grabbed the reins as a the number one starter although one could argue that neither has been given a sufficient stretch of games to prove their viability as the teams “starter” on a regular basis.

Most consecutive appearances by a Capitals goaltender so far this season is 4 games. Vanecek and Samsonov have each done it twice. #ALLCAPS — NoVa Caps (@NoVa_Caps) February 3 2022

I’ve regularly analyzed and documented the performances of each goaltender this season in my regular goaltender analytics reports (here here and Justin dug into it here) but how are Vanecek and Samsonov stacking up against the rest of the league’s goaltenders? How do they compare against potential postseason opponents? In this post we take a look.

Statistics used are courtesy of Natural Stat Trick and NHL.com. If you’d like to learn more about the terms used in this post please check out our NHL Analytics Glossary. (Reminder simply click on any of the graphics to enlarge).

OVERALL SAVE PERCENTAGE (SV%)

Let’s start with the basics – save percentage and goals against average.

Vanecek has done fairly well in save percentage so far this season when compared to the rest of the league’s netminders who have played more than 400 minutes (8 games). He currently ranks 18th out of 61 goaltenders and is well above the league’s average save percentage of .911%

Ilya Samsonov remains below the league average save percentage. And while that’s certainly disappointing for a first round draft pick there has been some recent improvement (with the exception of his last start).

GOALS AGAINST AVERAGE (GAA)

The next basic stat to consider is goals against average. Once again Vanecek is performing better than the league average while Samsonov is not.

The basic stats tell us that Vitek Vanecek has had the better season to date. But let’s dig a little deeper in order to potentially determine where each goalie stacks up in certain areas of the game.

GOALS DIFFERENTIAL (xGA – GA)

Goals differential is simply the difference of goals that are expected to be scored minus the actual goals given up by a netminder (Analytics glossary). In other words how is a goaltender performing in relation to what is “expected”?

Once again Vitek Vanecek is well above the league average of .629. He ranks 12th overall among goaltenders with more than 400 minutes of ice time. And once again while Samsonov still remains below league average he has been rising in the ranks over the past five weeks. It’s something to keep an eye on.

HIGH-DANGER SAVE PERCENTAGE (HDSV%)

The postseason typically places a higher premium on defending against the close-range shots or gritty goal area. This is generally known as the “high-danger” area.

High-danger shots refer to a specific area of the ice close to the opponents goal that has historically yielded a higher percentage of goals per shot attempts. In general terms it’s the “home plate” area from the goal out to the faceoff dots to the top of the circles.

Vitek Vanecek has been solid all season in saving high-danger shots. In fact he’s been one of the best in the league at even strength. He currently has the 5th-best high-danger save percentage in the league.

Ilya Samsonov continues to struggle in this area. However as noted before there has been some improvement in recent weeks and is a stat that should be watched when evaluating his game in the coming weeks.

SAVE PERCENTAGE ON PENALTY KILL

Once again Vitek Vanecek is above the league average in save percentage during penalty kills while Ilya Samsonov is below league average although both are very close to the league average.

SUMMARY

It’s clear that Vitek Vanecek has been the better goaltender so far this season yet he hasn’t really been given complete control of the number one spot. The big question is why not?

In tracking Ilya Samsonov since his draft in 2015 including all of his games with Metallurg in the KHL and all of his games with Hershey it’s become fairly apparent to me that Samsonov has shown he needs consistent games to gain steam and to find his top-end groove. Do the Capitals have that luxury and will he ever get that chance remains to be seen.

Vitek Vanecek should get the first start on Tuesday night against the Blue Jackets. If Ilya Samsonov gets the start that tells me the team is still trying to give Samsonov a chance to find his top-end groove. The question remains how long does that continue?

The trade deadline is set for March 21 and I’d expect GM Brian MacLellan to be active. He’s made it clear the team is “all in” during the final years of Ovechkin and Backstrom’s current deals. Look for a veteran goaltender to be added in the coming weeks.

–

King Dan Reilly

–

Reilly was born in Plattsburgh and raised in Saranac Lake.

He may be recognized for the large Winter Carnival parade floats he works on with others from Rumble Carpentry and HomEnergy Services — giant cupids Mighty Mouse aliens and dragons.

He could be known through his work on the St. Bernard’s School Pendragon Theatre boards or as a longtime member of the local Kiwanis Club where he spent several years as its president.

Maybe he’s known for work on the Saranac Lake Civic Center or for organizing fundraisers. Reilly raises money for the Pat Stratton Memorial Bicycle Ride; helped organize Heat-A-Palooza a concert raising money for heating assistance; works on the bike rodeo for kids to get helmets and learn bike safety and has taken part in the Tour de Force raising money for families of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.

Reilly said his nomination for Carnival king came as a surprise and an honor. He was asked by the people who told him he was nominated if he would accept it.

“I guess I’d be as dumb to say ‘yes’ as I would to say ‘no'” Reilly said with a laugh.

Reilly said he didn’t get into volunteering for the accolades. He said his work all happened “organically.” Friends would ask him to join boards and groups he’d learn of new groups to work with or people to assist through these groups. One thing would lead to another and suddenly he was working on numerous projects boards and events.

He kept seeing areas of need and working to help meet those needs. But he doesn’t view himself as particularly altruistic.

“I’m as selfish as the next person” Reilly said.

He points out that he’s just one of the many people working on these projects and groups.

Reilly said the “glory” of the Saranac Lake community is a group effort.

The community’s been there for him and his family through all times of life and he said he feels compelled to give back to it.

“This community’s given me a lot” Reilly said letting the tears flow. “You know my brother just died. I just cry easily these days. The community gave him a lot.”

He said community is a conduit for giving and getting.

“If people don’t give to it then you don’t have it” he said.

He didn’t always have a lot of money but he always gave his time.

He’s passionate about the issues that plague the community — water quality housing jobs and poverty. He’s especially zealous about helping children.

Reilly fondly remembers his years as “head elf” for Christmas gift giveaways at the town hall. He recalls driving a truck with Santa and all the gifts to the town hall and seeing over 100 kids excitedly bouncing around outside.

“It’s bringing a tear to my eye now” Reilly said.

Reilly said his goal as king is to go to as many events as possible especially the ones with the kids.

Queen Martha Watts

–

Watts feels “truly honored” to be the Winter Carnival queen.

“It’s kind of a life dream” Watts said. “We live in the best place there is with more volunteer spirit than I’ve seen anyplace.”

Anyone who’s seen an Ice Palace in the past two decades has read her work. She’s the one who writes the Carnival theme in colorful slush letters on the front wall every year.

Watts has been working on building the Ice Palace since 1990. She’s been in charge of putting up the lettering on the walls since 1995. She was married to her late husband David at the Ice Palace.

Watts was born in Brooklyn raised on Long Island and has lived here for 47 years.

She came up to study forestry recreation at Paul Smith’s College in 1975 and immediately fell in love with Saranac Lake. She said she learned a lot there sure but the associations she made became life-long friends.

“Paul Smith’s truly truly gave me my life up here” Watts said.

When she saw her first Carnival during college she was stunned.

“I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread” Watts said. “We know how to make our own fun. … The rest of the world what I’ve seen of it isn’t quite like us.”

Watts is always busy around Winter Carnival. This year she’s wondering if she bit off more than she could chew. But she’s plowing forward and getting it all done.

Her interview with the Enterprise on Friday afternoon was broken up into several segments because she was so busy. She had just come from setting up Arctic Golf holes. While on the phone she moved the large icicle she’s saving for the Heat Keepers icicle contest to a safe space in the snow. She got a call from a houseguest coming over to help with the PSC Booster Club Chocolate Festival. After the interview she was going to eat some lunch — at 4:30 p.m. — and get ready to be crowned that evening.

She likes staying busy.

“It makes life more fun” Watts said. “You get to meet a lot of people and you get to serve the community.”

Watts said she was raised to volunteer. She was a Girl Scout and a member of an active church. She said her mother demonstrated service and had Watts tag along everywhere she went to help people.

She’s helped organize the ALPO dog sled races 90-Miler canoe races Girl Scouts and the restoration of the PSC stagecoach.

She’s volunteered at Adirondack Medical Center Habitat for Humanity the Paul Smith’s College Visitor Interpretive Center Salvation Army and of course the Ice Palace Workers Local 101.

She’s a deacon with the First Presbyterian Church of Saranac Lake a member of the PSC Alumni Association Board and treasurer for the Paul Smith’s College Booster Club.

Watts believes Winter Carnival is an important event for the village. It brings visitors and business in during the quiet winter months; it brings people together in a time when the weather can be isolating; and it’s a time to neighbors to recognize the needs of others and leverage the energy of Carnival to help them.

As queen Watts plans to attend as many events as she can get to and she looks forward to seeing the parade from a different viewpoint.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhaXRpbGlicmUuY29tL2VuL25ld3MtMzU4OTItaGFpdGktZmxhc2gtdGhlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtY2FuY2Vscy10aGUtbmF0aW9uYWwtY2Fybml2YWwtMjAyMi1idXQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Haiti - FLASH : The Government cancels the National Carnival 2022 but... - HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7,"

About 135 people jumped in the event this year including four Whitefish police officers. Most of the jumpers were in groups that helped raise significant funds for the Special Olympics.

“We love doing this and it’s a good chance to support our community and be involved with programs like this that benefit the kids. We look forward to stuff like this” said Officer Trey Nasset of the Whitefish Police Department.

The Penguin Plunge had a goal of collecting $50000 from this event but ended up raising closer to $60000.

“It’s great you know. Everybody helps everybody else out with whatever needs to be done. And it’s just a great awesome group of people to be around” said Amber Miller Penguin Plunge Queen 2020.

This marked the 21st year of the Penguin Plunge and many of the people who participated have done the jump in the past.

“It’s extremely exhilarating and you come out looking like a popsicle when you finally emerge from being in the water” said Miller."

Beyond the benefits of smoother launches America’s aviators can now carry out more maritime air assault sorties without wearing out their airframes.

The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) is drawing greater interest from U.S. allies and given the advantages of dual carrier interoperable missions the United States should seize this moment to strengthen global deterrence by providing the technology to trusted partners.

Late last year the U.S. State Department approved the sale of the system to France—a clear step toward strengthening NATO’s deterrence in the European and Mediterranean theaters. There could also be enormous tactical and strategic benefits from extending EMALS collaboration to Japan South Korea Australia and India. With the EMALS these partners could collectively enhance power projection in the Pacific while distributing the load between each ally. As tensions rise from Ukraine to Taiwan that enhanced strength is sorely needed.

After years of scientific research innovation and testing the system has now proven to be an operational success. Last year in a key milestone the Navy and General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems reached 8000 carrier launches with the system.

If fighters can fly more sorties they are able to dwell longer and adjust their attacks should new intelligence or targeting information arise. Joint carrier operations can also improve the chances that an air campaign will be able to destroy overwhelm or defeat enemy air defenses.

Just last week the Navy performed dual carrier training operations in the Pacific in order to demonstrate readiness. Notably these exercises involved command-and-control and sortie generation coordination both of which are key measures of interoperability.

Another less recognized advantage is the system’s adaptability. This can allow EMALS to support amphibious assault ships or low-cost attritable aircraft for which building runways is cost-prohibitive or not possible due to challenging terrain. In addition U.S. allies without aircraft carriers could consider EMALS for other surface ships. Should it come to fruition this would massively expand power projection capabilities and bolster allied global deterrence posture.

This kind of combined power could strengthen the deterrence posture of the United States and its allies vis-à-vis China.

Outside of the obvious tactical benefits there would also be notable economic benefits for U.S. allies. By taking advantage of a system that the United States has already spend billions on allies would be able to upgrade their naval power projection capabilities without having to invest in development.

As electromagnetic propulsion greatly reduces strain on airframes a joint EMALS partnership could also reduce maintenance and sustainment costs for allies and partners.

As EMALS is engineered to be both steady and tailorable it can be adjusted for different aircraft weights and configurations. This is particularly valuable because the amount of thrust required varies depending on a complex range of interwoven factors including airframe size and shape the wind speed and the speed of the aircraft carrier itself.

General Atomics is already delivering EMALS for the second and third Ford-class carriers. These capabilities will strengthen the strongest link in America’s chain of deterrence. It’s time to help allies and partners do the same.

Tire prices saw repeated increases throughout 2021 and this year may not prove much better according to manufacturers.

The same supply chain constraints that led to longer delivery times and higher prices amid growing demand for trucks and key equipment like tires —one of the greatest expenses for fleets — are still posing challenges for manufacturers.

Last week Yokohama announced another price hike for consumer and commercial truck tires in the U.S. “in response to the continued rise in operational costs.” The company previously hiked prices Nov. 1 Aug. 1 and May 1 last year.

Other tire manufacturers have also continued to raise prices at a time when the rate of inflation in the U.S. hits 7% a 40-year high. Last year alone many tire manufacturers big and small raised prices an unprecedented five or more times according to tirebusiness.com.

Bridgestone last Spring increased prices by 8% on Firestone brand truck and bus radial tires sold in the U.S. and Canada (one of four price increases in 2021) and added another 14% this month. Michelin increased prices on commercial tires up to 13% in July of last year followed by a hike in September reaching up to 14% and then another increase up to 16% on January 1.

As market volatility continues those hoping for a return to normal in 2022 may be in for a rough ride.

“In respect to our industry’s supply chain dilemma I believe those projecting a return to normalcy in 2022 might be a bit too optimistic” Jeff Barna president and CEO of Yokohama Tire said in a recent statement regarding the company’s performance last year and its outlook on the year ahead.

[Related: Tire experts provide cold weather maintenance tips]

“To understand the true depth of this breakdown one would need to peel back the dozen or so layers that have contributed to the malaise” Barna continued. “As an example knowing that we have a problem with the 85-plus steamships anchored off the Port of Long Beach is only the tip of the ‘macro’ iceberg.”

Barna pointed out other limiting factors like the microchip shortage plant shutdowns labor unrest at the ports driver shortages excess container complications and potential freight company arbitrage.

“The point here being that even if some or most of these are remedied in the near future it will likely be 2023 before re-alignment of all variables is achieved” Barna said.

Andrew Briggs Yokohama’s vice-president of marketing and product management also blamed a convergence of factors for higher tire prices including an uptick in raw material costs like rubber which shot up nearly 80% from April 2020 to April 2021. Prices have since come down but are still well above pre-pandemic levels.

“There hasn’t been one single factor driving prices upward but rather a multitude of headwinds generally stemming from the global supply chain crises” Briggs said. “This includes but isn’t limited to higher raw material costs as well has higher freight and logistics expenses for finished goods.”

Michelin also cited the Suez Canal closure in March of last year as yet another supply chain failure. The canal was shut down for six days after a Japanese owned freighter Ever Given became grounded and brought ship traffic to a halt leading to another supply chain disruption along with billions of dollars in lost trade revenue.

“These tensions have affected the availability of raw materials and the ability of suppliers to deliver on time” Michelin said in a statement to CCJ. “This has also caused an increase in raw material and transport costs. Michelin is taking all the measures necessary to ensure the continuity of its activities as it has done for several months now: firming up contracts to guarantee supply and control price effects boosting local supplies in as far as possible in order to guarantee timescales implementing new shipping solutions etc. and therefore Michelin North America has not had a production disruption due to supply.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDYvcGhpbGlwcGluZS1haXJsaW5lcy1mcmVzaC1mcm9tLWJhbmtydXB0Y3ktZGVzY2VuZHMtcmlnaHQtYmFjay1pbnRvLXR1bXVsdC_SAWtodHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L3BoaWxpcHBpbmUtYWlybGluZXMtZnJlc2gtZnJvbS1iYW5rcnVwdGN5LWRlc2NlbmRzLXJpZ2h0LWJhY2staW50by10dW11bHQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philippine Airlines Fresh From Bankruptcy Descends Right Back Into Tumult,"Philippine Airlines has finally exited from Chapter 11 with debts erased and new capital infused. But will these be enough to keep it flying with clearly too many pilots in its cockpit?

Asia’s oldest airline Philippine Airlines has certainly been through a lot of economic turbulence within the Philippines and in Asia along with numerous changes in political headwinds on the local front. It even survived management takeovers — from being a state-run carrier in the 1960s and 1970s to private hands in the 1990s — as well as labor strikes lawsuits near financial collapse and even a brief closure in 1998.

In late December PAL exited from Chapter 11 bankruptcy which wiped out some $2 billion in debts. Its restructuring plan includes the reduction of its fleet and a commitment from majority owner and CEO Lucio Tan to infuse $505 million in new capital.

But will this be enough to keep the carrier flying though?

On the eve of the Lunar New Year considered an auspicious day among Filipino-Chinese families like those of Tan PAL’s board of directors decided to let go of its president and chief operating officer Gilbert Santa Maria. In his place they appointed a pilot Captain Stanley K. Ng as acting president and officer-in-charge. Ng who joined the carrier in 2003 as a member of its ground staff is the son-in-law of Tan.

The Wrong Signal

“This officer in appointment sends the wrong signal to creditors especially since PAL just exited from Chapter 11 bankruptcy” said financial analyst Astro del Castillo. “It will only add more questions about PAL moving forward on what direction it will take.”

He predicted investors would likely play it safe instead of putting more money in PAL which is currently suspended from trading shares as the carriers’ finances fell into a tailspin with the Covid-19 pandemic wreaking havoc on global travel.

PAL’s communications staff declined to respond to Skift’s inquiries why Ng was only appointed officer-in-chief even as its press release lauded his track record.

“An Airbus A320 commander Captain Ng is the first pilot to assume the presidency of PAL since the early 1960s. He brings to the job a wealth of experience in the airline industry” the press release said.

“He started flying in 2008 as a Second Officer and rose up the ranks until he was promoted to senior vice president in 2019 in charge of the airline’s internationally-respected pilots and cabin crew as well as operational airport and engineering teams.”

Ng will be sitting in the carrier’s main cockpit for at least six months. “Captain Stanley will be (the officer-in-charge) while PAL is looking for a very qualified chief operating officer. His appointment was made so Gilbert (Santa Maria) can leave as soon as possible.”

Whispering Winds

Whoever ends up being hired as the carrier’s chief pilot will have to go up against a formidable owner and family members along with a coterie of associates constantly undermining Tan and his lieutenant’s decisions.

Various sources including former PAL executives point to instances where decisions already made would be overturned just because some family member or consultant whispered a different opinion pushing the tycoon to change tack. Those familiar with PAL’s operations said this was probably what happened with Santa Maria whose departure was already rumored as early as last December.

Appointed president in July 2019 Santa Maria had to find ways to stem the carrier’s bleeding finances. But PAL sources told Skift his management style did not sit well with employees and Tan’s associates.

The pandemic worsened PAL’s shaky finances forcing Santa Maria to retrench 2300 employees — 30 percent of its workforce — in early February 2021. PAL also had to reduce domestic and international flights. But the carrier was able to trim its losses to $325 million in the first half of 2021 from $411.8 million the year before just as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York last September.

Wanted: New Chief Operating Officer

Del Castillo said Santa Maria tried to professionalize the airline but acknowledged he may have ruffled a few feathers in the process. “When you try to implement changes you are likely to step on some people’s toes” del Castillo said.

The analyst expressed hope that whoever ends up replacing Santa Maria will be just as good. “(Santa Maria) was aggressive in fighting for the industry not just for PAL especially during this pandemic” del Castillo said.

A former PAL executive recommends the carrier’s next president to immediately appoint key officials to help him frame its direction and policies. “He will need a strong (chief financial officer) head of commercial group and head of planning and strategy” the former executive said adding that Santa Maria appointed a young head of the commercial group with no airline experience. His head of planning also had no airline experience just like him.

“The new president will need a cohesive board of directors who will give guidance and direction” said a source familiar with the matter who wished to remain anonymous."

CATERPILLAR have confirmed that they will be launching a new smart creep feature for their D3 skid-steer and compact track loader models that operate Cat cold planer and wheel saw attachments.

Smart creep senses the load on the attachment and automatically adjusts the drive command to keep the cold planer or wheel saw running at the most productive speed. According to Caterpillar a combination of attachment sensors and proprietary software optimally balances attachment load and machine speed to maximize productivity.

By continually sensing the load on the attachment smart creep increases machine speed when encountering less resistance and automatically slows the machine when encountering higher load. Engine load remains constant while the operator can monitor hydraulic pressure on the in-cab display panel.

Without the aid of this feature setting the creep speed too fast can lead to stalling the attachment whilst slower speed results in productivity loss. Smart creep software smoothly and efficiently determines the optimal machine speed for cutting conditions.

Millions of years of evolution have allowed the seemingly delicate butterflies to survive. Their ability to fly in unpredictable zig-zag patterns prevents them from getting eaten by predators and their intricately designed wings – that are organized into photonic crystals – give them control of light waves to create iridescent colors. These creatures are inspiring great strides in the scientific community through their unique biology.

Researchers have recently turned to butterfly anatomy to improve scientific technology

Chunlei Guo Professor of Physics and Materials Science at the University of Rochester has been studying how butterfly wings are so efficient at harnessing solar energy. Since butterflies are cold-blooded insects they need to efficiently harness solar energy to maintain a high body temperature. Their intricately designed wings are organized into photonic crystals which are crystals that interact with light and give them control of light waves to create iridescent colors.

Guo’s research has involved studying the vividly blue morpho butterfly. The blue morpho’s intense wing color is not due to pigment but to the nanoscale structure of the wing itself. The wing is composed of millions of nanoscales tiny structures that reflect only blue frequencies of light.

This discovery of structural color allows researchers to control light and produce color without the use of chemicals or paint. It also led to the creation of a highly light absorbent material called “absolute black” which absorbs all colors of the spectrum and thereby increases heat absorption. Infrared lasers could mimic butterfly wing structures and etch similar micro-nano structures onto metals. Guo and his team found that administering these nanostructures to a solar panel improved its efficiency by 130%.

Studying the makeup of a butterfly’s cocoon also enabled scientists to identify an innovative and strong material called fibroin the proteins found in caterpillar cocoons. Researchers at the Tufts Silklab in Boston were able to isolate the fibroin which has many potential uses. It can be very flexible or as hard as the strong synthetic fiber Kevlar and can have different medical applications. The material can be used as bandages or implants in reconstructive surgery. Fibroin can also be shaped into small screws which can be used to reconstruct bones and contain human growth factor compounds to allow bones to come together.

The liquid form of fibroin has valuable applications such as reacting in the presence of hazardous substances in the environment or lab. Ink made from liquid fibroin has been used to make gloves that turn from blue to red when in contact with a contaminated surface.

Butterflies have also aided in the advancement of sustainable development. As ocean levels continue to rise due to climate change many cities may have to be built on water. Again using the model of the Morpho butterfly Guo discovered that the nanometric structure of the butterfly’s wing breaks down water into small droplets that easily flow off its surface.

Guo created a metal surface with this nanoscale pattern based on the morpho butterfly’s wing. When he added droplets to the metal surface the water repelled and bounced off of the surface.

“If we can deploy this in simple metal for the construction of the floating city then the city will never sink” Go said in an interview on PBS’ science series Nova.

Butterflies may also hold the secret to mitigating blood clots. UCI Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Adriana Briscoe discovered an enzyme called “cocoonase” found in silk moths which has dissolving properties and is compatible with the human body like the protein fibroin.

“Blood clots are very common in the United States. It turns out you can take cocoonase and in a test tube you can mix it up with a blood clot and it’ll break it down into its component parts” Briscoe said.

Today butterflies’ ecosystems are under attack due to the effects of climate change and habitat loss. If butterflies go extinct the entire food chain would be negatively impacted as many predators such as birds depend on butterflies for food.

In addition butterflies have inspired scientists to begin solving the pressing environmental issues of sea-level rise.

“There are many problems that humans haven’t solved that butterflies and moths already have” entomologist Jessica Ware said.

Butterflies have allowed scientists to make breakthroughs in medicine and sustainable development. Without these incredible insects inventions such as fibroin which can be used as implants in reconstructive surgery or an incredibly hydrophobic metal that can be modeled for a city on water would not be possible.

Founded in 1862 Union Pacific Railroad is one of the largest as well as the longest-tenured railroad operator in the entire North America. This freight-hauling railroad currently operates 8300 locomotives over 32200 miles of routes in nearly two dozen states of Western US.

Eager to reduce its carbon footprint the American railroad operator published its first Climate Action Plan in December last year. In the Climate Action Plan the company outlined its efforts to trim down carbon emissions throughout its operations by switching from conventional locomotives to electric locomotives. As part of its Climate action plan the railroad aims to reduce carbon footprint by 26 per cent by the end of current decade and achieve totally zero emissions by 2050.

The purchase of 10 FLXDrive electric locomotives from manufacturer and freight company Wabtec Corporation and another 10 from Progress Rail (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.) is part of those efforts. Releasing the news of the second purchase of electric locomotives Union Pacific also outlined its huge investment in battery freight technology to gradually achieve a zero-emissions future.

Once all the ordered electric locomotives are delivered Union Pacific will likely have the world’s largest carrier-owned battery-electric locomotive fleet. Lance Fritz Chairman and CEO of Union Pacific said the huge investment showed the company’s commitment to reduce its environmental footprint.

Speaking on the topic Fritz said “We’re committed to actions that reduce Union Pacific’s environmental footprint as we work toward our ultimate goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. These investments will contribute to further developing this important technology and providing industry-wide benefits.”

Progress Rail’s EMD Joule is a 118.1 ton electric locomotive switcher with an available battery capacity between 1.9-2.4 MWh. It boasts a nominal power of up to 3000 hp and a run time of up to 24 hours on a single charge. The Wabtec FLXDrive is quite similar in capacity. Both electric locomotives will be manufactured in the U.S.

Wabtec is expected to start delivering the FLXDrives electric locomotives to Union Pacific in late 2023 while Progress Rail will do the same sometime in 2024. All the twenty electric locomotives will be used in rail yards in California and Nebraska."

But KBC which was founded in 2016 is no longer just a handful of deal-makers working out of a WeWork near Amazon’s South Lake Union headquarters quietly tasked with growing the e-commerce giant's distribution network. The secretive firm has hired scores of high-level real estate professionals across the country signaling that its ambitions are to become something much greater than just Amazon’s broker of choice.

KBC Advisors has grown its ranks while it helped Amazon expand its logistics network.

Five years ago KBC had a headcount of roughly a dozen people based in one city but today it has more than 130 employees. It has hired more than 115 people since the start of 2019 alone according to a Bisnow analysis of employee LinkedIn pages. It opened offices in Atlanta Dallas and Nashville in 2020 sources told Bisnow before launching four new outfits last year alone: in New Jersey Chicago Phoenix and San Francisco.

Over the last three years it has hired at least 18 people from CBRE 13 people from Cushman & Wakefield and 11 people from JLL. Many of the hires were high-level brokers or executives at their previous firms including CBRE’s Philadelphia market leader an Avison Young principal a Cushman & Wakefield executive managing director and a JLL executive vice president.

The company’s growth has been fueled by the rapid expansion of Amazon’s logistics network. The tech giant leases more than 280M SF of industrial space across North America and industrial brokers and developers say KBC is typically involved any time Amazon builds or leases a warehouse.

“The first call you make when you have a new project is Amazon” said an industrial broker at a national firm who requested anonymity to talk about the e-commerce giant. “Except when you call Amazon you get KBC.”

But having the sector’s largest tenant as its client appears to no longer be enough for KBC. Recent hires and property listings indicate that the company is adding new clients and business lines which could become critical to sustaining KBC’s growth — its cash cow is getting set to slow down.

Amazon will start to “moderate” its physical warehouse investments Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call last week a move it says matches the slowing pace of growth of the underlying business.

“KBC is at the mercy of Amazon’s decisions. So if they’re not doing deals and if you own KBC wouldn’t you start looking at other stuff too?” said a source who has done business with KBC and spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I think KBC is also always going to have Amazon’s business but I think to be at the mercy of one client I think they want to get ahead of it if things slow down or change.”

Bisnow spoke to 11 industrial market sources for this story including brokers and developers across the country. Many of them chose to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of working with Amazon which often requires confidentiality agreements from its partners on real estate deals.

Bisnow also reached out to more than two dozen KBC employees who have joined the firm over the last three years but none agreed to participate in an interview. A KBC executive who runs the firm’s communications efforts declined to comment for this story.

The company doesn’t appear to have ever spoken publicly about its growth strategy but its website sheds some light on its philosophy.

“Many people remark how KBC is uncommonly different” the firm’s Careers page reads. “We’re proud of that. Long ago we traded bureaucracy for something much better. The chance to disrupt and revolutionize an industry.”

Industrial professionals have held largely positive views of KBC and its presence in the market given that the firm helped developers and their brokers land Amazon and the reliable revenue and increased value that comes with having the tech giant as a tenant. But that could change as KBC expands more into other business lines and begins competing more with other brokerage firms for talent and deals.

“They could become a force in the industry” a prominent industrial developer told Bisnow. “KBC is leaning toward becoming a full brokerage company who does all the services. Basically in competition to CBRE JLL and the others.”

Inside KBC’s Growth

KBC was founded in 2016 by John Hanson and Todd Meldahl but the duo had been working on Amazon’s industrial real estate strategy long before launching the firm.

The relationship between the brokers and the tech giant began in the late 1990s when Hanson was at CBRE and one of his colleagues at the firm Rick Diedrich left to join Amazon Insider reported last month. Diedrich then brought on Hanson to help scale up the company’s industrial footprint.

Hanson maintained Amazon as a client through the 2000s as he left CBRE to work for Trammell Crow and then Cushman & Wakefield according to a 2017 report by the Puget Sound Business Journal. Meldahl joined Hanson’s team at C&W in 2007 and the two then left to launch KBC in 2016. They were joined by several other C&W colleagues and as of September 2017 KBC had 13 employees operating out of a WeWork near Amazon’s headquarters the PSBJ reported at the time.

But the assignment of expanding Amazon’s industrial real estate footprint has for years been a rapidly growing job. The e-commerce giant added 100M SF of logistics space in 2020 alone to bring its portfolio to 285M SF across North America. It doubled its spending on its network last year it said in its earnings report last week outlaying $30B between leases and build-to-suit developments.

Amazon controls more than twice as much warehouse space as its closest competitor Walmart according to CoStar. Behind all of that growth is KBC development sources who spoke to Bisnow confirmed — it is involved in virtually all of Amazon’s logistics deals negotiating for leases developments and acquisitions on behalf of the behemoth.

“They do every single industrial deal with Amazon throughout the country and Canada” said a source who has done business with KBC. The source added that KBC even has dedicated brokers who lease parking lots for Amazon’s delivery vehicles. “There’s not a deal that would go by that they’re not involved.”

You would hardly know it if you were tracking Amazon’s deals in the press.

KBC’s name has been mentioned publicly on Amazon deals in only a handful of instances: It was connected to Amazon’s 1M SF lease at DFW Commerce Center in Dallas a 250K SF lease at Victoria Station in Sonoma California and a 125K SF lease in Loveland Colorado all in 2020 as well as Amazon’s 470K SF lease at Lakewood Logistics Center II in Colorado last year.

“They’re sort of like the Keyser Söze of real estate right now. When Amazon comes to a market no one dares say it’s an Amazon deal because they’ve got heavy nondisclosures” said MK Asset Management principal Hugh Williams a Chicago-based industrial broker. “Everyone knows it’s an Amazon deal. It’s a very interesting thing that when Amazon is doing a deal people know it’s Amazon but they’re not allowed to say the name. I think there’s a fear of Amazon in some ways.”

One of the many Amazon distribution centers that have popped up in major cities across the U.S.

In cities where KBC doesn’t have on-the-ground staff the secretive firm will partner with local brokers multiple sources said. Industry insiders say the finger-to-lips approach has to do with the level of intelligence KBC has from working with the biggest occupier in the industry which also happens to be a notoriously data-driven company.

“They likely don’t want to tout what they’re up to because they are operating ahead of the curve so they do fly below the radar” said Chesapeake Real Estate Group principal Matt Laraway a Maryland industrial developer who said he has worked with KBC on around five deals. “When they come to work with us they’re usually several steps ahead of their competition more well-informed and ready to go.”

KBC’s Hiring Spree

As Amazon’s logistics network has grown exponentially in the last three years so has its industrial broker of choice.

Five years after it had roughly a dozen staffers KBC’s website lists 126 employees on its “team” page. Insider reported its headcount has reached 160 people as of last month and a Bisnow review of LinkedIn pages found that more than 130 people list KBC as their employer on LinkedIn 117 of whom have joined the company since the start of 2019.

The hiring binge has happened stealthily over the last three years — KBC doesn’t issue press releases with announcements of major hires which is common practice at other brokerage firms.

These new employees have come to KBC with a variety of specialties including leasing acquisitions debt origination data research valuation accounting property conversions and geographic information systems mapping according to their LinkedIn profiles.

“They're out in the marketplace and they're trying to steal as many brokers as possible” said an industrial broker at a firm that has seen multiple departures to KBC. “They're poaching people left and right. And to be totally honest I don't understand what even their business model is going to be. And I don't know if they're quite clear yet.”

Many of these hires have come from the nation’s three largest commercial real estate services firms.

CBRE has lost 18 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including high-level professionals such as Adam Mullen the firm’s former Philadelphia market leader and Ryan Keiser a former Dallas-based executive vice president.

Cushman & Wakefield has lost 13 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including a four-person New Jersey-based leasing team — former Executive Managing Director Jason Goldman Executive Managing Director Marc Petrella Managing Director Michael Kimmell and Director Andrew Siemsen — plus former Southern California-based Senior Director Ryan Bos.

JLL has lost 11 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including former Nashville-based Executive Vice President Bo Fulk former managing director and Western U.S. head of industrial capital markets Bo Mills and former Los Angeles-based Managing Director Tony Muscio (who was in JLL’s hotels group).

CBRE Cushman & Wakefield and JLL all declined to comment on the departures.

KBC’s hires have been focused around its headquarters and the largest industrial markets in the country over the last three years according to employee LinkedIn pages. It has hired 50 people in Seattle 14 in Dallas nine in Atlanta seven in Los Angeles and six each in New Jersey and Nashville.

“They’ve picked up some of the best professionals in the country” Laraway said. “They have attracted best-in-class talent market-to-market.”

Bisnow spoke with two industrial brokers in different parts of the U.S. who have been approached over the past three years to work at KBC. The firm pitched to one of them the depth and richness of its data compared to global brokerage firms and data quality is a big factor for brokers in considering places of employment the broker said.

“These big firms the JLL the CBs are constantly touting their big data” the broker said. “I think [KBC is] well aware of how important that is to brokers.”

The office building converted from a former bottling plant where KBC maintains its Seattle office.

KBC’s ability to hire top-level talent away from the largest firms in commercial real estate signals to some industry insiders that it is offering generous compensation packages. The brokers who had discussions about working for KBC said the conversations were preliminary and compensation wasn’t discussed.

“I can tell you there’s no executive managing director from a big firm who’s going to go from one firm to another without significant financial upside they just don’t do it” Williams said. “So that alone tells me that there’s got to be a compensation model there that’s unique because it’s hard to get a group of people like that to leave.”

But even brokers working for firms that have been harvested by KBC and have seen their industry bend to Amazon’s will said they have had positive interactions with the brokerage firm.

“They’re great guys those KBC guys. They treated me overly fair” Cushman & Wakefield Senior Director Gordon Benedict told Bisnow. “I think you’ll be hard-pressed to find anybody that says anything bad about them.”

‘Are They Competitors Or Are They Friends?’

There are more than 120000 commercial real estate outfits in the U.S. with a combined annual revenue of $112B according to research firm Dun & Bradstreet. But there are few built like KBC.

“I don't know anyone [who] can look at the landscape and say ‘You know what the market needs? Another brokerage firm’” one Southeast-based broker said. “But they have Amazon in their back pocket.”

KBC is one of a few industrial-focused brokerage shops with national reach and its access to Amazon’s wealth of data could give it an edge in a crowded competitive market if it wants it.

“They have talent. Having that client as your customer is such a big hammer” one landlord told Bisnow. “Everybody wants to do business with them. A lot of the big landlords are going to give you listings because they’re going to want to be in your good graces.”

KBC’s run of notable hires has many speculating about the future of the Seattle firm and whether that future will remain tied to Amazon. Many of the brokers KBC has hired have books of business and years of relationships they brought with them.

“I think when you build your business I don’t want to say on the back of but in relationship with one client one of the things it does is it gives you confidence” said Wendy Berger the CEO of Chicago-based industrial developer WBS Equities.

Berger founded WBS in 2004 developing food storage facilities for Arbor Investments. Her business has diversified since then although Arbor still accounts for some 70% of WBS revenue. While Berger said she is unfamiliar with KBC it makes sense that the firm would look to add other customers outside of Amazon.

“Maybe [KBC is] saying they know they've had this amazing momentum now we need to build off of it” she said. “When you build your business on one client you're not focused on the external factors you're focused on your client.”

On its website KBC lists four main lines of business: capital markets agency leasing tenant representation and site selection. It has beefed up each of these divisions with its wave of hires.

The Prologis-owned warehouse in Hayward California that KBC has on its listings page.

The firm has a property listings page where it highlights industrial properties that KBC brokers are marketing for lease across the country. The page features 59 total listings across the U.S. including 28 in the Seattle market 10 around San Francisco 10 in New York and New Jersey and six near Nashville.

It is marketing buildings for national landlords many of whom have leased millions of square feet to Amazon including Prologis Black Creek Group Principal Nicola Wealth Management Duke Realty Velocis and CenterPoint Properties.

“They’re seeing every single site around the country and Amazon’s not taking every single site so why not approach that owner and try to lease it for them?” said a source who has done business with KBC.

“They are doing more deals with all these national industrial companies — Panattoni Seefried Ryan Hillwood — these guys are doing so many deals with them it’s like why not start an agency leasing and go rep Panattoni or Ryan? They’re doing so many deals with those guys those guys need to hire brokers as well. So it’s a perfect marriage.”

In at least a handful of publicly reported projects KBC was engaged in real estate deals that didn’t involve Amazon. The firm filed permits last year to begin construction on a $1.5M 350K SF warehouse in DeSoto Texas according to the Dallas Morning News. In December KBC's Goldman and Himmel — two former C&W brokers — helped sell a 13500 SF warehouse in New Jersey to an epoxy company.

KBC has infused itself with both capital markets and development acumen in the past couple of years. Multiple sources noted that KBC’s hire of Mills the former JLL leader as its president of capital markets suggests KBC is aggressively looking to list more just than Amazon-leased warehouses.

“Are they trying to become a national brokerage firm? We’ve seen them ask for listings. Been told they’re doing brokerage work for other people” one Mid-Atlantic industrial developer said. ""Are they trying to create an independent brokerage shop that handles not only Amazon but everything else? Or are they trying to milk this for everything they can?""

The skill sets KBC has acquired along with its access to a treasure trove of site selection and real estate data amassed by Amazon over the years means the firm “could become a force in the industry” someday soon one national developer told Bisnow.

The 37500sq m NRMA Agnes Water Holiday Park is expected to attract interest from domestic and international investors looking for land banking and capital growth opportunities in the coastal town.

CBRE Hotels’ agent Paul Fraser said it was an “exceptional” seaside offering of caravan sites cabins and campsites across 133 lots.

“To have such a significant lot size on absolute beachfront in Agnes Water is unheralded” Fraser said.

“To then have this incredible parcel of real estate tenanted by one of Australia’s largest and most successful park operators leads us to believe this asset will demand widespread appeal from a national and international market.”

Price expectations are between $25 million and $30 million.

Agnes Water is the closest access point to the Southern Great Barrier Reef and is regarded as the most northern surfing spot in Queensland.

It was voted the Top Small Tourism Town in Queensland last year and experienced tourism growth of more than 100 per cent year-on-year since the onset of the pandemic.

There is substantial development in the wings for the town with a 30.6ha development including retail and commercial properties planned as well as a $1-million upgrade to the road between Agnes Water and 1770.

CBRE Asia Pacific director Dillon Murphy said Agnes Water would continue to attract tourists as borders reopened.

“This coupled with the secure long-term lease to a nationally recognised tenant will provide a forward-thinking investor with a long-term income stream and high capital growth potential” Murphy said.

It is the latest in a string of caravan parks to go to market as institutional investors look to capitalise on the alternative asset class traditionally favoured by mum-and-dad investors.

There were more than 100 leisure parks listed for sale at the end of 2021 as owners looked to cash-in on the capital being deployed to the sector.

Tasman Holiday Parks plans to double its portfolio over the next three years after a $300-million private equity raise. The group has swooped on 21 holiday parks in Australia and New Zealand since 2019 in a $250-million land and asset grab.

HTL director Andrew Jackson told The Urban Developer that 2021 had been a strong year of off-market transactional activity with new capital trying to gain a foothold in this tightly held and rapidly evolving sector.

“This targeted strategy illustrates the metamorphosis of what has now well and truly evolved from a mum-and-dad cottage industry into being wholly corporatised and consequently widely recognised as offering institutional-grade investment attributes on par with any other asset class” Jackson said.

The NRMA Agnes Water Holiday Park will be sold via an expression of interest campaign due to close on March 10.",,,

In a statement Duterte expressed “grave concern” over the Senate’s adoption of the resolution as it casts “undue undeserved and unwarranted aspersion” on key DOE officials.

“The government values the critical role and contribution of the Malampaya Gas Field to energy security. I will not allow this valuable resource to be jeopardized and embroiled in the political antics of some members of the Senate” he said.

Baon na sa utang kikita pa! Gatchalian expects Dennis Uy to flip Malampaya to another investor after railroading takeover with Al Cusi’s assist

Duterte affirmed that Cusi still has his full trust and confidence and shall remain as the head of the energy department.

He maintained that the national interest has been protected and the government’s rights remain intact amid the developments involving the share sale and purchase agreement.

“I am calling on our legislators to ensure that our ability to compete is not jeopardized by political intrigues and innuendoes. Leave business transactions in the capable hands of the business sector. Let us respect their business decisions while we protect our national interests” Duterte said.

The resolution penned by Senator Sherwin Gatchalian recommends the filing of criminal and administrative charges before the Office of the Ombudsman and the Civil Service Commission against Cusi and other DOE officials for approving and recommending approval of the Chevron Philippines-UC Malampaya transaction.

Gatchalian said the officials violated laws for allegedly railroading the approval to the sale of the 45-percent participating interest in the Malampaya gas project of Chevron Malampaya LLC Philippines now known as UC 38 LLC to UC Malampaya an indirect subsidiary of Uy’s Udenna Corporation despite the lack of financial qualification.

Duterte however said that the sale and purchase of the stock of Chevron Malampaya LLC was a private transaction between private entities that must be respected.

He also reiterated that both foreign and local investments are “vital” to the economy.

“We compete for them with other countries and our ability to do so requires me to create and maintain an environment conducive to the entry of investors” he said.

Duterte said that while he recognizes the Senate’s power to conduct congressional probes in aid of legislation this should be exercised “with prudence and circumspection devoid of reckless accusations and focused on improving existing laws”. (PNA)",,,,,,,,,

On Dec. 14 2021 I had the privilege of being sworn in as the 10th female mayor for the city of Watsonville.

This year has brought many changes to Watsonville city government with women holding all the major offices: mayor interim city manager city clerk and city attorney.

Each one of us brings a unique perspective to this community and to our roles in the city. As a lifelong Watsonville resident with local Native American roots and a family with a history of community service I couldn’t be more proud of how far our city has come and where it’s going.

As the 2022 Watsonville mayor I am committed to listening and honoring our diverse perspectives and encouraging our public dialogue to become more productive and respectful of our differences. Despite the polarization that has become so prevalent in recent public discourse Watsonville stands as a beacon of what can be when we realize that we have more in common than not. South County certainly believes in a common goal — a prosperous Watsonville for all.

I am very excited about this upcoming year. Our city has some great opportunities ahead that will enhance the quality of life for all Pajaro Valley residents. I’m thrilled to share some exciting projects that are now underway:

• Construction crews continue to work on the much-awaited site located on 945 Main St. at Auto Center Drive. This commercial project which is expected to be completed midyear is bringing in big-name chain restaurants such as Chipotle Mexican Grill The Habit Burger Grill and a drive-thru Starbucks. More businesses are expected to join the list soon.

• Another important project on Main Street is the comprehensive renovation taking place at Ramsay Park. This historic more than $20 million project to redesign the largest park in the city is currently underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the vital role that local parks play in supporting individual and community health and well-being. Local residents have access to 2.25 acres of park land per 1000 residents as compared to the city’s general plan goal of 5 acres per 1000 residents and the national average of 10 acres per 1000 residents. The need for additional park space is underscored when comparing Watsonville’s 143 acres of park land to the city of Santa Cruz’s 1700 acres. This project represents a major step forward toward addressing the significant inequities that have existed between North Santa Cruz County and South Santa Cruz County.

• Pajaro Valley residents will also get to enjoy a new soccer field multi-use field all-inclusive playground nature exploration center dog park picnic areas and additional amenities such as accessible trails and more at Ramsay Park. The project was funded by a $7 million allocation from the State of California via Assembly Member Robert Rivas $7 million from the City’s American Rescue Plan Act funds and $7 million from the city’s general fund.

As a veteran teacher in the Pajaro Valley for the past 34 years and now representing Watsonville as mayor I am no stranger to standing up and being heard when it comes to advocacy. We in South Santa Cruz County look forward to working with the other leaders in the county to find solutions that address the unique needs of the people of the city of Watsonville.

In future columns I look forward to giving you updates from across our City and celebrating the communities businesses and people who make up Watsonville.

See you around town Watsonville.

Photo: Fitzrovia News.

Residents in Fitzrovia are invited to give their views on Camden’s West End Project now that the lengthy opera is apparently grinding towards its closing act.

The West End Project is a £35m four-year scheme to transform the area around Tottenham Court Road and includes changes to the public realm and the way traffic flows on streets including Gower Street Bloomsbury Street and part of Shaftesbury Avenue.

“The team is currently planning the final change to two way traffic for the northern section of Gower Street between Grafton Way and Euston Road” says Camden.

“More information on this will be shared once the programme is completed but the change is expected in spring this year.

“Work to Alfred Place [public open space] is progressing and due to be completed within the next month.

“Work continues around the St Giles Square area as the team creates a new public space. We are awaiting two new trees to add to the area and expect the work to be completed by Easter” says Camden.

The West End Project is Camden Council’s biggest ever infrastructure scheme and it has created much needed new public open space a restored Fitzrovia Mural safer space for cycling and (mostly) improved paving on Tottenham Court Road.

But it has also directed an increased amount of motor traffic down side streets — often queuing with engines running — creating what one resident has described as “the opposite of a low traffic neighbourhood”.

People have also complained that light controlled crossings don’t allow pedestrians enough time to get to the other side of the road. And there’s been a problem with buses colliding with pedestrians.

Few expected it to go smoothly — it is Camden after all.

Now the West End Project team want you to tell them what you really think about how public money has been spent. Try to be polite.

Have your say on Camden’s West End Project. Comment until 4 March 2022.",,,,,,

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

(WSMV) - Officers with the Metro Nashville Police Department arrested a man after he allegedly tried to carjack a woman who had just arrived at church on Sunday morning in Madison.

According to the arrest affidavit a woman and her 3-year-old son were parked outside the Abundant Life Living Word Church on Sunday morning around 10:15 a.m. when 30-year-old Javaunn Brown approached from the street. The woman said the man made small talk about the apartments across the street before demanding she give him her car keys the affidavit states.

The woman told officers she immediately started calling for help. Brown then jumped in the back seat and began pulling her son out of the car when church staff came outside and confronted him according to the affidavit. Brown began threatening to blow up the church and said he worked for the president before running away the affidavit states.

When officers arrived at the church on Cheyenne Blvd. they received a burglary call from the Nashville Korean Seventh-Day Adventist Church next door. They responded and found Brown getting into one of the Korean church’s vans the affidavit states. Brown took off running into the woodline with officers giving chase until he broke a window at an unoccupied house for sale on Gilead Court police said.

What You Need To Know Heart disease and stroke cause $147 billion in lost productivity on the job A study from the American College of Cardiology found over 45% of adults with cardiovascular disease suffer financial hardship related to their medical bills If you end up with chronic conditions after a heart attack the related costs could wipe out your retirement savings

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention heart disease and stroke cause $147 billion in lost productivity on the job. Certified senior adviser Chris Orestis president of Retirement Genius says there are other financial repercussions of a heart attack.

“Studies have shown that a heart attack can cost somebody as much as $1 million” he says.

“That’s hospital cost your doctors costs rehab medications and lost wages” he added. “That’s a big part of the financial impact for somebody to have a heart attack not only lost wages but depending on how it impacts them from a health perspective their strength going forward it can have a huge change in your ability to work and generating income for possibly years to come.”

A study from the American College of Cardiology found over 45% of adults with cardiovascular disease suffer financial hardship related to their medical bills. Orestis says it can also increase health insurance premiums and even more financial trouble down the road.

“You’re going to have to deal with out-of-pocket costs you’ll have deductible you’ll have co-pays” he said. “There could be areas of your treatment or medication going forward that might not even be covered so when it comes how that can impact you from an insurance standpoint that can become very troublesome.”

Another area affected financially by the costs of a heart attack is retirement savings. Orestis says the best financial investment is health care because preventing the need for long-term care will save you a lot of money.

“The cost of health care and even long-term care a heart attack could end up creating a situation where you have chronic conditions that can start to cost somebody thousands of dollars a month ongoing for months if not years; and that can just wipe out people’s retirement savings” Orestis added. “Once you let health care and long-term care costs get inside your bank account it’ll start to be the biggest thing you’re spending money on. It could drain somebody’s account very quickly.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dulu kita saling cinta

Kini kau pergi tinggalkan aku

Sungguh aku kehilangan kau yang terindah

Maafkan aku yang melukaimu

Apakah cinta masih mungkin

Kembali untukku darimu sayang?

Salahkah cinta bila hati hanya padamu?

Aku berharap cinta

Kini betapa rapuhnya aku

Jalani hidup tanpa dirimu

Sungguh aku kehilangan kau yang terindah

Maafkan aku yang melukaimu

Apakah cinta masih mungkin

Kembali untukku darimu sayang?

Salahkah cinta bila hati hanya padamu?

Aku berharap cinta

Masih adakah ruang di hatimu

Untuk letakkan cinta kembali?

Maafkan aku yang melukaimu

Apakah cinta masih mungkin

Kembali untukku darimu sayang?

Salahkah cinta bila hati hanya padamu?

Aku berharap cinta

Apakah cinta masih mungkin

Kembali untukku darimu sayang?

Salahkah cinta bila hati hanya padamu?

Aku berharap cinta

(Cinta masih mungkin

Kembali untukmu dariku sayang?)

Salahkah cinta bila hati hanya padamu?

Aku berharap cinta uh

CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3dpZmlub3dnbG9iYWwuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLWJsb2cvY2lzY28tcmVsZWFzZXMtZmVhdHVyZS1yaWNoLXdpLWZpLTZlLWFwcy10by1ib29zdC1jYW1wdXMtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC13aS1maS1zdXBwb3J0LWh5YnJpZC13b3JrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco releases feature-rich Wi-Fi 6E APs to boost campus industrial Wi-Fi & support 'hybrid work',"By Claus Hetting Wi-Fi NOW CEO & Chairman

Late last week Cisco released two new high-end Wi-Fi 6E APs ‘to redefine the campus experience and support hybrid work’ the company says. In addition to the standard Wi-Fi 6E features the new Catalyst 9136 AP includes environmental sensors and new features for band steering smart power consumption and even future flexible radio assignment (FRA). The new Meraki MR57 Wi-Fi 6E AP offers similar specs.

Last week Cisco released their bid for dominating the enterprise Wi-Fi 6E market: The company announced two new Wi-Fi 6E-capable enterprise-grade access points dubbed Cisco Catalyst 9136 and Meraki MR57 respectively. Cisco is positioning the two APs – as well as a new switch a Private 5G managed service and more (see below) – as a novel approach to the new ‘hybrid work’ paradigm.

According to Cisco ‘hybrid work’ means that employees will be required to communicate more with co-workers for example via immersive video conferencing. Cisco Product Marketing Manager Brett Shore in this blog says the new Wi-Fi 6E solution means that enterprises will now be able to deliver more wireless capacity for 4k and 8k video conferencing more bandwidth for wireless XR much-improved industrial IoT capabilities including the use of time-sensitive networking (TSN) more responsive Cloud-based applications and not least improved security.

Cisco’s buzzphrase for this Wi-Fi 6E release is wireless at wired speeds. And indeed the Catalyst AP delivers a peak data rate of 10.2 Gbps while the Meraki unit clocks in at a slightly lower 8.35 Gbps.

Nifty radio features for easing the 6 GHz introduction

Cisco has included some nifty radio features designed to increase client capacity on demand and ease the introduction of 6 GHz Wi-Fi into the enterprise. The Catalyst 9136 AP supports band steering to direct Wi-Fi 6E devices to the 6 GHz band while a future software release will support flexible radio assignment (FRA) so as to reconfigure one 5 GHz 8×8 to two 5 GHz 4×4 radios to support more clients.

Meanwhile the Meraki MR57 can toggle between true tri-band operation with four streams for each of 2.4 GHz 5 GHz and 6 GHz and a dual-band configuration with two 4×4 radios supporting 5 GHz – and no 6 GHz at all. The unit is of course operated via on Meraki’s trademark Cloud-management dashboard and is – says Cisco – ideal for offices schools retail outlets hotels and more.

As something entirely new the Catalyst AP incorporates environmental sensors for the monitoring of air quality – ‘total volatile organic compounds’ – as well as temperature and humidity. The Meraki AP connects to dedicated Meraki sensors and both APs can power the ‘Right Now app’ on Cisco’s ‘DNA Spaces’ platform to deliver metrics on how many people are currently in a location. The system will even send an alert when a location is over capacity.

Altogether an impressive feature-rich couple of initial Wi-Fi 6E releases from Cisco which will surely at least maintain Cisco’s dominant market share position within the enterprise Wi-Fi segment. For more useful information make sure you check out Cisco’s excellent blogs on Wi-Fi 6E here and the company’s equally excellent reference White Paper on Wi-Fi 6E here.

Kimberly's the second child of music legend Rod Stewart and his first wife Alana.

It seems that she is on good terms with Rod's second wife Rachel Hunter and indeed his current wife Penny Lancaster as they were both quick to post messages of congrats und her post.

Over the weekend Kimberly and Jesse were joined by her parents and her brother in LA celebrating the exciting news.

Kimberly is the mother of actor Benicio Del Torro's 10-year-old daughter Delilah after a brief romance.

Deputy Arts & Culture Editor

Wall Street: perhaps the most notorious locale of American lore. The financial capital of the world embodies the spirit of extravagant wealth influence and most notably success. However as attractive as Wall Street might be getting a slice of the pie and earning employment on the legendary street is often reserved for a select elite few namely ivy league graduates individuals with family ties and those born with silver spoons. That being said one particular organization at Florida State has been prosperous in breaching into the elusive Wall Street bubble: ‘The Noles on Wall Street.’

Simply put NoWS is a highly selective and intellectually rigorous program at FSU that seeks to place FSU’s brightest business and finance students into investment banking internships and other business-oriented programs at America’s top financial firms. Funded by Willow Partners a preeminent business society at FSU the program was founded in 2015 and has already found major success. Leading graduates of NoWS have landed internships at top Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan and Citigroup and the program has an exceptional internship placement rate overall.

“Just because we are [from] a state school that doesn’t mean we're not as good as someone from Harvard” said NoWS president Jared Ford. “The end goal is to have FSU on the radar of these banks and for them to come recruit at our school.”

As a past member of the program now serving as its top brass Ford is an individual who epitomizes NoWS’ success and the opportunities it can deliver. For this summer Ford placed into a prestigious 10-week investment banking internship program in New York City at UBS one of Wall Street’s most esteemed firms.

Impressed by NoWS’ superb results and pondering which characteristics and abilities made the program so successful I visited the NoWS as a guest for one of their weekly meetings.

The meeting which lasted roughly two hours consisted of roughly four segments — each aimed to tailor members into the best internship candidates possible. The first segment of the meeting consisted of networking and internship updates. Each member candidly opened up to the club about the dozens of calls they made emails they sent and interviews they conducted with personnel employed at investment banking firms.

In a bout of spectacular news sophomore student Katie Mendonsa received a resounding round of applause from the entire group. She had just scored an internship for Houlihan Lokey the No. 1 investment bank for global merger and acquisition transactions.

“The atmosphere in 'Noles on Wall Street is competitive but a great environment” said Mendonsa. “We all sincerely want to see each other succeed so everyone is willing to help you.”

Following the networking and internship updates came market updates. During this section the group showed off their expertise on current affairs and discussed anything that could possibly affect the stock market or economy. News brought up included oil futures Microsoft’s recent acquisition of the video game giant Activision and Russian troops on the border of Ukraine.

After this segment was my personal favorite portion of the meeting — the elevator pitch and resume workshop. Each member of the program delivered a short and snappy elevator pitch of their background qualifications and career goals to the fastidious observation of the entire group. Each pitch was crafted with close attention to detail and perceivably practiced by each participant many times over. Nonetheless Ford still was able to critique each speaker with comments related to content delivery and inflection.

“The most valuable thing I’ve learned through NoWS is how to tell my story” said junior and NoWS member Joel Weeks. “The only thing that differentiates you [from other candidates] is your personality appeal and how confidently you express yourself.”

Weeks who recently qualified for a prestigious diversity program at Perella Weinberg Partners is correct. Personality and self-expression are two of the key factors which go into NoWS’ highly-selective and prolonged application process in which 60-75 people apply and only 12 are selected.

The multi-stage process goes as such:

The first stage of the application opens up in the fall and requires applicants to submit a resume and answer a variety of questions related to why they want to join the organization. NoWS’ executive board processes the scores of applications and invites the candidates who meet the GPA requirements have properly formatted resumes and interesting professional experiences to a networking event. Applicants are then screened for their personalities and how well they behave in the networking environment. From this 25 candidates are chosen for interviews with Ford and the program’s co-director Anna Wimberley. After both behavioral and technical questions such as “What is your favorite book?” and “Walk me through a discounted cash flow model” the top-performing 12 candidates are chosen for NoWS.

If that sounds like a lot it is. Yet each critical skill necessary for the application process including acute social skills and an obstinate work ethic and fiery dedication are the bare minimum to succeed in the program. Ultimately we made it to the meeting's final portion behavioral and technical interview questions. Here each member once again illustrated their tact and in the spotlight solved enigmatic standardized interview questions such as “Are you a better leader or follower?”

Right before closure the meeting concluded with a pop-quiz a happenstance right in-line with NoWS’ demanding curriculum. Wimberley who will be interning with Citigroup’s investment banking division in the summer spoke about success. “Despite the stereotype that bankers receive I do not think that success should be defined by the job you have how much money you make or the opinions of your peers'' said Wimberley. “No matter the job or role that I take as long as I know that I am giving it my all then I believe I am being successful.”

Defining success as Wimberley does NoWS is undoubtedly successful. For the future Ford Wimberley and the rest of the organization’s executive board hopes to grow the reach of the program keep placing members in prodigious investment banking internships and continue to stick it to the state-school status quo.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Over his 16-year MLB career the best second baseman in Phillies history hit 14 home runs at Citi Field the most in any ballpark for Utley that’s not named Citizens Bank Park or Dodger Stadium. He trails only Giancarlo Stanton for the most home runs by a visiting player at Citi Field.

In June of 2009 Utley hit three home runs in two games that just cleared Citi Field’s corner porch in right field. A few weeks later during a game against the Yankees Mets announcer Gary Cohen uttered the words “Utley’s corner” when describing a wall-scraping home run to that same corner by Yankees center fielder Brett Gardner. Cohen went on to cite a study that said Citi Field at that time had given players only two home runs that wouldn’t have been out of the park at Shea Stadium. Utley hit both of those home runs.

“I guess Gary named it. It’s going to be Utley’s corner until someone else takes it over” Keith Hernandez said on the broadcast.

On the other hand Citi Field took away 36 would-be home runs that would have been out at the old stadium. As Justin Klugh pointed out a few years ago the Mets made some alterations to the ballpark’s dimensions in 2014 but decided against making any changes to Utley’s corner.

Over the years Utley’s corner had expanded from the first three sections to the right of the foul pole to the upper deck and all the way to the bullpens. But really Citi Field is the house that Utley built until proven otherwise.

Anyway here are all 11 of Utley’s home runs at Citi Field as a Phillie.

Michael Donell Moore Sr. 29 of Jacksonville entered guilty pleas in two robbery cases last August. Authorities say Moore held up the First Citizens Bank at 3129 Raleigh Road Parkway on May 8 2019 and robbed a CresCom Bank branch in Chocowinity on May 28 2019.

Don Connelly spokesman for U.S. Attorney Michael Easley’s office said Moore received the sentence after pleading guilty to bank robbery and brandishing a handgun during a robbery. U.S. District Judge Louise W. Flanagan sentenced Moore in a Friday hearing at the New Bern federal courthouse and ordered him to pay $58333 in restitution.

Citing court documents prosecutors say Moore walked into the Wilson bank wearing a hooded sweatshirt surgical mask and latex gloves handed the teller a note demanding cash and “threatened to kill everyone in the bank.”

Moore admitted to pointing a handgun at the teller before leaving the bank with $29607 Connelly said in a news release.

Prosecutors say Moore also admitted to robbing the CresCom bank in Chocowinity of $28726.

In that heist Moore “entered the bank wearing a hazmat suit sunglasses and a surgical mask” the release states. “Moore handed the teller a note that stated she had one minute to open the bank vault or a bomb would go off.”

Connelly said Moore used a silver revolver in that holdup.

The FBI helped Wilson police investigate the First Citizens Bank robbery and assisted Chocowinity police and Beaufort County sheriff’s deputies with the CresCom case. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Parris handled Moore’s prosecution.

Bailey police charged Moore with wearing a mask on public property in a botched robbery attempt at Southern Bank on July 2 2019. Police said an employee at the East Main Street bank spotted a masked man approaching the building and locked the doors before he could enter.

N.C. General Statute 14-12.8 prohibits wearing a mask or hood to conceal one’s identity or using a voice-disguising device on municipal county or state property. The 1953 law originally targeted Ku Klux Klan regalia. Legislators voted to suspend the statute in 2020 to head off conflicts over whether it could be applied to face coverings worn to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,
CLX,Clorox,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L2Nsb3JveC1rZWVwcy10ZXN0aW5nLWludmVzdG9ycy1wYXRpZW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clorox Keeps Testing Investors' Patience,"Inflationary pressures are stunting Clorox's profitability.

Share prices of Clorox (CLX 0.76%) fell over 14% in pre-market trading on Friday after the company reported lower-than-expected second-quarter fiscal year 2022 (FY22) results and slashed its full-year guidance.

This is yet another quarter when Clorox has disappointed investors making its banner year in FY20 disappear further in the rearview.

Here's what's driving Clorox stock lower and how to approach investing in the business given what we've just learned.

Some context

Clorox's business was firing on all cylinders in FY20 which ended June 30 2020. Clorox's FY20 included its highest revenue net income free cash flow (FCF) and gross profit margin in 10 years. Clorox followed up the performance by posting 9% year-over-year revenue growth in FY21. But its other metrics were on the decline and the cracks in its business would only widen from there.

Clorox market penetration comes at a cost

Clorox CEO Linda Rendle took over in September 2020 and put forth a campaign centered around growing Clorox's brands and taking market share from its competitors. To a certain extent her strategy has worked.

In its Q2 FY22 prepared remarks Clorox mentioned that 75% of its brands are ""a superior value"" as measured by the company's consumer value metric. Put another way customers rate Clorox's brands as the best in their category 75% of the time -- a record high. On the surface it looks like the consumer staple company should be proud of its growing market share. But dig deeper and you find that the growth came at a steep price.

Rendle's campaign came at the expense of much higher advertising spending. During the height of the pandemic Rendle repeatedly said that Clorox was going to bet on a permanent consumer shift toward improving hygiene and cleanliness by promoting its brands. The best example of Clorox's newfound advertising appetite is through its NBA promotion.

If you've tuned into the NBA recently you've probably noticed a new format at All-Star weekend called 2022 Clorox Rising Stars. The three-game tournament consisting of 12 rookies 12 sophomores and four members from the NBA G League looks entertaining and is a great way to promote less experienced players. But Clorox probably shouldn't be sponsoring it at least not during a time of high inflation.

The elephant in the room

Inflation is the single biggest threat to Clorox's business right now. And it's the crux of what's resulted in quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings. Inflation increases Clorox's costs. Some businesses can pass along those costs to customers by raising prices or reducing the impact on margins by cutting operating expenses and capital expenditures. Clorox has failed to offset the impact of inflation. Pair inflation-induced costs with much higher sales general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and you have a one-two punch that is crippling Clorox's gross profit margin.

As mentioned Clorox's gross margin was at a 10-year high of 45.6% in its FY20. It declined slightly in FY21 but was still a strong 43.6%. Clorox now forecasts that its gross margin for FY22 will be 750 basis points lower or just 36.1% which would be Clorox's lowest gross margin in over 10 years. Clorox expects Q3 FY22 gross margin to be in the mid-30s and Q4 to be in the high 30s. It had previously guided for Q4 gross margin to be in the low 40 percent range.

During its Q2 FY22 conference call Clorox said that it has historically taken between 12 and 18 months for it to implement cost-savings measures and raise prices to offset inflation. Due to the severity of inflationary pressures it expects it could take even longer for its gross margin to return to FY20 levels. Put another way Clorox is saying that its business won't return to its FY20 form until sometime between FY24 and FY25. That's a long time for investors to wait.

To make matters worse Clorox has done a poor job of overpromising and underdelivering. An analyst on the call addressed this concern head-on by simply asking if the company was ready to set realistic expectations. The response wasn't a vote of confidence as Clorox simply stated it's too hard to forecast the extent to which inflation will persist and continue to impact its margins.

Ripping off the proverbial bandage

About the only silver lining from Clorox's earnings is that the company didn't shy away from addressing the severity of short- and medium-term challenges. It is concerning that Clorox seems to be handling these challenges far worse than peers such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). P&G has found a way to grow its business and retain high margins despite facing similar sector problems as Clorox. I blame Clorox's excessive spending as a key driver behind its weak gross margin as well as management's aggressive strategy during what should be a time to dig in and play defense.

Existing shareholders have little choice but to give the company time to rebuild its business or sell the stock.

DURHAM N.C. (WTVD) -- Weekends are prime time for organized exercise at the Body Games Center in Durham. The men in charge helped their clients work up a safe sweat.

Owners DJ Coe and his father Dr. Derrick Coe say they're making a real difference in the community.

""And we can change the mom or the dad you can change the entire family on the healthy aspect."" said DJ Coe. ""So it's bigger than us. It's about how many lives can we impact? How many lives can we change?""

The Coes have business roots in the Bull City. Their ancestor Aaron McDuffie Moore was part of Durham's Black Wall Street a century ago and inspired them to serve the people who live in Durham today.

Both men bring life experience to their workout center.

""Ex-military I'm military trained"" said Derrick Coe. ""I have a master's in physical therapy from the University of Findlay in Ohio and I have a doctorate in physical therapy from Des Moines University in Iowa.""

""I went to East Carolina University majored in exercise physiology and was able to get several certifications as well. Decided to just use that to help our people help our community"" said DJ Coe.

Theirs is one of several Black owned fitness locations across the nation but their concept and father-son partnership could be unique.

""Especially that combination concept that we have which is wellness fitness and rehabilitation. So we focus on prevention of injuries improving the body once those injuries heal to get them back in the game"" said Dr. Coe.

""We have rest time in between stations and sets. And we require people to spray a Clorox based cleaner that kills any germs in here. The masks and the cleaning protocol before during and after workouts"" DJ Coe said.

The Coes say people at all levels of fitness are welcome and they can help people who are out of shape ease into a safe exercise routine.

""You hear the term 'generational wealth' we think 'generational health.' So we get families in here get them started get them educated"" said Dr. Coe. ""What exercise and wellness does for the body. Maybe a lot of those folks can get off the medications they're taking that make them go to the doctor as much.""

So she's taking a break after Saturday's final round of the LPGA Drive On Championship in Fort Myers.

The World No. 2 struggled and almost missed Friday's cut before birdieing her final three holes to tie for 45th.

Korda played 17 LPGA events including the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples in mid-November. She followed that up by playing with her former tennis star dad Petr in the PNC Championship on Dec. 18-19 in Orlando and fangirling Tiger Woods for a photo.

Plans for a break

Korda 23 played the last two weeks to open the 2022 LPGA season. But she won't be going to the tour's events in Singapore and Thailand early next month.

""Personally I'm definitely looking forward to my six-week break"" Korda said Friday. ""I definitely need it. I think I am just a little mentally kind of fatigued but everyone's going to through that.

""You're constantly trying to get better and push your limits and challenge yourself. I think I've done a pretty good job doing that but sometimes you need step back and relax and take a break from everything so I'm really looking forward to that.""

Lexi Thompson also will not be playing. She also had a long stretch. In addition to playing in the CME Group Tour Championship she played with Bubba Watson in the PGA Tour's QBE Shootout at Tiburón Golf Club in Naples in mid-December and then played in two of the three Florida swing events to start 2022 including in Fort Myers.

But many players are not taking a break and see the opportunity to go to the two events — the HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore and the Honda LPGA Thailand — that have 63-player and 58-player fields and no cut so prize money is guaranteed. The purses are $1.7 and $1.6 million respectively.

While No. 1 Jin Young Ko who skipped the first three events this year and Lydia Ko who didn't play in Fort Myers are in the two fields so are Americans such as Stacy Lewis who hasn't been over to Asia in a few years.

Before her post-round interview Friday Lewis was trying to make sure all of the various information tied into COVID-19 protocols was ready.

""It's been a mess"" she said. ""It's just what one country requires our country doesn't necessarily have. It's just amazing how different countries work with health care.

""I thought Singapore maybe thought it was going to be easier to get these things QR codes and forms and all of this stuff. It's a bit of a hassle but working our way through it.""

Rationale varies

Brooke Henderson a top-10 player from Canada who has a residence at Miromar Lakes is playing in both.

""I haven't been in a couple years so I'm definitely looking forward to going over there"" she said. ""Two of my favorite events and I've definitely missed them so excited to go over there and have no cuts and just try to be aggressive.""

Naples' Sophia Popov the 2020 Women's British Open champion is not going. After getting full status in 2021 and wearing out toward the end of it Popov is trying to navigate playing as much as she can but balancing getting enough rest.

""I didn't take the necessary breaks I needed last year and especially coming back from Asian events last year I was pretty tired and drained"" she said. ""As much as I love those events and I love the golf courses playing last year I think that for me just from a mental and physical standpoint I think it's the way to go just to be fresh for the majors.""

Austin Ernst and Ally Ewing who both got married in the past couple of years are both not going partly due to the virus.

""Just with all the testing and kind of how COVID is right now kind of wanted to not travel"" said Ernst who won the Drive On event in Ocala last year. ""It gave me a nice break to have.

""This is my 10th year on tour so I like being at home a little bit more than I used to so that was definitely part of it.""

Ewing has an added reason for not going. She is a Type 1 diabetic so she has a greater chance to have a more serious case of COVID-19 if she contracts it.

""The way I've played the last couple years has given me some stability in how I approach my schedule"" she said. ""For me it's viewing travel in a different way than when I was a rookie out here. The strenuous travel for me gets mentally and physically taxing. I will have to say it's maybe a part of it. I'm a Type I diabetic so when I travel things get difficult. Diet gets difficult protocols.

""I'm not sure what our bubble situation is going to look like but it kind of just ties you down to what you can do. So for me I thought for looking beyond the rest of the year it was going to be better for me long-term to stay and not play those events.""

For Swede Madelene Sagstrom she sees going to the two events as likely less restrictive than last year when the pandemic was more at its height.

""That was literally kind of being locked in the hotel room and getting food at the door"" she said. ""I feel like we're hopefully in the end of things. it's been easing up a lot for us in the last few months for traveling.

""It's been tough but it's part of the job. You've just got to deal with it and move on. Everybody's facing challenges and for us travel is one but it comes with the job.""

Henderson feels a little more at ease going over this year after not doing so in 2021.

""I feel like (the restrictions were) necessary last year with the way things were but it's nice that it feels like it's trending in the right direction and they don't have to be quite as strict over there"" she said. ""We made the choice not to go last year because we were uncomfortable my sister (who is her caddie) and I but this year I feel like the world is hopefully in a better place and our comfort level has definitely improved a little bit.""

Korda isn't against going to Asia due to the pandemic. It's more to do with the West Coast portion of the schedule starting a week after the event in Thailand.

""I love going to over to Asia"" she said. ""Typically I actually do well over there. Just looking at my schedule it just didn't make sense (to go). It made sense to take those six weeks off. I'm trying to get ready for the summer. That's what we're going to do.

""It would've been three weeks off two weeks over in Asia and then one week off and then a pretty intense West Coast swing. I'm going to try as hard as I can to just take some time off.""

Lewis 36 has been through these overseas travels since her rookie year so a lot of what it entails isn't new. But then there is what's tied into the protocols.

""We've always gone kind of through the tournament to book your flight and done that which is always a hassle in itself"" she said. ""It's just adding the medical stuff on top of it this year.

""I'm not stressed about it because I've been through this process. Sometimes you don't get your flight until the last minute and it's OK. But the younger girls are probably a little bit more stressed than I would. It's just part of the deal and you learn to work it out.""

She wasn't going to let a pulled back muscle keep her from giving a shot at ending that drought Saturday.

The 26-year-old nearly did getting within two strokes of eventual winner Leona Maguire.

But Thompson grimaced and grabbed a bit at her back on a wayward tee shot on No. 16. That led to a bogey and although she recovered to birdie the final hole to finish solo second.

""I kind of pulled a back muscle my first round out here and I was just happy to get through the next two days"" Thompson said. ""I didn't play any differently. It was just sore. But I would have to have a broken back to not play so I fought through it. Took some painkillers and just managed to get around the golf. Obviously played well so it was just happy to be out there.""

""I don't think she was quite 100% out there and she was gutting through it"" said playing partner Stacy Lewis who tied for fourth. ""Just really proud of her. She didn't feel very good out there today and still put up a pretty good number.""

Thompson holed out for eagle from the fairway on No. 10 then followed with birdies on Nos. 11 and 13.

""Holing out on 10 and making the birdie on 11 I knew I had to be somewhat close so I just tried to stay in the moment focus on just doing my pre-shot routine and committing to those golf shots out there"" Thompson said. ""I knew I had to make birdies.""

Thompson's eagle from the fairway may have been her first hole-out that wasn't an ace on a par 3.

""I haven't holed out I don't think because besides a hole-in-one but I hit my 2-iron off the tee just kind of a placement it's a shorter hole"" she said. "" I had 101 pin dead into the wind. I was in between clubs and I was talking about it with my caddie Will. 'Do you think my 115 club gets there? It's going to be higher.' So I'm like I just want to keep the next one lower in the wind so just chipped it. I saw it bounce and then I knew it went past I guess it spun back.

""I just went off the crowd to the left because it was tucked right. The crowd went nuts so I was like 'All right.' Definitely great memory.""

Golf will be a bit of a memory for the next six weeks. Thompson will return in March when the tour comes to California.

""With playing (QBE) Shootout in December I didn't get much of an offseason"" she said. ""Only had two three weeks so I'm looking forward to definitely putting the clubs away for probably a week or two especially dealing with a little bit of a back issue.

""But I'll be working hard as soon as I get back into it because I have things that I want to improve on and definitely get stronger.""

Schmelzel finishes career best

American Sarah Schmelzel 27 fired an 8-under 64 to tie the second best score of the day for her best-ever finish.

Her previous highest had also been at one of the tour's Drive On Championships which came into existence to help overseas gaps in the schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic. She tied for sixth at Inverness in 2020 and at the Lotte Championship in Hawaii last year.

""Obviously it's really nice to play well in the final round and move up the leaderboard something I've been working on a lot last few years on tour so it was nice to see that come together"" she said. ""Been playing well all week. Been hitting really good shots and had a lot of good looks so I think the key was to stay really patient and finally some putts started to go in on the back nine. Glad I kept it rolling.""

Schmelzel birdied Nos. 12-14 and Nos. 16-18.

""Making the turn I was just trying to make as many birdies as possible because I know the rest of the girls are out there trying to do the same thing"" she said. ""I wasn't sure that I was going to get six out of last seven or whatever it was so I'm happy with that.""

Tournament has second ace

Stephanie Meadow had a hole-in-one in the first round and Perrine Delacour had one in the final round doing so on No. 7.

""So I hit it really good"" Delacour said. ""It was 146 meters to the pin and I hit a really good 7-iron. I started a really good line and then I pitch it on the green and then just roll in the hole and start screaming jumping around with my caddie.""

Delacour shot a bogey-free 67 and tied for 20th.

As with Meadow's ace $20000 will be donated by CME Group to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Lin Ashok fire 63s

Aditi Ashok and Xiyu Lin both took advantage of a little lighter winds early in the day both shooting 9-under 63s. The wind did kick up as the final round wore on.

""It was super fun"" said Lin who finished in a tie for fourth. ""When I make the cut and I saw today is going to be a little less windy I really thought this course have lots of opportunities so I really went for it today and I putted really well. Hit like lots of good shots have some save. Yeah it was really nice.""

Lin had birdied Nos. 10 and 12 on the back before coming to the par-4 13th. The tee had been moved up to 254 yards so it was driveable for a lot of players. She pulled out a 3-wood but didn't make the green.

""It just didn't get a really good bounce so I was on the lip of the bunker"" she said. ""I was standing in the bunker and then it's not a very easy chip even it's only 25 yards away. Then I left it a little short about 20-footer and I made that putt. So that was a big move because for short hole you always want to have birdie.""

Ashok felt like she couldn't miss a putt and she nearly didn't.

""Almost every chance I got I made the putt which was great"" she said. ""I wasn't hitting it as good as I wanted to. I feel like I was not in control most of the time so I was holing like 10- 20-footers. Still the putting worked so it was a good day.""

LPGA*USGA Girls get inside and along the ropes

There were fans who were Crown Colony members or guests but there also was a noticeable group from LPGA*USGA Girls Golf. There were 40 from sites across Florida including Central Florida Miami and Fort Myers as well as Fore Life Inc. junior golfers from Miami.

The girls had posters and flags for players to sign following the final round. On Friday a few also were junior reporters and walked inside the ropes with Girls Golf alums and LPGA Tour rookies Sophia Schubert and Amanda Doherty.

Saturday a few girls were inside the ropes with Lexi Thompson Stacy Lewis and Linnea Johansson.

""We had tons of kids out watching today from the Girls Golf around Florida so just a good day"" Lewis said.

There's a lot of money on the line from the beginning of the season in January to the end of the season with the culmination of the Race to the CME Globe at the CME Group Tour Championship in November.

However not every tournament has the same purse. In fact purses in LPGA Tour events range from $1.2 million to $10 million in 2022. The smallest purse belongs to the season-opening Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions with a purse of $1.2 million. The largest purse belongs to the U.S. Women's Open which saw its purse increased to $10 million in 2022.

There are purses of every size in between. All five majors have a purse of at least $4.5 million and 13 other non-major tournaments have a purse of at least $2 million.

Coca-Cola's participation has been questioned by critics as China continues its ethnic cleansing of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region.

""The Coca-Cola Company is focused on helping communities address their sustainability challenges but we can’t do it alone"" the company says on its website. ""That is why we’ve formed key nonprofit partnerships with incredible organizations to progress sustainability initiatives such as women’s empowerment water replenishment sustainable packaging and climate action.""

COCA-COLA ACCUSED OF HYPOCRISY OVER OLYMPICS SPONSORSHIP

The U.S. under former President Trump's administration designated China's treatment of the Uyghurs as an ""act of genocide"" last year. The following month a legal opinion from a British court declared there was a ""very credible case"" that China was indeed carrying out a genocide. The Biden administration has maintained this designation since taking office.

FOX Business reached out to Coca-Cola's press office multiple times but received no response.

While remaining silent on human rights abuses in China Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey openly criticized Georgia's election security law.

""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied and we will continue to advocate for it both in private and now even more clearly in public"" the executive previously said. In addition Quincey released a strongly worded statement on behalf of the company expressing ""disappointment"" at the failure of the bill.

""We want to be crystal clear and state unambiguously that we are disappointed in the outcome of the Georgia voting legislation"" Quincey wrote. ""Throughout Georgia’s legislative session we provided feedback to members of both legislative chambers and political parties opposing measures in the bills that would diminish or deter access to voting. ""

Critics have spoken out.

""Look no further than the list of primary sponsors for the 2022 Winter Olympics which will be held in Beijing. About half are U.S. companies"" former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in an op-ed in July. ""Many of them like Coca-Cola  have spent the past year talking about ‘racial equity’ and criticizing common-sense voting rights bills like the one in Georgia. Yet these companies have no problem ponying up $100 million or more for an event that will glorify one of the most tyrannical countries on earth.""

'WOKE' CORPORATIONS HIT FOR 'BOWING TO CHINA WHILE SNUBBING AMERICA' AS THEY IGNORE CHINESE UYGHUR GENOCIDE

Coca-Cola while frequently dodging mention of China still displays its Olympic partnership with pride.

""Starting with the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam Coca-Cola has partnered on every event since helping to bring the Olympic spirit to athletes officials and fans around the world"" the company boasts on its partners page.

""Coca-Cola has been a founding partner of Special Olympics since 1968. Through its consistent and global support of Special Olympics Coca-Cola has fostered acceptance and inclusion for millions of athletes and helped create a positive legacy.​""

In 1936 Coca-Cola sponsored the Olympics held in Nazi Germany. The company held a tight grip on catering soft drinks at the event.

The White House previously told Fox News Digital that President Biden has ""been clear about his views"" on ""China carrying out genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang""

""The Biden Administration has already taken concrete measures including imposing visa restrictions Global Magnitsky Act and other financial sanctions export controls import restrictions the release of a business advisory warning companies of the serious legal reputational and customer risks they face by doing business in Xinjiang and President Biden rallied the G7 to commit to ensure all global supply chains are free from the use of forced labor— including from Xinjiang"" a White House official said.

Recently Chamath Palihapitiya part owner of the Golden State Warriors of the NBA received backlash after claiming that ""nobody cares about"" the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims in China .

""Let’s be honest: Nobody cares about what’s happening to the Uyghurs OK?"" Palihapitiya said on a podcast. ""You bring it up because you care and I think that it’s nice that you care. The rest of us don’t care"" Palihapitiya said about the ongoing genocide that has included the use of forced sterilization beatings and torture.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYnkuY29tL3NpbXBseS1zcGlrZWQtbGVtb25hZGUtc3RvcmVzLXN1bW1lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simply Lemonade Will Make A Spiked Version This Summer,"The products and services mentioned below were selected independent of sales and advertising. However Simplemost may receive a small commission from the purchase of any products or services through an affiliate link to the retailer's website.

A year after teaming up to launch Topo Chico Hard Seltzer Coca-Cola and Molson Coors are joining forces again this time combining Coca-Cola’s Simply Juice brand with alcohol to create an exciting new drink: Simply Spiked Lemonade.



Hitting stores this summer the new Simply Spiked Lemonade variety pack is inspired by some of Simply’s best-selling refrigerated drinks including Strawberry Lemonade Watermelon Lemonade Blueberry Lemonade and Signature Lemonade.



The lemonade will be sold in slim-can 12-packs as a variety pack and 24-ounce standalone cans of select flavors in stores nationwide. The drinks are made with real fruit juice and have 5% alcohol by volume.





Molson Coors

While this is the first time Simply Lemonade has been turned into an adults-only beverage there are many boozy lemonades on the market.

You’ve likely already heard of Mike’s Hard Lemonade which has actually been around since 1999. The brand continues to add new flavors to their lineup including Pineapple Mandarin in 2020. Other brands include Crook & Marker whose spiked lemonade is organic and has zero sugar and no artificial sweeteners and Truly which makes a hard seltzer lemonade.

Smirnoff Ice also has a pink lemonade flavor with 4.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). Country musician Blake Shelton has his own line of hard seltzer lemonade and Dogfish Head makes a canned strawberry and honeyberry vodka lemonade which has 7% ABV per serving. Dogfish Head says honeyberries by the way taste like a cross between raspberries and blueberries so the canned cocktail sounds like it’s bursting with flavor.

Dogfish Head

For a boozy take on another summer drink both White Claw and Truly have hard seltzer iced teas in a variety of flavors like lemon peach mango strawberry and raspberry.

There are dozens of other canned cocktails to choose from as well. Other flavors from Dogfish Head include Blueberry Shrub Vodka Soda and Lemon & Lime Gin Crush. Spiked flavors from Crook & Marker including Classic Lime Margarita Piña Colada and Classic Iced Tea.

You can also try the canned Piña Colada from Malibu rum cocktails from Bacardi vodka drinks from Absolut and products from the brand Cutwater Spirits. They have everything from Tequila Soda and TTiki Rum Punch to White Russians and more.

Don’t go there” she said. “Everything is super expensive.” They might be expensive yes but they’re also inviting to the weary traveler: a cold can of Coca-Cola a refreshing bottle of water or a tiny bottle of booze paired with a can of Pringles and bag of M&Ms. That’s practically a meal.

But over the past decade many hotel companies have steered clear of the once-vaunted amenity. “Hotels call time on the minibar” The Independent wrote in 2013 referencing the hassle and cost of upkeep. “The Death of the Minibar Is Nigh” an Esquire headline proclaimed that same year. The Atlantic ran a story that year simply titled “Elegy for the Minibar.”

The Atlantic piece reported that a German company invented the minibar in the early 1960s. The first one to become famous was at the Madison Hotel in D.C. Hilton claims to have “popularized” the in-room concept in 1974 in Hong Kong.

The heyday that followed for minibars is largely over. Large hotel chains have been scaling down their use for several years. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that Hyatt Hotels & Resorts was removing stocked minibars from some convention hotels and Hilton and Omni were making similar moves.

Popular new brands emphasize a communal atmosphere with wine hour in the lobby or a market near the front desk. Delivery services also make it easier to order a meal to the door — even if room service isn’t available.

“Are minibars still necessary if you can order things to be delivered to you whether it’s at 8 a.m. 2 p.m. or 2 a.m.?” said Henry Harteveldt travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group.

But some hotels have held on — and even tried to reinvent the amenity.

I am 32 years old and still deeply terrified that consuming anything from the hotel room minibar will bankrupt my entire family somehow — Mountain Lion In My Backyard 🦁🌇 (MLIMBY) (@ArmandDoma) August 21 2021

Buckley who once avoided minibars at all costs is now invested in their success as vice president of food and beverage for Atelier Ace the company behind the small boutique chain Ace Hotel. The company seeks out local partners to build its minibar program with a focus on diversity and inclusion — while also stocking choices that will appeal to the masses.

“That’s our goal right now to really work with that diversity and really work with interesting vendors that are putting out amazing products and small businesses that don’t have the opportunity to penetrate these bigger markets” she said.

At one of the company’s newest properties the Ace Hotel Brooklyn that means the kombucha gummy bears and whiskey are from borough-based companies whose owners are women people of color or members of other underrepresented groups.

“It gives people the opportunity to shop local but also learn about the community that they’re traveling in” Buckley said.

The top seller is water she said — Ace partners with boxed water brand Just Water co-founded by actor Jaden Smith — and gummy bears granola and power bars are also popular. While Buckley said the company will include a small amount of well-known items such as M&Ms about 80 percent of the minibar stock is locally sourced.

Quirky boutique hotels may have their own approach. But many luxury properties and casino resorts have also held on to the minibar. That’s where Bruno Agrario vice president of sales and marketing for Bartech Systems International gets the bulk of his business.

The family-owned company supplies automated minibars and trays to 1300 hotels around the world with this selling point: Technology keeps track of everything so the daily labor demand is significantly lower than a traditional minibar that requires someone to check each room regularly.

“Our minibar system is fighting all the negative aspects of traditional minibars” Agrario said. “In other words we fully understand why minibars are usually hated (by guests and hoteliers).”

Agrario said water is the top seller; cashews beer white wine Kettle Brand chips Pringles and chocolate almonds also do well. Diet Coke is the top-selling soda. He touts a “familiar is best” approach and he encourages customers to avoid specialized local products because he argues the heart wants what it already knows and craves — not something new.

“You don’t know those local items” he said. “A minibar is all about impulse purchase; you see the item you consume. If you don’t know the item you are not likely to use as much.”

MGM Resorts which has minibars in its luxury Las Vegas properties said in a statement that hotels “always keep the favorites in stock” — including vodka tequila beer chips nuts and candy bars.

“We evaluate and review all feedback provided on a regular basis and then use that information to make decisions based on trends and common themes” the company said. “Additionally we will test new products on a floor or two within one of our properties to get real-time feedback so we can use that data to make sound choices on products we will carry in the future.”

Minibars had a pop culture moment late last year an in episode of the HBO comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Larry David the creator of the show who plays a version of himself wants to curate the offerings for his friend’s hotel but his suggestions — wasabi peas Parmesan crisps figs and the “coup de grace” York Peppermint Patties — fail to impress.

“If you don’t have the vision to know how amazing a wasabi pea would be in a minibar I don’t really want anything to do with you” David grumbles before storming out of the meeting.

(Buckley with Ace Hotel said the fictional David would probably get hired as a minibar curator: “We like that avant-garde approach” she said.)

The pandemic dealt the latest blow to the old amenity and inspired a new round of “so long minibar” predictions. In May 2020 NPR quoted one consultant as saying: “I think the death of the minibar is probably finally here.

Harteveldt said there were practical reasons for hotels to ditch the stocked fridges or trays of non-perishables as the coronavirus spread: Properties needed to limit the presence of workers in guest rooms and get rid of unnecessary contact points.

Buckley and Agrario said they noticed a different trend as the pandemic progressed: After initial restrictions on minibars lifted they saw demand increase.

“Sales are up because a lot of times people don’t feel comfortable going out” Buckley said. “People like to be in their safe space.”

So what’s next for the minibar? Experts say there is plenty of downside — including an ongoing labor shortage and the persistence of covid-19 — but opportunity remains.

Mehmet Erdem an associate professor of hotel operations and technology at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas said innovative and creative approaches could appeal to a new generation of travelers. If hotels could figure out a pricing model that would make the minibar more attractive he said they might keep more people spending money on-site rather than looking elsewhere.

“It can be a win-win for everybody: nice affordable convenience for the guest and it can be one more amenity offered for the hotel room that adds to the competitive edge of a particular brand” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ2lnYXppbmUubmV0L2dzY19uZXdzL2VuLzIwMjIwMjA2LWNvY2EtY29sYS13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1zb2RhLWNhbi1jb2xsZWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The world record '11308 Coca-Cola can collection' is overwhelming,"Feb 06 2022 18:00:00

The world record '11308 Coca-Cola can collection' is overwhelming







Guinness World Records  which continues to be certified as 'the best in the world' has released a movie and an article celebrating the new world record holder who collected 11308 kinds of 'Coca-Cola cans' from 108 countries.This is Canada's Gary Feng who has become the new world record holder for 'a collection of soft drink cans collected for a single brand.'





Feng is collecting cans of Coca-Cola and the number is 11308. Feng's collection room spans multiple rooms with Coca-Cola cans lined up in aisle-like spaces.







Of course it is impossible to see all 11308 kinds of cans so this movie will only look at the selected collection picked up by Mr. Feng. The first can is in a box called 'STRANGER COKE'.







Translated literally it means 'strange cola' but this is a collaboration can aimed at promoting the popular SF horror drama series '

Stranger Things Unknown World ' distributed on Netflix. It is an extremely rare item that is not sold to the general public and is offered only to some influencers.





The second is a can with a design reminiscent of a hamburger.







This was manufactured by McDonald's in Brazil to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the release of Big Mac and it seems that it was not sold to the general public either.







A can when linked with an LGBT + related campaign marked 'SEXUAL DIVERSITY'.







A commemorative bottle when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump (at that time) had their first meeting. Former President Trump is also widely known as a diet cork lover and

was even told to drink 12 cans of diet cork a day.





'Beautiful and part of history' says Feng a commemorative bottle for the

Challenger released on July 29 1985 specially designed to be drunk in the low gravity environment inside the Challenger. One item. The Challenger succeeded in nine missions but in the mission on January 28 1986 it exploded in the air 73 seconds after its launch. All seven crew members died.





An item that looks exactly like this Challenger commemorative bottle was drunk on August 26 1991 at the Soviet Union's space station '

Mir '. According to Feng's commentary this Soviet federal version is a 'can collector's coveted item.'





The can with this season is the 'first Coca-Cola can' released in 1955. Prior to this Coca-Cola was only a bottle. The logo is the same as it is now but the can itself is made of tin. It is said that the aluminum Coca-Cola can was released in 1967.







A commemorative bottle of '

Ghostbusters ' and ''. The first Ghostbusters commemorative bottle was sold only in the UK but the Ghostbusters 2 commemorative bottle was sold in multiple countries.





In addition it seems that Coca-Cola had a period of manufacturing 'bottles with personal photos printed' bottles printed with Coca-Cola employees bottles printed with attendees of a certain private party weddings. There are commemorative bottles and so on.











The specially shaped cans with some constrictions were released in 1995 or 1996. It seems that it caused a breakdown of the vending machine and it was an extremely rare item that was immediately pulled out of the market.







These colorful cans are collaboration bottles with artists. Various patterns are drawn by the artists who collaborated.







And Mr. Feng is exhibiting a series of 'sports commemorative bottles' that has used up the entire room.







Coca-Cola releases a commemorative bottle with players and teams every time a world soccer tournament such as the World Cup FIFA World Cup or Euro Cup is held so the score of the soccer-related collection is very high. That thing.











Coca-Cola has been a

worldwide partner since the 1928 and has a huge selection of Olympic commemorative bottles.





The 2016 Olympics were held in Rio de Janeiro but for some reason there are still bottles that are supposed to have the 2016 Olympics in Chicago and of course it is a very rare item.







In addition cans celebrating the Independence Day of African countries ...







A plastic can that says 'recyclable'.







A can that was manufactured in the United States and imported into China when it did not have a domestic factory in China yet.







Energy drinks of various flavors and diet-type Coca-Cola. It's a collection that surprises me if Coca-Cola was manufactured so much.

Where factors like a retailer’s or a salesperson’s ability to hard sell the product were often the final push in deciding customer opinion we are in an era where the customer has become savvier more product and quality conscious.These are also buyers who are fueling the D2C growth in India. The pandemic further pushed the trend with more companies joining the D2C bandwagon in 2020. The results were often highly encouraging with many brands seeing an almost 88% uptick in demand in 2020 compared to the previous year. Improved internet access combined with increasingly interactive tech platforms have allowed brands to directly reach out to consumers like never before.But with the emergence of embedded technologies like AI and highly interactive platforms brands are also under pressure to keep apace with technological advancement. The thrust now is to adapt tech that combines efficiency with personalised service to drive customer engagement.Today no brand can afford to ignore the common tech platforms including an interactive website and social media . Messaging tools like chats WhatsApp or Facebook messenger are utilised to reach out to potential customers share catalogues or portfolios. SMSs or WhatsApp messages are utilised to establish initial contact informing the customer of their order ID or tracking number.Other than advertising and marketing  social media like Facebook are also important for staying in touch with existing or potential customers. These platforms can be utilised to form communities inform customers of new launches or address their concerns.With the multiple communication channels that we use today it is equally important to ensure a seamless experience across these platforms. For instance customers today expect their interaction to flow in one direction from the time they place an order to the addressal of any issue they may have. For instance if they have reached out through chat they expect the follow-up call agent to be aware of their interaction history.Under an omnichannel approach all channels are connected integrating all customer interaction in a single system that can be accessed instantly by the service agent. While it ensures an efficient experience for the consumer the service agent also benefits from the access to the entire customer history.New-age customer service now requires the integration of these channels to provide customers with a 360 degree experience. It involves a tiered approach where interaction can be managed as per their priority. It moves from asynchronous messaging to personalised interaction to ensure speedy redressal of customer queries and issues while optimising the utilisation of available resources.Customer interaction starts with chatbots or virtual agents with automated responses. Unresolved queries are handled by an agent through chat. It can be followed by increasingly personalised services from a call to agent’s visit as required. At the back office a similar tiered approach connects all channels ensuring an omnichannel approach.The digitalisation of customer experience is only in keeping with an overall digital-only approach we see today. While it helps in optimisation of resources it can also be a powerful tool for data gathering and analysis. It can help us gain valuable quantitative and qualitative insights into customer behaviour helping us to further improve products and services.- SaaS to leverage the right tools and analytics to see the consumer journey and behaviour which helps us understand both qualitative and quantitative trafficThe writer is co-founder The Sleep Company

When high-profile companies like Comcast and Du Pont need to make sure their no-longer-used computers and phones are smashed to bits they turn to Aston-based CyberCrunch an electronics recycling and data destruction service writes Joseph N. DiStefano for The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Their two plants one in Aston and one in Greensburg PA shred the devices into confetti beyond the means of retrieval for data thieves.

What’s left is then sold to recyclers.

Joe Connors head of business development at Aston-based CyberCrunch said his company is betting that working-from-home the Internet of Things and smartphones communicating with “cloud” servers will boost demand for destroying what gets left behind.

They’ve built new shredders like the Cyber 10G Pulverizer with just that in mind.

Old devices and proprietary data need to be destroyed for places like Penn and Jefferson Comcast and DuPont Clarivate and Sungard and 900 Wawa stores.

Right now coming off record low viewership in the first night of primetime coverage the billions the Comcast-owned network forked out to broadcast the Games until 2032 isn’t looking like money well spent.

Exhibit A: the 2022 Opening Ceremony.

A paltry 8.7 million tuned in on NBC in primetime see the pre-taped Mike Tirico and Savannah Guthrie-led coverage of the propaganda-heavy spectacle put on by Chinese President Xi Jinping and filmmaker Zhang Yimou. Put in the starkest terms those early numbers are down harder and faster from four years ago in PyeongChang than Mikaela Shiffrin on a slalom run.

A crashing 69% in the fast affiliates to be specific.

In a case of snowboarders to skateboarders the opening of the 2022 Winter Olympics also slid 16% from the preliminary data of last year’s Opening Ceremony of the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Right now that adds up to an all-time Olympics low for NBC.

Now like South Korea’s hosting of the XXIII Winter Olympics and Japan’s Covid-19 hobbled effort in 2021 China’s second Olympics in 14 years is many time zones off Stateside primetime on both coasts — which certainly doesn’t help the experience. Unlike 2018 the official kickoff of the Beijing Games was shown live in the early East Coast hours on NBC and on 2020 launching streamer Peacock. With the latter is clearly the long term big play for NBCUniversal Comcast are likely aiming to shrug off the lackluster linear results – for now.

Exhibit B: While snagging around 10.4 million viewers in primetime on NBC last July the Tokyo Olympics inaugural extravaganza had a total audience of 17 million when strong streaming numbers and more were factored in.

In that vein scooping up last night’s three-hour primetime show and adding the February 4 AM broadcast across various channels and more NBC Sports say that 14 million watched the Opening Ceremony on TV on all of Friday. The division also say that Peacock had its best weekday viewership ever to help push the total number of viewers that watched the Olympics on February 4 on to a total audience delivery of 16 million.

Right now the network at least has one true bright spot to focus on.

On a night of mainly repeats news magazine shows and Fox’s dipping WWE SmackDown NBC’s “enhanced” — their word not ours – Olympics coverage unsurprisingly took the primetime Gold.

In that sense they can have the satisfaction of Norway.

On the Stateside bright side Nathan Chan looks poised to bring home the Gold for Team USA at the Beijing Olympics but right now America’s haul is standing at zero.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluaWouY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDUvZGljay1zcG90c3dvb2QtcHJlcGFyZS1mb3ItcHJpc29ucy1zbWFsbGVyLWZvb3RwcmludC1vbi1zYW4tcXVlbnRpbi1wZW5pbnN1bGEv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFyaW5pai5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNS9kaWNrLXNwb3Rzd29vZC1wcmVwYXJlLWZvci1wcmlzb25zLXNtYWxsZXItZm9vdHByaW50LW9uLXNhbi1xdWVudGluLXBlbmluc3VsYS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dick Spotswood: Prepare for prison’s smaller footprint on San Quentin Peninsula,"San Quentin’s death row is closing. Gov. Gavin Newsom a longtime capital punishment foe has ordered that those 673 men condemned will be transferred to other prisons around the state where they’ll join the general prison population. It’s noteworthy that California’s last execution took place 16 years ago in 2006.

Regardless of one’s position regarding the wisdom and morality of the death penalty shutting death row has significant implications for the future of San Quentin State Prison.

Previously the penitentiary jutting into San Pablo Bay couldn’t close as it was the only permitted site for the state’s death chamber. With the effective end of state executions that rationale is no longer relevant.

The prison sits on a stunning piece of land. There’s a concept that addresses the needs of all of the stakeholders: the incarcerated Marin’s need to satisfy state housing construction mandates North Bay-San Francisco commuters and county taxpayers.

The scenario is similar to what’s been suggested in the past by retired Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey.

Death row’s closure presents an opportunity to shift San Quentin’s role within the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. With the exception of the new $136 million Central Health Services facility the majority of the prison’s infrastructure is antiquated.

The idea is to move inmates on death row and others who have life sentences to maximum security facilities around the state. San Quentin would then be repositioned as a “state of the art” medium- and minimum-security rehabilitation center to facilitate counseling and job training for inmates who’ll eventually be released.

A rehabilitation prison’s goal is to curb recidivism the post-prison relapse into criminal behavior. In America 70% of those released fall back into a life of crime within five years.

Marin has a plethora of volunteer groups committed to breaking the cycle of crime. That list includes among others Centerforce Mount Tamalpais College journalists mentoring reporters at The San Quentin News which is exclusively written by the incarcerated and Kairos the multi-denomination Christian organization assisting those transitioning to the outside. My late dad a San Francisco police lieutenant was a committed member of one such group then called Inside/Out.

A prison devoted to rehabilitation will be smaller than the present complex which occupies 245 of the 432 acres of state real estate. Much of the remainder of the grounds should be devoted to housing. While the North Bay has a water shortage San Quentin is Marin Municipal Water District’s single largest customer. Shift some of that water use from jails to homes.

Housing on the site needs to be sustainable. Officials should transfer development rights from inappropriate locations in unincorporated Marin now listed for multi-unit housing to San Quentin Peninsula. Include lower-cost workforce homes plus market-rate condos with spectacular bay views. The latter will finance the affordable component while guaranteeing a flow of property taxes.

Golden Gate’s Larkspur Ferry Terminal should’ve initially been sited at deep water Point San Quentin. When the prison is downsized move the ferries to the peninsula’s tip. Then high-speed boats will make the San Francisco run in 25 minutes making water transit even more compelling. Sell the current ferry facility using proceeds to finance the new terminal.

Add a pathway around the peninsula for hikers and cyclists give access to windsurfers and allow public use of tranquil beaches that have long been inaccessible.

Creating a consensus involving the department the guard’s union prisoner advocates transit agencies local governments and neighbors isn’t easy. It’s worth a major effort to create a national model of rehabilitative justice workforce housing and a faster commute to San Francisco.

The vehicle to pursue it is the Housing and Safety Elements for 2023-31 in Marin’s Countywide Plan. If there’s the political will reinventing San Quentin Peninsula should be high on the list for consideration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L2NoaWNhZ28tY3Vicy1pbi10YWxrcy10by1sYXVuY2gtc3RyZWFtaW5nLXNlcnZpY2UtYW1pZC1yZXNpc3RhbmNlLWZyb20tbWxiL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago Cubs in talks to launch streaming service amid resistance from MLB: sources,"The Chicago Cubs are in talks with media giant Sinclair Broadcasting to launch a streaming service for customers without a cable or satellite-TV subscription — despite pushback from Major League Baseball on the idea The Post has learned.

In a deal that insiders say could have league-wide implications the Cubs and Sinclair are angling to launch the new service following a tough round of negotiations with cable-TV giant Comcast more than a year ago which resulted in capping monthly fees for the Marquee Sports Network the broadcaster of local Cubs games according to sources close to the situation.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is concerned that Sinclair loaded down with debt after a series of big acquisitions doesn’t have the cash needed to produce high-quality broadcasts sources said. As exclusively reported by The Post Manfred also has been angling to launch a league-wide streaming service as soon as next year.

The stakes in the dispute could be high: The Cubs which own Marquee Sports in a 50-50 partnership with Sinclair are among the most valuable franchises in baseball. If the team begins broadcasting its games directly to consumers it might set a precedent for other franchises to quickly follow suit according to sources close to the situation.

“We’re always exploring options” Marquee Sports General Manager Michael McCarthy told The Post. “There is nothing definite to announce.”

Spokespersons for Sinclair and MLB declined to comment.

The disagreement carries a bitter tinge dating back to 2019 when MLB bid against Sinclair in an auction to buy the Fox Regional Sports Networks. Sinclair won Fox’s networks for $9.6 billion renaming them under the Bally Sports banner and rejected the idea of bringing in MLB as a co-investor. Relations between the parties have since been frosty sources said.

Likewise while MLB had initially planned to test its streaming service with the Detroit Tigers sources said the talks fell through last year when the Tigers instead signed a new media deal with Sinclair according to a source.

Now it’s up to MLB to approve whether teams are getting a fair value from Sinclair for their streaming rights sources said. While Sinclair is anxious to move ahead insiders say MLB has been dragging its feet.

“They say they want the conversation but it doesn’t happen” a source close to the talks said of MLB.

One key point of concern for MLB according to insiders is the $18-a-month price tag that’s being floated for the new Cubs streaming service — a tab that’s higher than what users pay for streaming services like Netflix HBO Max or Disney+ and which league officials fear will be too high for the average fan.

“Yes I think the $18 price is too high” one source familiar with the negotiations said. “No one is this high. The only person that pays this is someone deeply passionate about regional sports networks and that is a small subset of fans.”

Sinclair counters it can get customers to pay the $18 once it has amassed streaming rights for 14 teams — nearly half of MLB’s franchises according to sources close to the talks. The plan is for Sinclair’s Bally Sports to begin by airing games of teams whose rights it has recently secured including the Detroit Tigers Kansas City Royals Miami Marlins Milwaukee Brewers and Tampa Bay Rays games when it launches this summer.

In January Sinclair also announced a one-year deal with the National Basketball Association allowing it to air games for the 16 teams it carries including the Golden State Warriors directly to consumers. The National Hockey League in December agreed to a four-year deal for 12 teams.

Sinclair specifically agreed to pay teams for the rights to stream games direct to consumers and MLB approved these new media rights deals according to a source close to the company. More baseball teams are coming to Sinclair and saying they want to sell them streaming rights to make additional money and to get more fans watching their games the source said.

Nevertheless MLB wants to protect itself in case this direct-to-consumer service fails especially given Sinclair’s wobbly financial condition sources said. Its Diamond Sports unit which in addition to Bally’s and the 50% Marquee stake owns a minority stake in the YES Network owes nearly $9 billion in loans and its debt is trading at distressed levels with a value of about $5 billion. The principal comes due in 2026.

Meanwhile the value of regional sports networks has collapsed since Sinclair’s massive 2019 Fox deal as cable companies slash their payments for sports programming even as teams have continued to charge stiff fees for broadcasting rights.

Indeed one MLB team owner who requested anonymity used an NFL metaphor to describe the dire financial outlook for Sinclair’s Diamond Sports unit saying the company is facing fourth down with 30 yards to go and that while there’s a chance it can create significant new value from the streaming service it’s a longshot.

The team owner added he believes an eventual Diamond Sports bankruptcy is likely even after a partial refinancing of its debt that followed the deal with the NBA.

Rich Greenfield an analyst at LightShed Partners said MLB appears reluctant to tie its digital future to Sinclair as an intermediary “especially given the financial debacle surrounding the [company] and maybe even more importantly Sinclair’s lack of expertise in subscription streaming.

“Delaying Diamond’s bankruptcy slows down the process of reinventing the

regional sports business” Greenfield added saying the leagues could do a much better job of offering direct-to-consumer broadcasts than Sinclair.

Despite such concerns sources said Sinclair believes it can entice fans with its streaming service by making it more interactive and focused on gambling. Plans are to launch an app so fans can chat directly with the television announcers and participate in sweepstakes a source said.

Sinclair would not take sports bets directly but point during broadcasts to partners like Bally’s where viewers could watch games through a media player over their betting apps. The bet is that fantasy football has boosted NFL ratings and combining gaming with other sports should do the same.

“This would be like a picture within a picture” according to a source briefed on Sinclair’s plans."
CMA,Comerica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpcGxpbmdlci5jb20vcmV0aXJlbWVudC9lc3RhdGUtcGxhbm5pbmcvNjA0MTczL3ByaW5jZXMtZXN0YXRlLWlzLWEtcm95YWwtbWVzcy01LXdheXMteW91LWNhbi1kby1iZXR0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince's Estate Is a Royal Mess: 5 Ways You Can Do Better,"When pop superstar Prince died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016 he left behind significant assets many relatives … and no will. It was a recipe for disaster. In addition to tangible assets – money in the bank real property – Prince left music rights and the value inherent in his name and likeness. Comerica the estate’s administrator valued it all at $82.3 million; the IRS said it was worth twice that amount – a whopping $163.2 million – and asserted a tax claim for $39 million.

It took six years and tens of millions of dollars in legal fees but the heirs and the IRS finally came to terms in January agreeing on a final valuation of $156.4 million. In the interim there were changes. Prince’s half-brother passed away in 2019 leaving a will that opened the door for new unrelated parties to assert claims against the estate. Now the process of distributing the vast estate finally begins.

We may not possess a fraction of Prince’s estate but we can all treat our heirs like royalty. Simple steps now can prevent a nightmare like the one his family experienced. These are five key lessons from the Prince estate debacle.

1. Make a will

It sounds obvious but an up-to-date will was clearly not on Prince’s priority list. Your will tells the court how you want to distribute your property and it ensures that minor children will be placed in the care of someone you trust. Without a will the court will make those decisions on your behalf.

To be valid and binding a will must be signed by someone of sound mind; unrelated witnesses may also be required in your state.

Although a DIY will may sound enticing don’t do it. A mistake can send an otherwise simple will to litigation where any money saved is quickly eaten up by legal costs. Have a legal professional create your last will and testament.

2. Know what you have

Start your inventory with big-ticket items such as real estate and savings accounts – trusts and life insurance policies will bypass probate if beneficiaries have been named – and work your way down. Your grandmother’s recipe book and your father’s tie clip may not have monetary value but they mean something to somebody. Put them on a spreadsheet so they don’t fall through the cracks when you’re no longer here. It may also be helpful to add a column to the spreadsheet showing to whom you intend to pass the asset so you can refer to it as you draft your will.

3. Know what it’s worth

The IRS and Comerica settled last spring on the real estate portion of Prince’s estate but it took another year and a half to arrive at a valuation for intangible assets such as rights to Prince’s music. The IRS ultimately dropped a $6.4 million “accuracy-related penalty” it had levied on Prince’s estate and the Minnesota Department of Revenue also dropped an accuracy penalty. However the fight over value resulted in a huge tax bill that will likely force Prince’s heirs to sell their interests in his catalog rather than reaping its long-term benefits.

Protect your heirs by enlisting the services of a reputable expert to value jewelry artwork and other items of unique value and be sure to keep all documentation in a safe place. Although valuations change over time having a general idea of an asset’s value when making estate plans can spare your heirs severe tax consequences down the road.

Include a valuation column on your asset spreadsheet in which you insert the best information you have for each item and the basis for that valuation. If you’ve received a professional appraisal indicate the source and the location of any supporting documentation; if it’s a best guess state as much. Save your beneficiaries a fight over valuation by assigning a value or a process for determining values if one beneficiary wants to buy out others or receives a specific property.

4. Anticipate family dynamics

Even the best of families can morph into dysfunction when a loved one dies. How sad to think that your death could create a permanent divide between your relatives. Make things simple by creating a clear plan that leaves nothing to chance. Just because you’ve told a close relative that you want them to have your silverware don’t assume that everyone knows this or will be happy about it.

In Prince’s case the court was left to divide his extensive estate – including his Paisley Park studios-turned-museum real estate and music rights – equally among six blood relatives. Had Prince simply spelled out his wishes prior to death his heirs may not have been happy but they would have received their inheritance intact and in a reasonable time. Instead they had to watch and wait as the estate doled out tens of millions of dollars to lawyers and consultants and valuable assets to pay those fees.

A letter that clearly explains to your heirs the reasons for your decisions can head off hurt feelings acrimony and possible legal challenges. When the only decisions your relatives have to make are what to wear to the service and what kind of food to order afterwards you’ve given them a precious gift.

5. Name an executor

Designate a trusted individual to carry out your will's instructions and manage the affairs and wishes of your estate. Don’t make it a surprise. The more prepared and informed your executor is the smoother the process will be. Your designee should understand what he or she will be required to do. If you sense any hesitation or concern talk through those concerns. If it still doesn’t feel right to one or both of you identify another person to serve in this important capacity someone who will truly have your heirs’ best interests at heart.

The largest beneficiary of Prince’s estate was the IRS followed by the administrators and attorneys. A close family member or friend may be willing to waive compensation and should work to keep fees down so that the bulk of your estate passes to your loved ones.

Prince probably thought — like most of us do — that he had plenty of time to get his affairs in order or he may have concluded that whatever happened after he was gone was none of his concern. Creating an estate plan is an extremely personal decision but it has huge consequences. It is perhaps the strongest expression of love that the law recognizes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL21sYi90aWdlcnMvMjAyMi8wMi8wNi9oZXJlLXdoZXJlLXNvbWUtZGV0cm9pdC10aWdlcnMtdG9wLXByb3NwZWN0cy1jb3VsZC1zdGFydC1zZWFzb24vNjY4Mzg5MzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here is a look at where some of the Tigers' top prospects could start the season,"Your subscription supports:

En la conversación el especialista peruano mostró y dejó que fotografiaran una réplica de la primera lámpara incandescente patentada por Thomas Alva Edison en enero de 1880. Esta reliquia la obtuvo en los años 20 cuando era miembro de la revista estadounidense “Ingeniería Internacional”. Su fanatismo por estos valiosos objetos hizo que conservara esta bombilla en buen estado durante décadas.

Inicio de todo

Eran inicios del siglo XIX cuando varios científicos ingleses intentaron demostrar que era posible generar luz con electricidad a través del “arco voltaico”. Este fenómeno eléctrico se produce cuando dos electrodos son sometidos a una diferencia de voltaje dentro de un medio gaseoso. De esta manera se lograba una descarga similar a la de una llama.

Es así como en 1800 el químico británico Humphry Davy fue el primero en demostrarlo. Años después en 1809 el famoso científico inglés explicó ante la Royal Society de Londres la forma de crear luz utilizando un hilo de platino. Esta fue la primera exposición ante un ente científico de lo que sería la lámpara incandescente.

Más adelante en 1835 el escocés James Bowman Lindsay realizó una demostración pública de esta bombilla utilizando corriente continua. Desde de ese momento varios inventores trataron de perfeccionar este aparato. Sin embargo siempre se chocaban con problemas usuales como su corta duración elevado costo o excesivo uso de energía.

Edison entra en escena

Thomas Edison y sus investigadores centraron sus trabajos en perfeccionar esta lámpara incandescente. Por eso primero probaron con carbono y luego con platino. Al final decidieron que se quedarían con la primera sustancia. Años después el 27 de enero de 1880 el científico y empresario estadounidense patentó la primera bombilla incandescente comercial. El número de la patente fue el 285.898.

Esta lámpara contaba con un filamento de carbono y estaba cubierta de cristal. Además tenía una duración de 40 horas. Cabe resaltar que un año antes el británico Joseph Swan también había patentado una versión parecida de esta bombilla. Una pieza que tenía el mismo filamento de carbono pero no contaba con la cubierta de cristal y solo duraba 14 horas.

Con el pasar de los años Edison siguió desarrollando varios trabajos que lograron generalizar el uso de este invento. Es así como ideó un sistema de distribución eléctrica utilizando tubos y cables. Luego mejoró los métodos de generación de luz existentes en aquella época y creó el primer medidor de electricidad que permitía saber cuánto consumía un usuario.

Reliquia en buen estado

La tarde del viernes 15 de octubre de 1971 Guillermo Zúñiga Guzmán ingeniero electrónico y extrabajador del Ministerio de Fomento (ahora Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones) llegó hasta la redacción de El Comercio acompañado de una reliquia. El valioso objeto era una réplica de la primera lámpara incandescente patentada por Thomas Edison en el siglo XIX.

Ya en la sala el especialista peruano dio una entrevista para el diario decano y dejó que la famosa pieza fuera fotografiada para una nota sobre la “Historia del Alumbrado” de la página de Amenidades de este periódico. En la conversación Zúñiga contó que esta lámpara la obtuvo en 1929 cuando era miembro de la revista estadounidense “Ingeniería Internacional”.

Esta reliquia aún conservaba su cilindro de vidrio en la parte principal y poseía en su interior el filamento de carbono de 40 horas de duración. El fanatismo por su profesión hizo que mantuviera este objeto en buen estado por varias décadas. Para él era una pieza invaluable.

El ingeniero electrónico también reveló que había tenido guardada una copia del primer dinamo que construyó el famoso científico norteamericano. Esa pieza sirvió para dar luz a Nueva York Estados Unidos. No obstante manifestó que tuvo que deshacerse de ella pocos meses antes de la entrevista.

Es así como finalizó la conversación con Guillermo Zúñiga un fanático de estas reliquias que pudo obtener la histórica pieza creada y patentada hace más de 140 años por el reconocido inventor y empresario estadounidense Thomas Alva Edison.

Todo empieza cuando la usuaria de Instagram de nombre Katy Canales compartió una historia donde aparece un niño al parecer pariente de ella vistiendo la camiseta blanquirroja número 20 del Oreja.

La foto habría sido tomada en un lugar remoto del Perú dado el bello paisaje que aparece como fondo.

La joven etiquetó en la publicación tanto al mediocampista como a Siucho con el fin de que vieran la tierna foto del pequeño. Y sucedió.

Ana Siucho tuvo el detalle de compartir en sus historias de Instagram la foto del menor con la camiseta de su esposo. Ante esto la hincha no pudo ocultar su emoción y replicó la historia escribiendo “No lo puedo creer”.

Edison Flores es un furor en redes sociales tras sus dos golazos decisivos en la fecha doble donde Perú le ganó a Colombia y empató con Ecuador. El ‘Oreja’ se ha reivindicado tanto con el equipo como con sus seguidores en redes sociales.

De ahí han surgido fascinantes obras literarias y cinematográficas que de alguna forma plantean retos monumentales a la sociedad. Con esos mimbres se dan casos en la vida cotidiana más propios de películas fantasiosas como el de Elizabeth Holmes fundadora con sólo 30 años de la multimillonaria empresa que en 2014 sugirió inventar un gran hito histórico de la medicina para acabar condenada en 2022 por una de las mayores estafas ocurridas en Estados Unidos.

El 11 de febrero se cumplen 175 años del nacimiento en 1847 del prolífico inventor americano Thomas Alva Edison con más de mil patentes a su nombre entre las que destacan el fonógrafo la cámara de cine y cómo no la bombilla incandescente. Curiosamente el artilugio tecnológico ideado por la mencionada Holmes llevaba el apellido del insigne descubridor consistiendo en una máquina capaz de realizar más de 70 análisis clínicos partiendo de unas simples gotas de sangre extraídas del sencillo pinchazo en un dedo y con una sola muestra. Sin lugar a dudas suponía una colosal revolución médica que de haber sido cierta permitiría el abaratamiento y rapidez en la detección de múltiples patologías humanas. El problema es que conociendo que el alquímico aparato no funcionaba lo ocultaron y falsearon durante años embaucando a grandes inversores como el magnate de la comunicación Rupert Murdoch o el de la tecnología Larry Ellison (séptima fortuna del mundo) además de Henry Kissinger Bill Clinton y Carlos Slim entre otros que permitieron a la compañía Theranos de Elizabeth Holmes ser valorada en su día por encima de los 9.000 millones de dólares.

""No he fallado. He encontrado 10.000 formas en que no funcionará"" reconocía sin rubor el mítico Edison en el Siglo XIX cuando algún invento se le resistía modestia de la que a todas luces careció su admiradora Elizabeth ahora caída en desgracia. Ella podría enfrentarse hasta a 80 años de cárcel cuando Forbes o Fortune llegaron a considerarla como la joven más acaudalada del momento y símbolo del todopoderoso Silicon Valley californiano del que emanan grandes invenciones y de donde han surgido otros genios como Bill Gates Steve Jobs o Mark Zuckerberg. El problema es que en esa mina americana de prodigios tienen un lema que ha demostrado poca fiabilidad o inventiva: ""Finge hasta que lo consigas""…

In fact renderings of the would-be facility make it stand out as a true destination in the city.

At the moment the Canandaigua YMCA is housed in a 60000-square-foot building located at 32 N. Main Street.

The City’s Planning Commission gave approval to subdivide a Constellation Brands property as well as a special use permit and site plan in October 2021. It’s unclear at this point if the land was donated or purchased.

However details of the total cost fundraising timeline and actual process to build an 80000-square-foot replacement facility have not been outlined.

The YMCA said in a statement that it’s relying on strong partnerships in the community and looking forward at a vision for the city-at-large. “We have great partners working alongside us to ensure our vision becomes a reality for the residents of the greater Canandaigua community. There is still a lot of work to be done and we will share future details on the project as they become available” they said.

It was also the second-largest category by revenue behind No. 1 vodka which has been the top-selling spirit in the U.S. since the 1970s. At $7.3 billion in revenue vodka is still selling roughly $2 billion more annually than tequila and mezcal but agave-based spirits could be on track to outstrip it in just a few years.

Tequila and mezcal was the second-fastest growing spirits category in 2021 trailing only premixed cocktails . Agave-based spirits saw sales climb 30.1% compared with the prior year to $5.2 billion according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.

Tequila could soon overtake vodka as America's favorite liquor fueled by consumers' desire for pricey bottles of agave-based spirits.

For more evidence of the trend look no further than casinos. Julian Cox renowned bartender and executive director of beverage and corporate mixologist for MGM Resorts International  said total sales of vodka and tequila are running neck and neck at the hospitality giant.

""Nobody could believe it"" he said.

Using volume as a measure vodka still remains king. According to DISCUS the liquor sold 78.1 million cases in 2021 more than double the volume of the next category: premixed cocktails. Tequila and mezcal scored a distant fourth at 26.8 million cases.

High-end tequilas are helping drive growth for the category according to Christine LoCascio DISCUS chief of public policy.

""It's not just for margaritas"" LoCascio said at the trade group's annual economic briefing on Thursday. ""There are so many high-end tequilas that you can sip and savor like many other high-end products like whiskeys and cognacs and bourbons and high-end rums as well.""

Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes echoed that sentiment on the company's recent earnings call. The distiller owns two upscale tequila brands: Don Julio and Casamigos.

""The category's appeal across demographics is significant"" he said. ""It has crossed over. The multicultural growth is very strong. It cuts across age segments it cuts across gender it cuts across dayparts the occasion and the nature of drinks. It's not just shots and margaritas as it used to be many years ago.""

The Crown Royal owner is forecasting that tequila sales will expand faster than the broader spirits industry for the next five to 10 years. In the first half of its fiscal 2022 it saw tequila sales surge 56% over the year-earlier period.

Tequila is also helping the spirits industry steal customers from beer. Tony Abou-Ganim celebrity mixologist and author of ""Vodka Distilled"" created the beverage programs for T-Mobile Arena and Allegiant Stadium both in Las Vegas. The sports venues have margaritas on the menu made with fresh ingredients and 100% agave tequila.

""A lot of people think when they go to an arena or stadium 'I'm just going to drink beer' and our feeling was if we put a better margarita in their hands they're going to buy margaritas. And that's proven to be the case"" Abou-Ganim said.

DISCUS's LoCascio also acknowledged that high-profile celebrity launches have helped draw attention to the category.

A host of celebrities have rolled out their own tequila and mezcal brands including both actor and former professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson and model Kendall Jenner last year. In addition to hopping on the agave bandwagon they're hoping to emulate the success of George Clooney's Casamigos tequila which was sold to Diageo for $1 billion in 2017. Last year Constellation Brands invested in ""Breaking Bad"" co-stars Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston's Dos Hombres mezcal for an undisclosed amount.",,,,,,,,,

Preview

The three-man American contingent took third fifth and 11th in the qualification round of the men's slopestyle.

Sean Fitzsimons produced the best run of the trio to finish in third behind Su Yiming of China and Mark McMorris a two-time Olympic bronze medalist from Canada.

Gerard began his gold-medal defense with a fifth-place mark in qualifying but all that mattered is he advanced to the final.

Corning qualified in 11th place among the 30 competitors. The Colorado native needs to improve on his scores to be in medal contention alongside FitzSimons and Gerard.

The American trio could have a hard time gaining separation on the leaderboard among the loaded final field.

Norway's Staale Sandbech and Canada's Max Parrot are silver medalists in slopestyle while McMorris just took the Winter X Games title in Aspen Colorado before coming to Beijing. World Cup leader Sebastien Toutant from Canada qualified eighth.

Toutant won one of three buildup events to the Olympics in January. He won the FIS World Cup slopestyle event in Calgary but was off the medal stand at Mammoth Mountain in California the following week. Gerard captured first at Mammoth Mountain but the field for that event was not as stacked as it is in Beijing.

McMorris won the final tuneup event at the Winter X Games. The other two X Games medalists failed to reach the final.

In 2018 Gerard waited until his final run to lay down the gold-medal score. Parrot did the same to win the silver.

But the Beijing Olympics course has delivered features requiring imaginativeness not seen since well the last Olympics. As the men’s snowboarders prepare for the final on Monday it’s those unique features that could play a role in who stands atop the podium.

“That’s what’s cool about slopestyle” said Sebastien Toutant. “There’s a lot of options and you can use your creativity to pick different lines that people are not using.”

Toutant was among three Canadians and three Americans who combined to make up half of the 12-man field that advanced from qualifying at Genting Snow Park on Sunday.

Olympic newcomer Sean Fitzsimons qualified in third while defending gold medalist Red Gerard qualified fifth. U.S. teammate Chris Corning finished 11th in qualifying. China’s Su Yiming took first after a big run that saw him be the only qualifier to land a 1620 in the competition.

They all navigated a course that has features they have only seen in the Olympics.

The three rail sections atop the course offer some unique features protected by a snow replica of The Great Wall. While there are a variety of rail options riders could choose a line off the top of the guard tower.

Like in Pyeongchang the first of three jumps features two angled takeoffs that add difficulty because they force riders to start their trick in an unfamiliar body position.

“The course is really hard. It’s definitely one of the hardest courses we’ve done and then with the wing jumps they got we haven’t done that for four years” Corning said. “So they throw us into the fire again.”

That leads into the second jump a monstrous pile of snow that features a roller straight to the knuckle two straight kickers and two quarter pipes on the sides. Riders can choose their own adventure on that jump and what they choose might play big in who wins.

“Right now there’s a big push for snowboarding to get out of the straight jump era right now just because the spins are getting so crazy” Gerard said. “It’s cool to throw some transition in a slopestyle course and kind of throw off slopestyle riders so we’re a little challenged.”

Go straight at it and riders can attempt a triple cork – three off-axis flips – with a 1440 or 1620 some of the higher degrees of rotation being done today. But judges might reward the creativity of line coming at the jump from the side and using the quarter pipe.

WHAT JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR:How does the scoring work

They certainly did in Pyeongchang where Gerard took that approach and it helped him win gold. Canadians Max Parrot and Mark McMorris took the straight approach on that jump and finished with silver and bronze respectively.

“I’m going to guess that the winning run’s going to have the quarter pipes in it which they probably won’t be 16 on there so we’ll see” Corning said.

The last jump tees up the kind of tricks McMorris a two-time Olympic bronze medalist thinks will be needed to win. McMorris is coming off gold in slopestyle at the X Games in January and he has 21 X Games medals.

He’ll be favored to contend for gold in the final where he thinks riders will need a 1440 and two 1620s. If not that some other combination of high-rotation tricks executed well is the key.

But the Olympic course and all its unique features might still have its say.

“Just that second jump where there’s two kickers and then there’s the halfpipe hits on the side that’s not necessarily the most ideal just because it’s so hard to judge” McMorris said. “What’s a front triple off the jump versus a front 10 off that halfpipe? It gets tricky at times but it’s still really fun to ride.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjluZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9vbHltcGljcy9yZWQtZ2VyYXJkLXJlc3VsdHMtc2xvcGVzdHlsZS83My1kNTRiMGVmMC04Mzg5LTRiM2YtOGJiNy02ZDkxZDM0ZDQyMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winter Olympics Results: Red Gerard in slopestyle,"Red Gerard won a surprise gold medal in 2018. He was looking to defend that title in Beijing.

BEIJING China — Defending gold medalist and Silverthorne resident Red Gerard just missed getting his second Olympic medal in slopestyle in Beijing.

Gerard was sitting in the bronze-medal position when Canadian Mark McMorris edged past him into the third spot on his final run.

McMorris scored 88.53 on that run. Gerard's highest score was 83.25 which he got on his first run. In the slopestyle event each competitor does three runs and only their highest score is counted.

Gerard's teammate Chris Corning finished sixth with a score of 65.11. Corning is also from Silverthorne.

Gerard was 17 when he went to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. He flew to the top of the snowboard world when he earned gold and become the youngest person to earn gold at the Winter Olympics since 1928.

In the years that followed Gerard has stayed on top of the slopestyle world. He recently won the Dew Tour at Copper Mountain an international competition that secured his spot at the Games.

Snowboarding has become something Gerard has taken a leadership role in over the past four years jumping into side projects and getting into snowboarding films and efforts to get more children into snowboarding by building small beginner terrain parks at more ski areas. They're called “Red’s Parks” and are similar to his own backyard park in Silverthorne.

Gerard is the sixth of seven children – he has four brothers and two sisters. According to his bio on the U.S. Ski & Snowboard website he quickly learned that “if he didn’t keep up he’d be left behind.""

He started snowboarding when he was 2 years old. His family moved to Summit County in 2007 according to Team USA."

Costco’s Kirkland Signature brand is perhaps America’s weirdest private label. You can put Kirkland Signature AA batteries alongside Kirkland Signature cashews in your shopping cart.

It’s also shockingly successful.

Kirkland raked in $58 billion in sales during Costco’s latest fiscal year making up around a quarter of the company’s total revenue. Kirkland is America’s biggest consumer packaged goods’ brand measured by sales. It’s larger than Hershey (HSY) Campbell Soup (CPB) or Kellogg (K).

But it wasn’t always this way. It took Costco a couple decades to get its Kirkland strategy right.

If you shopped at Costco in the United States three decades ago you’d find about 30 different Costco private-label brands alongside the big-name food and household staples’ lines.

There was Simply Soda. Chelsea toilet paper. Ballantrae wine. Clout detergent. Nutra Nuggets dog food. These brands were sold only at Costco which was called PriceCostco at the time after Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 (Costco dropped ‘Price’ from its name four years later).

But Jim Sinegal Costco’s co-founder and CEO at the time decided these brand names were forgettable. He sensed a major opportunity to overhaul the company’s private-label strategy.

Sinegal was inspired by a 1991 article in Forbes about rising profit margins for leading consumer goods’ companies at the time like General Foods H.J. Heinz and Nabisco and the emerging growth of private-label brands. Consumers are “starting to switch to house brands…The trend so far is only a trickle but it shows signs of growing fairly rapidly” the article said. Sinegal underlined key passages from the article and sent it around to Costco’s top merchants.

Costco at the time was also expanding internationally including in the United Kingdom and Canada where stores’ private-label brands were better quality and more popular with shoppers than in the United States. Most US chains’ private brands had been boring knockoff brands with white labels.

“We found that there was a resurgence of private-label product and that was driven an awful lot by the fact that the prices of brand-name products were growing so rapidly” Sinegal said at a talk in 2019 at Georgetown University. Rising prices for big-name brands “created an umbrella” for Costco to develop its own brands at 15% to 20% below branded alternatives he said.

Sinegal told Costco’s merchants that he wanted the quality of Costco’s private labels to replicate those found overseas. And he had an unusual request — one name for all of them.

“The conventional wisdom said that you had to have a different name for every class of product that you had — a la Sears Roebuck with the Kenmore appliances and the DieHard batteries and the Craftsman tools” Sinegal said in 2019. “We looked at it and we said you know we’re in so many countries and we have such a wide array of products we’ll have a room full of attorneys that are doing nothing but trying to clear these names.”

Sinegal asked staff for suggestions for a name and someone floated Kirkland Signature a spin on the location of the company’s Washington State headquarters and came to executives with a design. (“Seattle Signature” was also considered but Costco couldn’t trademark the name.)

“We liked it” Sinegal said. “We cleared it for every country and every product category that we would have. That made it simple.”

So in 1995 all those private brand names disappeared at Costco and were replaced by a new logo with a simple black white and red design reading Kirkland Signature.

Although Costco soon moved its headquarters to nearby Issaquah the Kirkland name stuck: “Nobody could spell Issaquah so we kept it.”

‘KS’

Kirkland Signature known as “KS” at Costco would soon be slapped on everything from diapers to tires to golf clubs.

Last year Costco introduced a 24-pack of 12oz Kirkland hard seltzer and a 750ml Prosecco rosé. This year Costco is adding Kirkland cauliflower pizza furnace filters and a set of saute pans among other items.

The sole private-label brand at Costco is an essential part of the retailer’s positioning with customers and a way for Costco to stand out against competitors.

Kirkland which is exclusive to Costco draws members into warehouses and leads them to renew their $60 and $120 annual memberships every year. Perhaps more important to the company Kirkland helps Costco solidify its image as a value store with quality products say analysts.

“Kirkland is a proxy brand for Costco. It really means Costco” said Christopher Durham president of Retail Brands Institute a trade group representing the private brand industry. Kirkland is designed to appeal across demographic groups he said unlike many other retailers’ array of private labels that are each targeted at a specific segment of shoppers.

Having one name signals consistency to shoppers — exactly Costco’s goal — and also creates cost efficiencies for the no-frills retailer. Costco doesn’t have to pay for different packaging and can put all of its buying power with suppliers behind Kirkland. A single private brand is emblematic of Costco’s broader approach to merchandise at warehouses: Less choice is better.

“Kirkland has a one-note strategy and it’s really good at that one note” Durham said. “It creates a reason and a point of differentiation for people to shop there.”

‘Don’t get it wrong’

Many retailers have made developing their own brands a priority in recent years. Store products carry higher profit margins than national brand products and don’t incur the same advertising costs.

But Costco’s approach is novel. It’s still one of the only large retail chains to carry all of its private brands under a single banner. Costco rival Sam’s Club in 2017 streamlined its 21 private brands into its Member’s Mark brand.

Kroger (KR) says in filings that it produces and sells its private brands in three “tiers” — premium mainly under the Private Selection label a middle brand called Kroger (KR) and value brands such as Big K and Heritage Farm. Kroger (KR) also produces a natural and organic brand called Simple Truth.

Costco is unusual in its approach to developing private-label brands. Kirby Lee/AP

Most supermarkets take a similar tiered strategy known as “good better best” said Scott Mushkin a retail analyst at R5 Capital. But Costco has “positioned Kirkland as a premium brand at value prices.”

Other retailers also sell a wider variety of labels in an effort to target different types of consumers for various products.

Walmart (WMT) has more than a dozen private brands such as Great Value household staples and George men’s clothing. Target (TGT) has dozens like Cat & Jack kids’ clothing and Good & Gather food. Amazon (AMZN) has more than 400 different private brands according to estimates.

Going all in on the Kirkland label remains a risk for Costco.

“Maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability” of Kirkland products is “essential” to keeping members loyal to Costco the company says in its annual filings. If Kirkland “experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence” sales and profit margins may suffer.

“If you get 99 things right and one thing wrong people are going to remember the one thing. So you don’t get it wrong” said Costco finance chief Richard Galanti. “From an opportunity standpoint Kirkland is known. It’s a brand.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g4bGl2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNi90ZWVuLXN1c3BlY3QtYnJ1dGFsLWNvc3Rjby1jYXJqYWNraW5nLXJlY2VudGx5LWJvb2tlZC13aXRoLWFybWVkLXJvYmJlcnktY291bnQtdGhhdC1kYXMtb2ZmaWNlLXJlZnVzZWQtcHJvc2VjdXRlL9IBpAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g4bGl2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNi90ZWVuLXN1c3BlY3QtYnJ1dGFsLWNvc3Rjby1jYXJqYWNraW5nLXJlY2VudGx5LWJvb2tlZC13aXRoLWFybWVkLXJvYmJlcnktY291bnQtdGhhdC1kYXMtb2ZmaWNlLXJlZnVzZWQtcHJvc2VjdXRlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen suspect in brutal Costco carjacking recently booked with armed robbery count that DA’s office refused to prosecute,"NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - An 18-year-old man was arrested Sunday (Feb. 6) in connection with the brutal carjacking of a woman pumping gas last week at Costco. The suspect’s arrest comes less than three months after Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams refused to prosecute him following an armed robbery arrest late last year.

New Orleans police announced the arrest of Tyrese Harris just before 2:30 p.m. Law enforcement sources told Fox 8 that Harris was apprehended in the 1500 block of Milton Street in the St. Bernard neighborhood by police Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office deputies and U.S. Marshals Service agents executing an arrest warrant in connection with the Feb. 1 carjacking at the Costco at 3900 Dublin St.

New Orleans realtor Kelleye Rhein suffered fractures to her skull face and neck and bleeding in her brain after Harris reportedly jumped into her driver’s seat while she was pumping gas and took off.

Witnesses recall Rhein being left to die after she was bloodied and dragged up to 50 feet through the parking lot.

Harris initially was booked Sunday with principal to simple carjacking but in the overnight hours police booked him with additional counts of attempted armed robbery attempted armed robbery with a firearm illegal use of a weapon illegal carrying of weapons and aggravated criminal damage to property.

The additional counts are related to a separate carjacking of which Harris is accused of attempting Jan. 18 at 8:12 p.m. in the 700 block of Howard Avenue. In that instance police said Harris entered a 44-year-old man’s vehicle but the would-be victim “armed himself.” Police said Harris got out of the vehicle and shot at the man as he fled. The victim was not injured.

This is not the first time Harris crossed paths with law enforcement as an adult.

Harris was arrested last Aug. 21 two days after he and two accomplices allegedly robbed a man at gunpoint of his Toyota Camry and cellphone in the 600 block of Washington Avenue in the Irish Channel neighborhood.

According to court records an NOPD detective spotted the Camry 48 hours after it was stolen being driven by Harris in New Orleans East. Police said Harris refused to pull over as directed and initiated a chase that ended when he crashed the Camry into a canal near Hayne Boulevard and France Street. Harris and three other suspects fled the crash on foot but eventually were apprehended.

The NOPD initially booked Harris last Aug. 22 with aggravated flight from an officer resisting an officer and illegal possession of stolen things. After further investigation they rebooked Harris with an additional count of armed robbery with a firearm on Sept. 15.

Armed robbery is punishable in Louisiana by 10 to 99 years in state prison upon conviction with an additional five years added consecutively to the sentence if a firearm enhancement is imposed. But court records show Williams’ office refused the armed robbery charge recommended by police on Nov. 10 and instead only charged Harris with aggravated flight. He is due back in court Feb. 22 for that case.

The other allegations Harris faced -- resisting an officer and illegal possession of stolen things (the Camry) -- were not overtly refused by the DA’s office. But those counts and Harris’ bond obligation for them were allowed to expire when at the 150-day deadline to institute charges prosecutors took no action.

Williams’ office sent a statement Monday afternoon:

“As a prosecutor’s office we have a responsibility to only move forward with cases that have enough facts and evidence available to secure a conviction in court. Between April 2021 and Jan 2022 the DA’s office has accepted over 900 cases for felony offenses including 71% of robbery cases and are moving these cases to trial posture to secure convictions. So there is no hesitation by the DA’s office to accept cases and vigorously prosecute when we have the required evidence to do so. In the previous matter involving Harris we were unable to accept charges on all counts due to an initial decision by the victim of the robbery not to participate in the post-arrest investigation. We support our victims and their wishes. We understand that victims have been traumatized in these cases; our goal is never to retraumatize them. Nonetheless victim and witness testimony is often the lifeline of a case and without it we are often unable to move forward with charges. However if a victim or witness chooses not to testify we certainly respect their decision and we work hard with the police our investigators and lawyers to try and secure other evidence needed. As is clear by court records our office did move forward with charging Harris with crimes that did not require this victim’s testimony. Our office will not stop until Harris is held accountable.”

NEW ORLEANS — Authorities say a man allegedly responsible for a brutal carjacking at a Costco in New Orleans has been arrested and he now faces new charges for allegedly killing a 12-year-old child.

The New Orleans Police Department said 18-year-old Tyrese Harris was arrested Sunday by the department’s Violent Offender Warrant Squad. Harris was originally booked on a charge of principle to simple carjacking.

Harris is accused of carjacking Kelleye Rhein on Tuesday while she was pumping gas at Costco. Police say Rhein was fueling her car just before 3 p.m. when Harris climbed into her car and drove off. Rhein was dragged by her own car for about 40 feet through the parking lot.

Harris is accused of carjacking a woman on Tuesday while she was pumping gas at Costco. Police say the woman was fueling her car just before 3 p.m. when a man climbed into her vehicle’s driver’s seat and drove off. Rhein suffered a fractured skull and several cuts in the attack.

According to the Times-Picayune | New Orleans Advocate while being questioned following his arrest in the carjacking Harris allegedly confessed to killing 12-year-old Derrick Cash who was found dead shot several times and left on the side of a New Orleans East road in January. Cash was found near a black Jeep Cherokee that was reportedly stolen from a valet at the Pontchartrain Hotel on St. Charles Avenue.

The police department has not released any additional details about the new murder charge against Harris.

The police department said that Harris was also responsible for an attempted armed carjacking on Jan. 18 in the 700 block of Howard Avenue. He was booked on additional charges including attempted armed robbery armed robbery with a firearm aggravated criminal damage to property illegal use of weapons and illegal carrying of a weapon.

CCI,Crown Castle,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA1LzMtaW5jb21lLXJlaXRzLXRvLWJ1eS1pbi1mZWJydWFyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Income REITs to Buy in February,"These REITs are great for those who want to generate passive income.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow anyone to own a stake in income-producing real estate. This means they can be great for generating passive income. Currently the average dividend yield across the REIT sector is 2.6% more than double the 1.2% yield of stocks in the S&P 500.

Three REITs that stand out for their income-generating capabilities are Crown Castle International (CCI -1.51%) Digital Realty Trust (DLR -2.20%) and SL Green Realty (SLG 2.16%). With shares of all three selling off along with the broader stock market last month they look like great buys this February.

1. Crown Castle: Connected to a powerful growth trend

Shares of Crown Castle stumbled out of the gate in 2021 declining by more than 12% in January. That sell-off helped push its dividend yield up to 3.3% in early February.

That slump comes even though the infrastructure REIT reported strong quarterly results last month. Crown Castle grew its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by 14% for the full year helping support an 11% increase in its dividend. The communications infrastructure company also slightly increased its 2022 outlook after signing a new long-term deal with T-Mobile to support its 5G rollout.

Crown Castle sees lots of 5G-driven growth ahead as mobile carriers utilize more infrastructure to support the faster network. That leads the REIT to believe it can grow its dividend at a 7% to 8% annual pace over the next few years. With shares now cheaper Crown Castle offers the potential of generating even higher total returns in the coming years for investors who buy shares in February.

2. Digital Realty: A lower price despite enhancing its growth prospects

Digital Realty's stock also took a hit last month. The data center REIT tumbled more than 15% pushing its dividend yield up to 3.1%.

The REIT's sell-off came even though it recently made another growth-enhancing acquisition. Last month it agreed to acquire a stake in Teraco Africa's largest data center operator with seven state-of-the-art facilities located in South Africa. The $3.5 billion deal established Digital Realty as a leading data center operator in Africa. Digital Realty sees significant growth ahead on that continent which is in the early stages of its digital transformation.

That deal should provide further support for Digital Realty's growing dividend. The REIT has increased its payout for 16 consecutive years and appears poised to continue growing it in the future.

3. SL Green: A towering dividend

Share of SL Green Realty tumbled more than 13% last month. A big driver was a surge in coronavirus cases in New York City where the company is the leading office landlord. That further delayed the return to the office by some of the company's tenants.

However while the ongoing pandemic has been a headwind for SL Green it sees better days ahead. The office REIT recently reported its fourth-quarter results which showed that the city's office market is getting back on its feet. SL Green signed leases covering more than 1.9 million square feet last year smashing its expectation that it would sign 1.3 million square feet of leases. That led the company to set an ambitious goal of signing more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2022.

The improvement in office leasing will help further support SL Green's monthly dividend which now yields an attractive 5% following last month's decline. It should also help drive continued growth in SL Green's dividend which it has now increased for 11 straight years.

Higher yields following last month's sell-off

In January Crown Castle Digital Realty and SL Green Realty all tumbled along with the broader market. Those sell-offs came even though each REIT reported positive news. Because of that they look like attractive buys for income investors this month since their now higher yields look even more sustainable over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2ZlYi8wNS9lbGl6YWJldGgtaWktdG8tbWFyay03MC15ZWFycy1hcy1xdWVlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elizabeth II to mark 70 years as queen,"LONDON -- Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor wasn't born to wear the crown but destiny intervened.

The woman who became Queen Elizabeth II will mark 70 years on the throne Sunday an unprecedented reign that has made her a symbol of stability as the United Kingdom navigated an age of uncertainty.

From her early days as a glamorous young royal in glittering tiaras to her more recent incarnation as the nation's grandmother the queen has witnessed the end of the British Empire the advent of multiculturalism the rise of international terrorism and the challenges posed by Brexit and the covid-19 pandemic. In a world of change she has been a constant -- representing the United Kingdom's interests abroad applauding the nation's successes and commiserating in its failures and always remaining above the fray of politics.

""I've always thought she should be called Elizabeth the Steadfast"" Vickers told The Associated Press. ""I think it's a perfect way of describing her. She wasn't necessarily expecting to be queen and she embraced that duty.""

Once a year she travels the mile or so from Buckingham Palace to the House of Lords for the ceremonial opening of Parliament. And when world leaders come to call she hosts state banquets during which her diamonds flash under the TV lights and presidents and prime ministers worry about whether to bow and when to offer a toast.

""She's not beholden to the electorate. She's not dependent on her latest hit or her latest movie"" said Emily Nash royal editor of HELLO! magazine. ""She's just there. She does what she does. She carries out her duties without ever complaining or making any personal drama. And people respect her for that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaXN0b3J5ZXh0cmEuY29tL3BlcmlvZC8yMHRoLWNlbnR1cnkvcHJpbmNlLWNoYXJsZXMtY2FtaWxsYS1oaXN0b3J5LXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC15b3VuZy13aHktbWFycnktZGlhbmEtY3Jvd24tbmV0ZmxpeC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince Charles & Camilla: Why Did He Marry Diana Instead?,"Queen Elizabeth II | 50+ surprising facts about her life and reign

Not surprisingly the Queen a lover of horses and horse racing used racing references as she welcomed Camilla into the family: Becher's Brook and The Chair are fences at the Aintree Racecourse where the Grand National takes place.

It was in the summer of 1971 when Prince Charles then 22 first met Camilla Rosemary Shand who was 24. A legend has been fostered that the couple were introduced at a polo match at Smith's Lawn in Windsor but according to Jonathan Dimbleby's authorised biography The Prince of Wales (1994) the introduction was in fact made by a mutual friend Lucia Santa Cruz daughter of the Chilean ambassador to the United Kingdom whom Charles had met when he was a student at Cambridge.

“Instant attraction”

It was reportedly an “instant attraction” between Charles and Camilla. During an 18-month period their friendship blossomed into a love affair. They shared a lot in common including an appreciation for the comedy of The Goon Show a BBC radio series devised by Spike Milligan. Charles also liked that Camilla was very much at home in “the country with horses and hunting.”

Camilla had been involved in an on-and-off relationship with Andrew Parker Bowles an officer in the Royal Horse Guard that began when she was 17. But Andrew was said to have a roving eye and was involved with several women at the same time. In 1970 he dated Charles's younger sister Princess Anne as they shared a common interest in horses but marriage between the pair was out of the question as Andrew was Roman Catholic.

Charles pursued Camilla with “elaborately worded love notes” and late-night telephone chats. He thought about proposing marriage in November 1972 but was hesitant about taking the next step according to Dimbleby.

Charles who played his cards close to his chest realised that he was “too uncertain of his feelings” to ask Camilla to marry him. Their last weekend together was spent at the Hampsire estate Broadlands in mid-December 1972. His great-uncle Lord Mountbatten was the only family member in whom Charles had confided about Camilla.

Charles knew that his parents would not approve of the relationship. This view was supported by his godmother Patricia 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma who later told biographer Gyles Brandreth that the marriage “wouldn't have been possible not then. Camilla had a ‘history’ – and you didn't want a past that hung about.” Charles wrote to Lord Mountbatten lamenting that this was “the last time I shall see her for eight months” after he and Camilla parted after their final weekend together.

Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles

As a part of his naval service career Charles joined the HMS Minerva in mid-January 1973 for a seven-month voyage in the Caribbean. He was in the West Indies when he received the news that Camilla had become engaged to Andrew Parker Bowles on 15 March. He wrote to his great-uncle of his disappointment that “such a blissful peaceful and mutually happy relationship” would come to an end.

Charles’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Princess Anne attended Camilla and Andrew's wedding at Guards’ Chapel Wellington Barracks on 4 July 1973. Charles sent his regrets as he was still serving on the Minerva. Arrangements could have been made to fly back to London for the wedding but it would probably have been difficult for Charles to watch Camilla walk down the aisle and marry Andrew.

As Camilla settled into her new life as Mrs Parker Bowles raising their two children Tom and Laura in the country her friendship with Charles remained platonic for some time. The years that followed which Charles would later refer to as his “footloose” years were a time when he was linked with numerous women most notably Davina Sheffield Amanda Knatchbull Anna Wallace and Lady Sarah Spencer – Diana’s sister. Many believed that Davina Sheffield had a real chance to marry Charles but this was scuppered when a former boyfriend spoke to the press about their relationship.

A second affair

Charles was in Iceland when he learned that Lord Mountbatten had been assassinated by the IRA in August 1979. It was with Camilla Parker Bowles that he sought consolation for his grief. Indeed Camilla was the only person to whom he could talk about anything. She was his best friend his soul mate and and after the death of his great-uncle lover. This second affair – which royal biographer Penny Junor believes started the year previous in early 1978 shortly after the birth of Camilla’s second child Laura – lasted until Charles’s engagement to Diana in 1981.

In 1980 the duchy of Cornwall (Charles as the eldest son of the sovereign is the Duke of Cornwall) purchased Highgrove House near Tetbury in Gloucestershire as a country home for the Prince of Wales. The estate was only 11 miles away from Bolehyde Manor Camilla and Andrew’s home in Wiltshire. The purchase of the estate was an investment in his future as Charles wanted nothing more than a “normal family life” according to Lady Mountbatten.

How did Prince Charles and Diana meet? Why did he marry Diana?

Charles first took notice of Lady Diana Spencer in 1977 – he thought her “jolly” when he visited Althorp the Spencer estate in 1977 when he was dating her older sister Lady Sarah. This relationship came to an end in early 1978: Lady Sarah and Charles were skiing at the Swiss resort Klosters when Sarah decided to have lunch with two British journalists.

There she talked about her drinking and her battles with anorexia but perhaps most damaging of the “kamikaze remarks” as the journalist Tina Brown described her interviews was her discussion of the Prince of Wales. “He is a fabulous person but I am not in love with him” she said. “And I wouldn’t marry anyone I didn’t love whether he were a dustman or the King of England.”

Shortly before one of the interviews was published in Woman’s Own Lady Sarah told Charles she had spoken to the press. Charles’s response was cold and right to the point: “You’ve just done something extremely stupid.” Lady Sarah did not realise it at the time but she had inadvertently made it possible for Charles to pursue her younger sister Diana.

Later that year both Lady Sarah (who was by now Charles’s ex-girlfriend) and Lady Diana received invitations to Charles’s 30th birthday party at Buckingham Palace. The Parker Bowles were also guests at the party.

In the summer of 1980 Philip de Pass a friend of Diana’s invited her to a house party that his parents were hosting at their home New Grove near Petworth. He added that the Prince of Wales was the guest of honour.

It was at de Pass’s house party where Charles first saw Diana Spencer as a potential girlfriend. Sitting next to each on a bale of hay at a post-polo barbeque Diana broached the topic of Lord Mountbatten’s funeral and told Charles that “it was the most tragic thing I’ve ever seen. My heart bled for you when I watched I thought ‘It’s wrong you’re lonely – you should be with somebody to look after you’”.

It was Diana’s innocence and her sympathetic nature that first caught Charles’s attention. They saw each other on and off for the next few months. In the first week of August 1980 Charles invited her to join his party on the royal yacht Britannia for the sailboat races at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. One month later Diana was invited to Balmoral where she stayed with her sister Jane (Lady Jane Fellowes) who was married to the queen’s assistant private secretary Robert Fellowes as they had a grace-and-favour home on the Balmoral estate. This invitation came from the Queen at Charles’s request. Diana later recalled: “I was frightened because I had never stayed at Balmoral and I wanted to get it right.”

Others at Balmoral included the Parker Bowles and other friends of the Prince of Wales. Charles sought out Camilla’s advice as he weighed the pros and cons of a marriage with Diana. On paper Diana had all the right attributes: daughter of an earl with royal connections and she did not have ‘a past’ – i.e. there were no worries about former boyfriends flogging their stories to the tabloids.

Yet Charles had his doubts but as the media frenzy grew his father Prince Philip took matters into his own hands. He sent his son a letter advising him that it was time to make a decision: propose to Diana or let her go. Charles wanted to do the right thing for “this Country and for my family”. He proposed to Diana at Windsor Castle on 6 February 1981. She accepted without hesitation although she had already suspected that Camilla Parker Bowles was more than Charles’s best friend.

One of Camilla’s friends told biographer Gyles Brandreth that Camilla “had encouraged Charles to marry Diana” yet Diana was suspicious of Camilla’s guidance. But Charles according to Dimbleby tried to reassure Diana that Camilla had once been an intimate friend but now as he was going to marry her “there was and there would be no other woman in his life”. Both Charles and Camilla accepted that their affair had come to an end yet they remained close friends as Camilla remained a touchstone and confidant.

Wedding of the century

In what many describe as the wedding of the century Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer were married on 29 July 1981 at St Paul’s Cathedral. The couple had two sons William (born in 1982) and Harry (born in 1984) before the first fissures in their marriage began to appear.

Apart from their children Charles and Diana had few shared interests. By 1986 the marriage had collapsed. Two mutual friends concerned for Charles independently contacted Camilla and urged her to reach out to him. She picked up the phone to Charles and their friendship restarted from there. Some years later Charles would later confirm that Mrs Parker Bowles was a good friend but insisted he had been faithful to Diana until their marriage had “irretrievably broken down.”

Charles's marriage to Princess Diana was dissolved in 1996. A year later Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris. It was not until January 1999 that Charles and Camilla made their first public appearance together. Their engagement was announced on 10 February 2005 followed by the civil wedding and Service of Blessing at Windsor on 9 April where they acknowledged their “manifold sins and wickedness”.

Chosen out of a set of eight responses the project site spans 21 acres addressed at 4300 W. Roosevelt Rd in North Lawndale.

Developed by 548 Development and Related Midwest the $38.4 million project will develop a solar-powered 302000-square-foot industrial complex. Paired with a pair of community centers the proposal will round out with public open space. The complex’s design comes from a team including Lamar Johnson Collaborative Ware Malcomb and Site Design Group.

Dubbed Lawndale Innovation Center the new facility will leverage the location’s strengths for freight and logistics with a pair of industrial structures. The two will include one building spanning 153460 square feet with 31 dock spaces on the northern portion of the site and a second building measuring 148680 square feet with another 31 deck spaces on the southern side of the site. Parking areas for 86 trailers and 417 cars will be included.

Planned for the southern edge of the site the development will include the North Lawndale Innovation Center providing two buildings for community-based retail workforce training and office uses in partnership with local community organizations. An adjoining community park will be included to offer outdoor gathering space for community residents.

Currently the site is bisected by the CSX railroad Altenheim Line which is under study by DPD to convert it to a recreational trail. This development will provide ample room for the future implementation of the Altenheim Line development recently reviewed by the Committee on Design. Access to the trail would be provided from a passive recreation area on the northern half of the site.

The project will likely receive TIF money to pay for environmental remediation expenses and the proposed site purchase price for the property is $1. The TIF assistance and land sale will need approval from the community Development Commission and City Council with overall approval from the Plan Commission. Construction could begin by late 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2Vla2RhZC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi9nZWVrZGFkLXJldmlldy11ZS1maXRzLWN1c3RvbWl6ZWQtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeekDad review: UE FITS Customized Wireless Earbuds,"Just over a year ago I reviewed the UE 18+ CSX earbuds from Ultimate Ears. These were easily the best earbuds I’ve ever had the opportunity to evaluate. Each bud was equipped with six drivers they convert between wired and wireless operation and the shells are customizable. They were also completely customized—as in custom-molded for an absolutely perfect fit with no ear tips or wings needed. But they also cost $1499… However the company soon leveraged the custom-molding technology to release the UE FITS. These are customized wireless earbuds at a practical price.

Lightform Custom Fitting Process

The UE FITS are unusual-looking earbuds. No attempt to look like AirPods here and no attempt to disguise the fact you’re wearing earbuds. I actually like the approach but that’s a personal approach. The outer shell is offered in Eclipse (midnight blue) Dawn (lilac) or Cloud (gray). My review units were Cloud.

They also arrived sealed air-tight. The reason is the malleable covers for the technical innards. You slip the covers onto each earbud insert the works in your ear and follow the instructions on the app which walks you through ensuring they are optimally positioned. LEDs integrated into each of the buds begin to warm up the material so it conforms to the shape of your inner ear. Within about 60 seconds the fully customized earbuds are cured.

It’s a little strange it gets noticeably warm (but not hot) but it’s not an unpleasant process.

You now have a pair of true wireless earbuds that fit perfectly. Not really well after trying out different combos of ear tips and wings. Perfectly. If you have trouble getting that a good fit with earbuds—as I do—this is a game-changer. A fit like this doesn’t just mean comfort and less risk of an earbud popping out it also means you get a proper seal. That’s critical to audio performance especially having decent bass. And it helps to keep background noise out.

The molding process is permanent and pretty foolproof. However if you run into a problem (including needing larger or smaller covers) Ultimate Ears will send them to you within 30 days of purchase.

The buds have an IPX3 water resistance rating. They should be fine with a sweaty workout but I would avoid the rain.

Audio Performance

You are not going to get the detail separation sound stage and accuracy that the UE 18+ CSX earbuds with their six drivers offer. These have a more standard 10mm dynamic driver setup. They use Bluetooth 5.0 for connectivity with support for SBC AAC and APT-X.

I found that music sounded energetic with a nice bit of low-end boost. Think UE Boom-series portable Bluetooth speakers and you’ll have an idea of what to expect. The company describes it as “UE Signature” sound. It makes for a pretty enjoyable listen but isn’t exactly a flat studio experience. You can tweak the performance with the app using pre-sets or an EQ.

They are equipped with touch controls for key functions (customizable using the app) and microphones for voice calls. I’ve used the UE FITS as the microphone on video calls and I’m told my voice came through quite clearly.

Excellent Battery Life

The UE FITS do better than average for true wireless earbuds with 8-hour battery life. That’s one advantage of the larger form factor. The charging case holds an additional 12-hours of capacity and delivers one hour of listening time with 10 minutes of charging. The case does not support wireless charging but does at least use USB-C.

UE FITS Recommendation

Making the case for UE FITS earbuds even stronger is the discounted price. When I first mentioned them a year ago they were priced at $249. I thought that was pretty reasonable all things considered. That price dropped to $199 which made them even more appealing although they could be hard to find. At the time of writing Ultimate Ears has them discounted to $179 on its website. Given that they have been sold out at various times during the past year they are excellent earbuds—and everything else is going up in price not down—I’d make a move on these quickly if you’re interested.

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app.

Imagine five of the world’s best alpinists—the Team North Face climbers Conrad Anker Jimmy Chin Cedar Wright Alex Honnold and Anna Pfaff—running up stark granite ridges and walls in Antarctica battling glacial approaches bitter temps and loose rock under a never-setting sun. Now imagine a 20-something blonde 5’3” photographer from Cincinnati—Savannah Cummins—dropped into the mix climbing and shooting on the 1476-foot Skywalk on the north buttress of Holtanna (8694 feet) on their expedition there in December 2017. As incongruous as it may seem in the past four years Cummins 25 has broken barriers and used climbing and photography to make her a valuable asset on expeditions standing out as a young woman in an industry traditionally dominated by men.

In June 2017 Cummins went on her first expedition documenting her friend Katie Bono’s record speed ascent of Denali—21 hours 6 minutes round-trip—mainly with images of life at basecamp (snacks stretches injuries etc.). Two months later Cummins headed to India’s Raru Mountains with Pfaff and Lindsay Fixmer establishing The Gem a 400-meter 5.10 on Peak 5400. Then came Antarctica where Cummins summited such climbs as the “Penguin” a 300-foot first ascent while photographing The North Face’s 2018 clothing line and the 16 ascents made during the 20-day expedition.

From shooting engagement photos on the Tetons’ Grand Traverse to Mary Harlan sending Zion National Park’s Sheer Lunacy (V 5.12) to Jen Olson climbing But My Daddy’s a Psycho (IV WI5) in the Canadian Rockies Cummins utilizes bright colors and generous natural light to highlight her subjects amidst wild environments. With her warm supportive presence Cummins has a knack for capturing the emotions and vulnerability of her subjects: the love between a couple the exhaustion of big-wall climbing the cold of ice climbing.

Cummins grew up in Cincinnati with her parents Bruce and Chris and brother Tommy three years her junior. (Bruce works as an electrician while Chris is a flight attendant.) Though Cincinnati is only two hours from the Red River Gorge Cummins was not initially a climber—and in fact had little outdoor experience. In high school she played soccer and participated in gymnastics but mostly she focused on having fun—and getting into a little trouble. “I would sneak out of the house go drinking smoke weed hook up with boys” says Cummins. “Your typical teenager stuff.” Concerned her parents sent her to an Outward Bound program for at-risk teens in Boundary Waters Minnesota when she was 16. The course changed her life grounding her in a calmer simpler way of being that was rooted in the outdoors.

After high school she searched for a calling working for the Montana Conservation Corps and then getting her EMT license from the University of Montana. In 2012 she moved to Jackson Hole Wyoming and began working with City Kids Wilderness Project a program for at-risk youth. Here while mentoring the program’s teenagers Cummins began climbing on the City Kids rock wall. On her off days she frequented nearby Hoback Shield a slabby limestone sport crag. As she lived the life of a vagabond climber bouncing between Jackson Hole and Lander working as a lift operator and at the Enclosure Climbing Center—and sneaking in a trip to Nepal in 2013 during which she took “tourist photos” to record her travels—Cummins became more and more immersed in climbing and photography.

In 2014 after owning a rope for a year Cummins headed to the Red River Gorge and climbed for a week straight with no rest days then headed home to Cincinnati. Here with her father she attended a CrossFit workout—her first ever. While doing weighted pullups she tore the labrum in her left shoulder. The injury afforded Cummins an opportunity to further her photography taking pictures of her friends out climbing as she recovered. For help honing her craft Cummins reached out to her friend David Bowers a Jackson ski patroller and photographer. That June he took her to a local rodeo to photograph bull riding—a crash course in in-the-moment problem-solving. (“That’s where he taught me how to shoot manual” recalls Cummins. “He taught me what ISO was and aperture and shutter speed—all that stuff.”) Later her then boyfriend the climbing photographer Drew Smith taught her how to use Lightroom the ins and outs of her camera and how to find photogenic moments while climbing—things like rigging a rope to shoot from above and the rule of thirds.

“Then I went to YouTube university” Cummins says of becoming an auto-didact. “There was no tuition!”

Post-surgery Cummins spent a summer in a sling working at Enclosure and interning at Jackson Hole Mountain Guides. As winter approached the gym closed so Cummins moved to the warmer climes of Saint George Utah where she based out of her Subaru bouncing back and forth to Ouray to ice climb. As the savings from her seasonal work dissipated she needed a profession that would allow her to keep up the same lifestyle. “Just be a photographer” Smith suggested.

In 2015 Cummins committed building out a ProMaster cargo van with her father and then driving to Utah Yosemite and back to the Red River Gorge to photograph climbing. “She has always been so good at putting herself out there” says Smith. “She’s always so confident in her work and what she’s doing.” Using a Sony Alpha 7R II for most shoots and a Sony DSC-RX100 for fast-and-light trips Cummins began submitting to big outdoor companies. With photos of Kyle O’Meara bouldering in Washington for Patagonia Nathaniel Coleman on an approach in Little Cottonwood Canyon Utah for Five Ten and Pamela Shanti Pack racking up outside Moab Utah for La Sportiva she established her bona fides. Simultaneously Cummins found sponsorship with The North Face and expeditions took up most of her 2017.

When she returned from Antarctica last December Cummins faced a new injury—another torn labrum this time in her right hip. With a potential year’s recovery time Cummins settled in to a condo in Salt Lake City. As she rebounds Cummins has her eye on improving as a climber: “This year and moving forward I want to become a consistent 5.13 sport climber 5.12 trad climber and lead WI5” she says. As of the time of this writing Cummins has almost fully healed and is back to smaller climbing trips in the States scheming up new adventures for the remainder of 2018.

In Antarctica you summited a half dozen formations amidst bad rock and freezing temperatures. What was a favorite moment?

Savannah Cummins: Maybe not my favorite but the most memorable was climbing with Alex Honnold on Holtanna—I was basically running up this 5.10 because Alex climbs so fast. I’ve never had to run on a rock climb. It also went into the shade and was so cold; I was wearing all my layers and shaking the whole time. I don’t think I said more than five words the whole climb because I was so cold. (At night I would sleep with my laptop and camera batteries in my sleeping bag to keep them from dying.) Most of the climbs weren’t rated and we didn’t bother rating them. We also didn’t know a lot of the names so the few that we did name are [probably] not the correct names—I just want to make that clear out of respect for the Norwegians who have spent time there.

What challenges have you faced being a young self-taught female in a male-dominated industry?

I feel like I’m not necessarily taken seriously a lot of the time which I think mostly has to do with being newer and not knowing a lot of things about the business and photography. Also the business side of things was challenging early on—learning how much to license an image for what does non-exclusive vs. exclusive mean etc. I didn’t really have one mentor who taught me everything. I was learning from a lot of different people and the Internet. I would use YouTube every now and then but I never took a course.

My biggest hurdle has been self-doubt—I didn’t go to school for this I didn’t know what I was doing. I even applied at Dixie State University in St. George for photography and was accepted. I met up with a friend from Jackson Andy Bardon and told him I was thinking about going to school. Andy said not to; he said that I wasn’t going to learn from the people teaching in the university. I just needed to go out and learn on my own.

I have had advantages being a woman though. Women climbers want to work with other women so that’s helped a lot. Female athletes will reach out and say “Hey let’s go shoot!” I honestly prefer it because women are nicer to photograph; they look way better. Plus working with a badass female is inspiring—you can better relate to someone of your own kind. I try to show strong women as much as I can.

How does your style differ from other photographers?

I don’t like to set up shots; I try to capture raw moments. I’m not the photographer who says “Can you do that 10 more times so I can get the shot?” If an athlete is trying hard it’s my job to capture that moment as the fly on the wall. If I don’t get the shot I don’t get the shot and that’s OK. I don’t know if that’s how other photographers do it but that’s my style. I just try to capture those real moments—moments as simple as Katie Bono scarfing down food after her speed ascent of Denali. I also like shooting more climbing lifestyle instead of just climbing because climbing is hard to make look good at this point—it’s all been done already.

What is a favorite image you’ve created in a tense real-world moment?

Just a couple weeks ago I was shooting my friend Angela VanWiemeersch at the Maverick Buttress outside Moab. I hung my line on the same anchors of the route she was trying—the crux is at the chains. [See photo on facing page.] Kind of poor planning but I hadn’t been planning to shoot the route; we both decided to go for it at the last minute. As Angela worked her way toward the top I got more and more worried that I should have rapped down to get out of her way but it was too late. I held onto a nothing hold with one hand and smeared with one foot to keep away from the climb in hopes of not messing up her send—but also to try to get the shot. I was basically holding my breath till she clipped the chains. Angela sent!

Since Antarctica you’ve been in the spotlight. What do you want to use your voice for now that you’re an influence?

There are so many things in this world that need attention. Climate change overpopulation our environment animal rights women’s rights equality our water homeless people sick people underprivileged children .… I’m genuinely interested in all of these issues and even more. I’m starting to do more research to figure out where how and when I can best use my skills toward a cause. I want to be as educated as possible before starting down this path—right now this is my next big “project.”

Langer under whose guidance Australia won the T20 World Cup and the Ashes series 4-0 stepped down after facing complaints from players about his coaching style for months.

“It was absolutely clear that no one backed him” Hayden told ABC Radio on Saturday as quoted by Fox Sports Australia.

“If you listen to the Australian captain speak the other day there was not one mention of any sort of commendation or support.

“That would have been extremely hurtful.

“How do you reckon he’d be going? To hear the Australian captain on Sunrise offer no support and commendation. How would you feel?""

Hayden also lashed out at Cummins after the captain insisted that reviewing Langer's suitability for the role was fair in a high-performance review.

“And now we hear Pat Cummins saying ‘This is a high performance environment we all go through a high performance review’. I’m sorry Pat but that’s garbage … this just reeks of being orchestrated"" said Hayden.

The former Australia opener further pointed out that Langer had won the Ashes for the side and “stayed back” in Melbourne despite the situation being “dragged on for a month” adding that it seems “orchestrated.”

“This was a bloke (Langer) that won the Ashes stayed back basically in Melbourne for the entire time while this dragged on for a month. The whole thing just reeks of being orchestrated from basically the moment all of this garbage started coming out in the middle of last year” said Hayden.

“You could see that the writing was on the wall. If I had a bet back then that Justin Langer would have retained his spot at the end of his contract I would have put my whole life's savings on him not doing it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd2lzZGVuLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL25ld3Mtc3Rvcmllcy9taXRjaGVsbC1qb2huc29uLXNsYW1zLWd1dGxlc3MtcGF0LWN1bW1pbnMtb3Zlci1qdXN0aW4tbGFuZ2VyLWF4aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mitchell Johnson Slams 'Gutless' Pat Cummins Over Justin Langer Resignation,"Mitchell Johnson has strongly criticised Pat Cummins for his role in the departure of Justin Langer as Australia head coach with the former Australia quick labelling the current Test captain “gutless”.

Langer resigned after being offered a six-month contract extension by Cricket Australia with the debate around whether his tenure would be extended swirling in recent times.

Langer has ended his stint on a high with Australia winning the T20 World Cup and beating England 4-0 in the Ashes in his final two campaigns in charge. But those were the high points of an up and down four years following Sandpapergate with Australia losing two home series to India – the latter to a significantly depleted side – and failing to win a single Test series away from home. The circumstances surrounding Langer’s exit have proved controversial with several leading figures in Australian cricketing reacting angrily to the perceived slight. some of the leading figures of the game.

In a column for The West Australian Johnson aimed a salvo at the present Australia skipper blaming him for the fiasco for his failure to show any direct support for Langer instead stating that the ball was in Cricket Australia’s court.

“It’s in Cricket Australia’s hands. JLs been doing a fantastic job he’s been there for four years his contract is obviously up soon they’re just going through an evaluation process at the moment” Cummins said. “Which I think is fair the right thing to do. We all get evaluated all the time as cricketers. It’s part of a high-performance environment. That process is happening it’s a decision for Cricket Australia and we just have to wait.”

In his column Johnson said that Cummins had failed “his first big Test as captain”.

“Pat Cummins has been lauded as some type of cricketing saint since his elevation to the top job this summer” he continued “Cummins might have delivered with the ball during the Ashes series but he has failed his first big test as captain pretty miserably.

“He had plenty of public opportunities to endorse an extension for Langer. So when he let it through to the keeper every time it became pretty obvious he didn’t want it to happen.”

Johnson believed that Cummins being the Australia skipper must have been at the centre of the decision-making process.

“Cummins holds a lot of power and must have been central to what’s happened” Johnson said. “He’s clearly had an agenda to get in a coach he wants. His recent interviews have been gutless by not respecting his coach when he could have been upfront from the start.

“The baggy green is hyped as the most revered symbol in Australian sport. But what does it stand for now? In the wake of the disgraceful white-anting of Langer as coach which led to his resignation on Saturday it stands for selfishness.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9uZXdzL21pdGNoZWxsLWpvaG5zb24tc2xhbXMtY2FwdGFpbi1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1hZnRlci1jb2FjaC1qdXN0aW4tbGFuZ2VyLXF1aXQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkzNzk0NjIuY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L25ld3MvbWl0Y2hlbGwtam9obnNvbi1zbGFtcy1jYXB0YWluLXBhdC1jdW1taW5zLWFmdGVyLWNvYWNoLWp1c3Rpbi1sYW5nZXItcXVpdC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkzNzk0NjIuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mitchell Johnson slams captain Pat Cummins after coach Justin Langer quit,"MELBOURNE: Pat Cummins failed his first big Test as Australian captain by being coy over the future of Justin Langer  former fast bowler Mitchell Johnson said on Sunday as Langer's resignation as national men's coach continued to roil Australian cricket Langer quit on Saturday after nearly four years as Australian coach rather than accept a six-month contract extension.The reaction has exposed a split between current players who have been silent on his departure and several former teammates who have fiercely defended Langer.""Pat Cummins has been lauded as some type of cricketing saint since his elevation to the top job this summer"" Johnson wrote in a column in the West Australian newspaper.""Cummins might have delivered with the ball during the Ashes series but he has failed his first big Test as captain pretty miserably.""He had plenty of public opportunities to endorse an extension for Langer.

Photo courtesy of Cost Plus Drug Company. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has launched a new online pharmacy that offers more than 100 generic medications.

Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company offers the products at what company officials say is a fraction of costs that consumers currently pay.

The online pharmacy does not accept insurance so it’s a cash-payment venture.

A consumer advocate points out however that the new online pharmacy so far has no limited options and doesn’t offer brand name drugs. Mark Cuban is feeling disruptive. Again. This time he’s got his sights set on the cost of prescription drugs. Cuban the billionaire investor owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and panelist on the television show “Shark Tank” has launched an online pharmacy for generic medications. The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company will give consumers substantial discounts on various medicines according to the company’s website. “Not everyone sets the goal of being the lowest cost producer and provider” Cuban told Axios. “My goal” Cuban added “is to make a profit while maximizing impact.”

How it will work Cuban says Cost Plus Drug which will compete with such pharmacy giants as Rite Aid Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. is organized to eliminate pharmacy benefit managers from the equation. Those are the people who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of large employers health insurers and others. These middle managers are considered the quiet lesser-known partner in the pharmaceutical model. They’ve been criticized for what critics say is a lack of transparency about the rebates they receive and for keeping a large portion of cost savings from consumers. Cuban’s company’s refusal to pay spread prices to third-party pharmacy benefit managers prohibits it from processing insurance claims. So the online pharmacy is a cash-payment venture. Consumers will have access to more than 100 generic medications at prices Cost Plus Drug officials say are often less than what insurance plans’ deductible and copay requirements would total. Cuban says he wants to bring transparency to the generic drug pricing process and pass on a greater percentage of the savings to the customers. The company will buy directly from third-party suppliers and soon manufacture its own products. An $11 million 22000-square-foot factory in Dallas is expected to be ready to roll by the end of the year. The company will sell at a discount with a 15 percent markup plus a $3 pharmacist fee.

A consumer advocate responds Lucia Mueller is vice president of operations and communications at PharmacyChecker a company that helps people find the lowest prices on prescription medication among licensed U.S. and international pharmacies. They describe themselves as the only independent company monitoring and verifying the credentials of international online pharmacies and comparing prices of the prescription drugs available from these licensed pharmacies. Mueller works to promote online access to safe and affordable medications and educate and warn consumers about the risks of rogue online pharmacy websites. “Cuban’s supposed aim to cut out middlemen and lower medication costs is a worthy pursuit given the very dire consequences of high healthcare costs in this country” Mueller told Healthline. “People are completely forgoing their drug therapies due to high costs. “Unfortunately” she added “Cuban’s new venture currently only gives price relief for certain generic drugs so patients are still locked outside in the cold when it comes to brand drugs.” Mueller noted that users of the PharmacyChecker website are mainly scrambling to find affordable brand name medicines that do not yet have a generic counterpart available in the United States. “The price differential of Januvia 100 milligrams ordered internationally versus bought in the U.S. is striking” she said. “The highly popular GoodRx coupon will get you 30 tablets for around $530. And the U.S. coupon will get you the same for around $496” Mueller explained. “But the price for the same amount from Turkey is just $40.70 from Canada $150” she noted. “Brand drugs that are the highest burden on patient’s finances like Januvia and Eliquis are nowhere to be found on Cuban’s site.”

How Cost Plus Drug got started Cost Plus Drug represents the evolution of Osh Affordable Pharmaceuticals founded by Dr. Alex Oshmyansky a radiologist who told Cuban about his concept. “I met Mark in a cold email that I sent to him on a whim” Oshmyanksy told Healthline. “He is a genuinely good dude who likes people.” Oshmyansky started that first company as a nonprofit to help people who could not afford their prescription drugs. “I had seen enough patients have bad health outcomes and could not afford their medicines” he said. Cuban was impressed with Oshmyanksy’s pitch and agreed to support him. He changed the company name and hired Oshmyanski as the CEO. Share on Pinterest Dr. Alex Oshmyansky CEO of the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company Cost Plus Drug as a public benefit corporation is required to produce one or more public benefits and to operate responsibly and sustainably. “We will do whatever it takes to get affordable pharmaceuticals to patients” Oshmyansky said in a press statement. “The markup on potentially lifesaving drugs that people depend on is a problem that can’t be ignored. It is imperative that we take action and help expand access to these medications for those who need them most” he added.

Up and running Cost Plus Drug is already in business as an online pharmacy selling more than 100 medications including for asthma heart failure and Parkinson’s disease to mental health allergies and cancer. Although insurance is not accepted Oshmyanksy says the price of the drugs is still less than what people pay even with insurance. For example the company sells imatinib the generic cancer drug for Gleevec for $17.10. The consumer saves $2485.40 Oshmyansky says. Cuban is also bringing the digital healthcare company Truepill on board to make the process seamless and assure a secure e-commerce experience as customers navigate the pharmacy’s website. Since Cost Plus Drug deals only with generic drugs that could limit its influence to some degree. In the United States 9 out of 10 prescriptions filled are for generic drugs according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However a generic drug can be marketed only after the brand-name drug’s patent has expired taking up to 20 years after the patent holder’s drug is first filed with the FDA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzAyL2hvdy10by1nZXQtZnJlZS1uOTUtbWFza3Mtd2FsbWFydC1jdnMtd2FsZ3JlZW5zLWFuZC1tb3JlLmh0bWzSAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wMi9ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LWZyZWUtbjk1LW1hc2tzLXdhbG1hcnQtY3ZzLXdhbGdyZWVucy1hbmQtbW9yZS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to get free N95 masks: Walmart CVS Walgreens and more,"Millions of protective N95 masks meant to limit the spread of COVID-19 are now available for free in lots of locations across the United States.

Obviously she looks amazing but the comments may have gotten out of hand — so she decided to turn them off. The last time she posted a bikini snapshot to her profile was back in early Jan when she poignantly talked about women dealing with online violence. She captioned the post saying “Did you know: globally 85% of women have reported witnessing online violence yet tech companies and policymakers continue to look the other way! This is why @UNFPA has launched #bodyright; a new ‘copyright’ mark for you to use to demand protection from online violence.”

This snapshot was taken right after the rising star and model rocked the Paris Fashion Week catwalks such as walking down the Y/Project Menswear Fall/Winter 2022-2023 show and rocking a black suit from Jean Paul Gaultier Couture by Glenn Martens for the Spring 2022 Show. You can see the photo of her looking amazing in the suit HERE.

Meadow has been killing it with life lately from not only the star-studded fashion shows but also saying “I do” in late 2021 to long-time boyfriend Louis Thornton-Allan (where Vin Diesel walked her down the aisle!) Along with that she runs the Paul Walker Foundation in honor of her late father which focuses on improving marine life.

(WITN) - A man believed to be involved in hit-and-run in Duplin County died after another crash on Saturday.

The Highway Patrol said it happened on US 117 near John Deere Road and the town of Rose Hill when Jose Carmen Sanchez Gonzalez 43 of Rose Hill hit a car head-on.

Gonzalez is believed to have first been involved in another crash at a restaurant parking lot before he left the scene and then rear-ended another car after he drove away.

Gonzalez then hit a third car head-on and died. The driver of that car who was identified as Dominique Evans of Teachey was taken to the hospital where she’s in “critical but stable condition.” Evans was driving a 2008 Honda Accord according to HP.

The Highway Patrol said Gonzalez was driving a 2005 Nissan Altima.

The Highway Patrol said the crash is under investigation but confirmed alcohol was involved.

Delta Air Lines ' CEO Ed Bastian asked the U.S. Department of Justice to put convicted unruly travelers on a national ""no-fly"" list the airline's latest effort to deter aggressive behavior on flights that have surged during the pandemic.

Bastian said that while such incidents are rare a ""no-fly"" list ""will help prevent future incidents and serve as a strong symbol of the consequences of not complying with crew member instructions on commercial aircraft"" he wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter dated Jan. 3.

The Federal Aviation Administration declared a ""zero tolerance"" policy for unruly travelers last year. In 2021 it logged a record 5981 cases of unruly passenger behavior 72% of them related to disputes over mask compliance. Enforcement actions were initiated in 350 cases. So far this year the FAA received 323 reports of unruly passengers.

Last September Delta said airlines should share a central ""no-fly"" list of unruly passengers arguing it could prevent individuals barred from flying on one carrier from traveling on another.

Garland instructed prosecutors in November to prioritize cases of disruptive and violent behavior on flights such as assaults on crew members or passengers. Earlier that month the FAA said it referred 37 unruly passengers to the FBI.

Delta has barred 1900 people from flying the carrier for failing to follow the federal mask mandate it said.

DLR,Digital Realty,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA1LzMtaW5jb21lLXJlaXRzLXRvLWJ1eS1pbi1mZWJydWFyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Income REITs to Buy in February,"These REITs are great for those who want to generate passive income.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow anyone to own a stake in income-producing real estate. This means they can be great for generating passive income. Currently the average dividend yield across the REIT sector is 2.6% more than double the 1.2% yield of stocks in the S&P 500.

Three REITs that stand out for their income-generating capabilities are Crown Castle International (CCI -1.51%) Digital Realty Trust (DLR -2.20%) and SL Green Realty (SLG 2.16%). With shares of all three selling off along with the broader stock market last month they look like great buys this February.

1. Crown Castle: Connected to a powerful growth trend

Shares of Crown Castle stumbled out of the gate in 2021 declining by more than 12% in January. That sell-off helped push its dividend yield up to 3.3% in early February.

That slump comes even though the infrastructure REIT reported strong quarterly results last month. Crown Castle grew its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by 14% for the full year helping support an 11% increase in its dividend. The communications infrastructure company also slightly increased its 2022 outlook after signing a new long-term deal with T-Mobile to support its 5G rollout.

Crown Castle sees lots of 5G-driven growth ahead as mobile carriers utilize more infrastructure to support the faster network. That leads the REIT to believe it can grow its dividend at a 7% to 8% annual pace over the next few years. With shares now cheaper Crown Castle offers the potential of generating even higher total returns in the coming years for investors who buy shares in February.

2. Digital Realty: A lower price despite enhancing its growth prospects

Digital Realty's stock also took a hit last month. The data center REIT tumbled more than 15% pushing its dividend yield up to 3.1%.

The REIT's sell-off came even though it recently made another growth-enhancing acquisition. Last month it agreed to acquire a stake in Teraco Africa's largest data center operator with seven state-of-the-art facilities located in South Africa. The $3.5 billion deal established Digital Realty as a leading data center operator in Africa. Digital Realty sees significant growth ahead on that continent which is in the early stages of its digital transformation.

That deal should provide further support for Digital Realty's growing dividend. The REIT has increased its payout for 16 consecutive years and appears poised to continue growing it in the future.

3. SL Green: A towering dividend

Share of SL Green Realty tumbled more than 13% last month. A big driver was a surge in coronavirus cases in New York City where the company is the leading office landlord. That further delayed the return to the office by some of the company's tenants.

However while the ongoing pandemic has been a headwind for SL Green it sees better days ahead. The office REIT recently reported its fourth-quarter results which showed that the city's office market is getting back on its feet. SL Green signed leases covering more than 1.9 million square feet last year smashing its expectation that it would sign 1.3 million square feet of leases. That led the company to set an ambitious goal of signing more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2022.

The improvement in office leasing will help further support SL Green's monthly dividend which now yields an attractive 5% following last month's decline. It should also help drive continued growth in SL Green's dividend which it has now increased for 11 straight years.

Higher yields following last month's sell-off

In January Crown Castle Digital Realty and SL Green Realty all tumbled along with the broader market. Those sell-offs came even though each REIT reported positive news. Because of that they look like attractive buys for income investors this month since their now higher yields look even more sustainable over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLWNyeXB0by1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWdhbWluZy12ci1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS0yMDIyLTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Metaverse Explained: What Is It and What's the Big Deal?,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Open up any news site lately and the same phrase always seems to pop up: ""the metaverse.""

Ever since Facebook's shocking rebrand as Meta last October the metaverse seems to be all that anyone can talk about. You've probably seen the stories about the most expensive piece of digital real estate which sold last November for an eye-watering $4.3 million. Play-to-earn game Axie Infinity took the Philippines by storm last year when players discovered that they could earn real income. Even brands like Nike have jumped in feet first to make and sell virtual wearables.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

But even though stories about the metaverse seem to be everywhere you look chances are you've only got more questions than ever before.

Questions like: what's even the point of virtual real estate? How can I invest in the metaverse? And just how close are we to living in the Matrix?

Fear not — you've come to the right place to find the answers to your burning questions about the metaverse.

What is the metaverse?

You mean you don't know?

At its most basic the metaverse is supposed to be a more physical version of the internet. Instead of typing emails or Slack messages to your coworkers or — shudder — making a phone call you will log into the metaverse and your avatar a digital version of you will be able to have a conversation in a digital version of your office. Rather than playing video games by picking up keyboards or controllers or your phone and looking at a screen you can move around and make your avatars play.

The concept could change the way people work play travel and live. Numerous companies are building their own metaverse environments to establish a foothold in this burgeoning virtual space. A lot of shopping and activity could move to metaverses from the internet and companies will offer metaverse users countless opportunities to pay to customize their digital environments and avatars. And all of that will generate tons of valuable data for companies on the side. Add that together and you can see why people think there might be a lot of money to be made here.

How much money?

Jefferies equity strategist Simon Powell said the metaverse could disrupt almost everything in peoples' lives though that might take 10 years to happen.

Grayscale the largest crypto-fund manager is also optimistic saying the metaverse could generate $1 trillion a year in revenue from advertising digital events and more.

Mark Mahaney who works for Evercore and is one of the most-respected tech analysts on Wall Street was more restrained when he said:

""No we aren't quite sold that this will be as impactful as the Mobile revolution but we do believe that the Metaverse can account for trillions of dollars of value-creation within the next 10 years.""

Am I going to live or work in the metaverse soon?

For now talk of the metaverse is mostly hype. While the eventual vision of the ""metaverse"" is grand fantastical and futuristic it's currently little more than a collection of separate virtual gaming worlds the most popular ones being Decentraland Axie Infinity and the Sandbox.

To be honest it's not much different than today's slate of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like Roblox Fortnite Halo and Minecraft all of which have been called ""metaverses.""

But Bill Gates argues that working in the metaverse might not be too far off. In fact he predicted that in the next two or three years most virtual meetings will take place with digital avatars within the metaverse.

In late 2020 Microsoft rolled out an initiative for a virtual office space with Accenture and AltspaceVR called ""The Nth Floor"" and it's working on ""mixed reality applications"" through initiatives like Mesh for Microsoft Teams. Accenture recently acquired 60000 Oculus VR headsets to aid in training new hires starting remotely through their virtual campus One Accenture Park which has already onboarded tens of thousands to date.

As for the rest of the metaverse it's certainly further away although maybe not by that much. Mark Zuckerberg believes that the metaverse will become mainstream in the next five to ten years. And with everyone from Microsoft to Meta Apple and Zoom joining the frenzy it certainly seems like an extremely likely possibility.

But it won't be cheap: investors crashed Meta's stock by 25% after the company said that among other things it lost $10 billion on its metaverse endeavors.

Of course some scientists believe that we're already living in a simulation and Elon Musk famously said ""the odds that we're in base reality is one in billions."" So maybe we're already there.

How are cryptos and NFTs involved in all this?

The integration of cryptocurrencies — and all the good ol' market speculation that accompanies these highly volatile and risky assets — is basically what sets a ""metaverse"" apart from the virtual gaming worlds that have been around for decades.

Unlike traditional gaming worlds money in these metaverses often takes the form of a native token rather than a fiat currency like the dollar. Decentraland uses MANA Sandbox uses SAND Axie Infinity uses AXS and so on. Each of these cryptocurrencies can then be traded on a marketplace for investors to speculate on just like stocks or bitcoin.

The main allure of these metaverse-based cryptocurrencies is their promise of decentralization. Rather than having an authority such as a bank or the game developers be in charge of in-game currency transfer players are able to directly transfer money to each other whether it's to buy a non-fungible-token (NFT) wearable or participate in a treasure hunt.

In most metaverses the local cryptocurrency can be exchanged for in-game perks or NFTs through a peer-to-peer market. In these virtual worlds NFTs can serve many purposes such as taking the form of in-game wearables and items representing digital real estate and offering access to exclusive events like private parties with Snoop Dogg or communities like Decentraland's ""Last Slice Collective"" social club.

These NFT wearables can sell for thousands of dollars on the secondary market and even luxury brands are riding the gravy train. Last May Gucci unveiled a virtual exhibition in the gaming world Roblox allowing players to purchase digital replicas of ""signature items from Gucci's archetypal campaigns."" A virtual version of its coveted Dionysus handbag sold in an auction for $4100 — $700 more than the price of the real-life version reported Cointelegraph.

If the metaverse is digital how is there real estate there?

There are many similarities between owning real estate in the metaverse and in real life.

Related stories

In fact virtual real estate platform SuperWorld is actually mapped over the entire surface of the globe listing 64.8 billion plots of land that directly correspond to real locations on earth — including iconic monuments skyscrapers and natural wonders. For just 100 ETH (about $295000 as of February 4) you can own the metaverse counterpart of the Eiffel Tower.

Like land in real life all of these metaverses are similarly split into a finite number of land parcels available for purchase. For example Decentraland is composed of approximately 90000 parcels each measuring 52ft x 52ft (16m x 16m).

Once users buy this virtual real estate they're able to interact with it just like they would in the real world — by building a property hosting an event or monetizing commerce and advertisements that take place on the land. Corporations are jumping on the bandwagon as well hosting events like NFT drops conferences launch parties and Justin Bieber concerts.

But unlike physical real estate metaverse land at its core is made up of 1s and 0s and ironically lives on a server in a farm somewhere in the ""real"" world. If it all got wiped out for some reason humanity would likely be fine. Unfortunately you can't say the same for physical real estate.

Ok why are people paying so much for that real estate? What do they want to do with it?

We've all heard about the multimillion-dollar real estate purchases in these virtual worlds that left many of us scratching our heads. But here's the answer to why people are paying so much: location location location.

Advertisement

In real life buying an apartment in the East Village or in a celebrity-packed neighborhood costs more than owning a house in a small rural town and the same logic carries over to the metaverse.

For example Decentraland has 39 major districts dedicated to a wide range of interests including Vegas City (gambling) Fashion Street (shopping) and Festival Land (music). Land near these districts or major roads — which will automatically have heavier foot traffic — costs much more than parcels in the ""suburbs.""

Companies too are getting involved in the fight for the most prime real estate driving prices even higher. Last year Sotheby's broke (digital) ground on a replica of its London auction house in Decentraland's Voltaire Art District and Samsung just opened a virtual version of its 837 flagship store in Decentraland for a limited time.

Land parcels are finite so scarcity drives their prices up. And so does the appeal of being neighbors with a celebrity — Decrypt reported in December that a plot of land next to Snoop Dogg's digital mansion in Sandbox sold for 71000 SAND or about $450000 at the time of purchase.

Investors are also snapping up land to generate income — whether it's through real estate development and management or a more passive stream like advertising.

A notable example is Metaverse Group which manages assets in Decentraland and Sandbox making it one of the world's first virtual real estate companies. Tokens.com which acquired 50% of Metaverse Group in October recently paid $2.43 million for a piece of land in Decentraland's fashion district to expand into a virtual commerce hub for luxury brands the New York Times reported.

The most expensive piece of virtual land ever sold — for $4.3 million in Sandbox — was acquired by Republic Realm another virtual real estate investment company. According to the Wall Street Journal Republic Realm often buys vacant metaverse property and waits for it to appreciate or pays architects and developers to build homes and malls on its plots.

And like real life metaverse landowners can also earn passive income by renting their property out. Michael Gord the CEO and co-founder of Metaverse Group recently told Insider that he receives ""literally hundreds of people per day reaching out about renting.""

As for investing in land for advertising purposes Gord likens it to the analogy of buying pixels of a website in the internet's early days.

""Instead of advertising space instead of paying per eyeball if you could actually purchase the ownership of that space and you were able to buy real estate on websites that would continue to be Facebook or really dominant networks in the world your ownership of the real estate in Facebook would be priceless"" he said.

Wait so people are actually making real money in the metaverse?

Yep you heard that right.

From freelance work to 3D modeling to pure speculation people are finding all sorts of creative ways to make money in the metaverse. And it's not an insubstantial amount either.

Tobías K. known within the Decentraland community by his online moniker Tobik is a full-time content creator who makes Decentraland-focused YouTube videos. The 19-year-old Argentinian previously worked a freelance gig managing some of Decentraland's social media. In his spare time he's also created and sold some NFT wearables to which he credits the small fan base he's built through YouTube for purchasing.

Tobías recently told Insider that the total amount he's earned each month has been abundant enough to live on.

With freelance work there are many ways creators can offer their services. People with coding or 3D modeling skills can be hired to develop NFTs or build properties on digital land. Tech-inclined players can build play-to-earn games which may offer additional purchases in the game's native currency.

The people playing those gains can earn rewards like wearables and then turn around and sell them. Users can also host events such as treasure hunts where players buy tickets for the chance to find and win a wallet filled with crypto.

And of course there's pure speculation — people buying land in-game cryptocurrencies event tickets and NFT wearables with the intention to flip them for a higher price on the secondary market at a later date.

Am I a dummy for not being totally convinced about all this?

No.

There's an enormous amount of hype around the concept right now because of investors with dollar signs in their eyes people hyping their own projects companies attaching themselves to the latest buzzy thing and news outlets writing about all of the above. There's no question that some of the people who are tossing money into the multiverse will lose out.

It's similar to any big investment rush into a new industry or technology: Some people will probably make a fortune and many will not. People who got rich investing in tech in the past or those who missed out on Amazon or Facebook or another previous Next Big Thing are all trying to pick the right metaverse.

Well this all sounds too dystopian…I'm scared!

Don't say that too loud or your smartphone will tell the space billionaires not to sell you a ticket to their Mars colonies.

Seriously some concern is understandable. We're still living with privacy and safety problems from earlier versions of the web and smartphone technology and nobody thought social media companies like Facebook and Twitter could pose problems for democracy itself. There are lots of ways in which a metaverse could be fun and useful and others that are already problematic including harassment.

After all the term ""metaverse"" does come from a dystopian novel — ""Snow Crash"" by Neal Stephenson.

7 Rachel Siegel started by investing just $25 a week in cryptocurrency. Stephen Yang

Rachel Siegel: Substitute teacher turned millionaire

Back when she was a substitute public school teacher in New York City Rachel Siegel lived in a dark apartment in the Lower East Side where every window faced a brick wall.

Now she sees sun and sea thanks to a swanky condo she just bought in the Caribbean where Siegel can take in sweeping views of the ocean from her private balcony.

Her journey began in late 2017 when a friend invited her to the after-party of a cryptocurrency conference.

“I remember walking into the room full of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and I had never been in a room with so many passionate driven people — and generally people who I didn’t think were about to lose all their money” she told The Post.

That’s when Siegel 29 decided to make her first investment in the currency putting in whatever she had left over from her paycheck — usually just $25 a week.

“I didn’t have anything when I started in cryptocurrency honestly” she said. “I was just this substitute teacher with a really big idea.”

Her investments have yielded profits in the low seven-figure range though Siegel declined to give an exact figure. It was more money than she’s ever had though not enough to change her spending habits.

“I don’t buy big flashy things. I’m not one of those people with fancy cars or new Rolexes” she said.

7 Her newfound wealth has allowed Siegel to buy a Caribbean home and travel around the world. Stephen Yang

“But I am now able to be a homeowner. Years ago I would look at the prices of homes and just think that’s completely unrealistic.”

She hasn’t yet moved into her new seaside retreat as the deal is closing now but she did just splurge on a trip to Dubai traveling first-class on Emirates.

“It was just the most lavish experience I’ve had in my life” she said.

And she’s quit her teaching job. “It was scary at first to leave that income stream” she said. “But there’s so much opportunity in this space.”

Now Siegel works full-time as a cryptocurrency influencer going by the pseudonym @CryptoFinally.

“The cool thing about cryptocurrency is that anybody can do it and I’m one of those anybodies who did it” she said.

“I was a substitute teacher with no serious technical knowledge that went to college for theater and I made millions of dollars in this market via conviction via education. I believe that anyone could follow that path if they were dedicated to it.”

Kane Ellis: Teen tech worker turned Maserati owner

In 2011 Kane Ellis was an 18-year-old high school dropout working in IT when he learned how to mine cryptocurrency.

The Australian teen set up his computer to mine — essentially using computers to help verify and process transactions for the blockchain — thereby playing a small role in facilitating the growth of the crypto network.

All while he kept working at his day job.

He said that when he started he earned only about four Bitcoins a day then worth about $8.

“I got in it from the back-end side of things not the investment side” he said. “I just realized that my computer could make me an income.”

“When I was 18 obviously I thought this was cool for the profits but then about six months into it I realized this could be the future.”

7 Kane Ellis advises investors to hold onto their Bitcoins.

He recalled foolishly once paying for a meal at McDonald’s with four Bitcoins. If he’d held onto those coins they’d be worth $150000 today.

Ellis now 29 is the co-founder of CarSwap an online market for auto buyers and sellers. And he holds most of his money in crypto.

“Cryptocurrencies have helped me live a better life being able to start my own business” he said “I’ve been able to live the life I’ve always dreamt of.”

He’s used his profits to purchase exotic cars including his prized ride: a Maserati GranTurismo. The license plate jokingly reads BANKRUPT. “As a car guy being able to buy my dream car like the Maserati MC Sportline at the age of 24 was a massive achievement” Ellis said.

His advice to investors: “Hold your Bitcoins. Don’t go into it thinking it’s a short-term investment because realistically it’s a long-term one. Two five ten years.”

Terrance Leonard: Navy man with a dream home

Terrance Leonard first dabbled in cryptocurrency in 2013 while working as a software engineer. It didn’t go well.

“I’m a huge nerd so it was something that was interesting to me” the 32-year-old graduate of the Naval Academy told The Post. “But it was so difficult back then. It was like the Wild West. There wasn’t a lot of information and I worried I would lose all my money.”

So Leonard pulled back from the industry until 2019 when a crypto-enthusiast coworker explained the ins and outs of the market over lunch. That’s when he decided to get back in with a $2000 buy.

Since then he has invested tens of thousands of dollars primarily in Ethereum and some smaller coins like Unibright and his stake has reached a cool million.

“It’s putting me on a path towards financial freedom” Ellis said.

He recently cashed in some of his coins for a down payment on a four-bedroom home in Washington D.C. His new digs feature a detached garage and extra yard space for his dog Roman. Leonard who lives on his own plans to retire from full time work this year.

“Younger me would just be crazy excited — ecstatic even — to see where I am now” he said.

“I was a geeky nerdy kid who was into computers and to be able to leverage those skills to build wealth has been amazing.”

Lea Thompson: Tech worker turned crypto influencer

Seattle-based Lea Thompson first heard about crypto in its early days when she visited a friend who mined the digital currency.

“I would go to his apartment and see all these computer rigs up and think ‘What is this weird nerd thing you’re doing?’ “

It wasn’t until 2017 that she got hooked on the world of blockchain. Though she had a sales job in the tech industry Thompson never felt like she earned enough money so she worked a few “side hustles.”

One gig involved blogging for a platform that paid her in cryptocurrency.

“I started meeting more and more people that were working in the industry and seeing their excitement for the potential this industry had just really inspired me.”

7 Thompson says her Bitcoin has quadrupled in value. Carly Navarrete/CarlyNavarrete.com

Thompson also began investing putting $500 to $1000 a month into Bitcoin and Ethereum buys gradually building wealth and nearly 200000 social media followers.

She declined to say how much her stake is worth today but Bitcoin has quadrupled in value since the time she acquired most of her holdings.

Her profits were enough for Thompson to quit her tech job and become a full-time crypto content creator. Under the moniker Girl Gone Crypto she now puts out “edu-tainment” videos about cryptocurrency and the blockchain.

“I felt a lot more confident leaving my secure day job to spend my energy in a way that feels really limitless right now” she said.

“Crypto has totally changed my life. “It’s been really nice to settle into being able to afford luxury things like even just a weekly massage.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS1hbmQtdGhlLXJlYWxpdHktb2YtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtaW4tbmlnZXJpYS_SAVlodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktYW5kLXRoZS1yZWFsaXR5LW9mLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWluLW5pZ2VyaWEvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Technology and the reality of real estate development in Nigeria,"In times past ownership of property was a sign of wealth and one of the primary ways for the wealthy to tie down their assets for posterity. Now that we are in the 21st century not much has changed since then. Being a homeowner is still the dream of many people whether old or young.

Some have posited that members of the baby boomers generation (1946-1964) own the bulk of real estate followed by Gen X (1965-1980) and millennials (1981-1996). Interestingly though one article I read opines that Gen Z (1997-2012) is finding a way into real estate investing while revolutionising the industry in the process. According to the author members of Gen Z particularly in developed economies are leveraging the disruptive power of technology to democratise real-estate investing and bring their peers into the fold. For example rather than buying a property to live in they’re leveraging crowdfunding and the sharing economy to take ownership of houses buildings or commercial properties.

While this may be a budding development in advanced economies the reality of property ownership is quite different for many Africans. Take Nigeria for instance. There is a shortage of affordable mortgage or financing options so owning a house would require more than a sizeable amount of down payment. No wonder Nigeria’s apex bank the Central Bank of Nigeria put homeownership in the country at 10 per cent compared to 72 per cent in the United States and 78 per cent in the UK.

The high cost of construction materials a drastic increase in land prices and excessive financing costs have also made owning a property a lofty dream for many families. Even more weighty and expensive are the heaps of responsibilities like property tax maintenance and insurance that come with property ownership.

And then there are families whose income is barely enough to pay for rent. Given this how can technology provide solutions to housing-related needs and requirements? What solutions could be leveraged to create better access to professional information and market insights in the real estate industry? The short answer is property technology most popularly known as proptech.

In simple terms proptech is the use of information technology (IT) to help individuals and companies design construct buy rent sell manage and make decisions on property investments. Just like how edtech adopts technology to address issues in education proptech uses modern digital innovation to address the needs of stakeholders-developers investors buyers renters and property management companies-in the property industry.

While we cannot exactly pin down when the proptech movement officially began we can trace its development back to the 90s with the advent of PC based software applications that were built for the property industry. However in recent times the proptech sector has made its way into the limelight.

The fact that proptech as a sector is growing rapidly in market size and scope makes a compelling case for the transformation of real estate across the globe. In 2019 alone global funding for proptech reached $13.85bn. Though the pandemic may have slowed things down a bit it has unsurprisingly fast-tracked the industry’s digital transformation while birthing innovative proptech startups globally.

The cost factor

Proptech startups are redefining traditional processes in the real estate industry. They range from companies providing developers with innovative digital platforms to save money and time on building sites to furniture delivery companies.

If you have ever enlisted the services of a credible proptech platform you will agree that digital real estate platforms can help to ease the process of securing a house. Proptech startups like Spleet and Rent Small Small are helping people in Nigeria rent houses without needing to pay costly upfront fees. Others like Estate Intel a data-as-a-service platform are providing data that allows organisations interacting with the real estate and construction industry to make faster and smarter decisions.

From finding a good landlord in your search for an apartment to getting crucial insights from real estate experts and making the process of purchasing or renting an apartment a lot easier proptech startups shine when it comes to tackling the problem of house availability. On the other hand there is the not-so-tiny problem of affordability. In terms of cost real estate platforms appear to be a niche market that caters to high-net-worth individuals. After all there are not many- if any- minimum wage earners (#30000) that can afford the services of somewhat pricey homes listed on many proptech platforms.

Using Nigeria as a case study what experience could proptech create for the teeming population with housing needs? How can technology help in creating such an experience? Let me explore two ways this can be done.

Homebuyers need access to capital to become homeowners. This is where proptech intersects with fintech. Fintech startups can turn the dreams of hopeful buyers into reality by expanding their access to capital through innovative financing schemes. Some of these may include designing affordable mortgages tailored to fit a borrower’s unique situation or using shared-equity financing to help borrowers purchase a home with a fintech partner who pays part of the down payment in exchange for an equity stake if the home is sold for a profit.

For those who cannot or do not want to immediately purchase a home proptech startups could explore a rent-to-own business model. They could borrow a leaf from Airbnb’s playbook that successfully helped the company disrupt the vacation rental market. In the Nigerian context where low-income households far outnumber high-net-worth families rental platforms can play a key role in providing affordable and adequate rental housing.

At the end of the day technology can only do so much without the government’s intervention. That being said the government can promote long-term policy changes to address existing barriers to housing accessibility often linked to the high cost of urban land poor infrastructure and disputes around land ownership. By setting up urban policies that incentivize strategic land allocation and formalisation eco-friendly construction (green buildings) the government can bridge the housing gap between the rich and low-income households.

Given that technology is always in search of a problem to solve policymakers and tech players should take advantage of proven cost-effective technological solutions to build affordable livable and sustainable housing.

In the bitter cold winter of 2017 British Columbia’s minister of energy and mines discovered that someone had staked a mining claim in his actual backyard. The request had come without notice or warning. If approved it would allow the people behind it to pan for precious minerals in streambeds on his Cranbrook B.C. property less than 50 miles north of the U.S. border.

“The claim is not going to pay off for them” then-Minister Bill Bennet told The Province at the time; his home sits high and dry on a forested hill with no streams to explore. But the people behind the permit weren’t looking to strike a claim. They were a group of First Nations women led by Bev Sellars a former chief of the Xat’sull First Nation who had purchased the mining claim from the comfort of her home hundreds of miles away for $129.89 Canadian ($105 USD). Rather than looking to get rich Sellars wanted to make a point: In B.C. mining permits are too easy to come by regulations are too weak and the effects are felt well beyond their source.

“Anybody in the world can stake a claim in B.C. as long as they have the internet and a credit card” she says.

In recent years that lax oversight has fostered a simmering sense of unease among people living around some of the province’s many abandoned and operating mines and the feeling has not been restricted to Canada. There are at least a dozen mining projects along nine rivers that drain out of B.C. and into four U.S. states. From fissures in the Canadian Rockies these waterways can carry the residues of mineral extraction on a circuitous international route. They impact First Nations land and U.S. states fishing communities and vulnerable ecosystems. Downstream of some mines fish populations have crashed and water-quality studies have shown levels of contamination up to 85 times what biologists consider safe for aquatic life. In the U.S. this would raise alarms and warrant hefty fines but B.C.’s mining companies are not beholden to the EPA.

Now the province is poised to permit three of the largest mining operations in North America including one along a waterway that begins near Cranbrook ends just north of Portland Oregon and already shows signs of mining contamination. In response Indigenous groups have emerged as a driving force behind a movement of residents scientists and U.S. lawmakers who are clamoring for a higher level of protection for these shared waters.

Mineral-Rich Waters

The Kootenai River (or north of the Canada border “Kootenay River”) begins in a glacial cirque one ridgeline over from the famously turquoise waters of Lake Louise in Banff National Park. It then flows south into Montana swelling to become Lake Koocanusa at the B.C.-Montana border bending like a fishhook into the Idaho panhandle and finally returning to B.C. where it joins the Columbia River. Like other rivers of the Pacific Northwest the Kootenai once ran thick with ocean-going salmon and steelhead — that is until dams started impounding upstream populations in the early 1900s. There are still some Kokanee a landlocked version of sockeye salmon and white sturgeon an ancient fish listed as endangered in both countries.

The first people to settle in the Kootenai Valley likely arrived some 10000 years ago. These ancestors of the Ktunaxa Nation were seminomadic slept in teepees wove pine bark baskets spoke a language unlike any other and depended on the river that takes their name. Today they are represented in the bands of the Ktunaxa First Nation in B.C. to the north as well as the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) in Montana. The Kootenai River still anchors them all.

“We’re not a major casino tribe that’s not our bread and butter” says Rich Janssen head of the Department of Natural Resources for the CSKT in Montana. “What is our bread and butter is our resources.”

From their reservation on the south bank of Flathead Lake the CSKT have made themselves a bulwark against environmental degradation in their ancestral territory. They have built a sound forestry department to manage their vast timber stands and have established herds of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and elk that now migrate into Idaho. They reintroduced the seemingly lost trumpeter swan and reclaimed the National Bison Range which has grown to include more than 400 animals.

Miners first wandered onto Ktunaxa lands in the 1850s on the heels of the great gold rushes that set the tone for modern-day Canada. These early prospectors tapped into stone and made camp with little regard for Indigenous inhabitants or the local environment. “They described it like the land of milk and honey but they saw it in terms of how much money they could make. This is not a new story” Sellars says.

By the 1960s fully mature mining corporations began carving the first large-scale mines along the Elk River a tributary that joins the Kootenai just north of Lake Koocanusa in B.C. Today four active open-pit operations (plus a closed mine) sprawl across the Elk Valley producing about 21 million tons of coal each year. Teck Resources Ltd. which owns them all is one of the largest hard-rock-mining companies in B.C. — and all of Canada.

Mines in B.C. produce more copper and coal (for steelmaking) than any other Canadian province plus tons of silver and all the country’s molybdenum a silvery metal used for making steel and lubricants. In 2017 the mining industry there generated $11.7 billion Canadian ($9.3 billion USD) and directly employed more than 10000 people according to the Mining Association of British Columbia. The industry’s economic benefits have helped locals — including many Indigenous employees — but these gains have come with a cost both local and far afield.

In the early 2000s proposals to develop mineral deposits upstream of lakes Koocanusa and Flathead loomed over the CSKT’s hard-won environmental accomplishments and the tribes sought to weigh in on the permitting process. “We’re not against all mining. We’re against the mining that pollutes our natural resources in our Aboriginal territories” Janssen says. “We’re looked at as leaders in Indian Country; we don’t sit back idly and wait for something to happen.”

South of the Border

In 2013 the Ministry of Mines granted Teck permission to expand its Line Creek mine in the Elk Valley advancing a goal of opening eight new mines and expanding nine others by 2015. Even then though studies showed levels of contamination downstream of mines in the Elk River that were significantly higher than what occurs naturally.

“From a science and data perspective none of those mines should even be considered right now” says Erin Sexton a biologist at the Flathead Lake Biological Station in Montana who works on behalf of the CSKT. Knowing that any substantive case against upstream development would have to be rooted in a scientific understanding of the impacts the confederation set about collecting its own data. Armed with that information the tribes can establish a baseline for water quality in the Kootenai and set their own limits or standards that they hope B.C. will honor under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909.

Sexton who has worked along the Flathead for 14 years began by comparing two rivers: the heavily mined Elk and the so-far unmined Flathead just one watershed to the east. “It’s a perfect study of what happens to a Rocky Mountain rivershed when you mine it” she says. She collected water samples and bugs comparing population diversity and abundance in the separate waterways. In the process “we’ve discovered that contaminants go farther down the watershed than we ever thought they would” she says. “And they can have impacts on every aspect of life in that river community.”

In the Elk River Sexton found three contaminants that exceeded healthy thresholds. One in particular a natural element called selenium that leaches from rocks exposed to weathering is considered especially problematic. It biomagnifies or increases in potency as it filters through the food chain and recent studies have found it can threaten life in lake water at levels as subtle as 0.8 milligram per liter. Fish with unhealthy levels of selenium may be born without gill plates and with other deformities. It can also lead to deformed eggs and reproductive failure.

Digging deep into the ecological minutia Sexton discovered 72 species of algae in the unmined Flathead waters but only 12 in the Elk. “That’s what drives all the life in the river” she says. Perhaps as a result biological diversity on the Elk appears to have been significantly impacted. Compared to the Flathead the Elk harbored far fewer stoneflies and caddisflies while mayflies which thrive in disturbed environments were doing better than the others.

Once they knew what to look for biologists noticed selenium signals flickering throughout the Kootenai system in Lake Koocanusa and even 60-plus miles downstream where the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho has been battling to recover dwindling white sturgeon. So far contamination that far down has not been deadly and the CSKT aim to keep it that way.

“At this point I’m not sure anyone would argue that there’s not a selenium pollution problem in the Elk River” Sexton says.

In 2014 the province approved Teck’s Elk Valley Water Quality Plan which established water quality targets for selenium and other mine-related contaminants. The company has since spent more than $1 billion (Canadian) implementing it according to Dale Steeves Teck’s director of stakeholder relations. “Our plan is working” he added.

But in 2019 with the company looking to expand its Fording River project into the largest coal mine in North America studies showed that the downstream western cutthroat trout population had plummeted by 93 percent since 2017.

Teck now operates two water treatment facilities with more planned or under construction and expects to be able to treat more than 14 million gallons of water per day — nearly three times the 2020 capacity — later this year Steeves said. The investment is proof of how much there is to gain and lose in the valley.

“The Elk River is the worst-case scenario you can find” Sexton says. “I didn’t always think this way but I’ve come to think of it as a case study for B.C.’s broken mining policy.”

Conflicting Interest

When it comes to mining regulation in B.C. only a thin veneer separates church and state. Both enforcement of environmental protections and the promotion of the mining sector falls under the authority of the Ministry of Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. (The department’s name was changed in November of 2020 to replace “Petroleum Resources” with “Low Carbon Innovation.”) In a 2016 report the province’s own auditor general found those two roles to be “diametrically opposed” noting that operating under the same roof “creates an irreconcilable conflict” the result of which has been quick permitting infrequent inspections and weak enforcement.

“We found almost every one of our expectations for a robust compliance and enforcement program within the Ministry of Mines and the Ministry of Energy were not met” the report concluded.

In the years since the ministry has taken substantial action to improve mining oversight says Meghan McRae the ministry’s communications director and has beefed up enforcement. But critics contend that with 13 active mines and hundreds of permanently or temporarily closed mines that have the potential to leak harmful chemicals there are too many risks to monitor.

“There’s a lack of boots on the ground. It comes down to the fact that the government has no money for this” says Nikki Skuce co-founder of the B.C. Mining Law Reform Network which advocates for stricter mining regulations. Setting out to create a map of the province’s abandoned mining sites Skuce quickly found that the information was not readily available through the government. Her group in partnership with a trust spent around $20000 Canadian ($16000 USD) pulling it all together.

The Kootenai tribes ran into similar setbacks when trying to understand what threat the Elk Valley mines might pose to their waters. The lion’s share of water quality and ecological data is collected by mining companies that report their findings to the province. Sometimes it takes years for that information to become public.

“In the U.S. agencies are working together to get a picture of contamination but if we want to look over the border for a picture of what’s happening there Teck holds the data” Sexton says. This has left communities from Montana to Alaska wondering what might be floating downriver.

“The way that these mines are built and regulated it’s really not an ‘if’ hypothetical question it’s a ‘when’ problem” says Amelia Marchand environmental trust manager for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville in Washington State about the risk of an accidental disaster. Noting a lack of consultation from B.C.’s government she worries that in the event of an accident at the large copper mine expansion being planned upstream on the Similkameen River the Colville wouldn’t find out until it’s too late.

On Aug. 4 2014 those fears became all too real for some when the dam holding back a lake of gold and copper tailings breached at the Mount Polley mine in central B.C. The accident caused by faulty engineering that didn’t account for erosion spewed about 30 million cubic yards of waste slurry into Quesnel Lake.

“We had been worried about Mount Polley but we didn’t think what happened would happen” says Sellars who lives in nearby Williams Lake. “I was just in shock; I didn’t believe it.”

It was the largest environmental mining disaster in Canadian history and three years later the province missed a deadline to pursue charges under both the Environmental Management Act and Mines Act. As of this writing Canadian citizens have paid some $40 million Canadian ($32 million USD) to cover cleanup because B.C. does not require as the EPA does that mining companies put up the costs of cleanup and mitigation as bonds before receiving a permit.

Mining reformers like Skuce have been calling for a robust financial assurance system similar to what Quebec has instituted to ensure that taxpayers aren’t on the hook in the event of a disaster or a mining company going bankrupt before cleaning up a site. The province is only starting to put this system in place. According to the auditor general the estimated total liability for all mines is more than $2.1 billion Canadian ($1.7 billion USD) while the ministry has obtained financial securities for less than half of that.

When the province does act on violations critics say it does so halfheartedly. In March for instance B.C. ordered Teck to pay $60 million Canadian ($48 million USD) for not adequately treating water downstream of its existing Fording River coal operations. Although the company was found to be out of compliance during each year between 2012 and 2019 the fine was issued only for 2012. Sexton would like to believe this history of noncompliance would quash Teck’s request to expand its Fording River mine but the project appears to be moving forward anyway.

Reforms Underway

Far to the northwest of the Kootenai watershed Toronto-based Seabridge Gold is pursuing one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines in the salmon-rich headwaters of the Unuk River which enters the Pacific Ocean near Ketchikan Alaska. Seabridge has undergone a six-year environmental review monitored water quality along the Unuk since 2007 and proposed to build a state-of-the-art water treatment plant. The KSM mine would also dig one of the largest human-made holes on Earth erect one of the highest dams in North America and require wastewater treatment for 200 years after its closure.

For opponents of the project the failure of the Mount Polley dam and persistent elevated selenium levels below the Elk Valley are proof that industry assurances are not enough to wager the most pristine Chinook salmon habitat remaining on Earth.

After years of grassroots efforts from people like Sellars U.S. agencies in Alaska Montana and nearby states are responding. Since 2017 they have spent more than $7 million (USD) monitoring and documenting contaminants in transboundary rivers with the hope of swaying B.C.’s pro-mining agenda. In the Gem State where the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho has been trying to save the endangered white sturgeon new selenium standards went into place in 2018. In 2020 Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality capped a six-year effort championed by the Kootenai tribes to bang out new water-quality standards for the Kootenai River and Lake Koocanusa. And in Washington state where the Confederated Tribes of the Colville are collaborating with upstream First Nations on their own water quality standards 25 state legislators recently penned a letter calling on B.C. Premier John Horgan to better regulate transboundary mines.

For its part the Ministry of Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation has shown a willingness to adapt. Following the auditor general’s recommendations it created a Mine Investigation Unit to enforce regulations — though still under the ministry’s umbrella — and brought the first successful prosecutions in two decades. It has also invested $20 million Canadian ($16 million USD) over three years to hire 65 safety and enforcement officials and increased its limitation period for action under the Mines Act and the Environmental Management Act from three to five years.

With these and other changes officials intend to clean up B.C.’s image while continuing to churn up precious metals that combine into steel produce renewable energy and power the province’s continued economic prosperity. But to Sellars who doesn’t call for an outright end to mining the updates are yet another chapter in a story that’s been playing out since the Gold Rush: “Most government people look at the world like it’s a triangle with people at the top. Indigenous people look at it like a circle with everything connected.”

Asked if mining can be done responsibly in B.C. Sellars says “Nobody’s ever really tried it.”

Digital transformation is a very broad term. It encompasses various initiatives aimed at improving efficiency reducing costs adding value and enhancing delivery capabilities. Finance leaders need to strike a balance between these initiatives to avoid disrupting their operations and burning out the organisation by trying to do everything at once.

Finance organisations tend to focus most on cost reduction with digital initiatives such as robotic process automation or standardisation initiatives such as implementing a single-instance ERP. Initiatives to improve quality and speed such as self-service capabilities and analytics suites are less common but arguably equally important. Low quality service is the most common reason for organisations to resort to backshoring operations.

Some Finance leaders prefer to focus primarily on low-hanging fruit and quick wins with their digital initiatives. While it is useful to demonstrate benefits early to gain support for digitalisation developing a strong base of capabilities is vital for long-term success. The capabilities required might be skill-related such as business analysis and UX design or tech-related such as adopting cloud infrastructure and services.

Building a solid pipeline of potential digitalisation initiatives a long-term view as well as a robust prioritisation approach are all necessary to formulate the right focus for your organisation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vY2xhcmsuY29tL2NyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy9sb3dlcy1hZHZhbnRhZ2UtY2FyZC1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lowe's Advantage Card Review: Is It Worth It?,"Have you ever been shopping at Lowe’s and noticed a sign promoting the Lowe’s Advantage Card?

The in-house store credit card offers your choice of 5% off purchases or special financing offers for no-interest or low-interest payoff periods.

Although that’s tempting money expert Clark Howard says this type of offer is not for everyone. He says there are risks with store credit cards like these that you may not be aware of. I’m going to detail them in this article as well as all the pros and cons of this particular card.

Table of Contents

What Is the Lowe’s Advantage Card?

The Lowe’s Advantage Card is an in-house store credit card offered by the home improvement retailer. It does not carry a Visa or Mastercard logo which means you can use it only for purchases made at a Lowe’s store or through Lowes.com.

This card which is often pitched as a quick-approval option while in the store does offer two potential benefits. You can use it for special financing for home improvement projects home appliances and more. Or you can use it for 5% off the purchase price of eligible items. If your purchase qualifies for both you must choose one or the other.

How Can I Save Money With the Lowe’s Advantage Card?

There are a couple of different ways that you could use the Lowe’s Advantage card to enhance your purchases at the home improvement store:

Discount off the purchase price Special financing

It’s important to note that these two ways cannot be combined. The fine print on the card excludes it and it is clearly explained on Lowe’s website.

Lowes.com

When you look at these options you may notice that the 5% off is similar to what some non-branded credit cards offer in cash back or in rewards points. But the advantage here is that you’re getting an immediate 5% off your purchase price rather than a reward of a credit on your billing statement.

Clarks says the 5% discount is enough to consider this card if you’re a frequent shopper at the store. That comes with an important caveat though: He says you must pay your balance in full each month for the discount to be worth it.

The special financing offers are where people may run into trouble. Clark has a warning on retroactive interest with these purchases. I’ll explain that later in this article.

How To Use the Lowe’s Advantage Card

Discounts Off the Purchase Price Special Financing Offers 5% Off Most Everyday Purchases: There is no limit to the number of purchases you can make at the 5% discount but there are some limitations and exclusions you should note. 6 Months of No Interest Financing: If you spend more than $299 on a purchase with this card it is eligible for “special financing” that will let you pay off the balance in monthly installments for six months. However if you don’t repay the total by the end of the term you could be subject to retroactive interest all the way back to the date of sale. 20% Off First Purchase: As of January 2022 Lowe’s was running a promotional offer: 20% off the first purchase made by new cardholders. The discount was capped at $100. 84 Months of Fixed Payments: With a purchase of $2000 or more you can use this card to pay at a fixed APR. While that may sound good on the surface the fine print offers a warning: You must make fixed monthly payments for the duration of the payback period.

Is the Risk Worth the Potential Reward?

The idea of an interest-free six-month period to finance your next big household purchase is attractive on the surface. But there are risks involved.

The main risk associated with this card is retroactive interest. Let me explain how that works.

If you make a Lowe’s purchase of $299 or more you can use this card to get 0% financing on the purchase for six months.

If you fail to pay the balance in full by the end of the six months you will be assessed retroactive interest charges on the full purchase amount. And that interest accrues from the date of the purchase leaving you owing well in excess of the amount you saw at the register.

Though interest rates vary based upon your credit assessment it’s likely that your APR will be higher than the national average if you incur the retroactive interest.

After digging into the fine print on this offer I found a few other things to consider:

Making the required monthly payments is not necessarily going to be the path to paying off your purchase: “Depending on purchase amount promotion length and payment allocation the required minimum monthly payment may or may not pay off purchase by end of the promotional period.”

If you have more than one purchase financed on the card your payments may not go directly to the special finance offer: “Some or all of the minimum payment based on the promotional balance may be applied to other account balances.”

Clark doesn’t like the special financing but if you use it solely to get the 5% back and pay it off monthly this card could work. For shoppers who fit into this category you may also want to consider using a rewards credit card that can be used anywhere.

Using a cash back credit card such as the Citi Double Cash could be a way to secure 2% cash back without having to tap into a new line of credit. Revolving cash back cards such as the Discover it Cash Back Card or Chase Freedom offer 5% cash back on categories that change every three months. It’s worth checking those categories before your Lowe’s purchase to see if you may qualify for the 5% discount.

2 Alternatives to the Lowe’s Advantage Card

If you are looking for an alternative to using a store credit card Clark says these are better ways to finance your upcoming home improvement project if you can’t pay for it in cash.

Clark’s First Suggestion: Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)

If the project is large enough you may actually want to visit your local bank or credit union first. If there is equity in your home applying for a home equity line of credit may be the most prudent financial decision.

Clark says you’re probably better off securing a lower APR rate via traditional lending if you know you can’t pay off the full balance of your purchase before the introductory offer expires.

“Even though they’re going to pay interest right away they’re going to pay a much lower effective interest rate than even with 6 12 or 18 months at 0% but then goes to a 25% or higher interest rate later” Clark says.

Clark’s Second Suggestion: Low Fixed-Rate Credit Card

Is your home project expensive but not worth leveraging the mortgage on your house? Clark has another alternative: Ask your bank or credit union about its lowest fixed-rate APR credit cards.

Clark says you often can find a fixed-rate credit card at a credit union for under 10% APR. He would prefer locking in that card rate and trying to pay the balance off early instead of using the 84-month fixed-rate financing through Lowe’s.

Final Thoughts

If you are considering a large purchase at Lowe’s the temptation will be there to apply for the Lowe’s Advantage Card. Here are some pros and cons to consider before you make that decision:

Lowe’s Advantage Card: Pros and Cons

Pros Cons Up to 20% off first purchase with the card Cannot use the card anywhere but Lowe’s 5% off most Lowe’s purchases with the card There is potential for high APR interest accrual Special financing offers give 0% periods on some purchases Retroactive interest due on special financing if balance not paid in full by end of promo period

Bottom Line: If you have the financial flexibility and personal discipline to pay your bill for this card immediately you could enjoy 5% off most of your home improvement purchases. However if you’re trying to finance a home improvement project that will take you some time to repay money expert Clark Howard strongly cautions against getting involved with this type of credit.

There are ways to rework your grocery list to stay on budget—buying the store brand or finding cost-effective substitutes—but constantly re-strategizing your shopping trips takes time and creates hassle. That's why it's good to have some staples in your back pocket that you can be certain to find.

Experts are weighing in—CEO and founder Bindiya Vakil of Resilinc a company that uses predictive analytics to help build and sustain effective supply chains and Phil Lempert the consumer behavior analyst and founder behind Supermarket Guru—on the six types of products you can likely expect to be a little more ""shelf-stable"" through the next supermarket ups and downs.

Produce at the Farmer's Market

There are 8600 farmers markets registered with the USDA and it's becoming a well-known way to support local growers and shop sustainably. But browsing one is a great way to circumvent the shortages affecting supermarkets.

""Shopping at a local specialty store that sources from local farms are a good option"" says Vakil. ""You can find locally grown fruits and vegetables much more easily from your neighborhood farmer's market.""

Going this route takes a little more due diligence to get exactly what you want however. Lempert says to check the boxes behind the table. ""Look at where the product is coming from. You'd be surprised that it might be coming from Mexico or Peru. Not everything at a market is local so you have to be careful.""

If you're trying to buy organic Lempert also warns you to check for the USDA Certified Organic seal to guarantee you're getting a thoroughly inspected product. ""If there's [only] a handwritten sign it's not necessarily organic"" he says.

You can find nearby farmers markets by searching the National Farmers Market Directory.

Meat from a Local Butcher

Amidst all of the production issues with meat including shortages of raw materials and workers weather disruptions and costly pandemic-related sanitation measures you'd be better off finding your cuts of chicken and beef from a local butcher.

""Foods requiring packaging and long-distance transport will have a harder time making it to store shelves"" notes Vakil. ""The items most likely to withstand these kinks are those that are regionally sourced: the shorter the transport…the less packaging required the less likelihood of a disruption.""

According to Lempert due to transportation issues many cattle ranchers have started using in-house or independent slaughterhouses fast-tracking the meat to the customer directly. ""You might well be able to find a farmer or rancher that is selling direct-to-consumer—you'll have a fresher product and often it's less expensive.""

If you're looking to find local high-quality meat Lempert suggests searching Good Meat Breakdown where you can get connected to sellers buyers and more through their community Switchboard.

Groceries at the Dollar Store

You may not have expected to find low-cost fresh foods at the dollar store but discount stores like Dollar General have started selling produce and other perishables through the pandemic to make groceries more accessible.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

""There are about 35000 dollar stores in the US and they operate on opportunistic buying"" Lempert says. This means consumer goods suppliers come to them with products that wouldn't be accepted by bigger retailers. ""The products are up-to-code but may be discontinued or incorrectly packaged so they sell them at a deep discount.""

The only issue with going to your local dollar store for all your kitchen and household needs is consistency. Though stock is generally available stores rotate through items and brands frequently. ""You might find a product that you like go back the next week and it might be gone. But it's more of an adventure"" Lempert says. ""You might not find the same items every time but you will find products on the shelves.""

Apples

Apples have avoided making headlines among all of the shortages. FreshPlaza reported a healthy supply of Gala Fuji Red Delicious and more for the upcoming year. According to Lempert apples are harvested and then go into cold storage for the next year so consumers are unlikely to see shortages in the next few months.

However due to climate change and labor shortages there may be changes in the upcoming yield that could lead to lower supply. ""We don't know how the weather from the past two to three months will affect next year"" Lempert notes.

To help you put your basket of apples to good use we have a handful of delicious healthy recipes so you can satisfy your sugar craving with this crisp juicy fruit instead.

Greenhouse-Grown Produce

Greenhouses allow a variety of fruits and leafy greens to grow in a controlled environment eliminating any temperature or water-related factors that could impede production which allows them to flourish all year round.

""Anything grown in a greenhouse is more likely to be plentiful"" Lempert says. Some of these products include tomatoes lettuce peppers herbs and strawberries.

In 2021 CNN reported that the largest U.S. greenhouse facility could grow up to 45 million pounds of tomatoes—30 times more per acre than traditional open fields—while using 90% less water. The artificial intelligence company that owns the greenhouse AppHarvest aims to use technology to create more sustainable growing practices.

Josh Lessing AppHarvest's chief technology officer said to CNN ""We're creating a new framework for how to restructure the food supply lower carbon emissions and create stability.""

Frozen Seafood

If you're already familiar with the numerous health benefits of incorporating more Omega-3 rich foods in your diet you'll be glad to hear that seafood when sold frozen is likely to remain a staple you can find in most stores.

The production process for frozen seafood ensures freshness and it's usually stockpiled for three to six months so it's more likely to be available according to Lempert.

""Most of the large fishing boats have the cleaning freezing and packaging of the fish right on board. That's one of the reasons that frozen fish can be better than fresh fish"" he says.

The Wild Alaskan Company website explains the ""flash frozen"" process they use which helps the fish retain more of its nutritional value and reduce the risk of contamination as it makes its way into your grocery cart.

The best part? Frozen fish is usually less expensive than fresh. ""You can get a better product and save probably around 40% by buying from the frozen fish case"" Lempert says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYWlrZW5zdGFuZGFyZC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtYW1lcmljYS1vZi1haWtlbi1jb3VudHktdG8taG9sZC1nb2xmLWZ1bmRyYWlzZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV84NWRiYmFhNC04MTNlLTExZWMtODgxZC0wMzhjZTk1OTYxOGEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mental Health America of Aiken County to hold golf fundraiser,Aiken residents may soon see more traffic than normal along Whiskey Road.

Simply position the arm to your liking and the (surprisingly) bright LED will illuminate the page.

Three small AG13 batteries are required and included.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utahns are scrambling to find distilled water after noticing many local grocery stores are constantly out of stock and some limit how much a customer can purchase.

Many people use distilled water for specific purposes like CPAP or BiPAP machines baby formula humidifiers and neti pots.

Just as quickly as the Hemingway couple walked into Home Depot in Sandy Thursday they walked right back out. They'd been on the hunt all morning and afternoon around the south end of the Salt Lake Valley.

""We're looking for some bottles of distilled water for a BiPAP machine"" Paul Hemingway explained.

Unfortunately they came out empty-handed after only finding bottles of purified water.

""I never had trouble getting distilled water until this last couple weeks"" Hemingway said. ""Now everybody's out of it.""

In addition to Home Depot he couldn't find any at Walmart Dollar Tree GNC or Smith's.

""I saw signs at Smith's saying because of the shortage of water you're limited to buy two at a time"" Hemingway explained.

Nate McCulloch manager at the Salt Lake office of Advantage Home Medical Equipment said that they're hearing from clients who can't find distilled water asking what they can do.

Advantage Home Medical Equipment specializes in sleep therapy and respiratory care selling both CPAP and BiPAP machines. While the chambers on the machines that take distilled water are small McCulloch explained they usually must be filled on a daily basis.

It can be dangerous to use any other kind of water.

""Distilled water is stripped of any elements anything that might cause bacteria to develop or form"" McCulloch said. ""If people aren't keeping their equipment clean then there's potential for respiratory bacterial infections.""

When clients call asking what to do next McCulloch described how he'll suggest checking stores someone may not be looking in like Target Walgreens or Macey's — and checking often.

""There's a lot of places around that may have it you just have to look beyond where you maybe shop normally"" he said.

Some customers have told him they will go early in the morning in an effort to catch freshly stocked shelves. Others will call around before heading to the store.

If someone runs out McCulloch advises them to check with their physician on what they can do instead.

""You might just have to go without until you're able to find some"" McCulloch said. ""It's a sticky situation.""

Going without is not a desirable option for Hemingway who said he suffers from severe complex sleep apnea.

""I have to use distilled water every night in my machine"" he said.

As he left Home Depot he said ""the search goes on.""

Later Thursday Hemingway sent an update — he indeed found two jugs of distilled water at Peterson's Fresh Market in Riverton thanks to a tip from the Nextdoor app.

""Hallelujah"" he said. ""At least I'm happy for a couple/three weeks.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGhhdGdyYXBlanVpY2UubmV0LzIwMjIvMDIvYmV5b25jZS1ibGF6ZXMtbmV3LWl2eS1wYXJrLWl2eS1oZWFydC1jb21tZXJjaWFsL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhhdGdyYXBlanVpY2UubmV0LzIwMjIvMDIvYmV5b25jZS1ibGF6ZXMtbmV3LWl2eS1wYXJrLWl2eS1oZWFydC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beyonce BLAZES in New IVY PARK Ivy Heart Commercial,"Beyonce takes center stage in the latest commercial for adidas x IVY PARK‘s new Ivy Heart range.

DPZ,Dominos,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L21jZG9uYWxkcy1kb21pbm9zLXByb2ZpdC1tYXJnaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's Is Crushing Domino's in This 1 Metric,"That may be the case but Domino's stock has crushed McDonald's. What gives?

McDonald's (MCD -0.38%) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ 1.57%) are interesting to compare because they both operate on a franchise business model and both are quick-service restaurants. Since the pandemic's onset they have taken different paths with Domino's thriving right from the get-go while McDonald's initially suffered and is thriving since the economy's reopening gained momentum.

Overall they have benefited from a newly rising consumer trend of ordering food for delivery. Domino's has always offered that feature while McDonald's has capitalized on the rise of food-delivery aggregators to develop that part of its business. Recent trends aside McDonald's has long outperformed Domino's in one crucial metric. Yet interestingly the market has preferred Domino's stock over McDonald's by a wide margin. Let's find out why that's the case.

McDonald's has a much greater operating profit margin

Over the past decade McDonald's has soundly outperformed Domino's Pizza on operating profit margin -- and that disparity is widening. In fact most recently McDonald's boasted an operating profit margin of 42.5% contrasted with 18.3% for Domino's (see chart below). Considering that both restaurant businesses operate on a similar franchise business model why might this be?

Undoubtedly one reason for the disparity could be efficiencies in scale. Over the latest 12 months revenue totaled $22.9 billion for McDonald's but just $4.4 billion for Domino's. A greater revenue base can increase profit margins if a company is able to keep costs relatively fixed while revenue expands. And as a matter of fact McDonald's has done an excellent job of raising operating profit margins. From 2012 to 2021 its operating margin increased from 30.3% to 42.5%. In that period revenue decreased by a compound annual rate of 1.5%.

By comparison over the same time frame Domino's has increased revenue at a compound annual rate of 10.1% while its operating margin grew from 15.7% to 17.6%. Judging by these two metrics a difference of priority emerges. McDonald's prioritizes operating profit margin expansion while Domino's emphasizes revenue growth.

Which one is better?

To answer this question let's look at what the market thinks. Over the past decade McDonald's stock is up a respectable 161%. Considering the dramatic outperformance in margins McDonald's stock outperformed Domino's in the previous decade right? Wrong. Domino's stock in that same time is up a whopping 1300%.

To understand this vast gap let's look to operating profit again but this time in sum totals not margins. Operating profit at McDonald's grew from $8.4 billion in 2012 to $9.9 billion in 2021 an increase of 17.8%. In its most recent decade Domino's grew operating profit from $259 million to $726 million an increase of 180%.

Overall yes McDonald's is crushing Domino's concerning operating profit margin but Domino's is growing overall profits more rapidly. The market prefers to take the latter over the former.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NjI3Mi11cy1zYW1lLXN0b3JlLXNhbGVzLWRlY2xpbmUtYXQtZG9taW5vc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US same-store sales decline at Domino's,"ANN ARBOR MICH. — Domino’s Pizza Inc. has a delivery problem: not enough delivery drivers.

“When we look across the US business we continue to believe that consumer demand for Domino’s remains very strong across the country” said Richard E. Allison chief executive officer in an April 28 earnings call to discuss first-quarter financial results. “It is our current capacity to serve that strong demand particularly for delivery customers that has continued to be our greatest near-term challenge.”

US same-store sales declined 3.6% in the quarter ended March 27. US carryout same-store sales rose 11% but US delivery same-store sales dropped 11%.

“The decline in US same-store sales in Q1 was driven by a decline in order counts which were pressured by the very challenging staffing environment which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours and customer service challenges in many stores both company-owned and franchised” said Sandeep Reddy chief financial officer. “The decline in order counts was partially offset by ticket growth resulting from higher menu prices as well as more items per transaction and increases to our average delivery fee.”

Ann Arbor-based Domino’s breaks down its US stores into quintiles based on staffing levels relative to a fully staffed store Mr. Allison said.

“When we look at the same quintiles relative to the delivery business we see the stark impact that staffing had during the first quarter” he said. “We saw a 17-percentage-point gap in delivery same-store sales between stores in the top 20% and those in the bottom 20%. It is this disparity in delivery performance that is driving the overall contrast in performance across our US business. The gap between our top performers and our bottom performers has widened over the past year and we are keenly focused on lifting up the underperforming stores.”

Domino’s is not only raising wages for delivery drivers but also pointing out how the position could lead to a management role Mr. Allison said. A TV commercial shows a woman who began as a driver and now is an owner for Domino’s.

“If you want to be a general manager at Domino’s and an owner at Domino’s it all starts as being a driver” Mr. Allison said.

International same-store sales excluding the impact of foreign currency rose 1.2% in the quarter.

“India once again led our international markets in store growth and opened (its) 1500th store during the quarter” Mr. Allison said. “This was accompanied by a continued same-store sales growth. We also continue to see strong sales and store growth from China.”

Companywide in the quarter Domino’s had net income of $91 million or $2.50 per share on the common stock which was down 23% from $118 million or $3 per share in the previous year’s first quarter. Lower income from operations of $22 million resulted from lower US company-owned stores and supply chain operating margins and higher general and administrative expenses. Revenues increased 2.8% to $1.01 billion from $984 million. Domino’s stock price on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $353.88 per share on April 28 which was down 5% from $372.91 per share at the close of April 27.

“We got off to a slow start in January due to the omicron surge which impacted our stores and supply chain centers further limiting our capacity to serve customer demand particularly in the delivery channel” Mr. Allison said. “After a return to modestly positive US same-store sales in February we turned negative again as we began to overlap the impact of the 2021 federal government stimulus in March and have continued to face that overlap in April.”

He added “We have action plans in place that are designed to address the issues in our US business as well as other initiatives that we are developing but that work will take some time and we believe that we will continue to face pressure both on the top line for our US business and on our bottom-line earnings over the next few quarters. While we remain very optimistic about our ability to drive long-term profitable growth in the near term 2022 is shaping up to be a challenging year.”

The company is working on several initiatives to improve profitability Mr. Reddy said.

“These include No. 1 exploring further optimization of our consumer pricing architecture in the United States” he said. “Specifically this covers our many levers of pricing which includes our standard menu pricing national offers local offers and delivery fees to enable both our company-owned and franchisee stores to better cover the cost increases we are facing in both the food basket and labor market.

“No. 2 efficiencies in our cost structure as we seek to ensure that revenues consistently grow faster than expenses. No. 3 actions to accelerate our capacity to service the demand we see and generate incremental sales growth. Once implemented we expect the initiatives I just covered to enable annual operating income margins to recover to pre-pandemic levels post 2022.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNzU4MjU1L2RvbWlub3MtaXMtYmVpbmctc2xhbW1lZC1mb3ItdGhpcy1hbGxlZ2VkLWx1bmNoLWJyZWFrLXBvbGljeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's Is Being Slammed For This Alleged Lunch Break Policy,"Domino's Is Being Slammed For This Alleged Lunch Break Policy

Fast food chains across the board have felt the brunt of their employees' backlash over poor working conditions. Back in March 2021 employees from Chipotle McDonald's and more gathered together to protest their situation per ABC. Chipotle felt some particular pressure as they dealt with a lawsuit filed by New York City over inconsistent shifts for workers while McDonald's saw employee walk out in droves. Workers demanded hazard pay or safer conditions heightening tensions further.

Domino's has now attracted a ton of negative attention due to a form that has made the rounds on Twitter. The account @f***youiquit recently posted a photo of an employee waiver. If they signed workers waived their right a 30-minute food break for every eight hours of work and a 10 minute break ""for every 3.5 hours of continuous work."" The photo came with the caption ""Under absolutely no circumstances should anyone ever sign anything even remotely similar to this"" and followers shared their own takes on this Domino's policy.

A follower jumped in with ""Our manager would CLOCK US OUT if there was no pizza to deliver. We would stand around inside the store cleaning or folding boxes until there was a pizza to deliver and we would clock back in"" while another chimed in saying ""I was a manager here in my early twenties. First a shift manager & then a store manager. I would have quit before i did anything like this or passed out a form like that. WTF. They abuse their management staff too. No one is safe. They love to pay salary for a 60 hr a week job.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9zb3BoaWUtY29sbGUtYnJvb2tseW4taG9tZS10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Her Barbie-Inspired Brooklyn Apartment This Carpenter Is Reclaiming the Color Pink,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9zb25vbWEtY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1tb2Rlcm4tY2xpZmYtaG91c2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Home's Kitchen Has the Ultimate Trick for Creating Indoor-Outdoor Flow,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

Sometimes a design opportunity rises from the ashes. And that was quite literally the case for interior designers Austin Carrier and Alex Mutter-Rottmayer of über-cool Sonoma California–based firm Hommeboys when they visited the site of their latest real-estate endeavor: a 16-acre property that fell victim to the 2017 Wine Country fires. Together with Mutter-Rottmayer’s father James Rottmayer of Rottmayer Design + Build the team toured the damaged lot and saw nothing but potential. “When we visited the property for the first time the views blew us away and we fell in love” says Mutter-Rottmayer.

With love at first sight leading the way the project was affectionately named Cliff House for being perched on a rocky hill overlooking Valley of the Moon located right in the heart of Sonoma Valley in Glen Ellen. Shortly after purchasing the property Hommeboys headed to Morocco for some design direction. “We knew we wanted to combine a sense of contemporary style with traditional building methods and Morocco couldn’t have been a better place to be inspired” notes Carrier. Mutter-Rottmayer adds “Everywhere we turned there were elements that we wanted to incorporate into this project from the natural zellige tile to wood-beam ceilings to live edge finishes.” Once the inspiration had set in abroad the designers returned with a fresh material palette that happened to echo the calming California vistas that captivated them in the first place.

“The view is so incredible that we wanted each space to capitalize on it” says Carrier. In the kitchen and main living room the pair incorporated massive floor-to-ceiling moving walls of glass that open up the home to the outside in a dramatic way that embodies quintessential California living.

Creating a cast of cohesion from one room to the next Cliff House began to take shape. “We typically always start with the kitchen” explains Carrier “as it is the heart of the home and tends to be where most people spend their time and we find that the details and elements incorporated here are typically drawn through to other spaces in the house or throughout the whole project.” For instance the team replicated the wood-slatted detail on the island in the primary bathroom in the form of a vanity.

While many of the materials used in the house have an earthy old-world character the designers applied them in modern ways. They were also sure to mix things up (for instance while wood appears throughout many of the species vary from room to room). “It ends up creating a unique energy for each space” explains Carrier.

Case in point the office-library was made to energize and inspire so the team used a rustic orange Roman Clay wall finish called Yosemite to create just that effect. They paired the treatment with warm white oak cabinets but once again continued the theme of the fluted wood detailing to tie the work zone back to the rest of the home.

Because of the natural beauty that surrounds the home Mutter-Rottmayer and Carrier wanted to bring in plenty of natural materials and colors to complement the California landscape. They bleached the walnut cabinets to a blond tone similar to native grasses; opted for raw free-form stone walls in the kitchen and pantry; and used a textured Venetian plaster wall finish to envelop the faceted marble fireplace surround.

Even the doors to the primary suite were custom-made from cedar to match the rough-sawed ceiling stained in a custom bleached peachy tone. Proving to be a true creative collaboration between all design pros involved Cliff House now gives livable beauty and perseverance to a once abandoned lot of land.

PORTLAND Maine — The City of Portland hopes to have its single adult homeless shelter return to normal capacity early this week following a fire at the Oxford Street Shelter last week.

Repairs continue on the building according to Kristen Dow director of Portland Health and Human Services.

""We anticipate the building will be fully opened by early next week. We do not have a total cost of the repairs yet since they are ongoing but we have done electrical and plumbing work in addition to a scheduled deep clean of the directly impacted area on the 3rd floor"" Dow told NEWS CENTER Maine.

A fire broke out in a third-floor bathroom shortly after 3 p.m. on January 31 according to city officials.

According to Dow the city is housing about 35 individuals in hotel rooms who would otherwise be at the shelter if space permitted.

The shelter has been able to house some individuals on the first and second floors of the building following the fire.

Portland officials stated at the time of the fire that they believed it was set intentionally. The state fire marshal and the Portland Fire Department’s Fire Investigation Team are investigating the cause of the fire.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNi9tZWRpYS9hbXkta2xvYnVjaGFyLXJlbGlhYmxlLXNvdXJjZXMtYmlnLXRlY2gtbG9jYWwtam91cm5hbGlzbS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMi8wNi9tZWRpYS9hbXkta2xvYnVjaGFyLXJlbGlhYmxlLXNvdXJjZXMtYmlnLXRlY2gtbG9jYWwtam91cm5hbGlzbQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Klobuchar: Local media needs to be able to compete with Big Tech for ad dollars,"New York CNN —

Lawmakers are trying to find a solution to two intertwined trends: the rise of Big Tech and the decimation of local news.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar chaired a hearing on Capitol Hill last week to address the challenge and is advancing legislation that would attempt to give local news outlets more leverage against Big Tech companies like Google and Meta.

As the tech giants continue to thrive off digital ad revenue the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act would allow news outlets regardless of size to collectively bargain with advertisers strengthening their negotiating position against Big Tech.

Klobuchar’s father Jim Klobuchar had a long career as a local news journalist in the Midwest working as a sportswriter and popular columnist in her home state of Minnesota.

“Growing up newspapers the First Amendment was everything” Klobuchar said on “Reliable Sources” Sunday.

And over those years Klobuchar said she saw many local newspapers merge or close down. But none of that happened at nearly the rate seen over the past decade following the advent of digital news.

Between 2005 and 2021 roughly 2200 local US newspapers shutdown according to the Washington Post. And while companies like Google’s parent Alphabet have now surpassed $200 billion in annual revenue local newspapers’ ad revenue declined from $37 billion in 2018 to less than $9 billion in 2021 according to Pew Research.

Google generated those incredible earnings due mainly to market forces — but Klobuchar thinks that lawmakers and regulators can rein in Big Tech to give print and local media outlets a fighting chance to survive and compete.

“All we’re doing is saying big small people should be able to negotiate with these platforms together” Klobuchar said. “So you don’t have some small newspaper in Lanesboro Minnesota trying to do it by themselves.”

CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter raised concerns that the bill won’t get a floor vote but Klobuchar noted that the proposal does have bipartisan support including from Sen. Ken Buck (R-Col.) and Sen. John Kennedy (R-La).

“What unites us is a view that we must continue to rejuvenate America’s economy” Klobuchar said. “We must push for competition and allow for competition.”

Klobuchar noted that she is not an opponent of Big Tech and pointed out that she uses products and services from the tech giants including Fitbit and an iPhone. “I’m not a Neanderthal” the senator quipped but she stressed that there needs to be rules of the road to prevent “anti-democracy behavior” to allow local news organizations to generate vital ad revenue.

“That is not what was envisioned by the founders of our country” Klobuchar said. “I don’t want to stop these companies from existing. I just know that we have to make sure their platforms are fair to allow for competition.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWppd29ybGQuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9uZXdzL25ld3NEaXNwbGF5P25ld3NJRD05MjMxNTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Foreign govt' hacked WSJ New York Post Dow Jones: News Corp,

Last year the coronavirus pandemic forced the convention to move to May but plans for the 2022 edition are full steam ahead for the event to take place Feb. 18 through 20.

The event is centered around the Pensacola Bay Center at 201 E. Gregory St. which will house things like a vendor floor an artist alley and several spots for celebrity meet and greets and photos.

On Friday Feb. 18 the arena will open at 1 p.m. and stay open until 8 p.m. Then on Saturday Feb. 19 and Sunday Feb. 20 it will open at 10 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. and 5 p.m. respectively.

As visitors make their way into the area they will be greeted by the vendor floor. Pensacon Marketing and Media Director Julio Diaz said the space will feature various original creations from items like customized swords glass and leather to classic comic books and Funko Pops.

Pensacon typically pulls in about 10000 people per day according to Diaz and this year they hope to build on that.

""We are obviously hoping to do that or do better. I think we have as strong a lineup as we've ever had if not the strongest lineup we've ever had. So there certainly is nothing holding back from getting the bang for your buck"" Diaz said.

Three-day passes are selling for $85 and one-day passes are $35 for Friday $45 for Saturday and $40 for Sunday. Children under 10 get in free.

On the third floor of the arena you will find Artist Alley where comic book artists and authors as well as traditional authors can be found.

Invited guests will be placed all around the Bay Center eager to meet guests at one of the four celebrity autograph zones.

""If you haven't found the person you're looking for they're probably in one of the other autograph areas"" Diaz said. ""And we're going to try to publish a list of who's where once we get closer to the show.""

Several invited guests told the News Journal that they are excited to spend time at the Pensacola event and look forward to meeting people who have similar interests to them.

""(Attendees) need to understand that the show is geared around them. It's there for them"" said Rob Paulsen who is known for voicing animated characters on ""Animaniacs"" ""The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.""

""And in this day and age it's now cool to go to a convention. It's cool to cosplay. It's cool to have geeky interests and hobbies"" Paulsen added.

Another guest Daniel Ross — who has voiced the likes of Donald Duck and Lucky Charms' mascot Lucky the Leprechaun — said he feels grateful to share positive experiences with colleagues and fans at events like Pensacon.

""I just go back into thinking about the fact that I get to play in the sandbox with these different things that influenced me as a person"" Ross said. ""And so to be now in a position to give that back to the next generation and be the person to give them that positive energy is really meaningful to me.""

What's there to do at Pensacon?

Poseidon's Bay will sit just outside the Bay Center and will feature a stage with live music and dance throughout the weekend including the Emerald Coast Honors Orchestra. On Sunday it will also play host to a children's costume contest.

""So a lot of different entertainment there. Our food truck vendors will be out there. So are a number of community groups. A number of sponsors will have tents out there"" Diaz said. ""We're going to have some kids activities out there as well. I know we're going to have some bounce houses and things like that.""

Several venues around the city will also house special events such as panels throughout the weekend. Diaz said the scheduling and topics at the special events will be announced soon but the participating locations are:

Museum of Commerce 201 E. Zaragoza St.

Court of De Luna Event Space 116 E. Gonzalez St.

Voices of Pensacola 117 E. Government St.

UWF Historic Trust Bowden Building 120 Church St.

Pensacola Cultural Center 400 S. Jefferson St.

The REX Theatre 18 N. Palafox St.

The Court of De Luna Event Space will also play a key role throughout Pensacon. During the week leading up to the event visitors can get their passes early at the venue. Specific dates and times will be released soon.

Saturday night the De Luna Event Space will welcome a costume contest which starts at 7 p.m. and runs for about two hours and a 1990s themed afterparty. Joey Fatone former member of NSYNC will MC and rapper Young MC will also perform.

The costume contest portion of the event will be family friendly.

""It's actually in a place where we could keep the bars away from the kids. So we welcome all ages"" Diaz said.

A trolley system will run to the various venues throughout the weekend. It is free for all passholders.

As of Friday over 100 guests are set to attend the event:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vYmF0b25fcm91Z2UvbmV3cy93aXRoLTEtMDAwcy1vZi1uZXctaG9tZXMtcGxhbm5lZC1uZWFyLXphY2hhcnktc29tZS13b3JyeS1hYm91dC1zY2hvb2xzLXRyYWZmaWMtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUvYXJ0aWNsZV83NGE4MDM5MC03ZmFmLTExZWMtOGI0Zi05N2Q2MDUyMmZhMjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With 1000s of new homes planned near Zachary some worry about schools traffic infrastructure,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The Riverview landfill soon will begin producing natural gas and the city will get a portion of the money generated from its sale to customers.

On Monday night the City Council held a special meeting to approve an amended landfill gas rights agreement with Riverview Energy Systems for a new project that will convert landfill gas into pipeline quality natural gas.

“Riverview is going to benefit tremendously from this” Mayor Andrew Swift said after the council came out of closed session to approve the agreement. “I don’t know how else to say it. This is a big deal for Riverview.”

Decaying trash produces methane used as a source of renewable energy that can be used to produce compressed natural gas.

The DTE Biomass Gas to Electricity Plant had been operating at the Riverview Land Preserve for many years under an agreement with the city of Riverview.

“The city currently has a gas rights agreement with RES for their electric generation plant on the landfill property” City Manager Douglas Drysdale said. “This will replace that agreement. We’ve been working on this project over the past five years with multiple developers. We are very pleased to continue partnering with RES on these types of projects.”

City officials said this agreement was made possible only through the dedication and persistence of many people. Drysdale thanked his team: Rob McMahon Jeff Dobek Randy Pentiuk Alyssa Gunsorek and Jennifer Bowyer for their hard work in putting this together.

Swift said the council’s landfill committee had been working for this type of agreement since 2016.

He thanked former council members Elmer Trombley James Trombley and Thomas Coffey; as well as current Councilman Dean Workman who were the original members of the landfill committee who laid the groundwork for this agreement.

“Riverview will financially benefit from it” Swift said.

According to Drysdale the royalties earned on this agreement will be used to fund the city’s unfunded OPEB (retiree health care) liability without having an impact on residents’ property taxes.

Because there are many unknown variables that can and probably will affect the profitability of this project city officials said it’s impossible to say with any degree of certainty how much money it will generate.

However they do know the least amount the city will earn on an annual basis.

“Under the agreement we receive an annual minimum payment of $400000” Drysdale said.

So how much of an impact will that have on the city’s unfunded liability?

According to the city’s latest audit report as of June 30 2021 its OPEB liability is $28182597. Drysdale said the city has set aside $466305 resulting in a net liability of $27716292.

“City Council dedicated revenues from this project to fund the OPEB liability” Drysdale said. “This project will not fully fund the liability but will start setting a larger amount aside to fund it quicker.”

For reference the state of Michigan approved the city’s Corrective Action Plan which includes a $200000 per year contribution. Drysdale said money the city receives from this project will speed up the funding process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbm9jYW1lbHMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvaXNyYWVsLWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGUtZHJpdmUtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWxlY3RyZW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israeli Electric Vehicle Firm Builds US Road To Charge Cars While They Drive,"ElectReon the Israeli startup that provides wireless and in-road electric vehicle (EV) charging technology is set to deploy its first public wireless EV charging road system in the US. The electric road startup will establish wireless charging tech in Detroit Michigan.

The company announced last week they had won a request for proposal (RFP) to build an Electric Road System (ERS) in Detroit as part of the inductive vehicle charging pilot program in partnership with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification (OFME) and the Michigan Economic Development Corp. (MEDC).

The wireless charging infrastructure will support a suite of use cases involving various vehicle types and partners including autonomous vehicles. It will be implemented in the Michigan Central district as part of the Inductive Vehicle Charging Pilot initiative that Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced last year.

The Tel Aviv-based startup is working with companies like Detroit mobility tech firm Next Energy carmaker Ford Motor Company diversified energy company DTE and technical professional services firm. Jacobs Engineering Group to make the project happen.

Detroit is known as the center of the US automobile industry and the “Big Three” auto manufacturers General Motors Ford and Stellantis North America are all headquartered in metropolitan Detroit. Detroit has taken on the nickname Motor City because its automotive industry provided the model for mass production that was later adopted by other industries.

The electrified road will stretch up to a mile long and will be located near Detroit’s Michigan Central Terminal an abandoned train station that Ford is converting into a mobility innovation district. The state of Michigan plans to contribute $1.9 million to the project which ElectReon said will be fully functional by 2023.

The roadway will charge electric vehicles whether they’re in motion or at a stop through a process called inductive charging which uses a magnetic frequency to transfer power from metal coils that are buried under the road to a special receiver on the underside of the EV.

“Hosting the first wireless charging road system in the US as part of the open platform we are providing at Michigan Central will serve as a magnet to attract innovators to test on this nationally significant asset joining in the work with ElectReon Next Energy and many others and also show people the value electrification can create” said Carolina Pluszcynski the Michigan Central development director.

“We are excited to actively work with ElectReon and source pilot opportunities with such innovators to leverage the open wireless charging system” she adds.

“This is a monumental step towards expanding our U.S. presence and team and it’s exciting to start in the birthplace of the modern automobile industry. We plan to build on ElectReon’s proven track record of success globally and demonstrate its ability to help the U.S. realize its electrification and emissions reduction goals” said Oren Ezer CEO of ElectReon.

Debut in the US

Founded in 2013 ElectReon has developed a system to charge electric vehicles (EVs) while in full motion using copper coils placed under the middle lane of the road. The coils are covered by the pavement and powered by an underground system with charging performed by a receiver or multiple receivers installed under the vehicle. Instead of carrying heavy batteries with a limited driving range and a short lifespan electric vehicles would receive continuous power while being driven on these smart roads.

The company’s goal is to allow EVs to carry smaller batteries or maybe none at all making them lighter and more efficient as well as reducing the environmental costs of battery production.

ElectReon made its official entrance into the US market with the opening of the company’s Los Angeles office and the addition of Corey Johnson former speaker of the New York City Council as a strategic consultant to the New York region.

“We are excited to enter the US market and collaborate with industry leaders to further enhance the country’s mobility ecosystem” said Stefan Tongur vice president of business development for ElectReon in the US “Michigan’s automotive industry roots built a foundation for mobility innovation and we’re thrilled to join this community of experts. We are looking forward to collaborating with departments of transportation state and municipal agencies and automotive and mobility industry innovators in Michigan California and New York on charging infrastructure that’s vehicle agnostic and can be included in any electric vehicle. Our technology has the potential to support electric fleets of all types from public transit buses to delivery vans and long-haul trucks for logistics.”

Ongoing partnerships Europe and Israel

ElectReon has a number of partnerships in Europe in France Belgium Germany and Sweden to pilot its smart road tech with long-haul trucks as well as a program in Tel Aviv with the Dan Bus Company for wireless charging of electric buses.

The pilot in Tel Aviv is the first of its kind in Israel and will be carried out between Tel Aviv University Railway Station and Klatzkin Terminal in Ramat Aviv – a two-kilometer route including 600 meters of electric road.

The Tel Aviv pilot project will enable specially-equipped electric buses capable of being charged directly from under-road electric infrastructure to travel on the route. Within two months following the completion of tests and integration of the technology an electric bus will commence regular journeys on the route serving passengers traveling to Tel Aviv University.

In December the inductive charging tech provider announced the launch of the “Arena of the Future” project in Brescia Italy where the company has integrated its wireless technology to charge an IVECO bus and Stellantis’s Fiat Nuova 500 passenger vehicle while driving. This project is demonstrating contactless charging for a range of EVs as they drive on highways and toll roads as a potential pathway to decarbonizing long-haul transportation systems along motorway transport corridors a statement from the company said.

The construction and technical implementation of the 1050-metre-long circuit equipped with ElectReon’s proprietary in-road charging coils and supported by 1MW of electrical power have been successfully completed the company said.

In August ElectReon announced former Israeli president Reuven Rivlin would join the startup as company president.

ElectReon was also listed in the transportation category of the TIME annual compilation of “100 Best Inventions.” It was one of four Israeli companies that made the list.

“As we rapidly scale our deployments around the world we envision this technology to play a key role in accelerating the mass transition toward total electrification and we look forward to continuing to build the transportation infrastructure of tomorrow with the ongoing outstanding support from our industry and governmental partners we have experienced until now” said Ezer in November.",,,,,,,,,

Karn generating station on the shore of Saginaw Bay.

But shutting down the 544-megawatt plant doesn’t eliminate almost $700 million in unrecovered investments in Karn — costs that will fall to the utility’s 1.8 million customers even after the plant is no longer generating electricity.

A recent decision by the Michigan Public Service Commission aims to help. Regulators voted last month to allow Consumers Energy to refinance the unrecovered investments with low-interest ratepayer-backed bonds — a move expected to save customers $126 million over the next eight years and at least indirectly ease the shift away from coal.

It is the second time the PSC has approved such a refinancing to reduce costs related to unrecovered investments in shuttered coal plants.

The refinancing known as securitization is allowed in Michigan under a law adopted in 2000 as the state’s utility industry was undergoing a transition to deregulation. Today the financial tool is being used to help out with a different industry shift as utilities seek to replace older fossil plants with carbon-free energy.

And like a 1990s fad that’s suddenly cool again securitization is a hot topic in statehouses across the country.

Twenty-five states plus Washington and Puerto Rico have securitization laws in place. The list includes Colorado New Mexico and Montana all of which passed legislation in recent years to allow for the refinancing of unrecovered coal plant investments.

Securitization legislation was pre-filed in Missouri last month and bills are expected in Kansas and Minnesota in the coming weeks. The idea is also getting a close look in Indiana.

In each case the policy is getting traction among consumer groups utilities and environmental advocates alike all of which see potential benefits.

""We need to address this issue of legacy investments and how to make the transition and do it in a way that creates a win for both investors and customers"" said Ashok Gupta a senior energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Gupta became familiar with securitization working in New York 25 years ago when the state was restructuring its retail electric market and grappling with how to handle so-called stranded costs — utility power plant investments that might go unrecovered in a competitive market.

Now in the Midwest he’s advocating for adoption of the policy tool in Missouri and Kansas states where the big utilities still own more than 10 gigawatts of coal-fired generation.

While NRDC’s primary interest is addressing climate change Gupta stresses that securitization isn’t about shutting down coal plants. Rather it’s a financial tool to more broadly manage costs and deal with industry transitions.

And in deep-red states saving consumers money and improving the business climate is a better selling point than cutting carbon.

""This is near-term savings that you can create. You can get real benefits for consumers right now"" Gupta said. ""I’m willing to be the co-benefit.""

A ‘deal breaker’

Securitization has been used for years to help manage a variety of challenges in the utility industry.

In Florida it was used to help blunt the rate impact when the grid was rebuilt following hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 and again years later to mitigate the effect of the early retirement of a Duke Energy Corp. nuclear reactor. The California Legislature more recently passed a bill to let utilities securitize costs related to COVID-19.

Securitization was also recently approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to lower the costs associated with $100 million of unrecovered investments in We Energies’ Pleasant Prairie coal plant which shut down in 2018.

While the topic of securitization has seized the attention of policymakers supporters acknowledge it’s a complex issue.

It also is reemerging as legislators grapple with more pressing issues such as the pandemic. Also getting utilities and consumer interests to sign off on details of securitization legislation is akin to threading a needle. A policy that too heavily favors one side or the other can be a deal breaker.

St. Louis-based Ameren Missouri and Evergy headquartered in Kansas City Mo. have previously opposed securitization bills in Missouri and in Kansas. But at least one of the utilities has since changed its stance.

""We believe there is a desire for this important tool and will be supporting securitization legislation this year in both states"" Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said in an emailed statement.

The utilities have proposed billions of dollars in renewable energy investments and are thought to be more receptive to the idea since accelerating retirements of older fossil units would create room for new capacity.

Warren Wood a vice president for Ameren Missouri who oversees legislative and regulatory policy development said the utility doesn’t need securitization to green its power mix over the next two decades. But he said it could be a ""useful tool."" If done right ""all of the parties can come out ahead"" he said. ""This is achievable.""

It’s not just utilities that have warmed to the idea. Kansas’ top utility regulator has also weighed in to support securitization legislation saying the policy had benefits for all utilities and consumers alike.

""Hopefully everybody will sharpen their pencils and get serious about it"" Kansas Corporation Commission Chair Susan Duffy said during an energy conference presentation last month.

A key for utilities generally is that they be allowed to share in the benefits by reinvesting at least some portion of the amount of rate base that’s wiped out — investments on which their shareholders can profit.

It’s a practice referred to as ""capital recycling"" and is a key consideration for utility shareholders.

Consumer groups too see potential benefits in securitization but also pitfalls.

State Rep. Jamie Long (D). | Minnesota House of Representatives

David Woodsmall a lobbyist for the Midwest Energy Consumers Group whose members include some of the state’s largest commercial and industrial energy users said utilities should be allowed to recover investments in power plants that are shut down ahead of schedule.

But allowing utilities to earn any kind of return on amounts that are securitized is a ""deal breaker"" he said.

In Minnesota state Rep. Jamie Long (D) the incoming chair of the Energy and Climate Finance and Policy Division Committee has been interested in the topic for a couple of years. He introduced legislation in the House last year. But a COVID-19-shortened session kept the bill from being heard.

Long plans to introduce a bill in the coming weeks to allow securitization which he said can benefit consumers and also local communities that are home to older retiring coal-fired plants and the associated workers who will lose their jobs.

""I think that’s a key piece of the clean energy transition"" he said in an interview. ""I’m definitely interested in reintroducing the bill and moving forward with a full hearing.""

Which coal plants might retire?

Minnesota has been a leader among Midwestern states in reducing its dependence on coal-fired generation. The state today has just four coal plants still running and one of them — the 150 MW Hoot Lake plant — is set to shut down this year.

Two Xcel Energy Inc. coal plants totaling more than 2700 MW are set to be retired between 2023 and 2028 and some of the existing units are operated seasonally as of last year.

Only one Minnesota coal plant doesn’t have an early retirement date: the last two units at Minnesota Power’s 823 MW Boswell plant. Two older units shut down in 2018.

But that could change. Minnesota Power is due to file its 15-year integrated resource plan with the state Public Utilities Commission on Feb. 1. The Duluth Minn.-based utility a unit of Allete Inc. became the first utility in the state to reach 50% renewable energy last month and is planning further steps to slash carbon emissions.

Along with it Minnesota Power is required to file a study evaluating the potential for retiring Boswell early as well as the second phase of a study being conducted with the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) on the possible use of securitization if there’s a decision to shut down the plant. The first phase was filed in October.

Julie Pierce the utility’s vice president of strategy and planning said there are myriad considerations when looking at the plant’s future not the least of which is reliability of the grid in the Upper Plains. Ratepayer impact is also key she said.

As of last fall there was $780 million left to be paid off on the Boswell plant from investments in pollution controls that were made as recently as 2015. Those unrecovered investments are just one of the challenges in retiring the plant ahead of schedule. Another: the impact to tiny Cohasset Minn. and the surrounding area.

The Boswell plant represents about 70% of the city’s tax base and a significant source of revenue for the county and local school district.

Another challenge is the makeup of Minnesota Power’s customer base and the volatility of its revenue. A handful of taconite production plants and paper and pulp mills make up the bulk of its electricity sales and several of those plants were idled during the pandemic.

""When you have a customer profile that ebbs and flows in big ways and has big swings that makes it more difficult to manage a tool like securitization"" Pierce said.

It’s not that securitization can’t work but that it must be tailored specifically to the state and utilities involved according to Pierce.

""It is not a one-size-fits-all type of tool"" she said. ""That’s why we really wanted to partner with RMI to look at it in the Minnesota context with our regulations our statutes our ratemaking.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltb250YW5hbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNS9iaWctcHJvYmxlbXMtd2l0aC1zbWFsbC1udWNsZWFyLXJlYWN0b3ItcHJvcG9zYWxzLWZvci1tb250YW5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big problems with small nuclear reactor proposals for Montana • Daily Montanan,"Politicians and investor-owned utilities are now proposing small nuclear reactors in Montana to replace the old coal-fired power plants at Colstrip.

For the last 44 years a successful Citizens’ Initiative banned nuclear power in Montana unless approved by the voters. But Republican majorities in the 2021 Montana legislature repealed the initiative and Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law. There are similar proposals in Wyoming and Idaho.

But the rush to nukes suffered a major setback this month when the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission denied the application to build and operate the nation’s first small modular nuclear 720 megawatt reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory. The Commission cited “significant information gaps” in the company’s application including details on potential accidents and its classification of safety systems and components. This is no surprise considering the Union of Concerned Scientists has strong reservations about the sodium-cooled Natrium design.

The concerns are well-founded since other advanced reactor projects across the country have been over budget behind schedule and have yet to produce any power.

For example Duke Energy dropped a nuclear energy project after the estimated cost of $5 billion exploded to $22 billion. Yet ratepayers were still burned when the Florida Public Service Commission voted to stick ratepayers for $800 million in excess costs for a reactor that never generated any electricity. South Carolina’s PSC approved a $9 billion nuclear project – but the utilities abandoned the project never produced any electricity and left ratepayers to pick up the costs. Meanwhile the Vogtle plant in Georgia — currently under construction and six years behind schedule – was initially estimated to cost $14 billion but is now at least $30 billion. Last October Georgia’s PSC approved Vogtle’s request to pass on $2.1 billion in construction costs to ratepayers without producing a single kilowatt of energy.

Safety

These small nuclear reactors are theoretically less prone to meltdown than conventional nuclear reactors because they use liquid sodium metal as coolant rather than water. Since sodium’s boiling point is much higher than the reactor’s operational temperature the coolant won’t boil or vaporize so the system does not need to be pressurized.

But here’s the kicker liquid sodium catches fire if exposed to air or water. The sodium-cooled reactors at the Monju project in Japan and the Superphénix in France have experienced leaks leading to fires and shutdowns.

Nuclear waste

Due to the late Sen. Harry Reid’s successful effort to halt construction of a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada all nuclear waste in the U.S. must now be stored on site in concrete casks. Attempts to build “temporary” national waste repository sites in remote parts of the West – such as the west desert in Utah and rural Wyoming – have been stopped by local and Congressional opposition.

Initially TerraPower Bill Gates’s company that would build the Montana reactors proposed a “breed and burn” reactor that recycled its own waste by burning depleted uranium. Those plans have been discarded however in favor of storing the nuclear waste on site.

Decommissioning costs

The shocking costs go on even after the reactors have been shut down. Decommissioning cost for the Colstrip reactor was recently estimated at as much as $5 billion.

Put it all together and the bottom line is pretty clear: It’s time to say goodbye and good riddance not only to coal but also to nuclear power.

Chemours a company that split off from Dupont and is one of the only licensed titanium miners in the U.S. agreed not to do business with Twin Pines Management LLC the Alabama company that filed for permits to open a titanium mine next to the federally protected Okefenokee Swamp in south Georgia. Chemours said its ""foreseeable future"" is about five to 10 years.

“With respect to mining activities of others particularly Twin Pines Chemours has no role in the proposed Twin Pines project in Charlton County Georgia"" a Chemours company statement reads. ""We have no previous existing or future interest in acquiring and no plans or intent to acquire the project or the company.”

The reiterated commitment comes months after Green Century Capital Management an investment firm filed a shareholder resolution against Chemours asking for such an agreement.

Twin Pines CEO Steve Ingle said his company has never looked into doing business with Chemours.

""We are not answerable to shareholders of a Pennsylvania-based mutual fund we are answerable to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division"" he wrote in an emailed statement. ""We have no affiliation with Chemours and have never been approached about selling the mine to them.""

Related reporting:Sen. Ossoff calls on EPA Army Corps to halt titanium mine near Okefenokee Swamp

Environmental activists said the agreement deals a blow to Twin Pines' plans for the land adjacent to the swamp.

""Chemours’ decision to disavow any interest in the Twin Pines project sends an important signal: The leading company in the industry is stating that titanium mining next to the refuge is a non-starter"" said Thomas Peterson shareholder advocate for Green Century.

Ingle said Twin Pines would still have a market for titanium — used in everyday products aerospace manufacturing and metal alloys — without Chemours' involvement.

""We have many customers to which we have supplied minerals in the past and look forward to doing business with them when the time comes"" Ingles's statement reads. ""We also look forward to protecting the Okefenokee using highly advanced responsible mining methods and providing hundreds of good paying jobs to the people of Charlton County and South Georgia.""

Twin Pines is awaiting approval from the State of Georgia for the permits but the company has faced widespread public and political opposition to the project.

The Okefenokee Swamp is 438000 acres of wetlands and peat-filled swamps that serves as an economic and environmental hub for the state drawing about 700000 visitors a year and acting as natural storage for carbon and water.

In November a group of 43 scientists across Georgia wrote an open letter stating several environmental economic and recreational impacts the mine could have on the land in and around the swamp including using enough water per day to hydrate a town of 19000 people.

""Importantly a majority of the established research supports the claims that mining close to the swamp has a high likelihood of causing permanent damage to the swamp and surrounding areas"" the Nov. 30 letter reads.

“I am a lot less shocked by any eccentricities than I would have been in mid-twenties. I really enjoy the variety fun and diversity you get over here” the 36-year-old says. “As a person it encouraged me to speak my mind and have more of a laugh than in British rugby. It is more light-hearted and maybe that is then reflected in the French media.”

There are two factors that help to explain why Dupont does what he does off the field: French players are focused on the domestic media so sensibilities are catered more towards their own more surrealist sense of humour. Also crucially with the clubs being so decentralised from the French Rugby Federation players have a lot more autonomy to express themselves and “have fun” according to Beattie. He talks about his former team-mate Dupont as a person and it chimes with the biography set out on his agent’s website describing him as “a man of the Pyrenean soil” as well as explaining the man behind his cult following: “There is the language barrier so you don’t see the full personality. Antoine comes from an agricultural background the simplest of upbringings and a very straightforward bloke who happens to be the World Player of the Year and that is the nicest possible part of it because he couldn’t be a lovelier bloke.

“Antoine is one of the most self-deprecating blokes you will ever meet he is not worried about self-image at all. He is a very straight forward bloke who just loves his sport and doesn’t mind taking the mickey out of himself or those around him.”

Eddie Jones hit the headlines when he worried about the possible over-exposure of Marcus Smith. However Fabien Galthie who Beattie played under in France would have a very different take on his players’ extra-curricular activities. “Fabien is focused purely on rugby and doesn’t care about the other stuff like the media” Beattie says. “He would never tell you as a player how to be in the media. Fabien is a good-looking man and he was a World Player of the Year in 2002 and enjoyed that attention. He would understand [about Dupont]. There would be no directives coming from him.

“Antoine has been like this for as long as I have known him since he was a teenager. It is amazing to see the stuff he posts on social media go viral because to him he is just having a laugh. It goes back to the seriousness and having to toe the party line that you have in British and Irish rugby now. It of course helps that France are killing on the rugby field and playing their best rugby in over a decade it means he can express himself more.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1Z2J5d29ybGQuY29tL2NvdW50cmllcy9mcmFuY2UtY291bnRyaWVzL2ZyYW5jZS1zY3J1bS1oYWxmLWFudG9pbmUtZHVwb250LWFuYWx5c2VkLTEzNjQ1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,France Scrum-half Antoine Dupont Analysed,"An in-depth look at the World Player of the Year’s skill-set by Stuart Barnes

France Scrum-half Antoine Dupont Analysed

Antoine Dupont was named World Rugby Player of the Year for 2021 and leads his country in the 2022 Six Nations. Here former England fly-half Stuart Barnes breaks down the France scrum-half’s skill-set from head to toe…

Vision

You can possess all the physical attributes but if you cannot see the potential space in front of you (or sideways) greatness will never beckon.

If you possess the pace and power of Dupont – and his capacity to see the slightest of growing gaps around the fringes or on the short side – you might just be the best player in the world.

Heart

Rugby isn’t always a front-foot affair. Nor is it for the faint of heart. In defence it takes strength and technique but also that beating heart to keep going when it hurts.

Look back to the last French win in Cardiff and watch the number and intensity of tackles he makes. Dupont defends like a fourth back-rower. He’s the ninth forward with the vision of the pre-eminent back.

Balance

Call it low centre of gravity; Dupont’s enables him to excel in another two areas of the game. Approaching the breakdown he’s able to adjust his body into the perfect compact position from which to shift the pass away from the melee whatever the quality of the presentation.

If he decides not to pass but dart he is able to swerve away from and beneath tackles of the usual giants. This balance is the priceless asset that combines with his vision to put his teams in open space.

Thighs

He generates amazing acceleration courtesy of those pumping legs. While his calf strength is important it’s power from the thighs that enables him to combine a sprinter’s speed with a world-class rugby player’s ability to roll with the attempted tackle and come through it at a fair old lick. He’s the ideal size for a scrum-half and blessed with the body to make him nigh-on impossible to knock over.

Feet

Whether it is dancing his way through a congested space or changing direction at the last minute to pick those unique and unstoppable support lines of his Dupont’s fast feet are the flashy part of this rugby sports car.

When his footwork leaves others trailing in the dirt or standing flat-footed that’s when you are blown away by the metaphorical roar of this sturdy superstar.

(Mitch Bach - image credit)

After more than 27 years in the booth the voice of the Saskatoon Blades Western Hockey League team called his 2000th game on Wednesday night — but even after all that time he still remembers his first appearance.

Les Lazaruk 62 called his milestone game between the Blades and the Regina Pats at the Brandt Centre on Feb. 2 the same arena where he called his first game.

Back in 1994 the 35-year-old Lazaruk had already been on the air for more than 15 years long enough to temper his nerves on the night of his first game but everything else went wrong.

""The radio equipment that we had inherited at CJWW from old CFQC radio here in Saskatoon decided to not work on that particular night!"" he told Leisha Grebinski host of CBC's Saskatoon Morning.

Lazaruk missed the pregame show the first period and only entered the airwaves midway through the second period.

His favourite memory behind the mic he says was calling the 5-2 Blades victory over the Halifax Mooseheads in 2013 led by now NHL star Nathan MacKinnon.

The Mooseheads would go on to win the Memorial Cup held in Saskatoon that year but that didn't sour Lazaruk's memory of the Blades toppling a powerhouse Atlantic team.

""That's the greatest Blades victory I've ever had the opportunity to call"" he said.

A partner and a professional in the booth

Darren Dupont has been calling home games alongside Lazaruk for nearing a decade. Dupont doesn't join Lazaruk on the road to call away games.

""A lot of broadcasters at times might be territorial or they might be kind of not that open"" he said. ""[Lazaruk] just gave me room to do whatever I wanted you know he was so welcoming.""

Like others that have called Lazaruk a mentor — a title he's proud to hold — Dupont says he's learned a lot from the veteran broadcaster.

""He has been so kind and gracious with knowledge. You just sit there and absorb from him"" Dupont said.

Story continues

Even saying that he's worked with Lazaruk has had weight Dupont said.

He said that getting the two in a room together to call Lazaruk's milestone game was difficult with COVID-19 forcing game delays and cancellations.

Luckily it worked out and the two longtime partners got to share the 2000th Dupont says.

""I'm going to cherish all the games I've done with Les and this time that we've spent together"" he said.

'Simply the best'

While the Blades' win over the 2013 Memorial Cup Champions is etched in Lazaruk's memory he says his moments with owners managers coaches players and parents remain his favourite aspect of the job. Many have reached out to congratulate him on 2000 games.

A tribute to Lazaruk played on the Brandt Centre Jumbotron in Regina Tuesday night to acknowledge his legendary achievement.

Lazaruk says he was thankful and happily surprised to see congratulations from a host of broadcasters including CBC's own sports reporter Devin Heroux appear on the big screen.

""For me you were the voice the soundtrack to so many cold winter nights while I was growing up in Saskatoon"" Heroux said.

Many recited his patented goal-calls including ""High-ho lets go!"" and ""Winner winner chicken dinner"" while others commented on his contributions to their career as a mentor.

""I don't know how you do it congratulations and thank you also for mentoring so many of us up-and-coming journalists"" said Claire Hanna a TSN sports reporter.

""For you Les three words: simply the best"" Peter Loubardias a Sportsnet sportscaster said in the video.

Lazaruk says he's not sure whether he'll ever catch up with Medicine Hat broadcaster Bob Ridley who surpassed the 4000-game mark nearly a year ago but he'll keep calling games until ""somebody says get the heck out of here."""

Andy was born on March 1 1956 in Tuscaloosa Al. While he grew up in San Antonio Tx. Swarthmore Pa. and Chapel Hill NC he had deep roots in Chattanooga on both sides of his family. After graduating from the University of Alabama with a broadcast degree Andy moved here to work in radio sales at WSKZ KZ-106 – often moonlighting as nighttime disc jockey. He left broadcasting in 1986 to begin a successful 32-year career in commercial real estate with the Fletcher Bright Company. Andy was a Certified Commercial Investment Member (CCIM) and also served as CEO of Tar Heel Investments.



Andy loved nothing more than vacations in the North Carolina mountains and spending time with wife Lisa and his boys. He had many hobbies – from golf to world history – and artistic interests ranging from Duane Allman to Leo Tolstoy. He was an accomplished guitarist and played in several local bands over the years. Andy especially loved singing the blues. He was a true gentle giant and Andy’s big heart musical spirit and enthusiasm for life will be missed by all who knew him.



Andy was preceded in death by his parents James F. and Ann Govan and brother David Bright Govan.



He is survived by his wife Lisa Ferguson Govan; two sons James F. Govan and Samuel B. Govan; and two siblings James Gardner Govan of Milwaukee WI and Christine Noble Govan(Matt) Goodall of Raleigh NC; and many cousins nieces and nephews.



A memorial service celebrating Andy’s life will be held in the memorial garden of the Good Shepherd Episcopal Church 211 Franklin Road Lookout Mountain Tn. on Friday February 11 at 3:30 p.m. A reception will follow at Our Lady of the Mount Catholic Church 1227 Scenic Highway Lookout Mountain Ga. A private family burial will be held at a later date.



In lieu of flowers the family requests donations to Orange Grove Center.

The appearance came on the second night of a back-to-back at the San Fran venue as DSO works through the first leg of its 2022 winter tour.

A sign of things to come Dark Star started off with “Feel Like A Stranger” a Bob Weir/John Barlow collab that appeared on 1980’s Go to Heaven. Following takes on “Franklin’s Tower” and “The Music Never Stopped” guitarist Rob Eaton stepped off the stage and made room for Weir to join in on the fun. The Kid led DSO through a 16-minute “Shakedown Street” before a jaunt through another Weir/Barlow tune “Cassidy”.

With Weir on for the remainder of the first frame Dark Star delivered a tasteful rendition of “China Cat Sunflower” which eventually found its eternal match in the traditional standard “I Know You Rider”. This segment lasted a whopping 20 minutes before the collection of musicians closed out set number one with a cover of Bonnie Dobson‘s “Morning Dew”—a song that became a Dead staple throughout the band’s career.

Set two saw the re-arrival of Eaton on guitar as the group worked through tracks like “Sugar Magnolia” and “Rubin and Cherise”. A take on another Weir original “Playing in the Band” fell in the three-hole ahead of “Uncle John’s Band” and an extensive “Drums” > “Space” section. “Space” eventually found its home back in “Uncle John’s Band” preceding a cover of Traffic‘s “The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys”. Cannon’s Jug Stompers‘ “Voila Lee Blues” then set up a set-ending return to “Playing in the Band” before Dark Star Orchestra closed out its run at The Warfield with an encore of Jerry Garcia‘s “Mission in the Rain”.

It was “fun” she said.

She intended to leave after the holidays but the Salvation Army asked her to stay. “You stay here till someone makes us get rid of you” Salvation Army Major Normajean Daniels said. Lieth did. She was named office manager but little did she know what awaited her.

Three months later in March 2019 a flood swamped the Kearney area. Lieth helped the Salvation Army assist flood victims. Four months later when floodwaters deluged Kearney again Lieth again helped with recovery.

Nine months after that in March 2020 COVID-19 barged in and Lieth now a case manager didn’t flinch. “I was always about helping people. I said ‘We can do this’” she said.

On Friday Lieth retired but she left a chunk of her heart behind. She believes her work at the Salvation Army was part of her life’s calling. “I wish I would’ve gotten into non-profits years ago. When you want to help people this is a really good place to be” she said.

Flood memories

The March floods of 2019 were a warm-up of disasters to come. Daniels took the lead with recovery but Lieth followed up with clients who had requested assistance.

The disaster hit home when floods returned on July 9 2019. As rising water swirled around hotels at Second Avenue and I-80 emergency vehicles rescued hotel guests and brought them to the cozy Salvation Army offices at 1719 Central Ave.

As people suddenly flooded in Lieth made coffee offered snacks and lunch. Salvation Army volunteers hurried out to purchase food and paper plates as Lieth returned to her office answering calls calming people and offering assistance.

When a reporter asked about the floodwaters and the marooned travelers she jokingly referred to the Salvation Army as “Noah’s Ark.”

A few weeks later the Salvation Army assisted by other non-profits hosted a “one-stop” in Kearney where flood victims could meet with non-profits about aid and other resources. Efforts were duplicated in other hard-hit communities.

“I just carried on. We took nearly 500 applications for relief from people in Buffalo County and another 500 from Dawson County” Lieth said.

Dawson County with fewer resources than Buffalo County was especially hard hit. “Six weeks after the flood some people still had basements full of water so I said ‘Let’s organize something.’ We went down there with truckloads of supplies for them” Lieth said.

Tammy Jeffs the community services director at Mid-Nebraska Community Action Partnership led the larger Dawson County recovery program with assistance from other non-profits. “I was just one cog in the wheel” Lieth said.

That fall Lieth served as secretary on a long-term recovery group with leaders from the Salvation Army United Way the Kearney Area Community Foundation the Mid-Nebraska Community Action Partnership among others.

“Lisa Lieth leads with her heart.” KACF President and Executive Director Judi Sickler said. “She is a strong advocate for those who have unmet needs. She is a champion for many who may feel invisible.”

COVID-19 hits

As the recovery group wrapped up its efforts in December 2019 a bigger calamity waited in the wings: COVID-19. By early March 2020 COVID-19 stormed in and closed schools stores restaurants and day care centers. People who found themselves suddenly unemployed sought assistance from the Salvation Army. Many had never had to ask for help before.

“I talked to five people a day. As a case manager I listened to stories. That was my job” Lieth said.

At that time there were no COVID vaccines. “People were afraid they were going to die. People were down in the dumps just super-depressed. I had to reassure them that it was going to be OK” she said.

“One man just wanted a gas voucher. So many other people came in with astronomical needs like $3000 for rent but because funds were available in our community we could do our part. Being able to help made it a lot better than simply saying ‘I’m sorry’” she said.

‘Good for the soul’

Lieth 65 knew firsthand the importance of helping people. Born in Florida she lived in California from 1960 until 1989 when she moved to Nebraska. Part of that time she was a single mother with four children so she can connect with the 200 people who depend on the Salvation Army each month for food utilities and to pay bills.

“When they call I know what they’re talking about. When I was a single mom I had appendicitis and I lost my job and I had to apply for food stamps” she said. “I’m pretty good at paperwork but it took me two hours to fill it all out. Then they said ‘You’ll get something in the mail in two weeks” she said.

She had four children and a jar of peanut butter. They ate macaroni and cheese that cost 29 cents a box. “All of that prepared me for what I do now. I can say to someone ‘I understand how you feel. That happened to me’” she said.

Eventually back on her feet Lieth moved to Kearney remarried had two more children adopted a third from China and spent 20 years at Eaton Corp. doing purchasing and control production planning basically “being everyone’s back-up in a 100-person department.” Then during the Great Recession in 2008 she was one of 5400 Eaton employees who got laid off.

“I was in my 50s. There had to be a reason. I said ‘God I need to know what you want me to do” she said.

For the next 10 years she was an insurance agent. “When I left the house in the morning I’d pray ‘Let me help somebody today’” she said.

Salvation Army

Helping people is what she loved at the Salvation Army too starting with that first temporary Christmas-season job. “Christmas is the best time. My daughter was there too and she said ‘Mom this is good for the soul.’”

She stayed on after Christmas and became the office manager. Having weathered the demands of relief work in two floods she was named case manager in October 2019 when that position opened up.

“There’s a reason why it all happens. You might never know what it was. In life sometimes coincidences happen. That is God. It happens here at an unbelievable rate. It is awesome.”

From her desk at the Salvation Army Lieth has helped people beyond Kearney. After the floods of 2019 she served on the governor’s task force for disaster recovery. She served on the Buffalo County Community Partners collaborative steering committee.

Denise Zwiener executive director of the BCCP called Lieth a “beacon of light.” She said “When I would ask her to wave a magic wand and tell her community how to make a difference for those in need she would give a detailed list of actionable items that we took to funders elected officials and community decision-makers. She is passionate about helping others not just with hand-outs but hand-ups.”

Lieth was also a member of a national low-income housing coalition and sat on the board of Kearney Works. She has been advising the Two Rivers Public Health Department about organizing a minority health advisory committee.

“It’s nice to be able to be heard and to speak for my clients. I can see what they need so I can tell the people who can make it happen. I get reminded every day that I’ve been blessed” she said.

Steven Dahl corps administrator for the Salvation Army here said Lieth has been the foundation of the organization’s response to community challenges. “She has been rock solid helping people tirelessly and with conviction. She has helped us reconnect to partner agencies find untapped resources and connect both with those we are called to serve. She is simply amazing.”

Retirement plans

After retirement Lieth and her husband plan to see the country via back roads and sample local foods. This week she has been finalizing details with her replacement Dee Kreutzer who like Lieth began at the Salvation Army as a Christmas helper.

“It’s been very humbling to hear people say ‘What are we gonna do without you?’ We’ve done a lot in the community together. The Salvation Army has more partnerships than it has ever had. I’ve applied for grants from a lot of places. My emphasis is trying to help more. Always when I’m listening to calls I ask myself how I can help more? I wish I would’ve gotten into non-profits years ago” she said.

“My husband and I always said if we won the lottery wouldn’t it be great to help people? I got to do that and I didn’t have to win money to do it” she said."

The winning bidder was willing to pay £161.78 for the rare coin that has been mistruck at some point in the minting process.

2 The rare 5p looks fairly ordinary but small details mean it's an error and could be worth much more Credit: ebay

2 Up to 20 bids were placed on the rare coin so we know collectors were keen Credit: ebay

The error 5p sold back in December after bidders spent seven days battling to get their hands on it.

When bidding began offers kicked off at 99p - that meant it was already going for almost 20 times its face value.

But it managed to rocket even more in value as it sold for well over a hundred pounds more just a week later.

The design found on the rare coin is that of the 1992 5p which features the ""Third Portrait"" of the Queen on the obverse and crowned thistle and ""five pence"" writing on the reverse.

It's not the most recent 5p look that you might see knocking about in everyday change as another version was introduced into circulation in 2008.

But the old-type small coins are still legal tender meaning coins issued in 1992 have now been circulating for 30 years.

The difference with this particular rare coin though is that it doesn't look quite as it should.

Advertised in the listing the seller explained that the 5p design had been struck on the wrong type of coin.

They predicted it was a closer match to a Fiji cent - definitely not something you'd otherwise be able to use in a UK vending machine parking meter or more.

Sometimes planchets for one coin denomination are fed into a coin-stamping press equipped with dies of another denomination.

This means the coin could be stamped with a design intended for a different coin altogether.

The eBay seller sad: ""I feel this could be a 5p struck on a Fiji 1 cent blank.

""Based on weight metallurgy diameter designer of portrait - it would be a close match.""

The Royal Mint strikes coins for over 60 countries manufacturing between three million and four million coins a day so often things will go wrong.

But any mistakes that are made will usually be in low numbers - that means coin collectors are more keen to stash them away though.

Without the error the coin would otherwise sell at its face value - just 5p - so something being slightly off is important in making it valuable.

Usually error coins will have missing elements like the rare commemorative WW1 £2 coin spotted months back missing the words ""two pounds"" or the design printed may be misaligned as well.

Around the same time as this listing was gaining interest rare Snowman 50ps were being snapped up by buyers too as the print didn't quite match up in parts of the design meaning some silver of the coin was poking through.

Can I make a mint from an error?

Error coins are still legal tender so it's likely one could fall into your lap.

In the case of this error 5p someone could easily mistake it for a dirty penny and allow it to slip through hands undetected.

But collectors are willing to pay higher prices for something with a distinct fault as they are so rare.

If you spot a coin that looks different to normal or is imperfect you can check it against other listings on eBay to see how much others are selling for or are willing to pay for a similar strike.

Usually you can determine if something is the real deal by the number of bidders who were willing to stake their claim on it.

The error 5p racked up as many as 20 bids so coin hunters were clearly keen to close on an offer of their own.

It wouldn't be the first time we've seen bidding wars break out on the most highly sought-after copies so it's definitely worth checking your own change just in case.

But remember that a buyer can always pull out of the sale which means it won't have sold for the price that it may say it has.

Experts also warn of fakes - especially when it comes to buying and selling on eBay - so you have to be careful when you're on the hunt.

Change experts like Coin Hunter or Change Checker will help you verify if it's real too and they can help place a value on the coin that might put some weight in your wallet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyZGxpbmVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLXBhbmluaS1yb29raWVzLXN0YXJzLWZvb3RiYWxsLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review,"2021 Rookies and Stars continues the lineage of a classic brand with a wide variety of offerings and inserts. The boxes hit on February 9 2022. In preperation our 2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football review will help you determine– is it a rip flip hold or pass?

What Is Rookies And Stars

This might come as a shock but this product heavily emphasizes rookies and – get this – stars. Joking aside it’s a set that has been around for a long time. The first box I ever opened was a 2007 Rookies and Stars set from Leaf. Therefore the brand will always hold a special place in my heart. In addition the release has notably improved and revamped regularly.

This year’s offering keeps the ball rolling with a great base set autographs memorabilia cards and even some opti-crome cards to look for in every box.

2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review: What To Expect

Rookies and Stars was a hobby-only release in 2021 which helps the brand. But most notably the lack of base rookies floating around eBay will help the rookies and stars brand retain value in the long run.

Perhaps the best part of this box is that it only costs $325 at the time of writing making it a pretty low-cost product compared to the number of potential hits.

2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review Of The Formats

In 2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review terms of box structure here’s what you can expect:

Hobby Box

2 Autographs

2 Memorabilia

5 Numbered Parallels

12 Inserts

12 Rookies

6 Opti-Chrome Inserts

2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review Of The Checklist

The Rookies and Stars lineup is similar to what we’ve come to know from the brand but the continued emphasis on parallels will mean some more big-dollar cards coming out of the product.

This year look for:

Orange – #/99

True Blue – #/49

Red & Blue – #/35

Gold – #/10

Black & Blue – #/5

Green – #/5

Platinum – 1/1

This year’s six-pack boxes will have four hits on average (2 autos and memorabilia) and this will be marked by the return of a fan-favorite insert: Crusade. The brightly colored Crusade cards have a lot of great parallels to chase and could be a fun set for collectors to build.

You can also look for the popular Dress For Success card an autographed memorabilia card featuring the top players from the 2021 NFL Draft Class!

Also Panini advertises that collectors should “be on the hunt for short-printed Opti-Chrome autograph parallels of Crusade Airborne Stellar Rookies & new to 2021: Star-Studded!” Short-prints are a great way to breathe life into more common inserts so this was an excellent call for maintaining the set’s overall health.

2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review Of Value

If you’re hoping to invest in Rookies and Stars 2020-21 the first question to answer is if you should buy singles or wax.

Wax

2020 Rookies and Stars hobby boxes sell for $500 just as Joe Burrow is prepping his Bengals for the Super Bowl. 2018 boxes are listed at $550 powered by a deep rookie class and a couple of extra years of aging. 2019 – the least exciting rookie class of the last several years – can be found for $429.99.

What do all three of these prices have in common?

Namely they’re significantly higher than the $325 release day price of 2021 Rookies and Stars. That alone suggests that the product is a good hold.

Generally the value of boxes is determined by the best quarterbacks in the class. But sadly we haven’t seen anything too extraordinary from the 2021 quarterbacks yet.

But let’s wait. It’s too early to give up on Trevor Lawrence (spoiler he’ll still be amazing) Zach Wilson and Trey Lance. Mac Jones may also be worthy of more than the “game manager” label he is associated with.

Singles

Rookies and Stars rookie cards come in many different forms but your best hope of finding one that holds excellent long-term value is the popular Crusades insert.

If I’m investing in a single from this set I’d buy a colored Crusade from the player you believe in the most and get it graded eventually (don’t rush to PSA right now) or a numbered rookie autograph.

The Joe Burrow Crusade base cards from last year are selling for around $30 at the time of writing (again this is inflated by the Super Bowl). Meanwhile PSA 10s sell for about $170. Recently a Pink /50 sold for $90 but it sold before the Bengals got into stride in the playoffs.

If you want something more high-end a Dress for Success rookie autograph could also be an excellent long-term hold. This Herbert /75 that sold for $450 is a perfect example. But of course what you buy should depend on how much you believe in the quarterback.

The Bottomline Of The 2021 Panini Rookies & Stars Football Review

With 2021 Rookies and Stars Football the resell prices of previous boxes suggest they have great potential for a long-term hold. As always ripping is by far the riskiest but you can also pay off the $325 price if you hit a nice rookie autograph or a decent auto and some nice parallels. As far as flipping goes there’s not enough room to make any margins worth messing with but I wouldn’t call the product a pass either.

In the end do what makes the most sense for you and your budget. For example this box is a “hobby” While you can make a decent amount of profit off it hobbies are also about having fun.",,,,,,

A Youtube video showing the dogs can be found here: https://bit.ly/3Hvhg9W .

Part of the study “is to see how art therapy can decrease people’s levels of depression and improve their overall quality of life” Rastogi said. So patients will use art-therapy through an app and see how the electronic art exercises help.

Some patients in the study will use only the art therapy app while the others will have both the art therapy and the robotic dogs.

For the study researchers are looking for a very specific type of participant: People with vestibular schwannoma or acoustic neuromas which are tumors on nerves connecting the inner ear with the brain. They often have their tumors removed and often lose hearing and suffer balance issues.

By choosing those people as subjects researchers have an easy-to-diagnose condition adding fewer variables to patient diagnoses said Dr. Soma Sengupta associate director of UC’s Brain Tumor Center. The condition often leads to depression.

Furry fake friends

The mechanical mutts which resemble small Golden Retrievers come in.

“I have adopted some of them and it’s really amazing the companionship that they offer in the sense that you feel the presence of this entity in your environment” said Claudia Rebola director of a new center that focuses on innovation in the area of health and wellbeing at UC’s College of Design Architecture Art and Planning (DAAP).

“And while you know it’s an animal robotic agent — it’s not a real dog — you attach feelings to it in terms of routines and interactions and you expect a bark in response to let’s say I turn on the lights and then the dog barks like saying ‘hello.’ So you quickly develop a sense of presence with these robots in your life.”

The dogs and other pets have expressive eyes. They can bark lick nuzzle and help lift spirits of people who are isolated possibly those with long-term COVID-19 symptoms people with traumatic brain injuries or recovering from strokes.

Can help elders others

Rebola said the electronic pets can brighten the lives of the elderly just as they do children.

“It’s incredible to see how older adults adopt these pets how they take care of them they buy food for them they put a bed by their beds and they go out more often because they’re wanting to show off their pet” Rebola said. “Their pet becomes a social connector. People say ‘Oh look at that pet!’ And they’re more interactive.”

Yet the pets don’t need to be fed or walked although some like to do that too.

During the study the dogs wear special “smart bandanas” a UC team designed so researchers can track how often and how long they interact with the pets. The researchers emphasize the bandanas are not a Big Brother device that lets them watch their subjects but only tells them how often and how long a patient is interacting with the dog.

Subjects who only need to visit UC at the start of the study can live far from campus because only an initial visit for training about the art-therapy app is needed. People interested in joining the study can call Jamie Denlinger in the brain tumor center at 513-675-9656.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvMjAyMi8wMi8xNC9mb3JnZXQtZm9vdGJhbGwtaXRzLW1vbmRheS1uaWdodC1ib29rc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget Football It's Monday Night Books!,"Thomas Beard was sitting at a desk the other day in a small room in the back of Light Industry a film and electronic-arts venue of which he is a founder. A vase of yellow tulips was before him. In April Light Industry will move to new digs and in the interim Beard has decided to use the back room for an unusual project: selling all his books. The thought of letting go of his collection amassed over twenty years and largely kept in storage came to him during the pandemic. “I realized I’m never going to have an apartment big enough for all these books unless I get a rich husband and I’m not the marrying kind” Beard who is thirty-seven said. He gestured at the dozen or so IKEA Billy bookcases that lined the walls and were tidily packed with thousands of volumes. “The books were locked away like a dowry and I wanted them to have a life in the world.”

And so: Monday Night Books. “I figured I could do it one evening a week” he said. “It seemed perfect.” With neat side-parted hair a dark cardigan and a brown knit tie Beard brought to mind an early-sixties adman on a weekend morning. “This isn’t really a business—it’s a slow-motion garage sale” he went on. “When the books are gone I’ll close up shop.” The only items he has decided to keep are his working library of film books and his cookbooks. “But only proper cookbooks!” he clarified. “Like Elizabeth David’s ‘Harvest of the Cold Months: The Social History of Ice and Ices’? That is here.”

The performance-art aspect of the project is matched by the idiosyncrasy of the inventory. “To run a used bookstore that survives you have to buy a bunch of copies of ‘The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle’ for a dollar each” Beard said. There’s none of that at Monday Night Books. Instead the shelves—arranged in no particular order—track Beard’s intellectual development and interests from his days as a teen growing up in South Carolina (“I remember reading that copy of ‘Of Human Bondage’ after soccer practice”) to his years at the University of Texas at Austin (“I discovered Elizabeth Hardwick on the dollar rack at Half Price Books”) and beyond. (“I’ve dug in used bookstores for hours and hours all over the world for all of these things like this copy of ‘Deadly Innocents: Portraits of Children Who Kill.’ ”) “There’s a lot of what if you were using a capacious definition you would call ‘gay shit’ ” he said. “But also way more medieval stuff than I would have thought and a lot of Southern history. New York history is pretty well represented too. And definitely art and music.” Also unaccountably “several books about hobos.”

Just weeks into the project’s run the stock had already been reduced by hundreds of volumes and the space was bustling with masked customers riffling eagerly through the wares like hypebeasts at a limited-edition sneaker drop. Jasmine Sanders a writer was trying to decide whether to top off her pile—which included Paul Gilroy’s “The Black Atlantic” and a volume of Adrienne Kennedy’s plays—with a collection of Emily Dickinson’s letters or with a book of essays by Wayne Koestenbaum. (Beard: “I love Wayne but I mean Dickinson is a goddam genius.”) Sam Biederman a chief of staff at the city’s Parks Department who had come with a black Labrador mix selected an anthology of female crime writers. Tobi Haslett a writer was waffling on a Dennis Cooper book. “I’ve never really liked him but I might give it another try” he said. Another patron was more enthusiastic. “I just read the entire George Miles Cycle at work” he told Beard referring to Cooper’s five-novel series of queer sex and violence.

“What’s wrong? Do you want to fight about it?” Cartoon by Ellie Black Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop

Haslett could understand Beard’s impulse to radically deaccession. “I really should get rid of some of my books” he said. “But then it seems almost sinful to be like ‘Oh now I’m not going to own a copy of ‘Minima Moralia’ ” by Theodor Adorno. “Like what am I a Nazi ?” He laughed.

Beard’s view was more philosophical. “Nothing is truly gone” he said. “If I want to read say the letters of Rosa Luxemburg I can still go to the library and take them out.” He shook his head. “When people talk to me about Marie Kondo I tell them it’s not that. Usually the point is to get rid of things you don’t like but I’m selling these books because I love them.” He gazed at the shelves affectionately. “Reading ‘Go Down Moses’ in high school was one of the most important aesthetic experiences of my life so you would think that when I sold the very copy that I pored over as a teen-ager I would feel some regret. But in fact it’s the contrary. I’m so excited that someone else will have this book.” ♦

Earlier in the week (February 1) EA hosted its third quarter earnings call for 2022 and in it CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned what’s next for the Skate franchise as a new entry was announced in 2020 but little has been heard about it since.

When asked about user-generated content and NFTs the latter of which EA appears to have backed away from slightly here’s what Wilson had to say (spotted via TweakTown):

“The ability to create your own content and put it into that ecosystem has become a really valuable part of what our industry offers to our players and our fans” said Wilson in the transcript. “The traditional media just doesn’t. And this is something that we hold true. Again it’s been at the very centre of The Sims for a long time. It’s at the very centre of modes like FIFA Ultimate even Madden Ultimate Team to the very centre of the design of Skate which we’ll be launching soon.”

“And so this concept of UGC or user-generated content is really just an extension of the social interaction that I’m able to have with my friends in and around experiencing what is the best entertainment on the planet. And so I believe that’s going to be a really important part of our future” he added.

Skate 3 did support a park building mechanic so whether or not the new Skate does the same or also comes up with something new in the realm of UGC remains to be seen.

Last anyone heard of the new Skate 4 it was announced that it would be coming to PC for the first time but there’s still no release date or any major information. Wilson’s comments on the game “launching soon” do suggest more will be revealed about the game in the near future however.

Full Circle will be developing Skate 4 and the studio is staffed by series developers and the former head of Xbox Live.

The unremarkable exterior belies the personality of the company's founder and chief executive inside.

Manny Villafana is a legend in Minnesota medical technology and beyond — but not someone who rests on past successes. At age 81 he is on his eighth startup with Plymouth-based Medical 21 which he founded in 2016.

From his desk surrounded by a museum-like collection of old pacemakers Villafana explains his vision through parables. Only they aren't parables but true stories from his past that showcase his entrepreneurial zeal.

For half a century he has launched expanded and sold medical startups that have helped define shape and amplify Minnesota's medical technology industry.

His legacy is anchored by two companies he started in the 1970s: Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. (CPI) and St. Jude Medical Inc. Abbott Laboratories bought St. Jude for $25 billion in 2017.

""He really is one of those early serial entrepreneurs that has really shaped the ecosystem for medical technology"" said Scott Ward chief executive of New Brighton-based Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and a Medtronic veteran.

With the next medical frontier always beckoning Villafana just won't quit.

""When golf is as exciting as what I'm doing maybe I'll play golf"" said Villafana.

Every weekday morning he wakes up 5 o'clock goes to the gym eats breakfast and is at his desk by 9 a.m.

Medical 21's concept is to develop an artificial artery that can be used in cardiac bypass surgery replacing the need to harvest blood vessels from elsewhere in the body — such as the legs arms and chest. For decades dozens of companies have tried to do the same thing with no success. Villafana calls the quest ""the holy grail of cardiac surgery.""

With an entrepreneur's optimism and ambition he is undeterred.

While working at Medtronic early in his career Villafana suggested that it start making pacemakers with lithium batteries. Medtronic wasn't interested. At the time several companies were making pacemakers that lasted only 18 to 24 months. Villafana saw an opportunity and left his job to found his first startup Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. in 1972.

From a telephone booth in the downtown Minneapolis skyway he raised $50000 to start CPI.

""I didn't have an office"" Villafana said. ""I used to plug in the 25 cents or nickel or whatever it was and that's how I raised money.""

The company's first pacemakers used lithium batteries and came with an initial guarantee that the device would last three years. Lithium batteries have long since become the standard for all pacemakers.

CPI was sold in 1978 to Eli Lilly and Co. for $127 million which was later spun off with the medical device unit and eventually acquired by Boston Scientific Corp.

Villafana founded St. Jude Medical in 1976; the company introduced the first bileaflet all-carbon heart valves that soon became the industry standard. Before St. Jude heart valves were ball valves; the bileaflet version had two flaps that pivot for better blood flow.

In 1987 Villafana founded Helix BioCore Inc. which later changed its name to ATS Medical Inc. and was acquired by Medtronic in 2010 for $370 million.

Villafana's influence and impact locally is still felt today. Boston Scientific has more than 10000 employees and Abbott has about 5000 employees in the state. Manny's Steakhouse a downtown Minneapolis dining institution is named after Villafana who seeded the restaurant owner's startup costs.

The Manny approach

Perhaps as important as the technological advances made by his companies was Villafana's pioneering approach to relationships.

""He began that process of closely interacting with cardiac surgeons interventional cardiologists and really understanding their needs for the product and for education"" Ward said.

In the 1970s it was rare for medical device companies to train surgeons and medical fellows on their product. But that's exactly what Villafana did.

""The reason that [St. Jude Medical] retained their market share for so many years is because they trained and educated all the fellows all the cardiac surgery fellows on how to do heart valve implants and what they were trained on was the St. Jude product"" said Ward. ""That was all Manny. Manny is all about those close customer relationships.""

Today that's common practice in the business.

Villafana grew up in the South Bronx the son of Puerto Ricans who had — as he put it — ""nada nothing."" His mother father and his three brothers all died of heart attacks so it's no coincidence his career has focused on cardiac health.

""My entire family died of cardiac disease"" Villafana said. ""They all died too young.""

Cardiac bypass procedures are a very common surgery. The market is estimated at $8 billion Villafana said ""much bigger than anything I've worked with before.""

Villafana never went to college and holds an honorary doctor of science degree from the University of Iowa. Yet when talking about the human heart and the device his company is developing Villafana could pass as a doctor to a layman's ears.

Successes and failures

The key to creating an artificial artery is ensuring that the body will accept the material and won't itself lead to other complications. Medical 21 has licensed its technology from the University of Iowa but is making updates. The artificial artery itself looks like a very soft pipe cleaner made with a synthetic material and a nickel-titanium alloy wire.

Medical 21 wrapped a financing round in December; the company has raised $11 million since its inception. Villafana has taken seven companies public and expects Medical 21 to be his next. The company is looking to raise an additional $30 million to $40 million through a regulation A+ offering sometimes called a ""mini-IPO.""

In 2017 Medical 21 began testing the product on animals first in pigs and then in sheep.

Lyle Joyce a professor of surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin is on Medical 21's medical advisory board. His son David Joyce also a cardiac surgeon is also on the board.

Villafana ""is working in an area where there is a tremendous need"" Lyle Joyce said.

The father and son duo have implanted grafts in some animals. ""It went very well"" said Lyle Joyce. ""The present design is beautiful.""

Medical 21 hopes to start clinical trials of the artificial artery in the second half of the year in the United States and Europe. Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals are still several years away.

The company is collaborating with Mayo Clinic which owns an equity stake in the company. Juan Crestanello a cardiovascular surgeon at Mayo said he and his colleagues have seen some of Medical 21's work.

""The results so far have been very encouraging"" Crestanello said. If clinical trials proceed Mayo would be interested in being a trial site.

And while Villafana has found great success he's also failed like many serial entrepreneurs do. Medical 21 is his third consecutive company aimed at improving bypass surgery. CABG Medical Inc. developed an artificial graft but shut down in 2006 after unsuccessful clinical trials. And Kips Bay Medical created a mesh designed to support natural vein grafts. That company shut down in 2015.

Ward of Cardiovascular Systems believes Medical 21 may ultimately succeed where others have failed because of its persistent leader.

""Manny never moved on"" Ward said. ""He just keeps at it. He's going to keep working on it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oZWFyLXJ1ZS1ldXBob3JpYS1tYWtldXAtYWN0dWFsbHktMjA0NzQzOTEzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hear Me Out: Rue's 'Euphoria' Makeup Is Actually The Best,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website STYLECASTER may receive an affiliate commission.

There always seems to be one show that each generation looks to for beauty and fashion inspiration. For Millennials it was Gossip Girl. For Gen Xers it was Friends and now for Gen Z it’s undoubtedly Euphoria. It’s hard to think of a source of media that has had such a hold over what seems like the entire world. I mean you can’t go online on Sundays without seeing your feeds filled to the brim with Euphoria hot takes and recaps.

While the likes of Alexa Demie (who plays Maddy) and Sydney Sweeney (who plays Cassie) have been heralded for their statement-making—and sometimes cringe—makeup and style moments my admiration is almost always on Zendaya as her character Rue. And yeah a lot of the reason why is because she’s quite literally the most beautiful human to have ever existed and the actress we will worship for decades to come BUT another reason is that her skin always looks flawless.

Given the uh recreational activities she’s seen doing on the show this is a big fete.

After reading everything Euphoria‘s Makeup Designer Doniella Davy had to say in her interview with W Magazine I’m happy to report that my admiration for Z’s look is not just something I made up fangirling in my head.

See Davy and her team of talented artists have a specific routine for Rue’s no-makeup makeup look and it involves a skin-protecting cream that costs just $25 at Amazon or whatever beauty store you go to.

Davy told W Mag that Rue’s look is “always super simple: it’s no makeup.” OK yeah that makes sense but she went on: “We went with her total natural skin texture—I would just accentuate the bags under her eyes or put this red eyeshadow around her eyelash line or even trace over her veins on her temple and her brow bone using this watercolor-style special effects makeup and a really skinny brush. We were also using this Elizabeth Arden product called Eight Hour Cream Skin Protectant that Z loves to keep her face really moist.”

So not only is it great for the show but it’s something that Zendaya actually enjoys using on her own. I’m getting 12 bottles.

Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Skin Protectant Face Cream

The cream itself is pretty straightforward. It’s made with petrolatum vitamin E and salicylic acid to deeply nourish and protect the skin for up to eight hours at a time. The simple ingredients list means that it’s an ideal product to use in basically any way you want to: shaping your brows moisturizing your hands or adding some shimmer to your cheekbones.

Reviewers say the cream is “miraculous” thanks to its ability to soothe and hydrate extremely dry skin and lips.

“I put some around my eyes and woke up looking like I did about forty years ago” wrote one five-star reviewer. “I would even put some in my hair ends to smooth them out.”

Jonny Howson’s sterling performance at Old Trafford epitomised everything you would want from a professional footballer.

Howson who will be 34 in May produced a remarkable display of guts desire courage and work- rate all rolled into one.

If the team had needed an inspiration on the pitch it came from Howson.

He’s been tremendous all the way through since Garry Monk signed him following relegation from the Premier League in 2017.

Yet Howson was – on paper – one of the lesser signings as Monk tried to rebuild a new team from the ashes of relegation.

Monk signed illustrious and expensive names such as Britt Assombalonga Martin Braithwaite Darren Randolph and Ashley Fletcher.

Howson’s fee was undisclosed but was believed to be in the region of £6m which fell well short of Braithwaite’s £9m not to mention the £15m forked out on Assombalonga.

Naturally Howson has stayed in the team all the time while the others have fallen by the wayside for one reason or another. And he’s done so without initially winning over a large section of the fans.

I wrote a glowing tribute to Howson shortly after he arrived at the Riverside. In a particular game he had just prevented a couple of certain goals by taking the full force of shots on his own goal-line.

Afterwards there was criticism on social media about the article clearly inferring that Howson was not a crucial member of the team among the big boys.

Yet Howson has long since gone on to win everybody over and long may it continue. At the same time he’s going to face a tough battle to hang on to a regular place following Chris Wilder’s new arrivals.

However Jonny has come out of top throughout his illustrious career and I wouldn’t bet against him.

He’s as tough as they come as hard as nails never shirks a tackle and causes massive problems for opposition attacks.

Not only are we lucky to have him but you can’t help wondering why Norwich agreed to sell him in the first place at a stage when he was just reaching his professional peak.

In fact every team needs a terrier like Howson if it is to make an impact.

That’s why the likes of Robbie Mustoe enjoyed such a remarkably long career in the Boro side holding his own among much bigger fish.

Mustoe was another who was an unheralded signing when Colin Todd snapped him up for £375000 from Oxford United in 1990.

There wasn’t a lot of meat on Robbie but he too never shirked a tackle and became an important member of the side throughout the Lennie Lawrence and Bryan Robson eras.

When Steve McClaren took over the helm in 2001 Mustoe was 33 and did not appear to be in McClaren’s initial plans.

Yet he worked his way back into the side and was comfortably holding his own until his retirement at the end of that season.

Mustoe was very much a box to box player who could score goals as well as stop them.

It was as a destroyer where he was most effective within the team. He still held his own even when his position came under threat from the likes of Emerson.

When Emerson joined Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli at the Riverside Boro were moving into a golden era the likes of which we had never seen before.

Yet it is quite remarkable how players such as Mustoe and Howson are crucial to teams even when they are surrounded by big-name stars.

Emerson of course is arguably the best holding midfielder ever to represent the club.

He was a class above anything we had witnessed before when he first arrived from Porto in a £4m deal.

The Brazilian was a dominating character on the pitch who seemed to be able to put himself in the right place at the right time and always come away with the ball.

The downside of Emerson’s electric performances for Boro was that they lasted only a few months. From the first time that he went AWOL his form began to suffer. Afterwards we saw only flashes of the great player he could be.

Unlike Juninho and Ravanelli Emerson stayed on for half a season in Division One after Boro were relegated over the three-points fiasco.

His goal against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light that season will long remain as one of the most memorable of all time.

Again you consider how fortunate Boro were to be able to complete a transfer deal for Emerson in the first place though he was the last player that the then Porto manager Bobby Robson wanted to sell.

The story goes that Boro arranged the transfer with the Porto president without Robson having any knowledge of the negotiations.

Bobby was apparently incensed when he heard the news but moved on to take charge of Barcelona afterwards.

It is believed that Barcelona later publicly expressing interest in Emerson was the main reason for the player going AWOL.

This this respect the deal rebounded against Boro somewhat but when Emerson was firing on all cylinders in the Boro’s red shirt there was nobody like him.

Emerson was seen as the lesser light at the time of his arrival alongside Juninho and Ravanelli which was the case with another Brazilian.

Doriva was a relative unknown in Britain when Boro signed him from Celta Vigo and even then Boro announced his signing as an afterthought having also snapped up Michael Ricketts Malcolm Christie and Chris Riggott on the final day of the January transfer window of 2003.

Yet Doriva was another player who McClaren could not leave out of his side despite going on to sign many big fish such as Bolo Zenden.

Doriva was very much in the Howson mould with his tireless work-rate and his unerring ability to break down opposition attacks.

The Brazilian had a soulmate in George Boateng another defensive midfielder who was deceptively important to the side. Boateng was similar to some of Boro’s other holding midfield men in that you wonder why clubs released them in the first place.

However George was reported to have fallen out with Aston Villa manager Graham Taylor which hastened his likely departure from Villa Park.

Boateng was so highly rated within the game that Liverpool were poised to sign him until the deal fell down allegedly due to agents’ demands.

At this stage McClaren moved in and Boro were able to complete a £5m fee probably expensive at the time for a holding midfielder. Yet Boro received full value for money from the Dutchman.

He was as good if not better a reader of the game as any of the other holding midfielders and was also a good passer of the ball making him an important link with the forwards.

Boro planned that their next major holding midfielder would be Didier Digard but it never really worked out for the Frenchman on Teesside. Digard cost £4m from Paris St Germain and was seen as one of the potential leaders in Gareth

Southgate’s evolving side. But he suffered from injuries and never picked up the cudgels.

Adam Clayton was the next man to make a significant contribution in a defensive midfield role being a very astute signing by Aitor Karanka.

Clayton was signed from Huddersfield for £1.5m in 2014 and was a gritty hard working player who always put in a shift during his six years with the club.

The role was eventually taken up by Howson who displayed his versatility at times when switching both to right-back and centre-back during times of pressure on the squad.

Boro have had some great committed club men over the years. Howson is up there with the best of them.

We call this “founder diligence”.

In part one of this series I wrote about how this process is failing investors and founders. Too often evaluation processes are built on personality tests and frameworks that don’t capture founders’ potential to develop.

But putting aside the question of how good or not due diligence is the best way for founders to get ahead of the curve is to understand what founder diligence looks like across funds. I spoke to six European funds about their processes: Northzone EQT Ventures Entrepreneur First HV Capital EKA Ventures and Digital+ Partners.

I’ve broken them down according to a matrix that plots the different purposes of the diligence with how proprietary or not the process is. I’ll be using that matrix as a guide for this piece too.

Based on proprietary fund insights/support-oriented: Northzone and Digital+ Partners

Elena Pantazi talent partner at Northzone says the VC looks for six dimensions in a founder; while the first three are considered on a “more the merrier” scale the latter three have to balance out advantages and risks.

According to the firm they look for founders with (1) a deep drive and personal motivation to be an entrepreneur paired with (2) a growth mindset and openness for self-development. This in turn enables them to (3) attract talented people around them when scaling the business. Similarly they view (4) having a healthy dose of self-confidence as a positive attribute that enables founders to go through the rough patches while staying humble. Finally in terms of skill-sets they (5) encourage founders to identify their own superpower and evolve into a thought partner across other business functions without (6) needing to exert too much control across all areas.

“We don’t want to exclude 'spiky' founders — such as having a chip on the shoulder or having something to prove to the world — but to facilitate their success given the knowledge of their true strengths and uniqueness” Pantazi says.

Sometimes I also provoke and push founders on their answers to see how they react

Digital+ Partners evaluates founders throughout a range of interactions including the founder’s participation in deal meetings and pitches and throughout the entire due diligence process. The assessments inform the investment decision but also what support to provide post-investment and are based on five dimensions: leading self leading others leading by results leading as a founder and leading with knowledge.

Nicole Schneider chief people officer and partner uses what she calls “embedded analysis"" throughout the evaluation and sorts her findings into the five categories. She is both part of the diligence process and sits on the investment committee.

“In the diligence process I participate in most of the meetings and observe teams and individuals: how do they act? How do they respond to questions? How do they interact with each other? Sometimes I also provoke and push founders on their answers to see how they react” she says.

With all these points organised Schneider sits down to write her analysis which when complete goes to the Digital+ Partners team for their feedback and to reduce bias.

The firm doesn’t use one specific tool or standardised tests but it does sometimes suggest founders to go to a Swiss institute for a psychological evaluation to help their personal development and also offers advice on coaches available for founders specifically.

Science-based/support-oriented: HV Capital and EQT Ventures

Anna Ott VP of people at HV Capital says: “It’s quite simple. The more self-aware founder is better prepared for the journey. If you’d ask me for the pyramid of founder qualities I’d put self-awareness right at the bottom. But on top are leadership capabilities domain expertise (preferably) entrepreneurial background and a good portion of ‘raw intelligence’.”

Ott says that she and her colleagues start a dialogue with founders about their personal growth and coaching as early as possible. “If they were against deepening their self-awareness that would be a red flag but it hardly ever happens” she says.

HV also explores external tools like StrengthsFinder or consulting firms like Synthesis to provide assessments upon request. In either case it's the founder's choice if they want to share their evaluation with anyone including investors. Ott says it's ""more important that our founders deepen their self-awareness. With the method that works best for them.""

HV also looks at founders' support structure: their coaches mentors or industry veterans. The firm also offers recommendations of suitable coaches for tech startup entrepreneurs. Ott says more and more founders open up about their personal growth e.g. in development-oriented communities like Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO) or with their peers.

Recently she learned that two cofounders of Felmo Philip Trockels and Lars Giere won over a crucial hire by being very vocal about self-awareness. ""In the interview they said that they would be ‘too old to NOT believe in self-awareness’ and that they had no issue discussing their ‘dark sides' with that candidate. The talent said she was sold on the job there and then. It's a rare thing to show vulnerability as a tech entrepreneur still but when you do you cut through the chase and form invaluable trustful relationships with investors and key hires alike.""

What we are interested in is the behaviour and abilities that you have relative to your peer group

Self-development is also the keyword at Sweden’s EQT Ventures.

“We are aware that when you're a founder at the first round all you feel is ‘I got to this stage through a certain type of hive-mindedness and a family approach working in close proximity to my team and being involved in everything’” says operating partner Polly Barnes. “After their first big venture round however it becomes all about the ‘we’ and you almost need to do the opposite to grow. It is such a leadership challenge to break away from what worked for you before and take a more structured approach to encourage ownership through the organisation.”

Barnes says the work of supporting founder development begins during onboarding and includes both the individual and the team level. The results help determine “critical first hires” and strengths or personality styles that would improve the team’s performance.

“We work with a variety of tools: some of them are off-the-shelf products others are created solely for us working with an organisational psychologist but it is a flexible approach. We include strength evaluations driver analysis and personality assessments. We find that tech-based teams respond well to the clarity of strength assessments whilst drivers are really critical to understanding and harnessing motivation.”

Based on proprietary fund insights/filter-oriented: Entrepreneur First

Of course all investment professionals implicitly apply their experience to evaluate founders. That being said some funds have turned their proprietary insights into an explicit practice — not least because it reduces the risk for bias. In the case of Entrepreneur First that means 10 years of data and more information being collected every cohort by 50 interviewers across six locations.

“We don't believe past experience or knowledge is relevant to your future success. We don't select or put in our first money based on ideas at all” says founder Alice Bentinck. “What we are interested in is the behaviour and abilities that you have relative to your peer group.”

EF looks at five criteria in determining founder ability but emphasises that founders rarely score highly on all of these. These abilities also don’t necessarily have to have been demonstrated in work or study but in hobbies side projects or sports. They are:

Challenges convention: individuals who have taken surprising paths or decisions or challenged the status quo compared to their peers.

Drive to achieve: individuals with a bias to action who are driven to build and create.

Followership: individuals who have had people follow their decisions and actions in the past and can unite people around a common goal.

Smart with clarity of thought: individuals with problem-solving skills to tackle the macro and the micro. They can develop and communicate complex ideas to a range of stakeholders.

Technical knowledge and applicability or commerciality: EF looks for technical knowledge from potential future chief technology officers (CTOs) and specifically individuals with the ability to apply this knowledge to solve problems or “applicability”. And with CEO candidates EF looks for an understanding of technology as it can be applied across industries and how that relates to the customer or their “commerciality”.

Science-based/filter-oriented: Eka Ventures

Eka Ventures research found that about 90% of unicorns are led by founders when they reach a $1bn+ valuation which is why the firm’s evaluation process focuses on understanding a founder’s capacity and desire to sustain development over time. The main focus of Eka’s founder diligence is pre-term sheet and involves the founder-CEO or multiple founders says Camilla Dolan a general partner at the firm.

The process has four stages and it takes 90 minutes for a founder to complete their part of the evaluation. Eka can run the process in under a week.

The evaluation begins with a structured founder interview covering the candidate’s experience to date the non-professional experiences that shaped them and how they got to where they are.

We look for evidence of outlier achievement in any domain — sport gaming academics career etc — as an indicator of resilience perseverance and an ability to develop rapidly

The interview focuses on a founder’s strengths and weaknesses their approach to learning their awareness of how they impact those around them and evidence of outlier achievement.

“We look for evidence of outlier achievement which can be in any domain — sport gaming academics career etc — as an indicator of resilience perseverance and an ability to develop rapidly.”

Next is a psychometric evaluation for which Eka currently uses tools provided by Korn Ferry. The last stages are three to six reference conversations with members of the existing team and previous colleagues focused on the four traits with an NPS from the referee.

“We don’t see past success as a predictor for future success” Dolan emphasises. “Our assessment is focused on trying to understand how fast someone can develop and adapt to different situations and levels of complexity.” The firm is also bringing on a full-time hire with a background in psychology and research to develop the approach further.

What’s next for founder diligence

The investors I chatted to here represent best-in-class in founder diligence. But there’s still so much more the industry can do to push diligence forward. Several areas are crying out for improvement.

The first is bias. Firms that use historical data for their frameworks risk repeating a relatively homogenous stereotype. This is especially dangerous when they use their framework to select founders.

Unfortunately that is exactly how “intuitive pattern recognition” works: a subconscious heuristic of past (perceived) successes informs the choices we make about the future. In an industry of primarily privileged white men it perpetuates the stereotypical founder persona. That disadvantages founders from different backgrounds and ignores the incredible diversity of founders that are out there.

Then there’s the fact that founder evaluations often don’t look at whether or not founders can build a great team. In her research of unicorn founders Maddy Cross former head of talent at Notion VC and now partner at Erevena found the outlier founders hired 25-30 VP/C-suite executives in the first five years most with annual salaries of more than $200000. That’s a lot of hiring.

“If investors are looking too closely at the founder they are missing out on the scalability of the founder” Cross says. “They might end up investing in a business with a founder who’s great at the early stages but who struggles to grow beyond that because without a great leadership team they have no leverage.”

As the VC industry expands and professionalises founder diligence will have to as well.

1. Invest in zero carbon energy



2. Innovate in energy efficiency



3. Empowering each other



4. Collective responsibility



5. Net zero starts from ground zero

A billionaire tech mogul dooms Earth by convincing the American government to mine rather than destroy a fast approaching comet. This forms the satirical climax of Don’t Look Up one of Netflix’s most watched films of December 2021. It is a grim warning for climate change: governments and businesses can either thwart its worst excesses or accelerate its progress.Governments and corporations have a critical role to play in shaping the planet’s future. “Every one of us needs to make sustainability a priority for the future generation to enjoy this planet as previous generations have” concurs Equinix Managing Director of South Asia Yee May Leong.Here are five ways governments and businesses can work towards a low carbon future.“The only way you can reduce carbon emissions is to use energy that doesn't use carbon in the first place” says Leong. Equinix has invested over US$3.7 billion on sustainable projects including renewable wind energy as of May 2021.Equinix aims to power their two hundred and thirty five data centers with 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and has already made significant progress states Leong. As of 2020 it is fully powered by renewable energy in Singapore.In the US Equinix powers its data centers with low carbon hydrogen fuel cells and electricity from wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma. The company will also buy energy from a wind farm in Finland in 2022.Moving forward Equinix has partnered with six other companies to fund the development of fuel cells powered by green hydrogen with €2.5 million (US$2.8 million). These fuel cells will power data centres and reduce carbon emissions significantly.It’s not just businesses making this shift. 37 per cent of electricity in the UK came from renewable energy by 2019 with 20 per cent coming from wind sources. The UK’s green investments have succeeded in nearly halving its carbon emissions over the past three decades reported Bloomberg.Beyond zero carbon energy investing in new ways of saving energy is critical says Leong. Equinix has invested more than US$130 million in energy efficiency upgrades over the past ten years she shares. They launched the Energy Efficiency Center of Excellence in 2020 to improve cooling measures and fuel cells for their data centres.Equinix is careful to reuse heat conserve water and recycle used equipment in their data centres. Its data centre in Helsinki uses excess heat to warm about 12000 nearby homes in winter shares Leong. They have also shifted to using low carbon fuel cells rather than coal-fired generators.Equinix partnered with other European data center providers and trade associations to form a climate neutral pact in 2020 representing over 90 per cent of the industry. They aim to support the transition to a climate-neutral Europe through improving energy efficiency buying clean energy and reusing heat equipment and water.In sunny Singapore where heat reuse is less necessary Equinix is exploring opportunities with universities to develop other energy saving methods explains Leong. A promising venture is blue carbon the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems. Mangroves for instance have high rates of carbon capture and can reduce overall net emissions.Knowledge is power. Equinix releases Green Power Reports which tell customers their individual carbon footprints. They can then track their progress against their sustainability goals.Equinix data centers also provide a tool that displays real-time environmental data  such as power consumption levels. These allow companies to monitor their carbon footprint and react accordingly. For instance companies can use this data to identify overworked servers and redistribute workloads.Similarly Singapore has rolled out individual power reports for citizens to monitor their consumption. A mobile app that provides residents with electricity usage reports and a carbon footprint tracker has been released by Singapore’s electricity provider SP Group along with the Energy Market Authority and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.With individualised reports citizens and consumers can make informed decisions and adjust their consumption patterns accordingly.Companies and organisations can come together to pool resources. For instance companies can rent data servers from a shared facility rather than building and maintaining their own centres. This minimises resource consumption.“Every house wants a swimming pool of their own. Can we share the swimming pool?” questions Leong. It is vital to practice responsible consumption and share our resources to reduce our environmental impact.On the most fundamental level organisations can reduce emissions at home. Equinix carefully considers its supply chains to ensure they are buying from sustainable sources explains Leong.Equinix is partnering with its top suppliers of goods and services to set their own targets for carbon reduction by 2025 such as construction contractors as well as backup generator and refrigerant companies. Equinix has also set a science-based target to be climate neutral and reduce supply chain emissions from fuel and energy-related activities by 50 per cent by 2030.The Singapore government has encouraged its agencies to buy sustainably from 2006. The civil service has since moved towards only buying paper products certified with The Green Label Singapore’s environmental standard and certification mark reported The Straits Times in 2016.“If every one of us works through our supply chains to reduce carbon emissions the net overall effect should be a positive one” Leong notes.“Don’t look up” chant the comet deniers of the 2021 satire. With these five strategies governments and businesses can look ahead to reduce carbon emissions and safeguard the planet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Modera Prominence sits on 2.8 acres and has approximately 319000 square feet of rentable area with an average apartment size coming in just over 1000 square feet. The ground-floor retail area wraps the corner of Lenox and Piedmont totals approximately 21000 square feet.

“Modera Prominence is the epitome of luxury in Buckhead” Joseph Jacobs Wexford Real Estate Investors President and Cofounder said. “Working with Mill Creek was a privilege and it was our pleasure to partner with them on this project.”

Cushman & Wakefield’s Sunbelt Multifamily Advisory Group marketed and sold the property. Members from that team included Alex Brown Executive Director and Robert Stickel Executive Vice-Chair. Representing Mill Creek Residential Trust were John Harkey Senior Vice President of Asset Management and Patrick Chesser Senior Managing Director of Development.

“Modera Prominence is yet another fantastic and successful development by Mill Creek Residential in the Atlanta market” Stickel said. “They and their partner Wexford Real Estate Investors saw the benefits of Buckhead’s access to various job centers and unique features of the city including Path 400 and Chastain Park.”

“The buyer Lone Star grew upon its presence in Buckhead and saw the opportunity to take advantage of rent growth” Brown added. “Lone Star is in a great position to benefit from this asset especially once restaurant-driven retail opens in the area this summer.”

Wexford Real Estate Investors has been very active since Q4 2021 with several multimillion-dollar deals completed. In December Wexford Real Estate Investors and Key International teamed up to acquire the Pompano Beach Marriott Hotel for $54 million with plans to renovate the 219-key property.

Wexford Real Estate Investors also announced a joint venture with Beztak to develop an eight-story 277-unit Bocora apartment project located in Boca Raton on a 4.1-acre site they purchased together for $12.7 million. Then in late September Wexford Real Estate Investors partnered with NYC-based L&L Holding Company and Miami-based 13th Floor Investments to pursue a transit-oriented mixed-use development in Downtown West Palm Beach with the acquisition of a prime 2.6-acre assemblage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2JvdWdodC1hLWhvdXNlLXdpdGgtYmVzdC1mcmllbmQtMzcwMzQyNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Bought a House with My Best Friend — Here's How We Did It,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/bought-a-house-with-best-friend-37034268 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2JvdWdodC1hLWhvdXNlLXdpdGgtYmVzdC1mcmllbmQtMzcwMzQyNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Ever wondered what your soulmate looks like? No me neither. But in the spirit of stepping out of my comfort zone I decided to step into the world of the paranormal.

Now for someone who has no religion or sense of ‘fate’ I found this quite an uncomfortable notion.

With some (brief) research I came across MysticPsychicAva - an Etsy seller offering drawings readings spells and more.

READ MORE: Bristol bodybuilder used to be bullied at school for being small

After closing the tab multiple times I hesitantly entered my name and birth date then clicked 'buy'. Apparently that's all the info needed for an accurate reading.

I’m not entirely sure why but the idea of a stranger telling me about myself made me twitchy so I pushed it to the back of my mind and got on with my day.

But then a message appeared the subject read: “Your Future Soulmate.""

A sudden wave of nerves came over me and I quickly closed the notification. What if it looks like an ex? What if it looks like my best friend’s brother’s fiancée's dad? What if it looks like that guy everyone had a crush on in year nine?

But I’d paid my £8.85 so the least I could do was take a quick glance at the sketch.

Newsflash: it doesn’t look like anyone I’ve ever met. So I guess that either means Ava’s drawn a generic male face for me or I’ve not yet met the man of my dreams. I’ll let you make your mind up about that.

(Image: MysticPsychicAva)

Along with the drawing Psychic Ava gave me a description of this dream man. Obviously she mentioned a special type of connection - I wouldn’t expect any less of my soulmate - but luckily she delved a little deeper.

Some of what Psychic Ava told me rang true: “I know that you almost lost the hope that there is actually someone out there to unite a genuine path with but you also know that good things come to those who wait!”

However some aspects felt a little farcical: “Your road took you into this beautiful position where you are a fully matured woman wise in thoughts and moral in actions and this is the exact kind of evolution that made you ready for him.”

I’m not sure ‘mature’ will ever be a word I identify with but I must trust Ava's intuition.

Not having much experience of the psychic world I’m not entirely sure how much detail mediums are supposed to go into but I would have liked to know a little more about this potential love interest’s physical appearance than just: “Your future partner embodies a tall presentable figure that's nice to the eye.”

After a bit of fluff about how his hardworking tendencies will provide for his wife Ava turned up the heat. So Mum Dad - if you’re reading this maybe skip the next few paragraphs…

To quote her directly: “Waking up in the morning alongside such a man will transform you into a happy soul. A morning kiss and a sincere hug will set you ready for a truly productive day and just let me tell you that thinking on what follows at night will also make up for a very sexy energy incentive during the day!

“Being twin flames at the same time is causing your sexual chemistry to spark like a volcano and this is just something that you will both recognize from the start. [...] He is a strong man and knows how to ‘handle’ the situation at night by making you relax and embark on the beautiful trip of sensual prelude and personal closeness.”

Did it just get warm in here?

Well I think that’s a good place to stop. She concluded the reading with the relationship compatibility which came to a fairly satisfying 88 per cent.

So do I believe much of what Psychic Ava told me? No not really. Do I believe there's really a single soulmate out there for me? Nope.

Did I enjoy receiving the reading? Yes I’m very glad to know my future love will look like an over 25s X-Factor contestant - it’s really going to help me to filter out any future dates.

Lastly I think we need to address the possibility that Psychic Ava might really know what she’s talking about. So if you’re reading this and the drawing looks like you name a place and a time and I’ll be there.

It is written in the stars after all.

A newborn baby was fed to guard dogs in a gulag starving prisoners were executed for scrounging for edible plants in the dirt and religious minorities such as Christians were tortured North Korean defectors told the International Bar Association War Crimes Committee.

Up to 130000 people have been imprisoned by Kim across his network of labour camps.

His regime continues to pump out a steady stream of propaganda and this week a video of Kim riding a white horse was released by the Pyongyang Broadcast Service.

The bizarre video was released following health fears surrounding the despot.

Video from earlier this month shows Kim apparently struggling to walk down a slope and looking far slimmer than he did just two years ago.

Regime propaganda claims the despot's body ""completely withered away"" last year out of ""suffering"" for the people of his impoverished nation.

Heineken Champions Cup winner Damian Browne is ready for his next adventure and it will not leave his followers disappointed.

After he retired from rugby in 2015 the Galway native has been travelling the world challenging his body and his mind from Sahara to Mount Everest and the Atlantic Ocean.

Now Damian is ready for his next challenge as he is training to row almost 5000km from New York to his hometown Galway.

However this time he will not be alone as his friend Fergus Farrell will be by his side.

Damian explained to Galway Beo: “So there’s two of us in the boat and we’re both Galwegians and we’re both leaving New York around mid May this year and we hopefully arrive in Galway in July or August.”

He added with excitement: “It’s a huge exciting time getting ready and getting all the final preparations finishing our training period getting the boat getting all the equipment getting our food getting everything dialed in.”

“I’m very excited I love things when they’re really difficult the last Atlantic row was really difficult but even then I knew that someday I would do another one and now here it is.”

The adventurer already faced the Atlantic Ocean in 2018 when he rowed five thousand kilometres across the Atlantic ocean solo and unsupported.

Damian revealed to Galway Beo he still considers that experience the most difficult challenge he has ever done so far.

He said: “The Atlantic Ocean was just a monster. Any time you feel someway comfortable she will knock you down and make you very uncomfortable. She is just relentless and in terms of challenge that relentless nature becomes very difficult mentally.”

During their journey the two friends will try to share as much as they can about this crazy adventure.

Damian said: “We really want to bring people on the journey with us rowing from a city that has very strong links with Ireland and then coming to our hometown across this body of water that has a lot of historical significance between Ireland and America. I see it like a legacy piece for me.

He continued: “We’re gonna be posting videos you know life from the ocean podcasts pictures so people can get a taste of what we are experiencing.”

The former rugby player added that testing himself in these extreme environments means a demanding training program not only for his body but also for his mind.

He explained: “You have to be able to deal with it mentally which is not always easy of course.”

“I believe that the success of anything is in the preparation so I push a huge focus on being ultra prepared physically mentally technically.

“You put yourself through the worst basically in your training period in terms of the intensity of it so when it comes to the actual expedition you’re able to deal with whatever is thrown at you. Even though you know it’s gonna be difficult psychologically you’re ready.”

During his challenges Damian Browne learnt that sometimes not everything goes as planned but his training and determination helped him in the worst situations.

In 2020 he was ready to climb Mount Everest when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out.

He said: “It was very challenging because I left my partner and my five days old daughter to go up Mount Everest and take on the challenge.

“It’s very very difficult and then it became much more difficult on an emotional level when I got there. I thought it was very difficult being away from them I felt very guilty about leaving them.”

He told GalwayBeo he trained for three years to reach that goal but then during the expedition he not only suffered from altitude sickness but he also tested positive for Covid.

He said: “When you’re going through a physical illness or sickness and then you also have the emotional challenge it becomes very difficult.”

“My overriding memory of Everest is just fighting and staying in the expedition not giving up. Telling myself to hang around to find my way out through those moments and I eventually did.”

Unfortunately even if Damian’s conditions improved significantly his sherpa got Covid as well so he could not reach the very top of the mountain.

He continued: “I think I’ll go back at some point in the future but there’s no immediacy for me. I pushed three years of my life into completing The Seven Summits which are the highest mountains in each continent I have five of them done obviously I gave number six which is mountain Everest a go but it didn’t happen. So I think I’m just gonna park that goal for a little while and I'll come back to it in a few years but for now I’m gonna do different things.”

What it is sure is that Damian Browne will not stop challenging himself and finding new adventures.

He revealed: “I adore the planet I adore to travel around it and to explore it and I also find a lot of meaning in pushing my body and my mind to its current limit and pass its current limit that would have been a discovery I made in my professional rugby career.

“You get to travel the world and get to see corners very remote parts of the world parts of the world very few people get to see and get to have these magical experiences in those corners and you also get to learn more about life.

He concluded: “Easy didn’t give me anything in life. I constantly and relentlessly look for ways to challenge myself.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amazon Prime Video

Prime Video has announced it will air a Super Bowl ad this year to promote Thursday Night Football which is slated to move from Fox to Prime Video beginning in September. The move represents the NFL’s first exclusive national broadcast contract with a streaming provider. As part of Prime Video’s Thursday Night Football programming Prime Video has announced that it also plans to host pregame halftime and post-game shows. It will also offer new interactive viewing features yet to be disclosed. The Super Bowl LVI spot was created in tandem with Wieden+Kennedy and features real fans. It follows up the brand’s 2021 stunt a promo for “Coming 2 America” starring Eddie Murphy.

Anheuser-Busch

Beer behemoth Anheuser-Busch which owns Budweiser Michelob Busch Shock Top and other top beer brands returns to Super Bowl LVI this year after renewing its contract with the NFL in a multi-year extension signed in December. In a statement both the NFL and Anheuser-Busch indicated that the new contract “will include many new opportunities for the Anheuser-Busch brands led by Bud Light that will continue growing excitement among NFL fans.”

Avocados from Mexico

After a hiatus last year following a six-year participation streak Avocados from Mexico is back to the big game. It has released a teaser for its spot which sees comedy icon Andy Richter preparing to play Caesar. In full garb Richter looks into his dressing room mirror and tries to hype himself up for the part. The spot also debuts the brand’s new messaging platform “Addvocados” which endorses the idea that the smooth green fruit (yes avocados are a fruit) enhances any dish. Amidst all the action the brand has also launched ‘House of Goodness’ an immersive digital experience hosted by ex-NFLer Drew Brees. Avocados from Mexico has also rolled out in-store QR codes that direct shoppers to the brand’s website and also announced a new partnership with MikMak a firm that helps brands accelerate their e-commerce capabilities. The brand which according to data from Hass Avocado Board is responsible for 95% of avocado sales in the US has for many years hinged its growth on Super Bowl retail surges.

BIC

BIC lighters is advertising at this year's big game with the dynamic duo that is Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart. In the spot the rapper makes his way through a cloud of smoke. ""Yo Martha I didn’t know you was into this!” Stewart lifts the lid of her grill replying ""You mean smoking a turkey?"" She then offers a glowing endorsement of using a BIC EZ Reach lighter. The spot ends with Snoop suggesting that they both use the lighter for partaking in their favorite activities. The pair have appeared in BIC ads together in the past the most recently being a May 2021 spot in which they shared a 'bowl' of strawberries and fondue together. The two will also team up to host Animal Planet's annual Puppy Bowl for the second year in a row. The 80 year-old and 50 year-old will also reportedly 'coach' some of the pups partaking in the match.

BMW

BMW is back this year with a campaign headlined by A-listers Arnold Schwarzenegger and Salma Hayek Pinault who respectively star as the Greek god and goddess Zeus and Hera. The brand on February 2 released a 30-second teaser for the ad which promotes a new fully-electric model yet to be revealed. The teaser follows a January 27 Instagram post by Schwarzenegger that left fans wondering if they could expect a new Zeus-focused blockbuster in February. The ad campaign was developed with the help of creatives at AOR Goodby Silverstein & Partners.

Booking.com

As part of its larger strategy to entice traveling following pandemic blues Booking.com has purchased a 30-second spot in this year’s game. The brand is likely feeling the pressure as the category grows increasingly cutthroat; competitor Expedia will also have a Super Bowl presence.

Bud Light Seltzer

Bud Light on February 1 unveiled its Super Bowl LVI spot starring none other than celebrity chef and meme inspiration Guy Fieri. The minute-long spot sees party-goers transported to a magical place dubbed the Land of Loud Flavors which is naturally teeming with diners drive-ins and dives. And according to the beer brand it’s the obvious home for the boldly flavored Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda. As part of the campaign Bud Light Seltzer and Guy Fieri are giving fans a chance to see their name in lights at Super Bowl LVI. Through February 8 fans are invited to enter the ‘Get Your Name in the Big Game’ sweepstakes by posting on social media and using the hashtags #LandofLoudFlavors and #Sweepstakes.

Budweiser

Budweiser has unveiled its full-length Super Bowl spot after dropping two separate teasers within the last two weeks. Titled ‘A Clydesdale’s Journey’ the ad follows the story of the brand’s iconic mascot recovering after a devastating injury. The brand said in a statement that the ad directed by Academy Award-winner and Nomadland director Chloé Zhao is meant to embody “the continued resilience of the people of America.” The implications of the country’s ongoing recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic are apparent. The brand also said Zhao’s signature gritty style sets a new visual tone for the brand that will feature “a more bold and raw aesthetic.” The brewer a longtime staple at the big game returns after it sat out last year — choosing to spend its ad dollars on Covid vaccine awareness and access instead — after an unbroken 37-year run.

Busch Light

AB InBev-owned Busch Light will make a Super Bowl appearance with Grammy-winning saxophone musician Kenny G. The spot unveiled January 31 serves as a nod to Busch’s marketing origins by recycling “Head for the Mountains"" a number that originally accompanied a Busch ad from over 40 years ago. The Super Bowl spot tops of a historic year of sales for the beer brand. David Steinman vice president and executive director at Beer Marketer’s Insights told The Drum: “Busch Light is outperforming every single low-end brand. AB is keeping Busch Light high on its priority list.”

Caesars

Sports betting brand Caesars Sportsbook part of Caesars Entertainment — which includes a network of hotels and casinos — plans to run a 30-second spot in the first half of Super Bowl LVI. It will star Halle Berry JB Smoove and Peyton Eli Archie and Cooper Manning. Caesars is the NFL's exclusive casino sponsor.

Expedia

Expedia Group – which owns Orbitz Travelocity Hotels.com Hotwire and other travel brands – is also going all-in on the February 13 event. It not only secured a mid-game spot to promote its booking site Expedia but also plans to advertise its Airbnb challenger Vrbo in a pre-game spot. Expedia on February 2 debuted a behind-the-scenes teaser starring Ewan McGregor who endorses the magic of travel in recounting his memories of traveling from Scotland to France with his parents. “This is really just a vote of confidence in the travel category coming back” Jon Gieselman Expedia Brands president told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. Alongside the ad the travel brand will incentivize new sign-ups by offering exclusive mid-game giveaways of travel points for Expedia members. The campaign was developed with help from Anomaly.

DraftKings

2022 marks the second consecutive year that sports betting and fantasy sports platform DraftKings will partake in the Super Bowl. The spot will air mere weeks after New York became the 18th state to legalize online sports betting.

Frito-Lay

Snack giant Frito-Lay is going big on this year’s big game. To kick things off Frito-Lay partnered up with its parent company PepsiCo to launch a cheeky spot titled ‘Road to Super Bowl LVI’ starring Peyton and Eli Manning Terry Bradshaw Jerome ‘The Bus’ Bettis and Victor Cruz. The spot which aims to position a smattering of popular PepsiCo and Frito-Lay products as Super Bowl party necessities will run from mid-January through Super Bowl Sunday. A handful of Frito-Lay brands including Doritos and Flamin’ Hot Cheetos will have their own mid-game ads.

Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Doritos

Frito-Lay has tapped rapper and internet queen Megan Thee Stallion to serve as the face of its Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Doritos Super Bowl spot. On January 19 the brand dropped one of three teasers for the ad; in it Megan arrives at her Super Bowl photo shoot munching on a bag of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. To prepare her a handler checks to make sure she has no allergies to sloths or water buffaloes and that she’s comfortable working with crocodiles. “A croc-a-what?” exclaims the rapper. The spot closes with the tagline: ‘Unleash your Flamin’ Hot.’ The spot comes on the tails of a recent portfolio expansion; Frito-Lay debuted its new Doritos Flamin’ Hot Cool Ranch last month.

After releasing three separate teasers for its campaign Frito-Lay’s Flamin’ Hot label on February 1 dropped its full-length 60-second Super Bowl spot that features the vocal stylings of Megan Thee Stallion and beatboxing by Charlie Puth. Created in tandem with Goodby Silverstein & Partners and directed by Tom Kuntz the spot sees a cast of curious animals — from sloths and deer to water buffaloes and bears get their paws (and hooves and feet) on Flamin’ Hot Doritos and Cheetos. Their surprise and delight is magnified by Megan The Stallion’s and Charlie Puth’s rendition of Salt-N-Pepa’s 80s hit ‘Push It.’ 2022 will be the first year that Flamin’ Hot will have its own in-game spot featuring both its Cheetos and Doritos products. The spot is meant to create hype around the recently released Doritos Flamin’ Hot Cool Ranch flavor.

Lay’s

Frito-Lay mainstay Lay’s is making its grand return to gameday screens after 17 years. To usher in its big return the brand has tapped Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. Following the release of two seperate teasers Lay's unveiled the full-length spot on February 2. Made in partnership with creatives at Highdive the ad sees the two stars munching on Lay's and reminiscing on their favorite memories together — which include everything from a road trip to a kidnapping — as Rogen prepares to tie the knot. Rogen developed the script alongside his creative partner Evan Goldberg. The snack aisle staple brand also recently debuted its limited-edition potato chip made with potatoes grown in soil extracted from NFL stadiums for super fans and the superstitious alike.

Kia

Kia America has secured a 60-second spot in this year’s big game to promote its all-electric Kia EV6. The ad released February 4 following a teaser features an adorable robotic puppy who upon seeing a man charge his EV6 feels he’s found his ideal human buddy and follows him relentlessly until he makes it into the man’s life — and car. Super Bowl LVI will mark the brand’s 13th big game appearance a number of which have focused on the company’s various ‘Accelerate the Good’ philanthropic ventures including the ‘Great Unknowns Scholarship’ program which funded educational assistance for students in need and the ‘Yards for Homelessness’ project that offers resources for US youth experiencing homelessness. This year’s ad was created in partnership with El Segundo California-based branding agency David&Goliath.

General Motors

American automaker GM is returning for its third consecutive Super Bowl following a third quarter that saw the company’s revenues top analysts’ projections. GM could be in an especially favorable position at February’s event considering that competitors Audi and Hyundai – both of which have been regular Super Bowl advertisers – have opted to sit on the sidelines this year. Nissan and Toyota however will make appearances.

Gillette

Procter & Gamble razor brand Gillette is returning to the big game after a 16 year dry spell. The brand is making a comeback to promote its new GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar. The brand will air a 30-second spot that aims to stress the simplicity and speed of using the razor. Featuring the tagline ’A quick and easy shave’ the spot was created in partnership with creatives at Grey Advertising. The campaign will be augmented with various activations in Los Angeles throughout Super Bowl weekend including a branded roller skating event that suggests shaving with the GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar is as smooth as gliding across the roller disco floor.

Google

Google is returning to the Super Bowl after sitting out last year’s event per reports from Ad Age. The tech titan has yet to share details of its plans. In 2020 the company ran a tearjerker that promoted the company’s digital search and Google Assistant capabilities through the story of an elderly man trying to ensure he doesn’t forget his long-time partner.

Hellmann's

Unilever's condiment brand Hellman's is back for its second consecutive year with a spot created by WPP-owned Wunderman Thompson. The ad stars New England Patriots linebacker coach and former NFL star Jerod Mayo who is tapped by the fictional Terry Tate — the iconic 'Office Linebacker' character from early-2000s Reebok ads played by former NFLer Lester Speight — to tackle the challenge of combatting food waste. Unilever suggests that 40% of all food waste occurs within households and that major food events like the Super Bowl exacerbate the problem. At the same time Hellmann's is likely to continue to see sales surge thanks to pandemic-related upticks in condiment consumption.

Meta

Following its major rebrand that has come with not only a new name but a new vision for the future of the company Meta (formerly Facebook) has announced it will return to the big game after a hiatus last year. The tech giant on February 2 debuted a teaser for its ad which spotlights the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset. It will not only air an ad during the first quarter of the big game but also plans to run a full version of the teaser “Old Friends New Fun” on ABC’s Good Morning America ahead of the event on February 10. The brand worked with Anomaly to bring the spot to life. Increasing ad spend may help improve brand image on the tails of a post-rebrand stock spike that has since fizzled.

Monday.com

Sneak Peak! Here's a behind the scenes of how we created a world without limits for our Big Game spot ️#WorkWithoutLimits #BigGameSpot #mondaydotcom #WorkOS pic.twitter.com/pvw2F8LJG8 — monday.com (@mondaydotcom) January 25 2022

Cloud work management software company monday.com on January 25 announced it would be participating in Super Bowl LVI. monday.com teamed up with content agency Mustache to develop the spot. It released a behind-the-scenes teaser for the ad across its social platforms explaining that it took two directors five scripts and 95 crew members 10 stunt performers and much more to bring the concept to life. The whole project was of course created and managed through monday.com. It’s a step up from the brand’s first ad which run in 2018 had about a $50 budget. NFL The NFL will advertise during its own event this year. Though it’s unclear what the spot will look like the brand has in recent years focused on boosting fan engagement and improving its brand image through tactics focused on connecting real players with consumers in fun accessible ways through various media and fashion activations. Nissan

Japanese automaker Nissan returns to this year’s game for the first time since 2015. The brand has released its 60-second spot entitled ‘Thrill Driver’ an action flick-inspired film featuring A-listers Eugene Levy Brie Larson Danai Gurira and Dave Bautista. The ad developed in partnership with TBWA/Chiat/Day promotes both the new Ariya an electric crossover and the 2023 Nissan Z. The brand’s US chief marketer Allyson Witherspoon told Ad Age in December “Super Bowl isn’t something that we always do… but it is something we felt was important for this year. We have one of the freshest lineups in the industry and so we want… an opportunity on a platform such as Super Bowl to show what we have been up to as a brand.” Oikos

Greek yogurt brand Oikos is back for its third consecutive big game. The ad released February 2 stars father-and-son duo Deion ‘Prime Time’ Sanders and Shedeur Sanders. The two go head-to-head in a domestic chore competition taking on raking wood-chopping and car maintenance while trying to out-manpower one another. The brand positions its sugar- and fat-free Oikos Triple Zero and Oikos Pro as healthy snacks that go well with high-intensity labor and exercise — even if they can’t promise Herculean strength. The yogurt brand is also launching a sweepstakes in which consumers can win a limited-edition Strong Bowl billed as a “​first-of-its-kind super heavy bowl that holds your Oikos product and doubles as a 15lb weight — so you can get some reps in before the coin toss and chip dip.” Pepsi

Pepsi is the Super Bowl LVI halftime show sponsor. The brand is promoting the show starring Snoop Dogg Eminem Dr. Dre Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar through its new Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show mobile app which includes sweepstakes opportunities behind-the-scenes content creative drops augmented reality (AR) features and unique digital experiences leading up to the show. Pepsi has yet to reveal which of its brands will appear in TV spots during the telecast. In a statement shared with The Drum however the company asserted that 90% of households “will be enjoying snacks and beverages together on Super Bowl Sunday” indicating that it understands the valuable opportunities presented for its brands. Planet Fitness

Planet Fitness’ Super Bowl LVI spot pokes fun at Lindsay Lohan’s spotted past daring to ask “What’s gotten into Lindsay Lohan?” The ad created in partnership with Le Truc and AOR Publicis New York features the star herself. It depicts the actress feeling the positive effects of a newly active lifestyle: she’s trading nightclubs for good sleep and DUIs for DIY projects. Planet Fitness is this year celebrating its 30th anniversary.

Pringles

Kellogg’s Pringles will make a Super Bowl appearance for its fifth straight year with a 30-second spot developed in conjunction with creatives at WPP’s New York-based Grey Group. The brand’s 2021 spot tapped into hype around aliens SpaceX Blue Origin and a renewed cultural interest in space – mere months before the US government revealed it has long-standing evidence of UFOs – with a lighthearted tale of aerospace engineers getting distracted from important missions by the joy of stacking different flavors of Pringles to create new combos.

Salesforce

Web software company Salesforce has a new brand partner and advisor: actor Matthew McConaughey. On February 4 the brand launched its new global ad campaign ‘#TeamEarth’. In a statement the brand said the campaign “aims to inspire businesses and individuals to help build a more fair equal and sustainable future.” It kicked off the campaign with a TV spot starring McConaughey that will air during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. The ad will also appear during Super Bowl LVI.

Squarespace

Squarespace in 2022 will continue its tradition of advertising at the big game— it has made an appearance each year since 2014 with the exception of 2019. On February 3 the brand unveiled a 10-second teaser for the spot headlined by Euphoria star Zendaya cast in a mermaid-like look. The teaser features the tagline: “Everything to sell anything” which then transforms to read: “Everything to shell anything.” This year’s spot is the brand’s first creative to come out of its new Los Angeles office.

Taco Bell

Fast food chain Taco Bell will make an appearance at Super Bowl LVI; it will be the brand’s first such effort in five years. Created in conjunction with Deutsch LA the spot aims to put a fresh spin on the brand’s Live Más slogan which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary. It will star rapper and pop artist Doja Cat. The announcement comes on the heels of a couple of major developments for the brand – the December appointment of ex-Nike exec Sean Tresvant as chief brand officer and the more recent rollout of the Taco Lover’s Pass a $10-per-month taco subscription service. The brand’s Super Bowl spot could further fan the flames of brand love.

Toyota

Toyota has said it will return to the big game this year though it has shared few details. The brand has in past years had a major presence at the event airing two ads in 2015 and three ads in 2018. The brand last year ran a touching spot celebrating the story of Team Toyota athlete Jessica Long a paralympic swimmer. Toyota like other carmakers has fared much better than Wall Street predicted in the last year or so (Q3 earnings indicate that topline revenue jumped over 7% year-on-year). Super Bowl exposure certainly won’t hamper this growth.

Telemundo

Telemundo has unveiled its Super Bowl LVI spot a high-energy ad promoting the 2022 World Cup featuring iconic sports announcer Andres Cantor. In the spot Cantor ignites a global wave of his signature “Goooooooooool” cry with clips of everyone from soccer stars yogis and choir singers to Kelly Clarkson Blake Shelton and the Despicable Me minions chiming in. The spot builds on the network’s 2018 Super Bowl ad featuring the same refrain. At this year’s big game Telemundo and Universo will offer exclusive Spanish-language coverage ahead of the game led by Emmy-winning sports anchor Miguel Gurwitz. The new ad was created by Telemundo’s in-house team.

TurboTax

Intuit-owned TurboTax returns in 2022 for its ninth Super Bowl in a row. In partnership with creatives at Wieden+Kennedy Portland the brand will promote its tax-filing services ahead of Tax Day in April. But the spot won’t be the brand’s only presence during NFL playoffs this year; TurboTax Live is the lead sponsor of the playoff and postseason title games for both the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference.

Turkish Airlines

Turkish Airlines will join a handful of other travel brands at Super Bowl LVI. The brand makes its appearance after two years off. Travel is set to make a major comeback in 2022 — recent Tripadvisor research indicates that this year’s travel numbers are likely to surpass those of pre-pandemic 2019. In anticipation of the boom travel brands like Turkish Airlines are sure to be competing harder than ever for consumer dollars.

Uber Eats

Uber Eats has released a handful of rollicking teasers for its Super Bowl spot that sees stars including Gwyneth Paltrow Trevor Noah and Jennifer Coolidge sampling inedible goods that were delivered alongside their foodstuffs. In one clip Paltrow takes a bite out of a candle declaring that it tastes “funny — not bad but funny.” The campaign highlights Uber Eats’ transformation to food delivery service to well anything-you-might-need delivery service. The full spot was concepted in partnership with Special Group and was directed by Jake Szymanski known for his work for SNL Digital Shorts and Funny or Die. The campaign will also encompass out-of-home elements including creative featuring the same A-listers as well as shopping bags emblazoned with the tagline “Uber Don’t Eats”.

Vrbo

Expedia Group-owned vacation rental platform Vrbo has unleased its 60-second Super Bowl LVI pregame spot created in partnership with Wieden+Kennedy. Titled 'A Place For Together' the ad is a heartwarming display of the joys of gathering with loved ones and friends — set against Kermit the Frog's ""Right Where I Belong"" from The Muppets Take Manhattan. ""When traveling with Vrbo who you're with matters just as much as where you go"" Hector Muelas Expedia Group's senior vice-president of global creative said in a statement. ""Our definition of family isn't limited to people you're related to; it includes anyone you love spending time with.""

Vroom

New York-based used car retailer and e-commerce platform Vroom is suiting up for its second year running. The brand on January 20 unveiled its Broadway-inspired spot with choreography by La La Land choreographer Mandy Moore. In a statement shared with The Drum a brand spokesperson said the spot is mean to ""illustrate the rollercoaster of emotions that car sellers feel when they find a buyer on a peer-to-peer site who flakes on the transaction."" The effort could help Vroom maintain its e-commerce momentum; in the third quarter of 2021 the company reported that e-commerce unit sales were up 123% year-on-year. WeatherTech Automotive equipment and accessories company WeatherTech is making its ninth appearance at the Super Bowl and is following up its performance last year when it ran two mid-game ads with a new spot created in partnership with the full-service agency Pinnacle.

Newcomers to the big game:

Sam's Club

Grocery chain Sam’s Club will make its first foray into Super Bowl advertising this February with a playful spot starring Kevin Hart. Made in conjunction with VMLY&R with help from Hart’s company Laugh Out Loud Network the ad depicts Hart shopping in Sam’s Club. Hart believes he’s receiving VIP treatment throughout the store — he mistakes an outdoor furniture staging as a VIP lounge and thinks he’s allowed to use the store’s Scan & Go option (rather than wait in the checkout line) because he’s a celebrity. Little does he know that Sam’s Club treats all its members like this. In a statement the brand said “Kevin’s authenticity and humor made him the perfect fit for the warehouse retailer who is continuing to experiment with new ways to reach members while highlighting the benefits of being part of the club.” The retailer has hinted at additional gameday VIP offers but has yet to share details. Carvana

Popular online car marketplace Carvana is making its first foray in Super Bowl advertising this year. The 30-second spot plays on a concept many consumers can relate to: a chatty mom. The ad called “Oversharing Mom” depicts a mother who won’t stop raving about her recent purchase of a Mini Cooper on Carvana. She extolls the customer service and ease of the whole ordeal — selling points that the brand is focused on promoting as competitive differentiators in the used car space. The brand is a direct competitor of another Super Bowl LVI advertiser: Vroom. ClickUp

Project management platform ClickUp has unveiled its first-ever Super Bowl spot a mere three months after closing its Series C funding round which raked in $400m. The new ad created almost entirely by the brand's in-house team is a rollicking reimagination of the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence. In it a bumbling John Hancock seems to have misplaced the latest version of the document to the great distress of all his colleagues. Luckily ""Tommy"" a youthful redheaded rendition of Thomas Jefferson has saved the task on ClickUp. When one of the Founding Fathers goes to sign with a feathered quill Jefferson butts in: ""No no no no — just click!"" The document is signed and the group rejoices. Crypto.com The popular cryptocurrency marketplace which has witnessed incredible growth in the past year-plus will make its Super Bowl debut this year. The move comes after the company shelled out $700m to rebrand the Staples Center the Crypto.com Arena and announced it will also sponsor the city’s new professional women’s soccer team the Angel City Football Club. FTX Another manifestation of the boom of crypto Bahamian-based exchange FTX will run an ad at this year’s big game. Chief exec Sam Bankman-Fried said to Bloomberg: “There is no bigger more mainstream event to share a message like that than the Super Bowl.” Bankman-Fried owns the title of the richest person in crypto today. Intuit QuickBooks Accounting software QuickBooks which is owned by Intuit plans to air an ad at Super Bowl LVI as part of its ongoing ‘Early Start’ campaign which aims to shine a spotlight on the double-edged-sword nature of small business ownership and promote QuickBooks tools for new small businesses. Intuit predicts that this year more than 17m new small businesses will be launched representing a much higher rate than has been seen in recent years. “Many of these new entrepreneurs will be watching the big game and as they begin their journeys we want to make sure we’re supporting them with the confidence to start and grow their business from day one with QuickBooks and [our recent acquisition] MailChimp” Javier Martin QuickBooks’ global brand development director told The Drum. Intuit has previously run Super Bowl ads for its brand but this will be QuickBooks’s first foray. The company will also put out a Super Bowl spot for another one of its brands TurboTax. Rakuten

Rakuten Rewards a US branch of Japanese e-commerce titan Rakuten plans to join in on the fun with an ad that builds on Rakuten’s recent rebrand including its new creative platform and slogan ‘We bring the Cha-ching.’ The brand’s vice-president of brand and creative Victoria McRae told The Drum that this concept offered the perfect foundation on which to build the campaign because it ties the feeling of getting cash back to winning or scoring a good deal. “What better place to share that emotion than at the Super Bowl?” A team of in-house creatives developed the spot for which Rakuten Rewards unveiled a teaser featuring Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham. In it Waddingham is seen practicing her deliciously evil laugh in a dressing room mirror before experiencing a minor hiccup. Hologic In its first-ever consumer advertising effort Hologic a medical tech company focused primarily on improving women’s health will run a 30-second spot during the first half of Super Bowl LVI. The spot which was brought to life by CHÉ Creative and directed by popular commercial and music video director child. is meant to express that if the always-booked-and-busy Mary J. Blige can make time to get her annual women’s health screenings then regular patients can too. The brand told The Drum that Blige was the right spokesperson for the campaign because she has a track record of advocating for women’s health issues among Black women through the Black Women’s Health Imperative and with Hologic’s Project Health Equality program. The effort is part of Hologic’s broader Well-Woman campaign which includes resources to help people learn about different types of diagnostic screenings for women. The initiative was developed after Hologic found in its proprietary research that nearly 50% of American women it surveyed did not get their annual health screenings in the last year. In addition to airing nationally during the game the ad will run from February 13-20 in select local markets. Hologic also plans to advertise during the Winter Olympics in an effort to reach as wide a market as possible. Wallbox Barcelona-based electric vehicle (EV) charging brand Wallbox will this year make its Super Bowl debut with the brand’s chief marketer Barbara Calixto telling Ad Age: “The US is going to be one of the largest markets for EVs in the coming years. We’re going to the Super Bowl because that’s where our consumers are. Any potential EV car buyer is a potential Wallbox buyer as well.” The company offers charging equipment for various private and public applications.

Sitting on the sidelines:

Chipotle Chipotle the fast-casual chain that last year jumped on CBS’s reduced price tags on Super Bowl spots will sit out this year’s big game despite seeing strong growth during the pandemic (2021 third-quarter earnings indicate that revenue was up almost 22% year-on-year). Coca-Cola Coca-Cola announced that they will be punting on the game. After all PepsiCo is blistering the airwaves and Interwebs with promos for its Pepsi half-time show. Other PepsiCo brands are likely to bask in the Super Bowl spotlight as well. Fiverr B2B brand Fiverr which has invested a lot in recent advertising efforts has decided to surpass opportunities presented by this year’s game. Last year the company’s chief marketer Gail Arnon struck a different tune telling The Drum in January: “We obviously want to be and are aspiring to be one of the biggest brands out there so the Super Bowl is the stage for us.” Hyundai Carmaker Hyundai will not air an ad during Super Bowl LVI marking its second year out of the spotlight. Prior to last year the brand had run ads in 12 of the previous 15 Super Bowls. Kraft Heinz In a similar vein as Hyundai Kraft Heinz will sit out this year’s game for the second year running. The decision is a far cry from the brand’s previous strategy; in 2020 Heinz went all-in running four unique spots at the same time in a split-screen mashup while the company’s popular peanut brand Planters also aired a spot. Lexus Toyota-owned Lexus which first made its Super Bowl debut 10 years ago will sit out this year’s event. Mars Wrigley Candy giant Mars Wrigley which owns brands including M&M’s Skittles and Snickers will pass up this year’s event having previously participated in 12 consecutive Super Bowl games. Tide A surprising development considering the brand has in recent years established a notable presence at the event Tide plans to sit on the sidelines in 2022. Last year it garnered laughs with its wacky Jason Alexander hoodie spot.

Other noteworthy activations:

Animal Planet The network plans to offer a series of NFT trading cards to promote its annual Puppy Bowl event. The move adds to a growing wave of branded NFT offerings as crypto markets heat up. Twitter Twitter on January 31 called for fans to tweet their ""wildest Super Bowl predictions"" in six or fewer words. The social network says it will project select tweets on the roof of SoFi stadium in Inglewood California during the game. The move adds to a pattern of Super Bowl activations for the brand; in 2020 and 2021 Twitter teamed up with NFL to drop confetti containing fans' tweets after the big game. State Farm

Instead of running a traditional in-game ad (few can forget Super Bowl LV’s ‘Drake From State Farm’ spot featuring the Canadian rapper alongside Patrick Mahomes Aaron Rodgers and Paul Rudd) the insurance firm is launching a TikTok challenge. The #TeamStateFarm challenge sees the iconic brand voice Jake from State Farm play a talent scout on the lookout for TikTok’s best and brightest — to star in a commercial alongside him. In a campaign video Jake invites users to use the platform’s ‘Duet’ feature to show him what they’ve got. Winners will have the opportunity to join a special meet and greet with Jake and will have their own role in an upcoming State Farm commercial.

Subway

Popular fast-casual franchise Subway has launched 'The Vault' an exclusive new menu featuring sandwiches created by top US athletes available only online and through the Subway app. Three of the new subs were created by NFLers Russell Wilson Marshawn Lynch and Trevor Lawrence. To turn up the excitement Subway is offering fans the chance to enter the 'Subway Vault' at the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s in Los Angeles and potentially win a sandwich signed by one of the three football superstars. “Our athlete partners are some of our most passionate Subway fans so it was a natural fit to create a collection of their favorite sandwiches and Super Bowl LVI is the ideal location to introduce these sandwiches and The Vault to our fans” said Carrie Walsh Subway's global chief marketing officer in a statement.

Quaker

PepsiCo subsidiary Quaker is launching ‘Pregrain with Quaker Oats’ a new campaign that puts oats at the heart of gameday celebrations. As part of the initiative the brand is giving away limited-edition 6-packs of Quaker Oats to get football fans fed and fired up for the main event. Fans can enter to win the special edition oats by commenting on Quaker’s Instagram post tagging a friend and adding the hashtags #QuakerPregrain and #Sweepstakes. 100 fans will win oats ahead of Super Bowl LVI.

Vita Coco

To help fans recover from their Super Bowl celebrations Coconut water Vita Coco is launching its Hangover Shop on February 14 the day after the big game. Consumers can pick out hangover helpers and have items like Advil DiGiorno frozen pizzas and of course Vita Coco delivered to their doorsteps in mere minutes. As a pilot program the shop will be available on major food delivery platforms in New York City Miami and Los Angeles. The activation is part of Vita Coco’s larger service The Hangover Subscription which enables consumers to sign up for automatic coconut water deliveries ten days before all major holidays — including the Super Bowl. The brand has also announced a partnership with Lyft to help fans make it home safely after the big game. Riders can enter the discount code COCOMODE for $10 of their ride — and a playful map interface that displays available cars as coconuts — on February 13 and 14.

After system files you've got less than 700GB of free space for games and those games average around 25GB but can go past 100GB in size.

But there's good news. After a few OS updates your PS5's second internal hard drive slot which was initially deactivated when the PS5 was first released is now available for use. That means you can use a sold-separately M.2 drive (a type of solid state storage drive) to store and play both PS5 and PS4 games from.

Much like the PS5 itself or desktop graphics cards some phones and even new cars pandemic supply chain issues have made these M.2 solid state drives hard to find especially in the most popular console-ready sizes. That appears to be easing now and two of the three drives we've tested are available right now (the Corsair a new model doesn't appear to be in stock yet).

We've gathered advice on some of the best M.2 drives for your PS5 in our guide. But if your preferred model is unavailable how much of a difference does it make if you buy something else?

The Samsung 980 Pro. Joe Kaminski/CNET

To figure this out my colleagues and I tested three M.2 drives specially marketed as being PS5-ready. We tested the Seagate Firecuda 530 the Samsung 980 Pro and the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX all of which included a built-in heat sink. Prices on these jump around a good deal but the 2TB version of each currently runs between $350-$400.

Watch this: PS5 M.2 drives compared and tested 04:46

For each drive we took a game with a smaller file size and a game with a larger file size and timed how long it took for the PS5 to transfer the game files between the internal PS5 drive and the new M.2 secondary drive and also how long it took for the files to make a return trip from the M.2 drive to the internal drive. It's a casual test but works as a general guide for comparing these very similar drives.

In all three cases transferring from the internal drive to the new M.2 drive was faster than the reverse writing back to the internal drive. Note the internal drive has a read/write speed of 5500MBps while the Seagate Firecuda is listed as 7300MBps. The Samsung is listed at up to 7000MBps read/write and the Corsair at 7100MBps read and 6800MBps write.

Based on this it's fine to shop based on availability price and capacity.

You've probably seen the Huawei P50 Pocket online in the hero Premium Edition livery with golden-colored ornamented glass panels. That's not the one that ended up at our doorstep but after the initial mild disappointment we came to appreciate our white unit's less flashy appearance.

Mind you even in this comparatively more restrained attire the Pocket is anything but ordinary. It almost feels redundant saying that about a foldable phone but even as foldables go this one is hard to miss.

Huawei made sure to craft the Pocket in such a way that it stands out thanks to the two circular islands on the top half and the distinct finishes of the panels. Having said that if you'd prefer your bendy phone to be less conspicuous the black variant if it's available in your market may be just the right understated flat shell with a screen that still folds in half on the inside.

Going back to our white review unit we have to reiterate that we are fans of both the color and the crosshatch pattern that's just barely felt by your fingertips yet can't go unnoticed by your eyes. It is debatable just how grippy it is and the answer will probably vary from person to person but we'd say it feels more secure than a frosted matte back and about on par with a glossy glass one.

We also found ourselves unable to reach a consensus whether the back feels nice and premium or cheap and tacky. For what it's worth the reviewer writing these words is in the former camp.

The two black circles serve a different purpose each. One houses the cameras and is raised up a bit so we can call that an island. The other is home to the cover display and sits flush with the back panel. The overall look is in line with the non-Pocket P50 and P50 Pro only there the two black circles are placed on a common raised platform. On the Pocket here Huawei managed to fit the display within the available thickness so no protrusion was necessary for the bottom circle.

The display is on the small side at just over an inch in diameter but that's the size that worked well with the camera cluster so you can have two identically-sized circles. It's useful for showing a clock and notifications as well as a basic viewfinder for the rear cameras.

The two halves of the Pocket are outlined by metal frames on the sides shiny polished silver ones for the white colorway. The side frame continues onto the back where two aluminum strips meet in the middle of the unfolded phone making for something of an accent amidst the checkered pattern. It's a very similar construction in principle to the Z Flip3's.

The hinge and the way the display folds inside is different between the two however. The Pocket's inner screen bends around a larger radius than the Flip's and it forms sort of a water droplet shape at the fold inside the body with the two halves left parallel when closed. That's in contrast to the Flip that folds with a smaller radius and leaves the two parts at an angle.

The Pocket's different bending implementation allows it to essentially close tight leaving no gap between the two halves. That is there's no gap that you can see between the frame but there's inevitably some air between the two halves of the display - which of course you want in order to avoid damaging them.

Next to the Pocket the Flip looks almost like an early prototype design with its non-parallel halves and 2mm gap at the hinge end.

There's also the matter that the Pocket manages to be visibly and tangibly thinner. That's in part just perceptual thanks to the curved frame (it's flat on the Flip) but also very objectively measurable due to the different screen bending concept and consequently the gapless closing.

Oh and why didn't we start with this? The Pocket's crease in the middle of the display when opened is both shallower and less... sharp than the Flip's. It's something you easily can appreciate with your eyes but also with your fingertips. Creases on foldables are among those things we like to say are there if you look for them but tend to disappear as you become one with your phone but on the Pocket there's just less of it to begin with for your brain to learn ignore as time passes.

We haven't seen Huawei claim a certain number of folds that the hinge and display are tested for and that probably makes sense at this point. With the technology now several generations old there's no need to raise unnecessary doubts about its soundness.

The Pocket's build does have its downsides compared to the Flip though. For one its hinge doesn't particularly like to stay in any intermediate position and will tend to either close or open up fully - the Z Flip3 can be left at pretty much any angle. Now we're not ones to find a great deal of use for keeping the Flip part-way open but if you can see yourself using this 'functionality' as a makeshift 'tripod' the Pocket may not be as good.

Also we can't help but think that the Pocket doesn't quite extend and open up entirely flat particularly after it's been left closed for a while. It's the subtlest of angles but there is some. This reviewer recently bumped into an LG Flex2 at the office - the Pocket is nowhere as concave but the association was there.

This got us thinking and we checked the Flip3 only to find out that in its open state its display isn't completely flat either. It's just that the Pocket somehow manages to draw more attention to that fact.

Moving on Huawei didn't make the P50 Pocket water-resistant. We get that it's a huge engineering challenge on a foldable device with moving parts and exposed openings and all that but the Galaxy Z Flip3 does have an IPX8 rating so even if it's just protected against water but not dust it still sounds a bit more reassuring.

Having said that the SIM tray does have a gasket so even if there's no formal IP rating on the Pocket measures clearly have been taken to minimize exposure to the elements.

Speaking of the tray will take two nano SIMs or a nano SIM and a Nano Memory card Huawei's more or less proprietary external memory standard. It's not quite as useful as a microSD but it's still better than no expansion at all. Then again with at least 256GB of built-in storage on the Pocket you're unlikely to even need the extra space anyway.

Physical controls on the P50 Pocket include a power button with an embedded fingerprint reader and a volume rocker both on in the top half of the handset (when unfolded) on the right side.

Using the fingerprint for unlocking makes for a somewhat clunky two-step process - you need to open the phone first then touch the capacitive reader to unlock. That's a similar experience to the one we got with the Z Flip - it's essentially the same implementation. As we said back then however the very nature of the form factor makes 'locking' the Pocket a lot less essential than on a regular bar type of phone - it's not like you're going to accidentally touch the display when it's folded on itself.

The sensor works as expected - it unlocks with a similar rate of reliability with both the left index finger and the right thumb and it's nicely fast. It's a bit of a stretch to reach with the left index finger but they couldn't really have placed it any lower so we can't complain.

The bottom holds the main loudspeaker (earpiece makes that a pair of speakers) and the primary mic as well as the USB-C port. Up top there's another mic.

>Primary speaker and USB-C port on the bottom * Extra mic up top

The Pocket measures 87.3x75.5x15.2mm when folded and 170x75.5x7.2mm when you open it up. As we already mentioned it's thinner than the Flip3 when both phones are in their closed states which is all the more impressive given that the Galaxy's halves are actually thinner. The gapless design does indeed work miracles for the Pocket.

Huawei's foldable is wider though by more than 3mm and it's a difference you can feel. Not so much the 4mm of extra height on the Huawei - you won't be reaching the top of either phone anyway. The Pocket's 190g weight is essentially the same as the Flip's 183g.

Still Huawei's handset does seem to make a slightly more solid case for being 'compact' - not having wasted space between the two halves while also getting two parallel surfaces on the outside and the general feeling of density make you perceive it as getting more phone in as much or less space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhaWx3b3JsZGNydWlzaW5nLmNvbS9uZXdzLzI0NjAzNC9EaXNjb3Zlci10aGUtbmV3LUV4Y2Vzcy0xNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover the new Excess 14,"Discover the new Excess 14

The Excess 14 is the pure incarnation of the Excess DNA. It is the result of a dedicated design work and an industrial execution unique to the brand. It is a cruising yacht that is both fun and playful with sleek lines.

This catamaran is the outcome of innovative architecture of unbiased research work seeking 'out of the box' solutions.

The Excess 14 is designed around a layout never seen before on the market both in the owner's version and in the charter version. More sensations yet everything you'd expect from a cruising boat: this is the challenge taken up by the Excess 14!

The embodiment of Excess DNA: a fun and playful cruising sailboat with sleek lines

Instantly recognizable design: Take a low boom reduced windage thanks to lower freeboard taut lines and redesigned hull windows and you get a catamaran with a distinctive look! Add an aft-set coachroof a forward stepped mast a composite bowsprit (as standard) as well as inverted and inclined bows for more fun! Finish off with an non-immersed forefoot and you have a dynamic catamaran that's ready for adventure.

For more sensations at the helm you know our preference: Helm stations right at the stern in direct contact with the rudders and a good view of the sails as inspired by monohulls.

What you may not know is that visibility is optimal on board the Excess 14 through untinted windows - this is an Excess exclusive on the market!

This model features an optimized fins design and the rudder blades have been extended! A direct steering system has been chosen with textile lines for a better helm feel (because yes it is important!)

Innovative architecture: unbiased research to find 'out of the box' solutions

Fundamental unbiased research!

Thanks to our collaboration with VPLP design the lines of the Excess 14 have benefited from an understanding of ocean racing. Enriched by their Expertise and cutting-edge software this model is designed with an forward-set rig a square-top mainsail and a large overlapping genoa (as standard) to optimize the sail area to displacement ratio.

As it was impossible to leave it at that bridgedeck clearance was increased for better passage through the water and the hulls designed asymmetrically to reduce interference drag.

Continuing in this innovative approach there is also:

a lower center of gravity

an optimized structure (foam sandwich carbon reinforcements etc.)

a new longitudinal volume distribution

At Excess we don't do things by halves!

More sensations and everything you'd expect of a cruising boat: a real challenge!

The Excess 14 is a cruising catamaran that also offers comfort and modularity of its living spaces.

The goal was to maintain volume and good headroom all this in a warm and as bright as ever interior design.

In the hulls you'll find wide very comfortable beds and bathrooms featuring a separate shower. For setting off on your adventure large and subdivided storage spaces have been created!

And because there's no compromise between sailing and living spaces the retractable chart table is really ingenious!

Designed around a layout unseen on the market both in the Owner's version and in the Charter version.

The Excess 14 is available in several layout versions. In the innovative 3-cabin version the main characteristics are:

A central bathroom

A private dressing area

An option of extra bunks

In the 4-cabin version you'll find:

A layout including four cabins four heads and four separate showers

An optional skipper cabin in each hull

A skylounge option: lounging space on the coachroof with no compromise to the look or sensations.

New Delhi: Global energy major ExxonMobil is looking at signing more long-term gas sales deals with India as rising spot prices have added to the appeal of longer duration contracts.""We're certainly happy to work with our friends and partners in India to sign the kind of long-term contracts that allow a large part of the energy demand to be de risked from a price perspective"" said Monte Dobson  CEO ExxonMobil Gas (India).At present Exxon has a long-term contract to annually supply 1.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas to Indian firm Petronet LNG India is the world's fourth biggest importer of gas. And the fuel's demand in India is set to grow as Prime Minster Narendra Modi has set a target to raise the share of gas in the country's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from the current 6.2%.Companies are investing billions of dollars to build pipelines and gas import terminals to meet the rising demand in India.Dobson said India needs to build a ""stable base"" of long-term contracts to de-risk its self from price volatility.He said people who had secured more of their supply in the long term were ""feeling a lot better"". ""So that to me is the real solution"" Dobson said at World Energy Policy Summit.The comments from Exxon come as many countries are battling soaring energy costs with Britain announcing a 54% jump in energy bills from April.LNG prices have lurched from record lows of below $2 per mmBtu to all-time highs of $56 in the last 20 months as markets struggle to keep pace with global economies recovering from COVID-19 .

“I want to say we are not taking things lightly we have already engaged two different sets of international consultants to ensure they review the plan for Yellowtail and to ensure when a licence once approved is granted that it brings additional benefits to the people of Guyana and safeguards to ensure our environment is protected and actually benefit from the oil and gas sector” Bharrat told the House during his contribution to the budget debate.

He did not disclose the names of the consultants engaged in the review process.

However during a press conference Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo while providing an update said there were some setbacks in the review process. On this note he explained that the government is anticipating a completion of the process by the end of March.

“We have some consultancies in place at the Ministry [of Natural Resources] that have been reviewing…there is a draft licence [in place] and a parallel process at the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. By that period the reviewed will be completed and the licences issued” Jagdeo disclosed.

Twelve international companies last month submitted bids in response to a call from the Natural Resources Ministry for Consultancy Services for the Review and Evaluation of Yellowtail Field Development Plans. The companies according to minutes from the National Tender and Administration Board were: Infinity Services & Xwells Mexico Rwell Off-shore Endeavor Management Future Energy Partners Limited MSI Inter-national HIS Global Sunstone Energy Advisory Service Bay Phase RPS Energy Consultants Ltd Sproule Strat Oil Energy Services and Neon-Blu Consulting.

In the call for the service the Ministry stated that it anticipates that negotiations with the selected firm would commence on February 1 with the project starting around February 7. It said that negotiations will only be held if the technical proposal attains the required minimum score adding that firms must be prepared to furnish the detailed cost break-down and other clarifications to the proposals submitted.

Exxon’s local affiliate and partners applied to the EPA for an environmental permit and have since submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and other ancillary documents as part of the process as well as holding public consultations. The statutory period for the public to submit objections expired December 2021 and since then the EPA and the Environmental Assessment Board have been silent as to what the next move will be.

A number of environmentalists and groups submitted objections to the EIA while saying that the company fails to address a number of impacts on the environment.

The Yellowtail project is ExxonMobil and its partners’ fourth development in the Stabroek Block and is considered the largest undertaking since Guyana became an oil-producing nation. As part of the Yellowtail Project ExxonMobil plans to drill between 40 and 67 wells for the 20-year duration of the investment. It is intended to be the largest of the four developments with over 250000 barrels of oil per day targeted once production commences. Based on the schedule once approval is granted engineering commences this year and production in the latter part of 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYS5jb20udHIvZW4vZXVyb3BlL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tbGF1bmNoZWQtaW4tZnJhbmNlLWludG8tbXVyYWwtZGVwaWN0aW5nLXdvbWFuLXdlYXJpbmctaGlqYWItYWxvbmctd2l0aC1zdGFyLW9mLWRhdmlkLzI0OTQ1MDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investigation launched in France into mural depicting woman wearing hijab along with Star of David,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.aa.com.tr', port=443): Read timed out.

“That [selling to India] is something we will consider too. But of course we would like it to be an open transparent process. We have always mentioned it should be that way. We are considering the option of India but then we are looking at making it an open process” Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat told the Sunday Stabroek in an interview.

“What we are looking at too is not marketing but selling [ourselves]. In that way we save on the marketing fee. So if any country India or any company is willing to do that we may be open to talk about that. That way this country would actually save money” he added.

Bharrat said that government will assess the best option for this country and isn’t worried that the clock is ticking given that commissioning of the Liza Unity Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) platform at the Liza-2 field is anticipated to begin later this month. That is because he explained there is a 60-day startup period where production is gradually ramped. It is only after then and the green light is given by engineers that the expected 220000 barrels per day target could be reached putting this country’s first lift in late April.

The Natural Resources Minister explained that government was “awaiting a confirmed date of startup from ExxonMobil. Should be end[of] this month.”

“We haven’t gone out as yet. I would say before the month is out we would go out. Our lift would not be until the end of April. Remember when you start up it won’t be at full capacity for a while. There is a 60-day period [of commissioning]. They will also flare for a short period of time at the commissioning so we have time. You have Exxon Hess CNOOC and then us” (in terms of oil lifts)” he said.

It is in this vein he said that government is mulling it’s options for selling and looking at the fact that this country pays a marketer for the Liza-1 oil when it could enter agreements where it would get the same or even a better deal.

“The present arrangement is that we pay the company to market our crude. For example we pay Aramco US$25 cents on a barrel… So if we can save that money it is more money for the country and more revenue coming in” the minister said.

“So that is something we are exploring. Once we get countries or companies that are willing to do so we may very well consider them. If they are giving us Brent price and not charging a marketing fee then it is better for us” he added.

However there are still plans in train to advertise for a marketer for the oil from the Lisa Unity FPSO in the coming weeks if a decision is not made by then. “We would go out for tenders say by the end of February.”

India’s High Commissioner to Guyana Dr. K. J. Srinivasa has been vocal about New Delhi’s interest in formalising a long-term contract for the purchase of Guyana’s crude oil.

“Collaboration in the oil and gas sector is proceeding successfully and we hope to further strengthen this by working on a long-term contract between the Indian State-run public sector unit – Indian Oil Corporation – and the Government of Guyana for procurement of crude oil from Guyana to India” he had told a virtual symposium last year May when speaking on “Perspectives on Guyana-India Relations from 1838 to 2021”.

His announcement had come one week after the Reuters news agency had reported Bharrat as stating that India has expressed interest in buying one of the 1 million-barrel cargoes that government is entitled to in order to test the crude in its refineries.

India has since purchased two lifts of Guyana’s oil.

In an interview with Stabroek News just over a week ago Srinivasa restated India’s interest in purchasing Guyana’s oil.

“We have taken two lifts already. Last year March and last year July but this was not part of a long-term deal… we are expressing our desire to take Guyana’s oil because the second FPSO is here. So if a long-term government to government contract can be done we will be very happy to take the oil” he said.

Srinivasa explained that India is trying to diversify its supply sources and with increased production in Guyana it is looking to the country as one of the prospective sources. However he added that they have been unable to secure a deal that guarantees long-term supply.

“So we are willing to take Guyana share of oil… let us see how it pans out. With this extra [production] that will come on stream they’ll be able to work out something because the problem for us is we need a finality.

“So we are very happy to work with the government of Guyana and getting this oil is important for both Guyana and India because you will get an assured buyer and we will get an assured supplier. So we are with the Government of Guyana you know we are working with them very closely and let us see how fast it can be done” he explained."

For the first time ever the trophy’s signature delivery moment was made via an electric Light Commercial Vehicle (eLCV). The company’s newest electric zero-tailpipe emissions delivery vehicle delivered the coveted trophy to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s officially kicking off the weeklong celebration leading up to Super Bowl LVI.

“The Vince Lombardi Trophy delivery is an important tradition of Super Bowl week and FedEx couldn’t be prouder to play a role in its safe timely arrival each year” said Jenny Robertson senior vice president Integrated Marketing and Communications. “This year’s delivery is particularly special as it marks the first delivery of the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Super Bowl using an all-electric zero-tailpipe emissions FedEx delivery vehicle.”

The FedEx deployment of all-electric vehicles marks an exciting moment in the brand’s journey toward operating an all-electric global pickup and delivery (PUD) fleet – a key component of the company’s goal to reach carbon neutral operations globally by 2040.

Devance Bowen a Los Angeles resident and FedEx Express courier for 31 years assisted in the delivery to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s. Helping Devance make the key delivery was Super Bowl XXXIV Champion and 7-time Pro Bowler Torry Holt. Together the duo showcased the trophy in front of a contingent of NFL fans and media.

The historic Vince Lombardi Trophy which was handcrafted by artisans at Tiffany & Co. is made of sterling silver and depicts a regulation-size football in kicking position on a pyramid-like base that features the words ‘Vince Lombardi Trophy’ and ‘Super Bowl LVI’ along with the NFL shield.

To ensure a smooth delivery to Los Angeles the trophy was monitored in real-time by SenseAware® a FedEx innovation. The trophy started its overnight journey from NFL Headquarters in New York City and then traveled across the country to its destination in Los Angeles. The SenseAware technology also tracks and communicates environmental conditions inside the container including temperature humidity shock and light detection which would indicate if the package was opened before its arrival.

Throughout the week fans visiting the Los Angeles area can get up-close and personal with the trophy at the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s starting Saturday Feb. 5 & Sunday Feb. 6 and again on Thursday Feb. 10 – Saturday Feb. 12 at the LA Convention Center. On Sunday Feb. 13 it will be awarded to either the Cincinnati Bengals or the Los Angeles Rams commemorating a Super Bowl LVI Champion for the 2021-2022 NFL season.

“Each year we love giving our fans the chance to see the Vince Lombardi Trophy up-close at Super Bowl Experience before it is awarded to the Super Bowl Champions” said Peter O’Reilly NFL EVP of Club Business and League Events. “We appreciate the help of our friends at FedEx to kick off the week-long celebration for Super Bowl LVI here in Los Angeles.”

The Brookhaven NAACP and the family of FedEx driver D’Monterrio Gibson are asking for the resignation of Brookhaven’s mayor chief of police and others.

Brookhaven NAACP President Rev. Rico Cain made the statement after the close of a brief press conference Saturday afternoon on the steps of the Lincoln County-Brookhaven Governmental Complex.

Referring to the events of Jan. 24 when father and son Brookhaven residents Gregory and Brandon Case attempted to detain and fired gunshots at Gibson as he left their property Cain said “The victim’s family and the Brookhaven NAACP are asking for the resignations of Police Chief Kenneth Collins Mayor Joe Cox lead investigator (Det. Capt.) Clint Earls investigator (Det. Sgt.) Vincent Fernando and Assistant Chief Chris Case.”

Cain said incidents of racism have happened in the city “over and over again” and “some of those problems have been involving the Brookhaven Police Department.”

Cain was the only person present for the NAACP-called press conference though state and national NAACP leaders were expected to attend along with Rev. Al Sharpton members and leaders of the Black Panthers and Gibson and his attorney Carlos Moore of The Cochran Firm.

Cain said the anticipated large presence of law enforcement at today’s conference — more than a dozen at the complex and more visible in the downtown area — and throughout the city led others to reschedule the conference to another date in the interest of public safety.

“We’ve had some people to actually canvas the grounds for the last couple of hours doing different counts in different areas of law enforcement here in Brookhaven the last little while and the police officers you see now and law enforcement officers you see now are not the only ones” Cain said. “There are many more on standby all around different corners different buildings waiting for something to construe. But we would not be here to day if it was not for the slackness of the police department.”

Cain said many citizens of Brookhaven would love to tell their stories about how they have been affected by racism in the city. These people chose not to be present at the conference however due to fear they “would be penalized at some other time” he said.

The real issue Cain said is that both black and white people in Brookhaven feel that had the FedEx driver been black and the shooter been black the results would have been different.

Gibson 24 had delivered a package to an address at the Junior Trail NE residence of the one of Cases Cain said when Gregory Case 58 attempted to block his truck from leaving by using his own vehicle and Brandon Case 35 stood in the road with a firearm. When Gibson pulled past both of the men they pursued him as far as I-55 with the younger case shooting repeatedly into the vehicle.

“The consequences would have been greater than what they are now” he said.

He said these people feel the only reason the Cases turned themselves in was out of fear of retaliation.

Gregory Case was charged with conspiracy and released on a $75000 bond. Brandon Case was charged with aggravated assault/shooting into an occupied motor vehicle and released on a $150000 bond.

Gibson’s attorney Moore said Friday that hate crime charges are warranted for the cases and he wants “both of them charged with attempted murder.”

NEW ORLEANS — Two white men were arrested earlier this week days after a Black delivery driver accused them of chasing him and shooting at him after he dropped off a package in a Mississippi city.

But driver Demonterrio Gibson 24 on Friday said he doesn’t believe police took him seriously at first and his attorneys say both suspects have been “undercharged” and should face charges of attempted murder.

Nobody was injured but the chase and gunfire have sparked social media complaints of racism in Brookhaven Mississippi about 55 miles (89 kilometers) south of Jackson — and pushback in local media from the city’s Black police chief.

Gregory Case and his son Brandon Case were arrested and released on bond Tuesday in connection with the alleged Jan. 24 attack on Gibson 24. Gregory Case faces a charge of conspiracy; Brandon Case shooting into a motor vehicle.

Lawyers for Gibson say more serious charges including hate crime charges are warranted in what they believe was a racially motivated assault. “I want both of them charged with attempted murder” attorney Carlos Moore said Friday.

Moore and attorney James Bryant compared the incident to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun. The white men including a father and son were convicted of murder and sentenced to life. Defense lawyers said they suspected he had committed crimes in their neighborhood but prosecutors said there was no evidence of that. The three still face a federal hate crime trial.

Case to be presented to grand jury

Brookhaven with a population that is 68% Black is in Lincoln County where District Attorney Dee Bates said information will be presented to a grand jury for a decision on charges once police complete the investigation of the Gibson incident. Witnesses including Gibson will be able to testify.

Gibson told The Associated Press on Friday that he was in uniform when the incident happened. He said he was in a van rented by FedEx but that it did not have a FedEx logo on it. He pulled into a driveway and dropped off a package sometime after 7 p.m. on Jan. 24. Before he turned his van around in the driveway to exit he said he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.

He said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he exited the driveway. Gibson swerved around him and then encountered a second man.

“I drive down about two or three houses and there's another guy standing in the middle of the street with a gun pointed at my vehicle” said Gibson. The man motioned for him to stop. “I'm looking at him like shaking my head because why would I stop for somebody with a gun?”

Gibson said the man fired as he drove away damaging the van and packages inside. He said the white pickup chased him to the interstate highway near Brookhaven before ending the chase. Later police told local news outlets that the elder Case was the suspected pickup driver while Brandon Case was the man in the street. Gregory Case is 58 and his son is 35 according to The Daily Leader of Brookhaven.

Gibson said he called police and was told by one officer that police had received a call about a suspicious person at the same address at the same time. “I said ‘Sir I’m not a suspicious person. I'm a FedEx worker. I was just doing my job and they shot at me.'”

Police chief responds on social media

The Cases have not commented publicly on their arrests. The municipal clerk's office in Brookhaven said Friday morning it had not yet received paperwork on their arrests or information on their attorneys. Police chief Kenny Collins did not return calls from the AP seeking more information.

Early this week Collins who is Black pushed back against allegations on social media of racism in Brookhaven. “We’re not going to have outsiders coming in trying to stir that up” he told The Daily Leader. “Brookhaven is not a racist prejudiced town. You can’t judge a town by the actions of two individuals.”

“People need to be careful what they post on social media” Collins said. “If somebody is killed or hurt because of what you post on social media you will be charged too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vdGhlLWZpcnN0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tY2Vzc25hLXNreWNvdXJpZXItcm9sbHMtb3V0LWluLXdpY2hpdGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The First Production Cessna SkyCourier Rolls Out in Wichita,"The first production Cessna SkyCourier has seen the light in Wichita.

TGI Fridays is looking to give back to these people nationwide by offering them free food on Feb. 10. On that day delivery drivers of any kind can get one free appetizer simply by stopping at their local TGI Fridays.

The deal includes all truck drivers FedEx USPS UPS and DHL delivery people drivers on Uber Grubhub Postmates Instacart and other services. To get the free app simply show up in your uniform or show your credentials and tell an employee “I work in the delivery business.”

TGI Fridays

Despite the pandemic and staffing shortages they load up and drive fly and deliver all the stuff the rest of the world is constantly tracking because they know everyone is depending on them” Sara Bittorf chief experience officer at TGI Fridays said in a press release. “These are the unsung heroes and we want to celebrate them because they deserve our thanks and gratitude.”

The deal includes a choice of the following appetizers:

Loaded potato skins

Green bean fries

Warm pretzels

Chips & salsa

Pot stickers

Spinach & artichoke dip

While free food is a pretty good way to show some gratitude you can thank delivery drivers in plenty of other ways.

In one of the busiest off-seasons since the 1990s the series and its teams have been working away on developing the all-new next generation of Nascar vehicle in preparation for the new season.

Early discussions over Nascar’s Next Gen car took place all the way back in January 2019. The final product will include an updated front splitter aerodynamic vents on the bonnet and a redesigned side skirt. Additionally a rear diffuser will be introduced which will be used in Nascar for the first time.

As the Covid-19 pandemic begins to subside amid increasing vaccination rates Nascar is also more confident about running its 2022 season largely unaffected. The impact of the pandemic in 2021 meant that an event at Auto Club Speedway in California was cancelled and replaced by a race weekend on the Daytona Road Course. The series is hoping and expecting that no such changes will need to be made in 2022.

Last year Nascar revealed its next-generation car for the 2022 season

The 2022 Cup Series season also features a new event at the World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway which will take place on 5th June. It is the only venue to be added to the series’ 36 point-scoring events throughout the season.

Meanwhile Nascar's famous Clash event is set to kick off the 2022 season on 6th February only this year the event is being held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Named ‘The Clash at the Coliseum’ it will be the first time since 1979 that Nascar's preseason race has taken place at a venue other than the Daytona Speedway. To be able to host Nascar the Coliseum will be transformed into a quarter-mile asphalt short track built around the football field.

“Los Angeles is synonymous with major sports and entertainment events so we seized an innovative opportunity to showcase Nascar at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum” said Ben Kennedy Nascar’s senior vice president of strategy and innovation speaking at the time of the announcement.

“We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to take centre stage in this market as we get our 2022 season underway.

The LA Memorial Coliseum is being transformed into a Nascar circuit for ‘The Clash at the Coliseum’ preseason event

“It’ll be asphalt quarter-mile. We’ll have a few pit stalls maybe eight to ten inside but for non-competitive stuff. If someone has a loose wheel or needs to repair their car they’ll be able to come in and do that.”

With the Clash at the Coliseum set to kickstart Nascar’s Next Gen era BlackBook Motorsport presents a rundown of the series’ teams and their commercial partnerships as they gear up for the new season.

FSLR,First Solar,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2hpZ2FuZGFpbHkuY29tL21pY2hpZ2FuLWluLWNvbG9yL215LWZpcnN0LXRvdGFsLXNvbGFyLWVjbGlwc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to expect before America's next total solar eclipse in 2024,"All life experiences are binary; they are either expected or unexpected. You are familiar with most of your daily routine starting with waking up. What you do for the rest of your day is up to you. Maybe you decide to get out of bed. Maybe you choose to shower and get ready for the rest of your day. Maybe you visit your favorite coffee shop for breakfast or maybe you don’t. But no matter what you choose you expect the outcome of your choice and at the end of the day you close your eyes you fall asleep and you repeat it all over again.

Now look I’m not saying this to be morbid. I think it is important to create consistent habits and repetition is comforting. I love my morning routines. I love the comfort of walking over the same bridge to get to class each morning. I love my daily calls home to my family and I love ordering from my favorite restaurant once a week. I love all these things because I know what to expect. But what happens when you experience the unexpected?

You are probably thinking I experience new things all the time it’s not that special. I don’t mean new. With new things we can often anticipate what the experience feels like or recall past memories to help our mind fill in the holes of what just occurred. I’m talking about the rare “hold my breath what just happened” unexpected — the type of feeling that leaves your brain perplexed and mouth speechless.

I can only remember a few moments in my life when I’ve felt like this one of them being when I witnessed my first total solar eclipse in 2017.

When my dad first told me we were going to drive over eight hours from the south of San Francisco all the way to northern Oregon just to look at the sky for a few minutes I thought he was crazy. Why would someone drive for eight hours just to look at the moon? I told him that we could witness the moon cover roughly 85% of the sun from home and that it would be 85% as fascinating — I would quickly learn to eat my words.

The thing about total solar eclipses is that you can only experience totality which is when the moon completely covers the su if you are within the path of totality or the small strip of area where the moon’s shadow blankets the Earth’s surface. The further from the center of the path the less the moon covers the sun and the shorter the time that you experience totality. So we could have stayed home but we would have only witnessed a partial solar eclipse not a total solar eclipse — two completely different phenomenons.

After the lengthy drive my dad brother and I arrived in Madras a small town in Oregon with a population of over seven thousand people. By the time we arrived tens of thousands of people who’d traveled from all corners of the world had already flooded the ill-prepared town. Since Madras has the lowest chance of cloud coverage people from over 39 different countries and all 50 states flocked to Solartown Madras’s makeshift campsite for the weekend. Even Oregon’s National Guard was called in to mitigate traffic. I was stunned. People had been living out of their cars for days setting up tents and telescopes. It gave off an almost cult-like atmosphere: as if it were Judgment Day and this was the final hurrah. As time passed the anticipation grew.

“Two hours” yelled the crowd. “One hour! Ten minutes!! It’s starting!!!” Finally.

First contact: the invisible moon kisses the tip of the sun. If you are not wearing the special shades that block all visible light you can hardly notice the gradual bites the moon has taken out of the star. Now it’s just a waiting game. Roughly ten minutes before full coverage the world is enveloped in gray twilight. As time slowly progresses toward totality you notice the diamond ring effect where only a portion of the sun resembling a diamond ring remains. Five seconds before totality you notice Baily’s beads in which tiny balls of light surround the rim of the moon. It is almost time. A shadow washes over our world as if God has thrown a blanket over us.

And then it hits. Second contact: totality. The moon has completely covered the sun and all that is left is its corona the outermost part of the sun’s atmosphere which is typically masked by the sun’s rays. You throw off your glasses and at this moment life is transformed. The world changes from light to dark from hot to cold and from anxious to calm. The deadness of your surroundings flows through your body. You hear nothing but animals shouting in confusion as your senses overload. You are entranced and nothing matters not even time: minutes pass but they feel like seconds. And then it’s finished and you want more.

Third Contact: the sun slowly reappears. Your soul comes back to life and you become aware of your surroundings. Putting the shades back on you see the diamond ring effect and Baily’s beads again. You wave goodbye to the experience and pray that you will see another once more.

Fourth Contact: the sun is now free and cheers ring out from the crowd. You look around and people are still looking up at the sky to process what they have just witnessed. Some people are still in awe others have looks of confusion and a few are wiping away tears they didn’t know they had.

I fall into the first category. The experience was so enthralling that we traveled to Chile a few years later just to get a glimpse of totality again. While I could expect what it would feel like then no one could have prepared me for my first eclipse. As the next total solar eclipse visible from North America will occur on April 8 2024 you already know that I have plans to see it. But until then I’ll have to wait.

Welcome to solar spring! You may not have heard of this happy astronomical marker but Saturday marks the end of the darkest quarter of the year and the beginning of the greatest three months of light gain we experience all year.

Solar spring is the first of three spring markers and in my opinion one of the best. Light is so critical and when we have more of it lots of things change.

The gap between sunrise and sunset is now back to what it was on Nov. 5 with 10 hours and 10 minutes of possible sunshine. Between now and May 5 we will gain a whopping 4 hours and 4 minutes more light. All of this increase in solar radiation will be a signal for plants to start growing and animals to start becoming more active and mating. In general for nature spring is underway.

Of course we can still have below-zero weather major snow storms and it’s unlikely you’re going to the beach this weekend but solar spring is a real thing. Next up on the calendar will be meteorological spring which begins March 1. That marks the end of the coldest quarter of the year and starts the transition into the warmest which is of course meteorological summer.

Astronomical spring arrives at 11:33 a.m. on Sunday March 20 and this is probably the spring you were taught as a kid. That’s the point that the sun rises at the top of the planet and sets at the bottom and also marks when nearly everywhere has about 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of daylight.

May 5 through Aug. 5 is solar summer. When this begins we have 14 hours and 14 minutes of daylight but only increase an hour and 3 minutes peaking on June 21 with 15 hours and 17 minutes of daylight. From there Boston stays above 14 hours and 14 minutes between sunrise and sunset until August 5 when the loss of daylight starts to really become noticeable and increases rather quickly.

Daylight is so important to our mood and whether you just don’t like the winter darkness or have suffered through a long bout of seasonal affective disorder it’s time to open the shades and let the sun shine in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc2llcnJhbmV2YWRhYWxseS5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMi8wNi9maXJzdC1ncmVlbi1iYW5rLWluLW5ldmFkYS1uYW1lcy1mb3VuZGluZy1leGVjdXRpdmUtZGlyZWN0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Green Bank in Nevada Names Founding Executive Director – Sierra Nevada Ally,"Support Independent Journalism

Yara Centre is the first to receive the upgrade. The south-facing entrance roof will have 139 modules and the south-facing wall will have 88 for a total of 227 solar panels.

The City of Moose Jaw has begun its solar panel installation project as part of its ongoing commitment to climate action. A total of 730 solar panels will be installed on the city buildings.

Buildings to receive the upgrade include the Yara Centre City Hall/Moose Jaw Police Service and Mosaic Place. The work is expected to be complete by the end of August 2022.

The project cost $1 million even and was made possible by a joint funding effort. The federal government contributed $415120; the province contributed $345899; the City of Moose Jaw’s share was $238981.

The return on investment for the city will be rapid with the panels projected to reduce the city’s utility bills by $170000 annually. Greenhouse gas emission savings should be approximately 829 tonnes annually.

Climate action plan (CAP)

As part of the 2022 municipal budget Moose Jaw City Council adopted a Climate Action Plan (CAP). The CAP has set targets and is data-driven including:

20 per cent reduction of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025

45 per cent reduction of corporate GHG emissions by 2030

Elimination of 100 per cent of water loss from municipal buildings

The city will partner with Greenwave Innovations for the first step of the plan which will see energy sub-monitoring systems installed in the city’s 10 largest GHG-emitting community-facing buildings. An additional building within the city’s water/wastewater portfolio brings the total to 11.

The 11 facilities represent 48 per cent of the overall corporate emissions. They were selected for their energy usage and their high profiles within the community.

Once the energy sub-monitoring systems are installed public engagement dashboards will be placed in the monitored buildings. The dashboards will enable citizens to stay up to date with progress toward the CAP targets.

The city hopes residents and business owners will be inspired by the visible progress on the public engagement dashboards to implement their own actions on climate change.

“The City of Moose Jaw is very proud of our previous commitments to seek opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the actions detailed within this climate action plan” said city manager Jim Puffalt. “We look forward to guiding our community through this climate change journey and showcasing our city as a leader in environmental responsibility.”

It is the first such park in the country which is making the green energy concept come true as reality.

Solar panels have been installed on everything present in the park from the floor and swimming pool to the roof of the sitting bench and solar pole. The swimming pool consists of solar panels through which electricity is generated.

This is the first solar technology park in the country in which an attempt has been made to explain that solar energy is the better option for the future.

When you enter the park you will see solar panels on the floor to generate electricity. Even trees produce electricity due to the presence of solar panels.

More than five lakh units of electricity can be generated every year.

It took about 3 years to build this park. The reason for the construction of this park was the problems with electricity and to improve the environment. This park has been built on the initiative of Central Electronics Limited (CEL).

Chetan Prakash Jain CMD of CEL said ‘’This is the result of a new approach for us we decided to do something different. In this park you will see solar panels everywhere whether it is benches swimming pools and even in a walking area.’’"

The audit found that the improper accounting caused FirstEnergy to overcharge customers and that the utility may have done so to conceal or mislead how much it was spending on lobbying and why.

It said $1.5 million of the lobbying expenses came from ratepayers.

Regulators gave the company 60 days to come up with a plan to give customers refunds according to an audit released Friday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FirstEnergy spokesman Mark Durbin said the utility accepted the findings and recommendations in the audit and that changes in its accounting practices have been made or are underway.

FirstEnergy has faced multiple investigations over its role in a $60 million bribery scheme to win a legislative bailout in 2019 for two nuclear plants operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary.

The Akron-based utility agreed in July to pay $230 million in penalties to avoid federal prosecution.

FirstEnergy has said it has made significant strides in reforming the company's policies in the wake of the scandal brought to light in 2020 when federal officials arrested Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four associates.

Householder who later was removed as speaker and expelled from the House has pleaded not guilty to a federal conspiracy charge.

The audit released Friday found that FirstEnergy paid $25 million for lobbying expenses related to the bailout and that FirstEnergy Solutions a former subsidiary paid $44 million.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ford plans to suspend production of vehicles including the Ford Bronco the popular F-150 pickup and the new electric Mustang Mach-E at its manufacturing plants in Michigan Illinois and Mexico according to media reports including CNBC.

Production will be slowed at other facilities in Missouri Michigan and Kentucky while overtime will be eliminated at Ford's Oakville Ontario operations in Canada.

The changes come a day after the Detroit automaker warned a chip shortage would lead to a decline in vehicle volume in the current quarter.

The company has yet to respond to queries by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

A shortage of semiconductors – essential components in new vehicles and primarily manufactured in Asia – has impacted automobile production since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic causing prices to spike and contributing to surging U.S. inflation.

President Joe Biden keen to boost American auto manufacturing wants to bring semiconductor chip production back to the U.S. and has held several events to promote massive domestic investments.

U.S. lawmakers meanwhile voted Friday to pass legislation aimed at jump-starting tens of billions of dollars in such research and manufacturing countering China's growing influence and easing a global shortage of computer chips.

In late January high-tech giant Intel announced it would begin construction late this year of two semiconductor factories in Ohio with the aim of producing chips by 2025. Biden called the $20 billion investment ""historic.""

As previously reported by autoevolution the automaker confirmed a V8 engine. Ford Authority says that the order books for the U.S. market will open this fall which is curious because that’s very close to the MY23 switchover. For reference the MY22 entered production last November.If the report turns out to be true it’s very obvious many would-be owners don’t have a chance of getting the V8-engined pickup for the 2022 model year. More expensive than the V6-engined Raptor the Raptor R is further expected to be a limited-production affair. Ludicrous dealer markups will only exacerbate things unless the Dearborn-based company grows a pair.More specifically the Dearborn-based automaker made it clear that asking for additional deposits or any other pre-sale payments for the F-150 Lightning is strictly forbidden. Scalper issues have been addressed as well with a no-sale provision effective one year from the truck’s purchase date.Turning our attention back to the Raptor R the cited publication further understands that we’re in for “a more robust rear suspension fortified by structural enhancements like beefier trailing arms.” It remains to be seen what kind of chassis and suspension changes are in the pipeline but on the other hand it’s widely believed the V8 mill is the supercharged Predator.Introduced for the 2020 model year by the Mustang Shelby GT500 the 5.2-liter engine features the same displacement as the Voodoo in the Shelby GT350 series. Be that as it may Ford switched to a cross-plane crankshaft instead of a flat-plane crankshaft because the Coyote-based V8 features a short runner off the Eaton TVS R2650 blower that provides up to 12 psi.Thepowerplant is good for 760 horsepower at 7300 revolutions per minute and 625 pound-feet (847 Nm) at 5000 rpm. In other words the 6.2-liter HEMI Hellcat V8 in the Ram 1500 TRX is a slightly torquier beast.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lZGV0cm9pdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjk4NTAvc3RhcmttYW5fZGV0cm9pdF90cmFpbl9zdGF0aW9uX2h5cGVfZGlzdHJhY3RzX2Zyb21fbWljaGlnYW5fc19kaXNtYWxfZnV0dXJlX2FuZF9mb3JkX3NfaW5ldml0YWJsZV9leGl00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starkman: Detroit Depot Hype Distracts from Michigan's Dismal Future and Ford's Inevitable Exit,"The writer a Los Angeles freelancer is a former Detroit News business reporter who blogs at Starkman Approved.

By Eric Starkman



Gov. Gretchen Whitmer speaking Friday at the train station (Phoyto: State of Michigan)

The writer H.L. Mencken famously said: “No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Ford Motor Co. last week proved a variation of that saying: “No one ever got bad publicity underestimating the gullibility of the Detroit-area media.”

As I was reading The Detroit News’ fawning coverage hailing plans for a “Transportation Innovation Zone” what struck me as the only significant news of the ballyhooed “public-private partnership” was that Michigan is earmarking $126 million in taxpayer money to support the iconic train station’s redevelopment. That’s on top of the some $250 million of taxpayer money that was contributed for the renovations.

To create the appearance that the project was already generating results Ford called in a chit with its Google partner to sprinkle some Silicon Valley pixie dust on the effort with the announcement that the multinational technology company has proudly become a “founding member” of Michigan Central.

“I think this is going to be a hub for research on all sorts of things that we can’t even envision as we sit here today and I think we’d like to continue to build out the partnership and have others come in” Google CFO Ruth Porat was quoted as saying.



Ruth Porat (Photo by World Economic Forum)

Porat clearly does a lot of thinking. That’s why she gets paid the big bucks -- $51 million in 2020. So what exactly is Google committing to as a founding member? It plans to open a lab to teach computer science to high school students and partnering with local nonprofits to offer a nebulous career certification program that Ford has agreed to recognize.

Oh and the company will also provide cloud computing for the project.

I’m confident in speculating that Porat wasn’t visiting Detroit especially this time of year to announce a program that is of no business significance to Google. A more likely reason is that Ford and Google are planning something much bigger expanding on their already significant relationship.

Ford and Google last February announced a six-year deal for in-car connectivity and cloud services that Ford CEO Jim Farley said was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The announcement was a big deal for both companies because the arrangement allowed Ford to streamline its operations and eliminate jobs while giving Google some credibility in the cloud computing business an area where Amazon and Microsoft are kicking the company’s butt.

Rising Stock

Ford’s stock popped this week after Bloomberg reported that the company plans to spend more on vehicle electrification and consider a partial spinoff of its EV business.



Ford CEO Jim Farley

EV is all the rage on Wall Street and Farley knows how to play to his audience. On a call to discuss Ford’s lackluster earnings Farley told investors he was already running Ford’s EV businesses and internal combustion engine [ICE] businesses as separate companies.

“I’m struck at how different the rhythm of this digital BEV business is versus ICE Farley said. “Running a successful ICE business and a successful BEV business is not the same.”

Never mind that Ford’s $2.0 billion quarterly operating income fell behind Tesla’s $2.6 billion.

A likely spinoff of Ford’s EV business spells big trouble for Michigan and Detroit. Rest assured Ford’s EV headquarters won’t be in Michigan. The company has earmarked more than $11 billion for EV manufacturing in Tennessee and Kentucky. Austin where Tesla relocated its headquarters and where GM has its largest IT Innovation Center is another possibility. Since 2009 GM has invested more than $2 billion in Texas where it has 13 facilities and 9000 employees.

Rivian until recently another high-flying EV company in which Ford has an interest relocated its headquarters to California from Plymouth more than a year ago reportedly because CEO RJ Scaringe believed that being a Michigan-based company gave the company a stodgy image. Establishing an EV headquarters outside of Michigan would likely boost Ford’s stock something Detroit’s media loves to crow about.

Eyes on India and Mexico

Ford has already signaled its plans to diminish its Michigan footprint. The company announced last September it plans a major expansion of its white-collar engineering technology and business operations workforce in India where it already has 11000 employees.

Ford’s acclaimed EV Mustang is made in Mexico.

Get the picture?

The Michigan Central Depot announcement last week provided Whitmer cover for her inability to attract significant investment in Michigan save for GM. Lacking any announcement of substance Whitmer shamelessly slathered on meaningless PR pablum.

“Ford is an American icon that has left its mark on Michigan – and the world – for more than 100 years and we are proud to partner with Ford and other founding members at Michigan Central to shape the next century of transportation solutions while reducing emissions and accelerating electrification” Whitmer said Friday in a news release.

“By embracing a whole-of-government approach in our collaboration with Michigan Central and the city of Detroit we are writing the playbook for a new kind of partnership that keeps Michigan at the forefront of mobility for generations to come. Together we can continue growing Michigan’s economy putting Michiganders first and win the next century of auto manufacturing and technology development.”

Meanwhile in Ohio . . .

Michiganders should take note of what’s going on in neighboring Ohio: Intel announced last month it plans to invest at least $20 billion to build two chip factories just outside Columbus.

The company said the site could be expanded to accommodate as many as eight chip factories with Intel spending as much as $100 billion to build them. The initial two factories will employ 3000 workers earning an annual average salary of $135000. The project also is expected to create 7000 construction jobs and 10000 indirect jobs.

Intel has also pledged $100 million for Ohio educational institutions to ensure a pipeline of talent and support research programs in the region. Compare that to Google’s commitment to launch a coding school for high school students.

In yet another win for Ohio fuel cell maker manufacturer Hyperion announced a few days ago it plans to relocate its headquarters to Columbus from California and open a 65-acre plant – the largest new factory in Columbus in over a decade. The factory is expected to create more than 680 jobs with an annual payroll of more than $58 million.

Hyperion CEO Angelo Kafrantaris is yet another person with Michigan ties who hightailed it out of here. He graduated from the College of Creative Studies in Detroit. Google co-founder Larry Page is a University of Michigan alumnus.

One can’t blame Farley for wanting to exit Michigan. The automotive industry has become more competitive than ever and Ford needs to attract the best and the brightest and forge partnerships with companies around the world. In Tennessee Ford can rely on the full support of the state’s leaders including members of Congress. Dearborn’s Congressional representative is Rashida Tlaib an internationally renowned antisemite who advocates a boycott of Israeli companies.

Ford and GM have critical research facilities in Israel as does every major technology company.

What what he does not says

Ford is so done with Michigan it didn’t even bother to meet with Whitmer to see if she could come up with a better deal than Tennessee offered. Farley recently told Crain’s Detroit Business that he “loves” Michigan but actions speak louder than words.



William Clay Ford Jr. (Photo: Ford Motor Co.)

Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. deserves credit for his Herculean commitment to Detroit including spearheading the Michigan Central Depot redevelopment. But he can’t change the fact that Michigan is fraught with dismal leadership on both sides of the aisle.

The Detroit media’s Chamber of Commerce cheerleading journalism does their readers and viewers a great disservice. They stood idly by as former Beaumont Health CEO John Fox destroyed a once prominent and proud hospital system and last week that company faded into oblivion. More companies will join Ford in the stampede out of Michigan.

The story that needs to be written is how can Michigan’s decline be reversed and who has the political smarts and capabilities to pull it off.

Whitmer has conclusively demonstrated she’s not up to the task.

Life is constantly providing reminders of this mainly in the form of influential entities doing exactly what they should not do. This week's example was brought to us by the announcement that Rudy Giuliani was revealed as a contestant on the upcoming seventh season of ""The Masked Singer.""

At the risk of sounding like America's angry mom screaming at all your rambunctious toddlers didn't we talk about this? What did I say? Did I not warn you several times not to touch the buttons on that image rehabilitation machine over there?

Yes.Yes I did! Here are the receipts: Back in ye olden days of 2018 I humbly requested talk show gatekeepers to refrain from promoting Sean Spicer's Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad book. Only ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" crossed that picket line which fine bygones.

Spicer's book didn't go on to be a bestseller but nevertheless he was invited to participate in ""Dancing with the Stars"" in 2018. All he did was lie to us about crowd sizes right?

RELATED: Giuliani prompts ""Masked Singer"" walkout

In November 2020 a few days after Donald Trump lost the presidential election to Joseph Biden I pleaded to the entertainment powers that be to resist the urge to rehabilitate any of the flunkies with him at that point.

""None of these figures deserve to turn up on celebrity editions of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" or drop in on ""The Conners"" for a hilarious cameo or to show their faces in any broadcast network entertainment title"" I wrote ""Not Kayleigh McEnany not Kimberly Guilfoyle not Mark Meadows none of them. Not now not ever.""

Shame on me for assuming a Giuliani ban was a given. After all by this point Sacha Baron Cohen had broadcast a video that caught Giuliani with his hands down his pants on a hotel bed appearing to prep himself for what he thought would be a sexual encounter with a young woman masquerading as an interviewer. This happened before his hair color melted off his face on live TV but after he'd ranted for nearly 40 minutes about supposed election fraud on a landscaping company's driveway kicking off the Big Lie.

Giuliani is a mess and if he weren't actively involved in destroying democracy that would make him a terrific reality show candidate. But he is at this moment facing multiple legal actions against him not the least of which is an investigation of his role in the January 6 2021 insurrection and his leadership of a plot to install illegitimate electors.

He is a central participant in a rolling coup against our democracy that is intensifying by the day including on Friday when the Republican National Committee officially rebranded the deadly attack on the Capitol and all the events leading up to it as ""legitimate political discourse.""

That's really enough for any producer with a shred of moral fiber to say ""You know what? I don't think this man should be featured in any of our hits let along one with the tagline of 'The Good the Bad and the Cuddly.'""

""The Masked Singer"" isn't an entirely unproblematic show mind you. Its host Nick Cannon has made antisemitic remarks. One judge Jenny McCarthy is on record as an anti-vaxxer. Another Robin Thicke is famous for being a groper and a lech and ripping off Marvin Gaye. Maybe the exec who opened the door to Giuliani looked at that situation and said to themselves ""Well you know . . . glass houses and stones.""

And even if we acknowledge that shows like ""Dancing with the Stars"" have a history of casting polarizing political figures there's something extra sinister to hiding Giuliani under a mask before springing him on an unsuspecting audience. The show's draw is its veneer of family-friendly innocence and even its most controversial participant Sarah Palin has been defanged by the political establishment. She's still a terrible person but after she squawked her way out of that bear costume few people gave her a second thought.

Hate on her if you want and she assumes you do. She did not call for ""trial by combat"" minutes before insurrectionists invaded the Capitol building and hunted for congressional Democrats. Giuliani did that.

Anyway if I'm overreacting I'm in fine company.

""No single headline has captured the national zeitgeist of existential dread combined with ridicustupulocitiness better than this one"" Stephen Colbert joked on Thursday. ""That's right: the criminal goon that we know for a fact is being investigated for trying to overthrow our democracy for his idiot emperor was yukkin' it up on a reality show!""

Kimmel who broke the news to a Thursday night audience that howled in disgust asks ""How does this even happen?""

Then he answers his own question. ""I mean a lot of people at Fox had to sign off on this – not one of them was like 'Hey maybe we shouldn't have the guy who's under investigation for helping to plot an insurrection singing on our show'?""

He's right. ""The Masked Singer"" is not a small title for Fox. It finished the 2020-2021 TV season as the top-rated unscripted series among 18-to-49-year-olds the viewership most sought by advertisers. It's also among the top five most popular shows overall in that demographic. That means a lot of people at the top of the corporate food chain who are aware of its popularity gave it a thumbs up thinking of the ratings potential as opposed to the part it may play in making an amoral goblin seem like a harmless showman.

We should be dismayed at this but not surprised. As I have also previously pointed out – I'm getting tired of repeating myself! – it is their job to make their network money by selling products even poisonous ones. This also should be a reminder that the Fox broadcast network is still owned by Fox Corporation and the Murdochs.

So while Giuliani may have been banned from Fox News while it contends with Dominion's $1.6 billion lawsuit against the channel for backing the baseless election fraud claims transforming him into a man-sized stuffed animal for our amusement is . . . swell?

Ken Jeong acknowledged how wrong this is by walking off in protest. Thicke reportedly followed him but in a reminder of his spinelessness later said that he wasn't taking a stand against a fomenter of fascism. He was just checking on his friend. Just to be clear!

But no matter how long Giuliani gets to stand in that spotlight or what song he sings it's a note and a step towards sanitizing a long dirty ledger that's still unrolling.

And while I would not go so far as to theorize that sliding the former mayor of New York into a troll suit (or whatever he wore) will be enough to normalize him it does set a precedent I shiver to game out from here. If he's OK for this show who else is acceptable?

Maybe let's not answer that. We might give somebody new ideas.

This one is bad enough even if it does make for one hell of a punchline: ""One of the most chilling phrases in the English language"" Colbert says ""is 'Surprise! It's Rudy Giuliani.'""

For the full year same-store sales notched 13.8% which marked ""the highest U.S. annual comparable sales ever reported"" McDonald's announced in its earnings release back in January.

""90 percent of the businesses are owned by franchisees. They're very close to their customers…they understand what their local costs are"" Rensi noted.



""McDonald's has recommended…somewhere around 6 6.5 percent increase next year. The reality of it is every franchisee gets to decide their own prices based on community needs.""

The former McDonald’s CEO continued to say that another major issue besides inflation is the trucker’s shortage which is deeply impacting the restaurant industry.

After all something staggering had occurred: the green and brown M&M mascots had been remodelled to wear different shoes. Mars the company that owns M&Ms announced “We’re on a mission to create a world where everyone feels they belong using the power of fun! Join us in being for all funkind.”

The fight over the ridiculousness of this PR move broke out. Fox News host Tucker Carson raged about no longer being sexually attracted to the candy icons generating a slew of reactions making fun of his response. Others called into question the details of the remodel and the way it slut-shamed the women-coded characters. Some others criticized how it didn’t attract consumers or get across the message that Mars claims to support.

Among the numerous responses making fun of the remodel — including those from Stephen Colbert Trevor Noah and countless social media users — a repeated theme cropped up: this is a hilarious meaningless non-news stunt. Mars seems to have cemented itself as an out-of-touch brand vying for public approval through moral posturing. Just like that the company got all of our rage all of our mockery and all of our attention.

But while we kept our eyes trained on whether the orange M&M should represent anxiety Mars spent 2021 as the target of a class action lawsuit for profiting off of child slavery in cocoa harvesting. Many large chocolate manufacturers including Mars were sued in the past year by Mali citizens who were enslaved as children on cocoa farms funded by the companies. They were kidnapped from their families and taken to Côte d’Ivoire where they were surrounded by armed men and forced to work long hours in dangerous conditions.

Such cases have continued even though this issue has been a known problem in the cocoa industry for decades. The companies themselves even claimed that they’d commit to eradicating ‘the worst forms’ of abuse from their supply lines by 2005 — although they arbitrarily extended the deadline afterward.

Last summer the US Supreme Court dismissed the Mali citizens’ lawsuit by saying these international crimes did not happen on US soil. This is convenient — it sure is costly to go out and check whether the farms you’re financing use child slaves especially if willful ignorance will mean driving down cocoa prices through farms that don’t have to pay their workers. It is also easy to participate in human rights offences in other countries when you cannot be legally prosecuted for it. The court confirmed the legitimacy of the child slavery allegations; Mars got away on a technicality but they still profitted off of child slaves.

This story forces North American readers to face the circumstances to which our economic and legal structures subject colonized countries getting off scot-free in the process. But smart marketers know that these problems feel far enough removed from our reality that they can be obfuscated.

A seemingly braindead headline about the M&Ms no longer being sexy? Now that gets clicks. It’s so ridiculous that it’s memorable. And a right-winger losing it because he’s no longer attracted to a chocolate candy? What a fool! Aren’t these culture war commentators so silly? Mars fanned the discourse flame responding to the scandal in a tweet in which the green M&M smugly asks “Did my shoes really break the internet?”

Mind you we should still have conversations about how we exploit women’s images for advertisements. However in this case this remodel is meant to be the first and last conversation you have about Mars. That way the name of a company using child slavery is associated with its mascot scandal; the search results are populated with this discourse burying the lawsuit.

A company remodelling their mascots is at worst shallowly attempting to profiteer off of social justice talking points. A company profiting off of child slavery is evil. The remodel debacle requires little effort on the company’s part but letting the child slavery controversy reach the public with no distractions would force Mars to take public action to right its practices. Which option is best for the company and its reputation is an easy choice for PR to make.

Corporate marketers are skilled at attention control as can be seen from the history of company stunts that have used social issues to manufacture discourse and get press like Gilette’s ad criticizing toxic masculinity and Nike’s ad about police brutality. Mars took the tactic to the level of covering up human rights abuses.

Thankfully as I’ve found while writing this article some people are taking note of these connections and critiquing their capitalist roots. But considering the well of unethical corporate practices this stunt won’t be the last one.

Beware of manufactured outrage and of contributing to the spread of curated advertising narratives. In a world where our attention is invaluable for public action and is therefore a prime target for companies keep it where it matters. In this case call out the corporations who are getting away with profiting off the enslavement of children and critique the mass North American consumption of the products of exploitation.

Life is constantly providing reminders of this mainly in the form of influential entities doing exactly what they should not do. This week's example was brought to us by the announcement that Rudy Giuliani was revealed as a contestant on the upcoming seventh season of ""The Masked Singer.""

At the risk of sounding like America's angry mom screaming at all your rambunctious toddlers didn't we talk about this? What did I say? Did I not warn you several times not to touch the buttons on that image rehabilitation machine over there?

Yes.Yes I did! Here are the receipts: Back in ye olden days of 2018 I humbly requested talk show gatekeepers to refrain from promoting Sean Spicer's Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad book. Only ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" crossed that picket line which fine bygones.

Spicer's book didn't go on to be a bestseller but nevertheless he was invited to participate in ""Dancing with the Stars"" in 2018. All he did was lie to us about crowd sizes right?

RELATED: Giuliani prompts ""Masked Singer"" walkout

In November 2020 a few days after Donald Trump lost the presidential election to Joseph Biden I pleaded to the entertainment powers that be to resist the urge to rehabilitate any of the flunkies with him at that point.

""None of these figures deserve to turn up on celebrity editions of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" or drop in on ""The Conners"" for a hilarious cameo or to show their faces in any broadcast network entertainment title"" I wrote ""Not Kayleigh McEnany not Kimberly Guilfoyle not Mark Meadows none of them. Not now not ever.""

Shame on me for assuming a Giuliani ban was a given. After all by this point Sacha Baron Cohen had broadcast a video that caught Giuliani with his hands down his pants on a hotel bed appearing to prep himself for what he thought would be a sexual encounter with a young woman masquerading as an interviewer. This happened before his hair color melted off his face on live TV but after he'd ranted for nearly 40 minutes about supposed election fraud on a landscaping company's driveway kicking off the Big Lie.

Giuliani is a mess and if he weren't actively involved in destroying democracy that would make him a terrific reality show candidate. But he is at this moment facing multiple legal actions against him not the least of which is an investigation of his role in the January 6 2021 insurrection and his leadership of a plot to install illegitimate electors.

He is a central participant in a rolling coup against our democracy that is intensifying by the day including on Friday when the Republican National Committee officially rebranded the deadly attack on the Capitol and all the events leading up to it as ""legitimate political discourse.""

That's really enough for any producer with a shred of moral fiber to say ""You know what? I don't think this man should be featured in any of our hits let along one with the tagline of 'The Good the Bad and the Cuddly.'""

""The Masked Singer"" isn't an entirely unproblematic show mind you. Its host Nick Cannon has made antisemitic remarks. One judge Jenny McCarthy is on record as an anti-vaxxer. Another Robin Thicke is famous for being a groper and a lech and ripping off Marvin Gaye. Maybe the exec who opened the door to Giuliani looked at that situation and said to themselves ""Well you know . . . glass houses and stones.""

And even if we acknowledge that shows like ""Dancing with the Stars"" have a history of casting polarizing political figures there's something extra sinister to hiding Giuliani under a mask before springing him on an unsuspecting audience. The show's draw is its veneer of family-friendly innocence and even its most controversial participant Sarah Palin has been defanged by the political establishment. She's still a terrible person but after she squawked her way out of that bear costume few people gave her a second thought.

Hate on her if you want and she assumes you do. She did not call for ""trial by combat"" minutes before insurrectionists invaded the Capitol building and hunted for congressional Democrats. Giuliani did that.

Anyway if I'm overreacting I'm in fine company.

""No single headline has captured the national zeitgeist of existential dread combined with ridicustupulocitiness better than this one"" Stephen Colbert joked on Thursday. ""That's right: the criminal goon that we know for a fact is being investigated for trying to overthrow our democracy for his idiot emperor was yukkin' it up on a reality show!""

Kimmel who broke the news to a Thursday night audience that howled in disgust asks ""How does this even happen?""

Then he answers his own question. ""I mean a lot of people at Fox had to sign off on this – not one of them was like 'Hey maybe we shouldn't have the guy who's under investigation for helping to plot an insurrection singing on our show'?""

He's right. ""The Masked Singer"" is not a small title for Fox. It finished the 2020-2021 TV season as the top-rated unscripted series among 18-to-49-year-olds the viewership most sought by advertisers. It's also among the top five most popular shows overall in that demographic. That means a lot of people at the top of the corporate food chain who are aware of its popularity gave it a thumbs up thinking of the ratings potential as opposed to the part it may play in making an amoral goblin seem like a harmless showman.

We should be dismayed at this but not surprised. As I have also previously pointed out – I'm getting tired of repeating myself! – it is their job to make their network money by selling products even poisonous ones. This also should be a reminder that the Fox broadcast network is still owned by Fox Corporation and the Murdochs.

So while Giuliani may have been banned from Fox News while it contends with Dominion's $1.6 billion lawsuit against the channel for backing the baseless election fraud claims transforming him into a man-sized stuffed animal for our amusement is . . . swell?

Ken Jeong acknowledged how wrong this is by walking off in protest. Thicke reportedly followed him but in a reminder of his spinelessness later said that he wasn't taking a stand against a fomenter of fascism. He was just checking on his friend. Just to be clear!

But no matter how long Giuliani gets to stand in that spotlight or what song he sings it's a note and a step towards sanitizing a long dirty ledger that's still unrolling.

And while I would not go so far as to theorize that sliding the former mayor of New York into a troll suit (or whatever he wore) will be enough to normalize him it does set a precedent I shiver to game out from here. If he's OK for this show who else is acceptable?

Maybe let's not answer that. We might give somebody new ideas.

This one is bad enough even if it does make for one hell of a punchline: ""One of the most chilling phrases in the English language"" Colbert says ""is 'Surprise! It's Rudy Giuliani.'""

Former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi argued that inflation is driving every restaurant in the United States ""absolutely crazy"" and that the price of products has gone up ""substantially.""

""Portion sizes are shrinking. Prices are going up. It's just insane what's happening in the restaurant industry"" Rensi told ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast"" Friday.

INFLATION HITS MCDONALD'S ON FOOD COSTS LABOR

""It's also true of every other small business"" Rensi said. ""They're all suffering terribly from this federal inflation.""



McDonald’s says inflationary pressures will stick around in 2022 after profits and sales fell short of estimates.



In the U.S. the Golden Arches burger chain reported that same-store sales – or restaurants open at least a year – rose 7.5% from October to December [2021]. For the full year same-store sales notched 13.8% which marked ""the highest U.S. annual comparable sales ever reported"" McDonald's announced in its earnings release back in January.

""90 percent of the businesses are owned by franchisees. They're very close to their customers…they understand what their local costs are"" Rensi noted.



""McDonald's has recommended…somewhere around 6 6.5 percent increase next year. The reality of it is every franchisee gets to decide their own prices based on community needs.""

The former McDonald’s CEO continued to say that another major issue besides inflation is the trucker’s shortage which is deeply impacting the restaurant industry.

After all something staggering had occurred: the green and brown M&M mascots had been remodelled to wear different shoes. Mars the company that owns M&Ms announced “We’re on a mission to create a world where everyone feels they belong using the power of fun! Join us in being for all funkind.”

The fight over the ridiculousness of this PR move broke out. Fox News host Tucker Carson raged about no longer being sexually attracted to the candy icons generating a slew of reactions making fun of his response. Others called into question the details of the remodel and the way it slut-shamed the women-coded characters. Some others criticized how it didn’t attract consumers or get across the message that Mars claims to support.

Among the numerous responses making fun of the remodel — including those from Stephen Colbert Trevor Noah and countless social media users — a repeated theme cropped up: this is a hilarious meaningless non-news stunt. Mars seems to have cemented itself as an out-of-touch brand vying for public approval through moral posturing. Just like that the company got all of our rage all of our mockery and all of our attention.

But while we kept our eyes trained on whether the orange M&M should represent anxiety Mars spent 2021 as the target of a class action lawsuit for profiting off of child slavery in cocoa harvesting. Many large chocolate manufacturers including Mars were sued in the past year by Mali citizens who were enslaved as children on cocoa farms funded by the companies. They were kidnapped from their families and taken to Côte d’Ivoire where they were surrounded by armed men and forced to work long hours in dangerous conditions.

Such cases have continued even though this issue has been a known problem in the cocoa industry for decades. The companies themselves even claimed that they’d commit to eradicating ‘the worst forms’ of abuse from their supply lines by 2005 — although they arbitrarily extended the deadline afterward.

Last summer the US Supreme Court dismissed the Mali citizens’ lawsuit by saying these international crimes did not happen on US soil. This is convenient — it sure is costly to go out and check whether the farms you’re financing use child slaves especially if willful ignorance will mean driving down cocoa prices through farms that don’t have to pay their workers. It is also easy to participate in human rights offences in other countries when you cannot be legally prosecuted for it. The court confirmed the legitimacy of the child slavery allegations; Mars got away on a technicality but they still profitted off of child slaves.

This story forces North American readers to face the circumstances to which our economic and legal structures subject colonized countries getting off scot-free in the process. But smart marketers know that these problems feel far enough removed from our reality that they can be obfuscated.

A seemingly braindead headline about the M&Ms no longer being sexy? Now that gets clicks. It’s so ridiculous that it’s memorable. And a right-winger losing it because he’s no longer attracted to a chocolate candy? What a fool! Aren’t these culture war commentators so silly? Mars fanned the discourse flame responding to the scandal in a tweet in which the green M&M smugly asks “Did my shoes really break the internet?”

Mind you we should still have conversations about how we exploit women’s images for advertisements. However in this case this remodel is meant to be the first and last conversation you have about Mars. That way the name of a company using child slavery is associated with its mascot scandal; the search results are populated with this discourse burying the lawsuit.

A company remodelling their mascots is at worst shallowly attempting to profiteer off of social justice talking points. A company profiting off of child slavery is evil. The remodel debacle requires little effort on the company’s part but letting the child slavery controversy reach the public with no distractions would force Mars to take public action to right its practices. Which option is best for the company and its reputation is an easy choice for PR to make.

Corporate marketers are skilled at attention control as can be seen from the history of company stunts that have used social issues to manufacture discourse and get press like Gilette’s ad criticizing toxic masculinity and Nike’s ad about police brutality. Mars took the tactic to the level of covering up human rights abuses.

Thankfully as I’ve found while writing this article some people are taking note of these connections and critiquing their capitalist roots. But considering the well of unethical corporate practices this stunt won’t be the last one.

Beware of manufactured outrage and of contributing to the spread of curated advertising narratives. In a world where our attention is invaluable for public action and is therefore a prime target for companies keep it where it matters. In this case call out the corporations who are getting away with profiting off the enslavement of children and critique the mass North American consumption of the products of exploitation.

Garmin Epix Gen 2 review: The ultimate fitness watch MSRP $900.00 Score Details “The Garmin Epix series 2 provides detailed in-depth health metrics for dedicated athletes and beginners alike.” Pros Up to 16 days of battery life

Incredibly precise heart rate tracking

Detailed health metrics

Built-in altimeter and compass

Great social features

Extensive data customization Cons High price tag

Some metrics feel inaccurate

No ability to respond to messages through the watch

There’s value in knowing information about your health. If you’re trying to get in shape knowing your current resting heart rate can tell you a lot about your existing level of cardiovascular health. Your heart rate also tells you a lot about how effective your workout is for burning fat building endurance and more. Your Pulse Ox gives an estimation of the oxygen saturation level in your blood while your Respiration gives you an average of how much you breathe from minute to minute.

The Garmin Epix 2nd Gen tells me all this information and more. All I have to do is wear it. It’s one of the smartest fitness watches I’ve ever worn. With a few tweaks and improvements it could be the single best smartwatch I’ve ever used. The Garmin Epix is designed for serious athletes but it also carries a serious price point.

More health information than I can shake a stick at

The main purpose of the Garmin Epix is to tell you everything about your personal health and fitness. It provides a ridiculous amount of information — in fact more information than I can really use. For instance it includes tracking information about diving and even golf — two sports I’ve never participated in.

All of the information is available on the Garmin Epix itself (called “Glances”) but you can see a more detailed breakdown on your phone through the app. The “My Day Card” shows you information like what I detailed before but you can add or remove data that you aren’t interested in seeing. All of the options include:

Training Status : The Training Status metric uses your VO2 Max estimate your heat and altitude performance acclimation and your training load to gauge how your training is progressing.

: This is self-explanatory. You can manually add your weight or it can connect to certain external devices and be recorded automatically. Hydration: Your Hydrate measurement is the amount of water you’ve had throughout the day. You will need to add this manually.

All of that information is beginning to make this review feel more like a guide but it’s necessary to explain some of the quibbles I have with the device. The heart rate tracker is spot-on; I measured it against several other trackers I have and found it to be within one beat every time.

It provides a ridiculous amount of information.

The Body Battery is an interesting feature. You aren’t going to drop when your score is low (and in fact I don’t think it can hit zero — mine only went to five at the lowest.) You will definitely feel tired with a lower body battery score though.

Most of the metrics are accurate or at least within reason. I’ve used the Garmin Epix for a bit over two weeks now and have had few complaints. The only two that stand out are the Stress and Sleep measurements.

The Stress measurement doesn’t feel accurate in the slightest. It’s based on your heart rate so while exercising or exerting yourself your stress level might be high. The watch told me I was under high amounts of stress when resting on the couch one night watching TV. Considering I was half-asleep at the time I have to respectfully disagree.

The Sleep measurement is accurate but not a great reflection of your actual energy levels. Lower amounts of sleep should translate to lower energy levels but there were several nights where it showed less than five hours of sleep where I woke up and felt great. I noticed that the sleep measurement stops if you are awake for too long at any given time so it might register less sleep than I actually had.

More detailed information for those that want it

All of the above metrics are available at a glance but the Garmin Epix provides more detailed health information for those that want it. For example it provides users with a Fitness Age estimate that compares your actual age to your body’s level of fitness.

I’m 32 but it says my fitness age is 30. By increasing the amount of exercise I get each week the watch says I could reduce that to the fitness level of a 26-year-old.

You can measure your Lactate Threshold and HRV Stress levels through the use of the Epix paired with a Garmin chest heart rate monitor. This isn’t included with the Epix and requires a separate purchase. Garmin offers multiple heart rate monitors some of which are designed to be used by swimmers while others are for cyclists and runners.

Again this isn’t vital for normal day-to-day operation of the Epix — but serious athletes will appreciate the feature.

A crazy number of training options

The Garmin Epix really is a jack-of-all-trades kind of smartwatch. Cyclists can measure their functional threshold power VO2 Max and more. Golfers can download golf courses to have easy access to a map and even track their scores through the Epix. Another app called Garmin Dive can be downloaded to log your dives manage your gear check out maps and more.

If you’re training for a run the PacePro Pacing Strategies can help you build up your stamina and technique at a safe steady pace. Regardless of what kind of athlete you are there’s something in the Garmin app for you.

The Garmin Epix really is a jack-of-all-trades kind of smartwatch.

If you are a distance runner and want to stay safe while on a long trail you can set up LiveTrack a feature that lets friends and family know your location and status while on the trail. The Garmin Epix has incidence detection and will alert your emergency contact if something happens. It even sends your GPS location so that someone can find you. If you have an Android phone (the feature isn’t available for iOS users) you can use GroupTrack to see where all of your connections are in real time.

Even if you just want a way to keep yourself fit without going all out Weekly Monthly and Yearly challenges give you a community to compete against. Some of the challenges include walking one mile per day for 365 days cycling 250 kilometers in a single month and more.

A lot of customization but not a lot of variety

There’s a lot you can do with your Garmin Epix from an aesthetic perspective. The face can be customized by downloading a secondary app called ConnectIQ from the App Store or the Google Play Store.

ConnectIQ lets you browse dozens of different faces for Garmin smartwatches. Because it’s the catch-all app not every face is compatible with every watch — but I rarely encountered any that wouldn’t work with the Epix. The biggest problem is that many of these faces are custom-made and will ask you to make a donation through PayPal; if you don’t the face will constantly change and pester you for money.

There are a lot of completely free options though. I settled on one that shows a huge amount of information including the current weather sunrise and sunset times heart rate stair count step count and more. The only issue I’ve encountered with it so far is that the temperature often isn’t accurate.

ConnectIQ also lets you create custom watch faces through its Face It tab. If you’re the type that prefers to make something completely your own it’s worth checking out. I didn’t have much luck but then again my artistic talents stop at Paint By Number books.

There are a lot of faces to choose from but I found many of them to be so similar that they made little difference. The Garmin Epix is a training tool after all — even its physical design is sporty. It won’t pair well with a blazer and cufflinks so don’t worry about finding a formal dinner-worthy watch face.

The Epix isn’t the first Garmin smartwatch I’ve tested but it’s by far the best.

The ConnectIQ app isn’t just for finding watch faces though. You can connect various music apps straight to your Epix and download music to listen to offline. You can connect Bluetooth headphones to your Epix and listen to music without taking your phone with you.

There are also other training apps available through ConnectIQ but not all are created equally. Many are community-made and these apps can be hit or miss. Pay close attention to the rating score for each app. Some like the Hydration Tracking app from Garmin only scored 1.5 stars out of 5 while the Wikiloc Trails app had a 4 out of 5 from well over 1000 users.

The Epix has some epic features

The Epix isn’t the first Garmin smartwatch I’ve tested but it’s by far the best. It has a couple of features I haven’t seen before; for example it has a built-in altimeter and compass. It’s not a feature I expected to use much but I’ve found myself pulling up the compass on more than one occasion.

The built-in stopwatch is also tremendously useful although I’ll admit I’ve used it for cooking more than training. The Epix is easy to navigate and has become so much a part of my daily wear that I feel strange when it isn’t on my wrist.

The Garmin Epix can get up to 16 days of battery life in smartwatch mode but I found it closer to five to six with the always-on screen. Charging takes only a few hours. I find I rarely go without wearing the Epix now. It’s waterproof so you can shower with it (although I still can’t bring myself to shower with a smartwatch after years of keeping water far from electronics.)

You can link your Garmin account to Facebook Google and your phone’s contacts to find other Garmin users you know. You can share data and compete against them to add a more social aspect to your training — something that’s particularly nice to have in a time when many people are still avoiding the gym.

If none of your friends use Garmin you can search for public groups to join. Some are location-based but others are generalized groups that anyone can take part in. I found several for tennis and baseball. There are even groups for ultimate frisbee.

Our take

The Garmin Epix is a truly incredible smart fitness watch with only a few minor flaws. Just having it on my wrist has kept me more aware of my activity levels throughout the day and watching the numbers improve (along with the friendly community) keeps me motivated to continue working out.

Is there a better alternative?

The Garmin Epix combines the best features of other Garmin models into the ultimate fitness watch. It’s hard to compete against but there are a few options if you’re willing to sacrifice features. The Garmin Venu 2 is a more-affordable $400 but lacks many of the advanced tools the Epix has.

The Apple Watch Series 7 has a lot of fitness features but is more smartwatch than fitness tracker. If you want to be able to answer messages or make calls through your smartwatch you’ll need something like the Series 7 — the Epix doesn’t have that functionality.

How long will it last?

The Garmin Epix is built like a tank. It’s comfortable but definitely has a bit of weight to it. The screen is scratch-resistant and capable of withstanding a beating and it’s waterproof up to 10 meters. I expect it to last for years to come but if something happens Garmin offers a one-year limited warranty.

Should you buy it?

Yes — if you’re a serious athlete in need of an outstanding fitness watch capable of providing a slew of information. If you’re just starting out on your fitness journey consider a more affordable alternative. The $900 price point is steep for a fitness tracker that doesn’t have full smartwatch features.

But both wheat and corn managed a late-week rally bouncing off minor supports and finding solid buying through the close on Friday.

For the week Kansas City March was down 16¢ Minneapolis down 7¢ and Chicago down 23¢. Corn dropped 15¢ while soybeans soared 83¢. Corn is caught between the strong soybean performance and the weak wheat market; after tagging along with soybeans last week corn seemed to side with wheat this week.

Tensions between Ukraine and Russia remain high but have stabilized. Russia continued to add military forces/equipment to the borders so it is unlikely that nerves will calm any time soon. Russia claims they don't want war but their actions speak a completely different story. The wheat and corn markets sold out of much of the geopolitical risk premium but if a skirmish breaks out those markets will be sure to quickly replace that premium.

Next Wednesday we will get the February supply/demand report. Early estimates suggest the trade is looking for U.S. ending stocks for wheat and corn to be close to last month while soybeans will decline. World end stocks for corn and soybeans look to be slightly lower with wheat unchanged. The report is expected to show a drop in corn and soybean production from South America due to the ongoing drought in southern Brazil/northern Argentina along with persistent rain/flooding on mature soybeans in the north.

The stressful weather in South America is causing record corn and soybean production losses and will directly affect their export supplies. World demand is expected to shift to the U.S. for soybeans and the U.S./Ukraine for corn. Thus if Ukraine's export channels get disrupted by a Russian invasion then it is all U.S. for corn as well and it is an all-out bull market for grains.

There was very little wiggle room for supply declines before the drought as grains were already in a bull market from weather issues last year in South America. This year is worse than last year and we have the added fear factor of Black Sea unrest.

For wheat record production in Argentina and Australia had a notable dampening effect on price for the last couple of months. I expect those fundamentals are largely factored into price by now. Moving forward the market will increasingly focus on U.S. hard red winter wheat production across the Plains most of which is in a drought status.

Recent snows have softened the fear somewhat but the crop is still dormant. It will soon start growing and the need for rain will be immediate. Crop condition ratings have plummeted since fall so there is already a good chance of below-normal yields.

Export sales last week were a mere 161 TMT for both old and new crop below even the low end of expectations. Year-to-date sales are at 17.5 MMT down 5 MMT from last year a 23% drop. Wheat sales sit at 78% of USDA's projections compared with the 86% average.

Corn export sales year-to-date sit at 45 MMT down 11 MMT from last year at this time a 20% drop. Corn sales currently are 73% of USDA's projections compared with 67% average. Soybean export sales year-to-date sit at 45 MMT down 13 MMT from last year a 23% drop. Current sales sit at 81% of USDA's projections equal to the average.

A noteworthy piece of news this week was that Russia and China signed an agreement that allows wheat and barley from all of Russia's regions to be imported by China. Russia has steadily made inroads to markets across the globe particularly as their grain quality has improved and this agreement is huge for them. For China it adds a major supplier for grain imports who won't balk if China runs into geopolitical issues themselves over Taiwan.

I think the recent drop in wheat has been as much about being the short leg of spreads against soybeans and corn as about recent moisture. Very little if any weather premium remains at the current price level. Corn is trying to keep up with soybeans and higher corn will ultimately pull wheat higher. Moving forward I look for wheat to regain some weather risk at least until we are confident of yields.

Seasonally wheat tends to rally into the February crop report which of course is next week. Considering the long way wheat has sold off if we do have a rally it would most likely be just a swing high. I look for longer term highs in all the grains to be early May – unless we have weather issues then look for rallies to extend longer in time.

Computer scientists coined the colorful expression “garbage in garbage out” in the earliest days of data processing a term first recorded in an article in 1963 when an AP reporter visited an early computer lab.

Nearly 60 years later we’re still struggling with data credibility.

A study last year from HFS Research found that 75% of execs don’t have a high level of trust in their data. And a Gartner study from a few years ago reported that 40% of enterprise data is either inaccurate incomplete or unavailable.

This as data volumes continue to explode and AI applications increase. IDC estimates that the amount of data created in the next three years will eclipse the amount created in the previous thirty.

A 2012 comment from statistician Nate Silver in NPR still holds:

“We’re not that much smarter than we used to be even though we have much more information — and that means the real skill now is learning how to pick out the useful information from all this noise.”

I think this is an important reminder in enterprise decision-making as we all try to get savvier over time with how we work with the data we have access to. We have to learn how to be data-driven without being data-blinded neither accepting information wholesale nor rejecting it outright.

Netscape founding CEO Jim Barksdale famously gave one of my favorite quotes about data-driven decision making:

“If we have data let’s look at the data. If all we have are opinions let’s go with mine.”

Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:"

COVID has spurred rapid changes in how clinicians deliver healthcare and how technology is enhancing everything from diagnostic imaging to data storage. It also changed the format for one of the world’s largest gatherings of radiologists researchers and medical imaging providers who convene in Chicago for the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). As a result of COVID-19 restrictions attendees had the choice to join in person or virtually.

No matter how you experienced the show one thing was clear while some industries are struggling to rebound from a collapse caused by COVID healthcare is experiencing a technology boom. Innovation in medical imaging has accelerated not in spite of COVID-19 but because of it.

New AI-enabled products that meet the increased demand for access to data streamline processes that improve care and help crunch vast amounts of information to reveal patterns that can improve diagnosis or prevent mistakes are coming to market at lightning speed. Here are some of the technologies and solutions that reflect this transformation launched by GE Healthcare at or in the runup to #RSNA21.

Of all the weapons deployed against COVID-19 one of the least heralded may be X-ray technology which as it turns out is a truly important tool in treating severe cases. Doctors treating a patient overwhelmed by COVID-19 frequently turn to an endotracheal tube and ventilator to supply needed oxygen. However placing this tube can be an imprecise process. Now a new artificial intelligence algorithm embedded in the latest X-ray scanners helps doctors assess endotracheal tubes placement. The AI quickly alerts caregivers helping them to prevent complications such as collapsed lungs.

This AI technology called Critical Care Suite 2.0 is one of roughly 60 innovations GE unveiled at #RSNA21. Among the other advances GE announced are a partnership with the University of Cambridge health system to make better use of patient and clinical data to help improve cancer treatment and a pocket-sized ultrasound scanner that clinicians can use to diagnose patients outside of hospitals and clinics.[1]

But wait there’s more.

Up Close And Personal

Years before she began designing Critical Care Suite to make X-ray systems more intelligent engineer Katelyn Nye experienced firsthand how medical devices can help save lives. Since she was a teenager Nye has had an implanted defibrillator a machine that has had to restart her heart more than once. When it comes to innovating technology to help doctors improve patient outcomes for Katelyn it’s personal. You can find the story here.

Collaborating To Make AI Work

One of the challenges healthcare providers face is making sense of the copious amounts of data they collect data that is often difficult for different parts of an organization to access and use. A trio of new partnerships that GE Healthcare announced at RSNA aims to unlock these data silos and speed the application of AI to some of medicine’s most pressing problems. Starting with the University of Cambridge GE will be partnering with doctors there who are working on how best to deliver cancer treatments. GE will work with clinicians to develop an application that brings together different sources of patient data into a single interface. The other partnerships are with Optellum a U.K.-based company that helps clinicians diagnose the severity of some lung cancers and SOPHiA GENETICS which focuses on digital oncology and radiogenomic analysis. Read about the partnerships here.

The Heroes Among Us

Sometimes the most meaningful improvements make healthcare delivery easier on both patients and doctors. Enter the SIGNA Hero[2] GE Healthcare’s new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system named in honor of the world’s healthcare workers. This new system is designed to more easily accommodate patients of different shapes and sizes allowing more patients to be scanned and in more comfort. The SIGNA Hero is designed to use AI to improve image clarity and speed up scanning times by 30% to 50% which could be a lifesaver for hospitals and clinics facing a huge backlog of nonurgent care from the pandemic.[3] Read more about the SIGNA Hero here.

A CAT Scan With Nine Lives

Computed tomography (CT) scanning has come a long way from the days when machines were too slow to make imaging a patient’s entire body practical. In fact today CT technology moves so fast that hospitals and other healthcare facilities have a problem: rapid obsolescence. Whereas new CT technology once arrived every four to five years today advances come annually making it challenging for those who purchase these lifesaving systems to plan ahead. Enter the Revolution Apex platform a modular CT system that an industry first[4] allows for upgrades with minimal hassle and that will mean these machines can stay in use longer. Revolution Apex is also fast — fast enough to capture a clear image of the heart in motion[5] something that CT machines have traditionally had a tough time with. The system’s launch couldn’t come at a more critical time as COVID-19 and other factors have ramped up the demand for such imaging while staffing shortages have become persistent. Read about the Revolution Apex here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMzQ2OTA5L2phcGFuLXdpc2hlcy10by1hZHZhbmNlLWVjb25vbWljLXJlbGF0aW9ucy13aXRoLW1vcm9jY2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan Wishes to Advance Economic Relations with Morocco,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FsY29uLWFubm91bmNlcy1uZXctbGVhZGVycy1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alcon Announces New Leaders in Asia Pacific  Business News,"SINGAPORE - Media OutReach - 7 February 2022 - Alcon  the global leader in eye care dedicated to helping people see brilliantly today announced it has appointed Chintan Desai and Stephanie Waugh to lead the company's Surgical and Vision Care franchises in Asia Pacific (APAC) region.

Why trust us?

Garmin Epix Gen 2 review: The ultimate fitness watch MSRP $900.00 Score Details “The Garmin Epix series 2 provides detailed in-depth health metrics for dedicated athletes and beginners alike.” Pros Up to 16 days of battery life

Incredibly precise heart rate tracking

Detailed health metrics

Built-in altimeter and compass

Great social features

Extensive data customization Cons High price tag

Some metrics feel inaccurate

No ability to respond to messages through the watch

There’s value in knowing information about your health. If you’re trying to get in shape knowing your current resting heart rate can tell you a lot about your existing level of cardiovascular health. Your heart rate also tells you a lot about how effective your workout is for burning fat building endurance and more. Your Pulse Ox gives an estimation of the oxygen saturation level in your blood while your Respiration gives you an average of how much you breathe from minute to minute.

The Garmin Epix 2nd Gen tells me all this information and more. All I have to do is wear it. It’s one of the smartest fitness watches I’ve ever worn. With a few tweaks and improvements it could be the single best smartwatch I’ve ever used. The Garmin Epix is designed for serious athletes but it also carries a serious price point.

More health information than I can shake a stick at

The main purpose of the Garmin Epix is to tell you everything about your personal health and fitness. It provides a ridiculous amount of information — in fact more information than I can really use. For instance it includes tracking information about diving and even golf — two sports I’ve never participated in.

All of the information is available on the Garmin Epix itself (called “Glances”) but you can see a more detailed breakdown on your phone through the app. The “My Day Card” shows you information like what I detailed before but you can add or remove data that you aren’t interested in seeing. All of the options include:

Training Status : The Training Status metric uses your VO2 Max estimate your heat and altitude performance acclimation and your training load to gauge how your training is progressing.

: The Training Status metric uses your VO2 Max estimate your heat and altitude performance acclimation and your training load to gauge how your training is progressing. Heart Rate : This measures your resting heart rate throughout the day as well as the highest rate you reached.

: This is self-explanatory. You can manually add your weight or it can connect to certain external devices and be recorded automatically. Hydration: Your Hydrate measurement is the amount of water you’ve had throughout the day. You will need to add this manually.

All of that information is beginning to make this review feel more like a guide but it’s necessary to explain some of the quibbles I have with the device. The heart rate tracker is spot-on; I measured it against several other trackers I have and found it to be within one beat every time.

It provides a ridiculous amount of information.

The Body Battery is an interesting feature. You aren’t going to drop when your score is low (and in fact I don’t think it can hit zero — mine only went to five at the lowest.) You will definitely feel tired with a lower body battery score though.

Most of the metrics are accurate or at least within reason. I’ve used the Garmin Epix for a bit over two weeks now and have had few complaints. The only two that stand out are the Stress and Sleep measurements.

The Stress measurement doesn’t feel accurate in the slightest. It’s based on your heart rate so while exercising or exerting yourself your stress level might be high. The watch told me I was under high amounts of stress when resting on the couch one night watching TV. Considering I was half-asleep at the time I have to respectfully disagree.

The Sleep measurement is accurate but not a great reflection of your actual energy levels. Lower amounts of sleep should translate to lower energy levels but there were several nights where it showed less than five hours of sleep where I woke up and felt great. I noticed that the sleep measurement stops if you are awake for too long at any given time so it might register less sleep than I actually had.

More detailed information for those that want it

All of the above metrics are available at a glance but the Garmin Epix provides more detailed health information for those that want it. For example it provides users with a Fitness Age estimate that compares your actual age to your body’s level of fitness.

I’m 32 but it says my fitness age is 30. By increasing the amount of exercise I get each week the watch says I could reduce that to the fitness level of a 26-year-old.

You can measure your Lactate Threshold and HRV Stress levels through the use of the Epix paired with a Garmin chest heart rate monitor. This isn’t included with the Epix and requires a separate purchase. Garmin offers multiple heart rate monitors some of which are designed to be used by swimmers while others are for cyclists and runners.

Again this isn’t vital for normal day-to-day operation of the Epix — but serious athletes will appreciate the feature.

A crazy number of training options

The Garmin Epix really is a jack-of-all-trades kind of smartwatch. Cyclists can measure their functional threshold power VO2 Max and more. Golfers can download golf courses to have easy access to a map and even track their scores through the Epix. Another app called Garmin Dive can be downloaded to log your dives manage your gear check out maps and more.

If you’re training for a run the PacePro Pacing Strategies can help you build up your stamina and technique at a safe steady pace. Regardless of what kind of athlete you are there’s something in the Garmin app for you.

The Garmin Epix really is a jack-of-all-trades kind of smartwatch.

If you are a distance runner and want to stay safe while on a long trail you can set up LiveTrack a feature that lets friends and family know your location and status while on the trail. The Garmin Epix has incidence detection and will alert your emergency contact if something happens. It even sends your GPS location so that someone can find you. If you have an Android phone (the feature isn’t available for iOS users) you can use GroupTrack to see where all of your connections are in real time.

Even if you just want a way to keep yourself fit without going all out Weekly Monthly and Yearly challenges give you a community to compete against. Some of the challenges include walking one mile per day for 365 days cycling 250 kilometers in a single month and more.

A lot of customization but not a lot of variety

There’s a lot you can do with your Garmin Epix from an aesthetic perspective. The face can be customized by downloading a secondary app called ConnectIQ from the App Store or the Google Play Store.

ConnectIQ lets you browse dozens of different faces for Garmin smartwatches. Because it’s the catch-all app not every face is compatible with every watch — but I rarely encountered any that wouldn’t work with the Epix. The biggest problem is that many of these faces are custom-made and will ask you to make a donation through PayPal; if you don’t the face will constantly change and pester you for money.

There are a lot of completely free options though. I settled on one that shows a huge amount of information including the current weather sunrise and sunset times heart rate stair count step count and more. The only issue I’ve encountered with it so far is that the temperature often isn’t accurate.

ConnectIQ also lets you create custom watch faces through its Face It tab. If you’re the type that prefers to make something completely your own it’s worth checking out. I didn’t have much luck but then again my artistic talents stop at Paint By Number books.

There are a lot of faces to choose from but I found many of them to be so similar that they made little difference. The Garmin Epix is a training tool after all — even its physical design is sporty. It won’t pair well with a blazer and cufflinks so don’t worry about finding a formal dinner-worthy watch face.

The Epix isn’t the first Garmin smartwatch I’ve tested but it’s by far the best.

The ConnectIQ app isn’t just for finding watch faces though. You can connect various music apps straight to your Epix and download music to listen to offline. You can connect Bluetooth headphones to your Epix and listen to music without taking your phone with you.

There are also other training apps available through ConnectIQ but not all are created equally. Many are community-made and these apps can be hit or miss. Pay close attention to the rating score for each app. Some like the Hydration Tracking app from Garmin only scored 1.5 stars out of 5 while the Wikiloc Trails app had a 4 out of 5 from well over 1000 users.

The Epix has some epic features

The Epix isn’t the first Garmin smartwatch I’ve tested but it’s by far the best. It has a couple of features I haven’t seen before; for example it has a built-in altimeter and compass. It’s not a feature I expected to use much but I’ve found myself pulling up the compass on more than one occasion.

The built-in stopwatch is also tremendously useful although I’ll admit I’ve used it for cooking more than training. The Epix is easy to navigate and has become so much a part of my daily wear that I feel strange when it isn’t on my wrist.

The Garmin Epix can get up to 16 days of battery life in smartwatch mode but I found it closer to five to six with the always-on screen. Charging takes only a few hours. I find I rarely go without wearing the Epix now. It’s waterproof so you can shower with it (although I still can’t bring myself to shower with a smartwatch after years of keeping water far from electronics.)

You can link your Garmin account to Facebook Google and your phone’s contacts to find other Garmin users you know. You can share data and compete against them to add a more social aspect to your training — something that’s particularly nice to have in a time when many people are still avoiding the gym.

If none of your friends use Garmin you can search for public groups to join. Some are location-based but others are generalized groups that anyone can take part in. I found several for tennis and baseball. There are even groups for ultimate frisbee.

Our take

The Garmin Epix is a truly incredible smart fitness watch with only a few minor flaws. Just having it on my wrist has kept me more aware of my activity levels throughout the day and watching the numbers improve (along with the friendly community) keeps me motivated to continue working out.

Is there a better alternative?

The Garmin Epix combines the best features of other Garmin models into the ultimate fitness watch. It’s hard to compete against but there are a few options if you’re willing to sacrifice features. The Garmin Venu 2 is a more-affordable $400 but lacks many of the advanced tools the Epix has.

The Apple Watch Series 7 has a lot of fitness features but is more smartwatch than fitness tracker. If you want to be able to answer messages or make calls through your smartwatch you’ll need something like the Series 7 — the Epix doesn’t have that functionality.

How long will it last?

The Garmin Epix is built like a tank. It’s comfortable but definitely has a bit of weight to it. The screen is scratch-resistant and capable of withstanding a beating and it’s waterproof up to 10 meters. I expect it to last for years to come but if something happens Garmin offers a one-year limited warranty.

Should you buy it?

Yes — if you’re a serious athlete in need of an outstanding fitness watch capable of providing a slew of information. If you’re just starting out on your fitness journey consider a more affordable alternative. The $900 price point is steep for a fitness tracker that doesn’t have full smartwatch features.

It requires us to be cognizant of their preferences that have undergone a sea-change in the last decade. Where factors like a retailer’s or a salesperson’s ability to hard sell the product were often the final push in deciding customer opinion we are in an era where the customer has become savvier more product and quality conscious.These are also buyers who are fueling the D2C growth in India. The pandemic further pushed the trend with more companies joining the D2C bandwagon in 2020. The results were often highly encouraging with many brands seeing an almost 88% uptick in demand in 2020 compared to the previous year. Improved internet access combined with increasingly interactive tech platforms have allowed brands to directly reach out to consumers like never before.But with the emergence of embedded technologies like AI and highly interactive platforms brands are also under pressure to keep apace with technological advancement. The thrust now is to adapt tech that combines efficiency with personalised service to drive customer engagement.Today no brand can afford to ignore the common tech platforms including an interactive website and social media . Messaging tools like chats WhatsApp or Facebook messenger are utilised to reach out to potential customers share catalogues or portfolios. SMSs or WhatsApp messages are utilised to establish initial contact informing the customer of their order ID or tracking number.Other than advertising and marketing  social media like Facebook are also important for staying in touch with existing or potential customers. These platforms can be utilised to form communities inform customers of new launches or address their concerns.With the multiple communication channels that we use today it is equally important to ensure a seamless experience across these platforms. For instance customers today expect their interaction to flow in one direction from the time they place an order to the addressal of any issue they may have. For instance if they have reached out through chat they expect the follow-up call agent to be aware of their interaction history.Under an omnichannel approach all channels are connected integrating all customer interaction in a single system that can be accessed instantly by the service agent. While it ensures an efficient experience for the consumer the service agent also benefits from the access to the entire customer history.New-age customer service now requires the integration of these channels to provide customers with a 360 degree experience. It involves a tiered approach where interaction can be managed as per their priority. It moves from asynchronous messaging to personalised interaction to ensure speedy redressal of customer queries and issues while optimising the utilisation of available resources.Customer interaction starts with chatbots or virtual agents with automated responses. Unresolved queries are handled by an agent through chat. It can be followed by increasingly personalised services from a call to agent’s visit as required. At the back office a similar tiered approach connects all channels ensuring an omnichannel approach.The digitalisation of customer experience is only in keeping with an overall digital-only approach we see today.

Belgium’s families will be the first worldwide to get a look at the design of Brussels’ new Lego Discovery Centre interactive indoor play place. Previous destinations were called Legoland Discovery Centers.

“We are delighted that our partnership with the Lego Group continues to deliver such fantastic opportunities for our guests” said Justin Platt chief strategy officer Merlin Entertainments.

“By working together to design and build this next generation of the Lego Discovery Centres we can cater for even more families looking for the ultimate Lego morning or afternoon of indoor activity which the whole family can enjoy together” he added.

The state-of-the-art playground will feature four major attractions:

Lego Space digital creator allows kids and their grown-ups to digitally build a space rocket out of Lego scan their build launch it and then fly it into outer space where they can dodge aliens and land on planets within the Lego Space solar system.

Imagination Express train ride lets participants use magical devices (and score points!) while embarking on an interactive adventure. The ride passes through a larger-than-life Lego world. Start in a bubble bath dive down the plug hole and plunge into a Lego-style ocean before launching into space.

Preschoolers have their own play area designed especially for ages five and under. The playscape includes little ones’ favorite back-in-time reptiles through a dinosaur-themed carousel and slides.

A team of Playmakers and Master Builders will be on hand helping families “learn through play.” Interactive Lego Creative Workshops inspire guests to have fun while learning through Lego-based activities.

“We are excited to partner with Merlin Entertainments on the development of the new Lego Discovery Centre in Brussels which will immerse the whole family in the world of Lego play” said Julia Goldin chief product and marketing officer The Lego Group.

“By creating this highly interactive indoor Lego experience” she continued “we will give families a place to play explore create and have fun together. Working closely with Merlin Entertainments and their expertise in the location-based entertainment sector we hope to spark curiosity creativity and imagination for the builders of tomorrow.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdnVlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21vbmV5L2Vjb25vbXkvYm9vbXRvd24tMjA0MC9iaXRjb2luLW1pbmluZy10ZXhhcy1wb3dlci1ncmlkLzI2OS00ODkwYThkMC0xYjRmLTQ5OWEtYjNmOS00ZTZmYzBhMmQzZDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin in Austin: Can the power grid keep up?,"While crypto-mining supporters say Bitcoin mining brings balance to the Texas grid others say it needs to be regulated to make sure of that.

AUSTIN Texas — Texas and cryptocurrency mining could soon become synonymous as companies flock to the business-friendly state. But can the ERCOT grid handle the intense energy requirement?

Driving into one of the largest Bitcoin mining facilities in North America we didn't know what to expect.

""This building is 1050 feet long and 60 feet wide"" said Riot Whinstone CEO Chad Harris. ""You don't see this in Bitcoin mining.""

Riot Whinstone is an unusually large mining facility in Rockdale Texas just an hour northeast of Austin. Harris said they broke ground in January 2020 and started mining in June of that year.

Inside each football-field-length warehouse are thousands of computers buzzing like worker bees mining almost nonstop to create a sweet profit – Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a form of cryptocurrency which is a form of digital money usually called a coin. Bitcoin is the original form of cryptocurrency and right now it's the most valuable. In April of 2021 one bitcoin was worth more than $60000 but the price fluctuates often. Creating more coins or mining them takes a lot of energy.

""If I sent $20 in bitcoin to you it requires approximately the amount of electricity that an American household will use in an entire month"" said Cryptocurrency legal expert Blockchain Democracy author and Texas A&M Professor William Magnuson.

Magnuson worries that the intense energy usage from cryptocurrency mining will lead to more carbon emissions.

So why does crypto-mining require so much power?

""There are about 100000 machines here"" said Harris.

Harris said every machine or miner is racing 24 hours a day to solve a complicated math problem. The computer that solves it first produces the new unique bitcoin.

""So one single machine after power cost earns $30 to $31 a day"" said Harris.

Harris said working together these machines make about 63 bitcoins a day.

That translates to more than $3 million. To do that the data center needs 300 megawatts of energy. The problem is that after every coin is made it's harder to solve that complicated math problem which leads to a demand for even more power.

To fulfill that need Riot Whinstone is expanding adding enough computers to need another 400 megawatts. That's enough to power a large city.

""Texas has some of the lowest costs energy in the world"" said the president of the Texas Blockchain Council Lee Bratcher.""

The cheap energy cost and business-friendly incentives are why cryptocurrency miners and related companies are flocking to Texas.

""We think that the ethos of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and blockchain in general fits very well with the state of Texas' decentralized love freedom-loving and kind of outside-the-box independent thinking"" said Bratcher.

Bratcher started the Texas Blockchain Council in 2020 with the goal of making Texas ""Bitcoin mining country"" and Austin the ""Bitcoin mining capital of the world.""

""We have about 75 member companies about 250 individual members"" said Bratcher.

The council regularly holds meetings in Austin Houston and Dallas for the cryptocurrency community. They recently held one of Texas' largest blockchain summits in Austin.

""About 700 thought leaders and industry professionals from all over the country attended the event in Austin"" said Bratcher.

Texas Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn were in attendance. Along with Gov. Greg Abbott the two said they support Texas becoming a crypto leader.

""Several of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the world are headquartered themselves in Austin"" said Bratcher. ""There's so much tech talent in Austin. The number of job openings for cryptocurrency companies financial services companies funds tech startups is just out of control in Austin and Dallas and Houston as well.""

Blockcap another mining and blockchain company moved its headquarters from Las Vegas to Austin in 2021. There are more than four dozen blockchain companies in Austin. Blockchain systems essentially serve as digital ledgers. Most of the time it's used to track Bitcoin activity and transactions.

Just less than a mile from Riot Whinstone is Bitdeer another leading Bitcoin miner in the continent needing about the same amount of energy.

In West Texas Genesis Digital Assets is building a new self-hosted Bitcoin mining data center with 300 megawatts of capacity and power sourced from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) according to their statement.

And the list goes on.

""We know that the Texas grid is unstable"" said Magnuson.

The winter storm of February 2021 crippled the Texas power grid leading to over 240 deaths.

Crypto-mining supporters argue they bring balance to the grid in two ways. One by using energy that otherwise wouldn't be used.

""While if I wasn't using the amount of power that I'm using you would be paying more for your power"" said Harris.

Two by being able to power down in seconds when electricity demand is high.

""Bitcoin miners can turn off within five seconds so they actually provide grid resiliency by increasing baseload demand"" said Bratcher.

Cryptocurrency mining isn't regulated in Texas so there's no rule forcing miners to turn off.

""How do we know that cryptocurrency miners are acting responsibly?"" asked Magnuson. ""How do we know if cryptocurrency miners will power down their facility when the electricity grid is struggling?""

Harris said while it's not required there is an incentive. Harris said their electricity costs are lower if they shut down during peak demand.

""It can be from 15 minutes to four hours"" said Harris. ""For that we're rewarded a lesser fee for transmission. It's about 400th of a cent per kilowatt-hour.""

Harris said they powered down about 72 times last summer as well as during the winter storm. But Harris admits that not everyone will live by that honor code and shut down when needed.

""You're going to have a gold standard and we believe we're it and then you're going to have people that might not behave the same way"" said Harris.

Since the winter storm state leaders made it mandatory for power plants to winterize but University of Texas energy expert Joshua Rhodes said that's not enough.

""Half the power plants in ERCOT run on natural gas"" said Rhodes. ""If we don't fix the natural gas sector then it doesn't really help to have power plants that can operate if you can't get fuel to them because they're not going to make electricity.""

Because blockchain is unregulated it's unclear how many Bitcoin miners are in Texas.

""There is no central database that keeps track of where all the Bitcoin mines are located"" said Magnuson. ""We don't know where many of them are except press releases.""

This means it's hard to know how much power miners are actually using.

""We need our government regulators to step in and clarify the rules that apply to cryptocurrency"" said Magnuson.

""We don't regulate any other load being those large petrochemical refineries and oil and gas facilities on the on the gulf coast"" said Rhodes.

There are still a lot of unknowns but one thing is for sure the buzz surrounding Bitcoin is growing. You can now use it to buy Dallas Mavericks tickets or exchange currency at your local H-E-B. And soon you'll start seeing QR codes to use Bitcoin at restaurants.

""Exactly what it's designed to do is to create a financial opportunity freedom with no outside governance to allow people to exchange currency for goods and services"" said Harris. ""It's amazing.""

As more miners swarm to Texas only time will tell if the buzzing machines will pollinate our electricity grid or give it a paralyzing sting.

Ebbing was selected last year as the Air Force's preferred location for a pilot training center for Singapore and other countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program. The proposal would accommodate up to 24 foreign Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft and move 12 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Singapore air force currently at the Luke Air Force Base at Glendale Ariz.

Residents largely spoke in support of the mission with questions regarding how they can welcome Singaporeans when contractors can bid on construction projects and when aircraft will start arriving.

Three people raised concerns regarding potential noise levels the program would bring and whether it would affect surrounding residents. Air Force officials said no noise studies have been done because it's too early in the process.

Patrick Jeanes of the Air Force's Air Education and Training Command said the move would require increases in personnel changes in aircraft numbers and operations and construction or renovation to support the F-16 and F-35 aircraft as well as a two F-35 flight simulator facilities. He said Ebbing could expect 384 military and civilian personnel -- which would be accompanied by dependents -- and about 3500-6600 annual flights with 10%-15% done between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.

Jeanes said if the center is at Fort Smith residents can expect F-16s around June 2023 and the first F-35s in July 2024.

Jeanes said the Singapore air force must leave Luke Air Force Base so the base can accommodate incoming F-35 aircraft. He said Ebbing would eventually host various countries' air force personnel over the course of the program including Poland and Finland and the base could remain indefinitely.

David Martin environmental impact statement project manager from the Air Force's Civil Engineer Center said it's too early in the process to answer a lot of the questions especially considering Fort Smith hasn't been officially chosen as the program site.

A couple of people questioned whether the Fort Smith Regional Airport runway extension is also a part of this project.

During the public comment portion Carl Geffken city administrator said the extension is a city project for economic development.

""We are very much in favor of this project coming to Fort Smith and most importantly the city Sebastian County and the state of Arkansas have been willing and able to do what's necessary in order to secure this project"" Geffken said.

Martin said it's federal law for agencies to identify and consider environmental consequences of implementing proposals such as at Ebbing. He said the National Environmental Policy Act requires an environmental impact statement to evaluate noise air quality compatible land use environmental justice socioeconomic factors air space use and management biological resources cultural resources hazardous material and solid waste health and safety physical resources transportation and potential noise.

""The EIS process began with a notice of intent that was published in a federal register on Jan. 14 This began the formal scoping period which ends on Feb. 14 2022. Please note all scoping comments must be received or postmarked by Feb. 14 2022. We anticipate having a draft EIS out for public review and comment in the summer of this year and a final EIS in early 2023"" Martin said.

While Ebbing is the preferred location the Air Force chose Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township Mich. if the center couldn't be at Fort Smith for some reason.

Roughly eight Harrison Township Mich. residents also spoke during the public comment portion to request Selfridge Air National Guard Base be chosen for the program instead.

""We'll embrace the Air Force. We do have a history of having F-16s in the area"" Fort Smith Mayor George McGill said. ""We appreciate the information you are providing to the community and we look forward to meeting everyone and greeting everyone. Our schools are prepared to meet your students and your children when they arrive as well. We're looking forward to it and when you do an honest assessment of our base you're going to find it has everything that you need to provide a successful mission.""

Here Are the Potential Buyers.,"A number of defense heavyweights will probably be lining up to take a look at Mantech International.

Defense contractor Mantech International (MANT) has reportedly put up a ""for sale"" sign with company co-founder George Pedersen said to be exploring options for his controlling stake.

The deal talk surrounding Mantech should come as no surprise. Pedersen is 85 and has stepped away from the business in recent years factors that had us thinking about a potential sale of the company a little over a year ago.

Mantech which is valued at about $3.1 billion would make a tempting morsel for many defense titans. The company generates nearly half of its revenue from the intelligence community. That work tends to be renewed more easily than most government IT work which makes it more valuable to would-be buyers.

But Mantech today has margins that trail some of its rivals because of the cost-plus nature of much of its business and it has forecast anemic growth in 2022. Any would-be buyer would have to be attracted to the long-term value in the portfolio and look past what could be a rough few quarters ahead.

A lot of the biggest names in defense companies like Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.19%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC -0.05%) have shifted away from defense IT and are unlikely to get involved. But there are still plenty of potential bidders.

Here are four defense companies that are likely to take a close look at acquiring Mantech.

Leidos: The biggest name in defense IT

Leidos Holdings (LDOS 0.67%) ranks as the largest government IT contractor a position it has reached by being an active acquirer. Leidos was formed by the 2016 merger between units of SAIC (SAIC 1.73%) and Lockheed Martin and in the years since it has done a number of follow-on deals.

The Reuters report discussing Mantech's plans said the company and its banker had reached out to Leidos and for good reason. Leidos is valued at $12.4 billion and has the financial wherewithal to raise the capital necessary to pay for Mantech. A purchase would be a strong strategic fit making Leidos one of the top contractors to the intelligence community.

But Leidos is still in the process of paying down some of its debt from other acquisitions. The company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio today is pushing toward 3 and the company would have to take on significantly more leverage to come up with the cash Pedersen would presumably want in a sale.

Parsons: An outsider gaining scale

Parsons (PSN 1.44%) the other company mentioned in the Reuters report is a relative newcomer to defense IT. The company's roots are mostly in construction including massive projects for the Pentagon and other government customers but has used M&A to build its tech capabilities over the past decade.

A deal for Mantech would fully establish Parsons in the defense IT world and give it a seat at the table for a wide range of contracting opportunities. But Parsons is similarly sized to Mantech and seems likely to be disadvantaged in a bidding war. Because of its smaller size Parsons would probably have to lean heavily on stock to get a deal done which might not be of interest to Mantech's key shareholder.

General Dynamics: The deepest pockets in a bidding war

General Dynamics (GD 1.12%) is the only defense IT company that comes close to matching Leidos' heft and it's one of the few top-tier defense contractors that still is heavily invested in the IT business. GD gained significant scale with its $9.6 billion acquisition of CSRA back in 2018 and given its $60 billion market capitalization it would have no problem paying for another large acquisition.

After a few years spent investing in future products including a refreshed Gulfstream jet lineup GD expects to generate more than $3.5 billion in free cash flow in 2022 alone.

However investors haven't always been on board with the company's efforts to grow the IT part of its business. General Dynamics seems almost certain to at least give Mantech a look if its primary defense IT rival Leidos is involved in the bidding but it could decide to put its cash to work on buybacks or investment in other areas instead of involving itself in a heated auction.

CACI: Fortune favors the bold

CACI International (CACI 2.12%) has been one of the more aggressive consolidators in the sector in recent years making an audacious -- and ultimately unsuccessful -- bid to break up General Dynamics' CSRA deal and then finding numerous smaller targets as consolation prizes. A deal for Mantech wouldn't be nearly as hard to pull off as the attempted CSRA buy and CACI arguably needs the acquisition more than Leidos or GD if it wants to join the top echelon of IT contractors.

CACI is about double the size of Mantech but like Leidos its net debt is already more than 3 times EBITDA because of its other acquisitions. It's hard to imagine that CACI management wouldn't at least look hard at Mantech but it could be tough to get a deal done assuming Mantech is looking for cash.

Will private equity come calling?

It's been a tough few years for defense stocks as investors initially shied away ahead of the U.S. presidential election and then ran for the exit in 2021 after a combination of pandemic-related complications and a focus on Afghanistan led to a slowdown in Pentagon contract awards.

Mantech on its own is unlikely to generate much growth before the second half of 2022 at the earliest which could make it tough for any buyer to quickly impress with revenue synergies. But there are probably cost cuts to be had: General and administrative costs totaled 8.7% of revenue through the first nine months of 2021.

Private equity has been active in defense IT and Mantech with its depressed near-term growth outlook and room for cost cuts would seemingly fit what PE tends to look for in a deal. With so many other potential bidders digesting other deals or otherwise distracted there is a strong chance that a PE firm could be drawn to Mantech with the idea of flipping it to a larger buyer a few years down the line.

Mantech for its part is set to release earnings in late February. The company for now isn't talking but if the reports are correct and its founder is exploring options there are a wide range of potential suitors for the defense IT specialist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsYXJrZnVuZXJhbGhvbWVzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyeS9yb2JlcnQtYm9iLWZvc3RlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Robert 'Bob' Foster of Neosho Missouri,"~Obituary lovingly written by the family of Robert 'Bob' Foster~

A growing manufacturer in the defense solutions space Great Lakes Sound & Vibration (GLSV) of Houghton County in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula (U.P.) is finding success as a small-town business with a worldwide impact. GLSV has utilized various programs and service providers from Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) for several years finding assistance at key points in the company's growth. These resources have helped the multi-functional engineering company to find new markets expand in the U.P. and better its business.

When GLSV required an upgraded facility additional equipment and new hires to support the latest contracts the company was evaluating competing sites in northern Wisconsin. In 2019 with the help of MEDC its Micro Michigan Business Development Program (MBDP) provided the needed incentive assistance to keep GLSV growing in Michigan. MBDP is an incentive program aimed at providing grants loans and other economic assistance to businesses for highly competitive projects in Michigan that create jobs and/or provide investment and results in a net-positive return to the state.

“The management and employees of Great Lakes Sound & Vibration are delighted to be expanding in the Copper Country” said GLSV President Steve Mattson. “We are appreciative of the commitment and partnership of our defense customers and the warfighters they serve which has provided the opportunity for this expansion. We are also grateful that the great state of Michigan the MEDC Keweenaw Economic Development Alliance and Franklin Township believe strongly enough in our company to make an investment that simplified our decision to continue to provide complete customer-specific design and build solutions for noise vibration and shock problems from our preferred home in the Keweenaw.”

Assistance from the Northwest Michigan Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) has helped GLSV land new U.S. government contracts and grants. The Northwest Michigan PTAC has been a large supporter of GLSV since 2011. To execute on new contracts with military customers the company purchased and rehabbed the former Goodwill Training Center in Franklin Township; the completion of an entire remodel of the facility is expected at the end of February 2022. Based on growth and job creation GLSV is on track to claim an MBDP performance-based grant for job creation in May 2022.

With the support of MEDC’s programs and strategic processes GLSV achieved its goal to make $10 million in revenue in 2020 five years ahead of schedule. The company is targeting $15.5 million in 2022 with the aim to be employee-owned by 2025. As the company expands with new military contracts and defense customers Great Lakes Sound & Vibration is sure to make the Great Lakes State proud.

GLSV also has a growing international presence thanks to its engagement with MEDC’s International Trade Program since 2014. After landing its first international contract in Canada with the help of MEDC service provider Foster Swift Collins & Smith PC the company has increased its overall revenue and revenue from international markets. With only a few years of exporting experience the company's percentage of total sales from international sales is nearly 13 percent. The contract with Canada gave GLSV the confidence and know-how to seek out connections and contracts with other allied nations including Norway Japan Sweden and Iceland.

To continue building on the international success they saw in Canada and create a strategic plan for expanding into global markets GLSV participated in the MEDC- and U.S. Commercial Service-hosted program ExporTech September-November 2019 in Marquette Michigan. The intensive 10-week export planning course program helped the company craft a strategic export plan provided market research on their highest potential markets and offered resources and connections to services that can support them along the way including other MEDC International Trade services and MEDC partner programs. GLSV has plans to participate in future international trade shows building on best practices and relationships built with help from MEDC.

When GLSV was looking for market research as well as learning tactics to do their own market research going forward they sought out help from MEDC’s Second-Stage Growth Solutions (SSGS) program. SSGS provides second-stage companies with the technical research assistance and business expertise they need to continue to grow profitably and be prepared for the future. In addition to the company’s engagement with the first step of the process Mattson attended the Next Steps Retreat where he was able to develop action items and network with other company leaders.

“The [SSGS] team was phenomenal in being fluid and flexible for our wants and needs during the engagement” said Mattson. “This helped our company get the maximum benefit from the program. We received numerous items and data packages throughout the engagement that showcased tools techniques and methodologies for our business to use internally as we look to grow our business strategically.”

The company has also utilized the MI-STEP program to offset the cost of export-related activities as well as the Michigan Canada Center which is one of MEDC’s international trade centers. GLSV’s participation in Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) events in 2018 led the company to meeting buyers such as General Dynamics and RCO Aerospace Products connecting with the latter at the AIAM Upper Peninsula Aerospace Expo.

In 2022 GLSV was selected by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land and Maritime to supply exhaust mufflers for the U.S. Marine Corps Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV). The AAV is a fully tracked amphibious landing vehicle and is the current amphibious troop transport vehicle of the United States Marine Corps. It is used to land ground forces and their equipment in a single trip from offshore and to conduct mechanized operations and related combat support once ashore. GLSV is a proud supplier to DLA and will continue to support their land vehicle and maritime efforts.

The PMBC Access and Certification Grant has allowed GLSV to acquire assistance to enhance its quality management system and open doors of opportunity into new supply opportunities related to ground vehicles marine amphibious and aerospace. GLSV has been awarded the PMBC Access and Certification Grant in January 2021 and March 2022.

GLSV began undergoing auditing to the new AS 9100 standards in June 2022; its contract awards with DLA in this segment generate significant revenue and establish credibility in the commercial markets. GLSV used funds from the PMBC grant for both certification and access to identify the important supply opportunities with DLA.

Due to the certifications received through the PMBC Access and certification grant GLSV was able to increase sales by $2 million through the first quarter of FY23.

Utilizing the MEDC’s suite of services from International Trade and Michigan Business Development Program to Second-Stage Growth Solutions and Pure Michigan Business Connect has given GLSV the tools for success.

Milley told lawmakers during closed-door briefings on Feb. 2 and 3 that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in the fall of Kyiv within 72-hours and could come at a cost of 15000 Ukrainian troop deaths and 4000 Russian troop deaths.

Several lawmakers expressed concern that the Biden administration did not respond quickly to provide Ukraine with significant military aid such as anti-aircraft and rocket launcher systems that would defend against an invasion from Russia.

Biden administration officials at the meetings responded to these concerns by saying that a significant supply of military aid to Ukraine could be used as a reason to invade Ukraine.

While Ukraine is receiving security assistance from the United States through a $200 million allocation made in December it is also receiving $600 million in assistance from the United Kingdom and Baltic states which the country is depending heavily upon and includes anti-tank Javelin missiles and older-version Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles.

Soelect raised $11 million from GM Ventures KTB Network and Lotte Ventures an affiliate of Korea’s Lotte Chemical.

The startup based in North Carolina was founded in 2018 by Jin Cho who has worked in the battery industry for 25 years previously with LG Samsung and Johnson Controls. As Reuters writes citing Cho Soelect already has more than 20 customers mainly from the automotive industry.

Soelect considers lithium metal anodes as a key component in future battery systems. For its ‘LiX’ anode the company claims fast-charging capabilities at up to 4C and up to 100% in 15 minutes. By comparison QuantumScape announced this week that it could charge its solid-state cells to 80 per cent in 15 minutes. However QuantumScape’s tests also showed that the battery lasts 400 cycles in the process. Soelect does not detail the cycle stability on its home page.

Instead Soelect says its anode can be reused “without destroying the processes which are required for most recycling process.” The company does not provide further information on the anode’s composition or properties of battery cells with this technology. However the company is also looking into polymer-based Solid Electrolyte Membranes (SEM).

Regarding (semi) solid-state battery solutions Reuters quotes Spokesman Darryll Harrison of GM Ventures. He said GM’s investment in Soelect “complements” the automaker’s partnership with SES and “further expands our efforts to accelerate the advancement of battery chemistries.” More precisely Harrison said Soelect’s lithium-metal technology “could serve as an enabler for both future lithium-metal and solid-state EV battery anode designs.”

KTB Network and Lotte Ventures participated in the financing round alongside GM Ventures. None of the companies disclosed their share in the investment but Lotte Ventures was the lead investor. Lotte Ventures is part of the South Korean group Lotte Chemical. “Lotte Chemical’s expertise in chemical/materials manufacturing GM’s expertise in electric vehicle and battery development and KTB’s venture capital experience will be combined to drive the development and commercialization of our technology and also help us attract top talent” Cho said when commenting on the news.

Companies have been experimenting with automated driving systems since the 1920s when Houdina Radio Control operated a 1926 Chandler using radio impulses on the streets of New York. RCA Labs and the Ohio State University also ran promising trials in the 1950s and 1960s.Mainstream automakers didn't get involved on a larger scale until the 1990s but that didn't stop them from creating futuristic concepts for a world where humans would no longer drive their vehicles.General Motors did so in 1964 when it unveiled the Firebird IV at its Futurama Exhibit at the New York World's Fair.Completely unrelated to the Firebird that Pontiac would release in 1967 the IV was part of a series of experimental vehicles that GM started rolling out in 1953. It all began with Firebird I (XP-21) a gas turbine-powered jet plane on wheels and continued with the II a sport four-seat car with titanium bodywork. The latter debuted in 1956.A wild-looking Firebird III arrived in 1959 with seven wings and fins air drag brakes and a joystick instead of a steering wheel.Five years later and the Firebird IV was created for a future in which cars steered automatically via ""programmed guidance systems to ensure absolute safety at more than twice the speed possible on expressways of the day.""Was it a true-blue autonomous vehicle? Not really because it was just a rolling concept. Even though GM claimed it to be a turbine-powered vehicle like the Firebirds before it  the IV never actually ran and drove. What's more GM's idea was a bit different than today's autonomous concept as the Firebird IV required a system of ""electric highways.""There was no plan to put it into production and GM wasn't exactly interested in developing self-driving cars at the time. It was just an exotic topic that fit the Futurama bill.But the Firebird IV was as spectacular as futuristic concepts get. The car was incredibly sleek and even though it lacked the III's massive amount of wings and fins it was still heavily inspired by the jet age . The beltline became increasingly wider toward the rear to the point it formed a wing-like element that extended a few good inches beyond the rear fascia.Likewise the front wheels were partly covered by slanted wings that extended from the lower front fascia all the way to the doors.The extremely sharp nose and the turbine-like elements that flanked the rear fascia also contributed to the IV's spectacular appearance. So did the cockpit-style roof with wrap-around glass and a deeply sculpted center section.The roof slid forward and upward to unlatch the doors which then glided forward to provide easy access inside the cabin. Both the roof and the doors were activated at the touch of a button.The interior itself was a mix of aviation and luxury features. While the seats were obviously inspired by jet fighters of the era they reclined and swiveled for increased comfort and easy ingress and egress.On top of that the Firebird IV was pretty much a living room on wheels thanks to a pull-out refrigerator a folding table and even a TV set.The idea doesn't seem all that wild now when we're very close to being able to work sleep or watch Netflix while sitting in a fully autonomous car but it was spectacular back in 1964. Especially when refrigerators and TV sets were still too big to fit in production cars.The car's dashboard also included a special slot for punched cards with predetermined routes programmed by info provided by electric highway centers. An early navigation system if you will.And in case you don't know what punched cards are they're basically pieces of stiff paper that hold digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions.Pioneered in the late 1800s punched cards have been obsolete as a storage medium for a few decades now but they were still being used in 1964.So what happened to the concept after its debut that year? Well GM repackaged the idea for the 1969 show circuit as the Buick Century Cruiser.The latter was almost entirely identical but featured a different color a steering wheel and a few other upgrades inside the cabin. Sadly like most Futurama show cars the Firebird IV was crushed in the 1980s.But even though it ended up a big pile of scrapped metal the Firebird eventually gave its name to the iconic Pontiac Firebird  which remained in production for a whopping 35 years.Likewise Buick's take on the concept signaled the return of the Century nameplate in 1973. And it stands as proof that GM had quite a few innovative ideas back in the day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL0F1dG9tb2JpbGVzL0dNLXMtbmV3LU1leGljYW4tdW5pb24tYS13aW4tZm9yLVUuUy4tYS1zaG9ja2VyLWZvci1Bc2lhbi1jYXJtYWtlcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM's new Mexican union a win for U.S. a shocker for Asian carmakers,"MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK -- Workers at a General Motors factory in central Mexico have voted to tap an independent labor union to represent them replacing a long-serving union seen as too cozy with management.

This article was first published by Labor Notes.

Auto workers at a General Motors plant in central Mexico delivered a landslide victory to an independent union in a vote held February 1-2. It’s a major breakthrough for workers and labor activists seeking to break the vice grip of the employer-friendly unions that have long dominated Mexico’s labor movement.

Turnout among the plant’s 6300 eligible voters was 88 percent. The independent union SINTTIA (the National Auto Workers Union) picked up 4192 votes — 78 percent of the vote. SINTTIA which grew out of the successful campaign which ousted the previous corrupt union last year promised to raise wages and fight for workers on the shop floor.

Workers at the Silao plant voted last August to invalidate the contract held by a well-connected national auto workers union headed by Congressman Tereso Medina of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). That union was affiliated to the Congress of Mexican Labor (CTM) the country’s largest union federation.

CTM affiliates tied to the long-ruling PRI have long been criticized for signing employer-friendly “protection contracts” which lock in low wages and prevent workers from organizing genuine unions.

In this week’s vote a paltry 247 votes went to another CTM affiliate that appeared on the ballot with 932 (17 percent) to a third union known as “the Coalition” widely perceived by workers to be a CTM front. (A fourth competitor got just 18 votes.)

“Today I believe we as workers are more united than ever” said Alejandra Morales SINTTIA’s principal officer who has worked at the plant for 11 years in the paint department. “Not only in Silao but in all of Mexico.”

The weekend before the vote Morales reported receiving threats outside her home from three people in a pickup with the license plates removed part of what she called a “campaign of intimidation and defamation” by “the mafia of anti-democratic and charro unions.” SINTTIA’s secretary of organization reported getting death threats on Facebook and WhatsApp.

Shot in the Arm

SINTTIA’s victory is a shot in the arm for the independent union movement in Mexico; the vote was closely followed domestically and internationally.

Under Mexico’s labor law reform which went into effect in 2019 all existing union contracts must be voted on by May 1 2023 a measure aimed at allowing workers to democratically choose their unions — a freedom long denied Mexican workers. Most union contracts in Mexico have been signed behind the backs of workers by employers like GM and corrupt Mexican union officials — often before any workers are even hired.

Thus far votes to delegitimate contracts and open the door toward choosing a new union have been few and far between. As of mid-January majorities in only 24 workplaces — less than 1 percent of those where legitimation votes have been held — have opted to throw out the existing union. The GM Silao plant is by far the biggest to do this. It’s also the first where workers have voted to join a new union.

“What we hope is that [workers at] new companies see that they can beat the CTM” said Juan Armando Fajardo Rivera the union’s press secretary who has worked at the plant for 13 years. “The CTM isn’t invincible. If you want a union you can achieve it with the new reform.”

International Support

Support for the effort to vote in a genuine union at GM Silao poured in from unions and labor activists across the globe. The UAW and AFL-CIO issued statements pushing the Mexican government to ensure the vote was fair and free from intimidation. Unionists from Brazil Canada and the U.S. joined an international delegation to the vote; among the Brazilian delegation were eight members of local unions at GM.

The second-place finisher the CTM-linked Coalition attacked the international solidarity shown by unions and workers around the globe as “foreign interference” and made the fear of job loss a centerpiece of their campaign. “Both the Canadians and the Americans want to take our production to their countries” said a leader of the Coalition in an interview with El Financiero.

SINTTIA for its part embraced the support. “The union struggle encompasses the whole world” said Fajardo Rivera. “It’s not just in Mexico.”

“It’s important to recognize the commitment of workers from other countries” said Morales “because it’s important that the whole working class not just from here but globally be in constant communication for the betterment of everyone.”

What’s Next

Once the results are certified by Mexican labor authorities SINTTIA will enter negotiations with GM. Earlier this week the automaker reported it had pulled in a record $10 billion in profits last year.

Workers at the Silao plant make the lucrative Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups but earn less than $25 for a 12-hour shift. Foremost on their minds is a wage increase. “What workers would like most is to have a decent salary that is enough for their day-to-day [needs]” said Morales.

Among the other demands that SINTTIA highlighted in its election campaign were bathroom breaks improved benefits food and transportation paid for by the company and better ability to take vacation time.

The independent unions that exist at three of Mexico’s two dozen auto assembly plants — at Nissan Audi and Volkswagen — have won higher wages and benefits than those where contracts are controlled by protection unions linked to the CTM. Those unions who formed the federation FESIIAAAN (the Federation of Independent Unions of the Automobile Auto Parts Aerospace and Tire Industries) in 2018 were vocal in their support for SINTTIA.

“We know that those unions have been working for years to obtain what they are earning today [and] their benefits” said Morales. “We lost a lot over the years so we are going to have to advance bit by bit.”

Under Mexico’s reformed labor law the union has six months to negotiate a contract and get it approved by a majority of the plant’s workers.

General Motors has been cutting their car lineup as the past few years have seen the deaths of the Buick Regal and LaCrosse the Cadillac CT6 and XTS and an assortment of Chevys including the Cruze Impala Sonic and Volt.

The Chevrolet Spark will join them in the automotive afterlife this summer and it appears the Malibu may be living on borrowed time as well.

While that remains to be seen the company has stopped accepting orders for the 2022 Malibu. When asked about the move Chevrolet spokesperson Kevin Kelly told CarsDirect that the company is no longer taking orders for the Malibu “because we have received enough orders to fulfill the ‘22 model year.”

Some people may take that as an ominous sign considering it’s only February but Malibu sales have been in freefall so it’s not surprising the company doesn’t want to build too many of them. Jumping into the numbers Malibu sales have declined every year since 2016 when the company sold 227881 units in the United States. While the decline has been somewhat gradual they plummeted to a mere 39376 units in 2021.

To put that into perspective Chevrolet axed the Cruze after sales fell to 184751 units. That’s nearly five times more than what the Malibu achieved last year.

Needless to say the Malibu is officially on deathwatch. However you might want to grab some popcorn as Automotive News’ Future Product Pipeline suggests the sedan won’t be killed until 2025. That being said we might get an electric performance sedan to effectively replace both the Camaro and Malibu."

Arcellx has some catching up to do but its technology could offer some key advantages compared to the first-generation CAR T-therapies of its larger rivals. The biotech has encouraging early clinical data for its multiple myeloma CAR T and it now has $123.8 million in IPO cash to advance that therapeutic candidate to a pivotal clinical trial.

Gaithersburg Maryland-based Arcellx priced its offering of 8.25 million shares at $15 apiece which was the low end of its planned $15 to $17 per share price range. Those shares began trading on the Nasdaq Friday under the stock symbol “ACLX.” Arcellx’s stock price opened at $19 before settling down to $16.80 at the market close.

The “CAR” part of CAR T stands for chimeric antigen receptor—the receptor that recognizes and binds to an antigen on a cancer cell. CAR T-cell therapies are made by harvesting a patient’s T cells and genetically engineering them to express antigen-specific CARs on the cell surface. The first CAR T therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences won FDA approvals for certain types of blood cancer that had not responded to earlier therapies. BMS’s CAR T-therapy Abecma was approved for multiple myeloma last year.

While CAR T offers a way to address blood cancer cases that have failed earlier lines of treatment some patients do not respond to these therapies or they relapse later. CAR T also introduces the risk of dangerous side effects. Arcellx aims to overcome those challenges with technology that enables it to produce synthetic binding scaffolds that are “deimmunized” which is the company’s way of saying that they are engineered to avoid causing an immune response.

The synthetic binding scaffolds which Arcellx calls D-Domains are smaller than the binding domains in currently available CAR T therapies. In its IPO filing Arcellx said that the smaller size allows it to reduce the size of the lentivirus construct used to deliver its genetic cargo. Consequently these therapies may have better transduction which is the transfer of the genetic material into a T cell. In preclinical research Arcellx said D-Domain led to higher transduction efficiency a higher expression of its binders on the surface of T cells and lower signaling that can lead to off-target activation of the T cells.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Arcellx’s lead program CART-ddBCMA is a CAR T-therapy designed to target BCMA a protein found in abundance on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. The company noted in the IPO filing that it has achieved transduction efficiency higher than published Phase 1 data for BMS’s Abecma and Johnson & Johnson’s experimental CAR T therapy ciltacabtagene autoleucel both of which target also BCMA. Arcellx’s comparison comes with the caveat that it is looking across trials with different designs and methodologies rather than head-to-head studies. Nevertheless more efficient transduction is one sign that the Arcellx drug could be competitive to BMS’s Abecma and J&J’s CAR T which is expected to receive an FDA decision by the end of this month.

At the 2021 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December Arcellx presented data for the first 24 multiple myeloma patients dosed with CART-ddBCMA in a Phase 1 expansion study. Of those patients 22 could be evaluated for safety 17 of whom had disease that was unresponsive to five earlier lines of treatment. As of the Nov. 4 2021 cutoff date 19 patients could be evaluated for efficacy. Arcellx reported an overall response rate of 100% in all 19 and a complete response or a stringent complete response in 68% (13 of 19) patients. The median follow-up period for these patients was 283 days.

CAR T therapy’s side effect risks include cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Arcellx reported that these problems were manageable and resolved with standard treatment measures at the two dose levels tested. No off-target effects were observed. Arcellx now plans to advance CART-ddBCMA to a pivotal 100-patient Phase 2 clinical trial by the end of 2022. In the IPO filing the company said that based on its discussions with the FDA successful data from this study combined with the Phase 1 results should be enough to support a biological license application submission. The company also hopes expansion studies from the Phase 2 test will support use of CART-ddBCMA as an earlier line of treatment. For context Abecma’s approval covers its use treating multiple myeloma unresponsive to at least three earlier lines of treatment.

The synthetic binding domains Arcellx produces are key components of a second platform technology that the company calls ARC-SparX. This technology produces CAR T-cell therapies engineered to target multiple antigens in order to adapt as a patient’s cancer changes. Also the dose of these therapies can be controlled in order to minimize toxic effects. The most advanced drug from this platform ACLX-001 is on track to enter Phase 1 testing as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; ACLX-002 is being developed for acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

The potential competitive advantages of Arcellx’s approach could go beyond blood cancers. CAR T-therapies have not been able to hit solid tumors. Arcellx contends its technology produces binders that do. The tech can also be applied to off-the-shelf cell therapies. These applications are not limited to T cells. Natural killer cells are among the other cell types listed by the company for potential use of D-Domain. Longer term the company is looking outside of cancer.

“Ultimately we hope to develop multiple therapeutic options incorporating different mechanisms cell modalities and targets to treat hematologic cancers solid tumors and indications outside of oncology such as autoimmune diseases” Arcellx said in its filing.

Arcellx was founded in 2014. Prior to the IPO Arcellx had raised $234.8 million in financing most recently a $115 million Series C round of funding that closed last April. New Enterprise Associates is the biotech’s largest shareholder owning a nearly 14.5% post-IPO stake according to the filing. SR One owns 11.4%; Novo Holdings owns 9.5%.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2021 Arcellx reported its cash position was $131.2 million. That money combined with the IPO proceeds will be deployed across the biotech’s pipeline. Between $75 million and $85 million is budgeted for the Phase 2 test of CART-ddBCMA. Another $10 million to $20 million is earmarked for drug candidates from the company’s ARC-SparX platform.

However behind the fanfare of owning digital items is a much bigger and more important picture. NFTs are on the verge of completely revolutionizing trade finance and global commerce. There is the potential to tokenize a wide range of assets and connect real-world finance origination to the decentralized finance (DeFi) markets. Trade finance instruments such as fixed income products and investment notes can securely move along the blockchain in a manner that brings transparency facilitates seamless settlement and extends liquidity. At the same time smart contracts eliminate intermediaries reduce counterparty risk and preserve the integrity of deliverables.

We’re talking about a new class of financial assets as well as a significant overhaul to almost every payment system financial service and supply chain in the world. And it may be coming sooner than most think.

How NFTs Can Play Into Trade Finance

NFTs are more than just jpegs on a blockchain — they represent digital ownership. They are built upon smart contracts and blockchain technology the same decentralized networks that power many popular cryptocurrencies. Blockchain platforms are by definition trustless highly secure and offer completely verifiable data and immutable ledger history. Smart contracts meanwhile are self-executing predetermined agreements that reside on the blockchain and define how the assets on the blockchain work.

Leveraging this NFTs can take any type of information be it an image a 3D model a document anything really and give it a form of uniqueness and tangibility by making it cryptographically unique from any other batch of data — even if otherwise identical.

This means that NFTs represent a fundamentally more useful form of digital information. The data encoded into an NFT cannot be altered counterfeited or in any way accessed by anyone not in possession of the appropriate cryptographic keys. Even if an attacker should manage to steal an NFT the history and destination would still be completely visible to everyone.

You can also tokenize contract agreements themselves with Liability NFTs and Asset NFTs which are created to show ownership of a given contract for the promisor the party who makes a promise and the promisee the party receives the benefits of a contract.

For businesses and trade finance this opens up a whole new world of possibilities for handling sensitive data. More importantly it provides a mechanism for creating compelling new products IDs payment rails supply chain dynamics and much more. Take for example using NFTs to create a blockchain “receipt” that can track a product all the way from raw material acquisition to landing on a retail shelf. Every step of the process every hand on the goods every purchase or sale along the way would all be recorded immutably — better still with a minimum of human intervention.

Trade Finance also faces complex regulatory and supply chain procedures involving multiple moving parts and requires a great deal of trust. It is also a sector that remains highly susceptible to document fraud. NFTs can remove those barriers eliminate fraud and reduce reliance on middlemen by tokenizing assets and documents into a single immutable digital token.

This not only stands to minimise the rate of illicit activity in trade finance but it also means that companies stand to save money on overhead wages and human error.

NFTs Can Do Even More

Redefining and streamlining how businesses operate is a significant first step but there is a lot more that NFTs and smart contract platforms can offer to the trade finance industry.

NFTs for example could allow startups to create digital representations of commodities and explore new models of raising capital through a frictionless system. Furthermore the structure and transparency of blockchains make it relatively easy for any entity to stay inside a regulatory framework once those frameworks are fully locked down. In fact everything from debt management processes to the provenance of goods can be streamlined and verified using NFTs.

The best part is it’s already possible — and happening. Blockchains like the XDC Network are currently being tested for use as trade finance systems. In September leveraging the XDC network Tradeteq — a trade finance distribution firm — executed one of the world's first complete end-to-end on chain tokenized invoice finance transactions.

The Beginning of a New Paradigm

While the basic technology and underlying principles already exist there’s still a lot of work to be done to set up more complex rails for moving these assets and build new protocols to ensure their continued veracity at every step in the system.

Integration into existing financial firms regulatory structures and an overall greater education across multiple industries are similarly crucial if this shift is to become global. Many local governments and national politicians are also researching the potential so there is already some momentum.

Anything less and the rollouts of these new products could be clumsier than they need to be. In any event the possibilities they offer will more than likely be much more broadly understood at some point in the future and a true renaissance in trade finance could occur. The only thing holding this back is for more players to recognise what is happening and seize the opportunity while it is still early.

Leatherback founder and CEO Ibrahim Toyeeb says the introduction of Leatherback to the global market is underpinned by a desire to democratise banking and provide opportunities for borderless global trade and commerce.

“It’s no secret that emerging markets are the principal drivers of global growth. Given this reality – and the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed numerous restrictions on travel and commerce – Leatherback was formed to simplify global trade for people and operations everywhere allowing them to seamlessly move money from one continent to the next.”

In this respect Leatherback provides a much-needed solution for exporters and importers immigrant-owned businesses international students the migrant population in general tourists and multi-nationals with foreign operations that require financial solutions payments or foreign exchange.

Leatherback is inspired by the leatherback sea turtle a nomadic creature that roams the seas from the northern regions of the arctic to as far south as the pacific without self-imposed restrictions to hinder its movements.

Like its namesake the fintech operation is built on the same principles. It offers multi-currency accounts with the option to exchange currency instantly across multiple countries including the United Kingdom Canada India Nigeria Egypt Uganda Tanzania Angola South Africa the UAE Denmark Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The organisation enables clients to create local and foreign accounts to give them the option to remit funds across 40 countries while businesses can invoice and collect directly in over 13 currencies.

Notably Leatherback is fully regulated by the FCA in the UK Fintrac in Canada the Central Bank of Nigeria and other regulatory authorities in the 13 countries it is licenced in. “Ensuring our users operate in a secure space is non-negotiable. The multi-layered cybersecurity measures we have deployed are aimed at safeguarding their money and providing them with peace of mind” adds Toyeeb.

At the core of Leatherback is the ability to break down payment barriers promote business expansion remove barriers to business growth and build a global digital payments infrastructure that harnesses the rise of digitisation.

While it may seem implausible that users can set up accounts make currency conversions and global payments within minutes Leatherback has done just that.

A zero-balance start-up fee and highly competitive rates provide further compelling reasons to join the Leatherback fold.

While Leatherback allows for ease of making and receiving payments around the world it also integrates invoicing and payroll services tax management services and revenue management.

Leatherback is a game-changer in the industry. By using Leatherback’s networks account holders can spend abroad in the local currencies from the comfort of their offices or homes at competitive exchange rates.

Through its collections application programming interface (API) clients can accept money globally – in-store or online – from more customers in their preferred countries and in small or large volumes. In addition trade finance unlocks working capital for short- and long-term business goals business continuity and disaster recovery.

With its deep understanding of local markets and global finance Leatherback’s main objective is to remove borders from transacting so that people and businesses are encouraged to be ambitious and provide their services freely making and collecting payments with ease around the world. “We believe in side-stepping convention to continuously find better ways to make things happen” concludes Toyeeb.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvY3J5cHRvLWV4Y2hhbmdlcy10by1icmllZi1wb2xpY3ltYWtlcnMtb24tdGRzLXRhbmdsZXMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkzNzI0MDYuY21z0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9jcnlwdG8tZXhjaGFuZ2VzLXRvLWJyaWVmLXBvbGljeW1ha2Vycy1vbi10ZHMtdGFuZ2xlcy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkzNzI0MDYuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crypto exchanges to brief policymakers on TDS tangles,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIT Delhi Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit Indian School of Business Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit

The industry body representing cryptocurrency exchanges has decided to reach out to relevant policymakers to brief them about complications arising out of the government’s move to levy a 1% TDS (tax deduction at source) on all crypto transactions.The issue was discussed at the meeting of the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) on Saturday where the overwhelming view was that this move would dent crypto trading volumes and drive small traders towards informal Person to Person (P2P) trading and decentralised exchanges (DEX). Crypto exchanges derive a large chunk of their revenues from traders who frequently trade and pay a small sum on every trade.According to the provisions of this year’s finance bill the buyer of a cryptocurrency has to deduct 1% of the sale consideration and pay the amount as an advance tax to the government on behalf of the seller on every trade.The withholding will apply where sale consideration is more than or equal to Rs 50000 (for specific individual payers) and Rs 10000 for others.TDS must be deducted on both crypto-to-rupee and crypto-to-crypto swaps.But people opposed to these provisions say the provisions are impractical and will lead to complications in compliance thereby discouraging trading on formal exchanges.For instance to pay advance tax the buyer needs to have details of the seller such as name PAN number etc. As this information lies with the exchanges not with the buyer the buyer won't be able to remit money to the government.Moreover day traders make multiple trades per day often with small margins. Therefore the volume of the TDS payouts could be substantial and also considerable time would need to be devoted to this exercise.“Specific sections regarding TDS are still confusing. We believe multiple discussions are needed to come up with better systems or processes. We are very hopeful that the right actions will be taken” said Sumit Gupta CEO & cofounder CoinDCX one of India’s largest crypto exchanges. “We are happy that the industry has got clarity and confidence. However I would also like to point out that it's two steps forward and one step back.”Tax experts say that the government hasn’t thought through the tax proposals and hasn't consulted enough with the crypto stakeholders.“The government has come up with tax regulations but has not clarified how to implement them. The way TDS regulations stand currently it could severely dent crypto trading in India” said Anoush Bhasin founder of New Delhi based cryptocurrency tax advisory Quagmire Consulting.The crypto community believes that policymakers should interact more with all the stakeholders—exchanges market participants and tax experts—to understand the pain points of the industry.“There were a lot of positives for the crypto industry in the budget. We believe the government has taken a step towards recognising digital assets. But the government should also look into the operations side of the exchanges to understand the impact” said Atulya Bhat CMO BuyUcoin.BACC plans to hold several knowledge sessions for policymakers to apprise them about the workings of the exchanges and how the taxes will impact their revenue models.In their meeting the BACC members discussed all details of the new crypto tax regime.The crypto investor community has also been up in arms against the 30% tax on crypto currencies announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget.“The thumb rule in taxation has always been to tax citizens as per their income. The rich end up paying more taxes than the poor. In this case both are being treated in the same way. Imagine the rich who are already in the 30% income bracket won't have much of a problem but consider the small investor who has invested less than Rs 50000. Also there were many people who were earning their income as freelancers now they will be taxed at a flat 30%” said Kashif Raza founder Bitinning a crypto education platform.During the last three days the hashtags #reducecryptotax and #faircryptotax have been trending on Twitter. By Saturday evening more than 63000 people had signed the petition started by popular crypto influencer Aditya Singh and amplified by popular social media influencers like Sandeep Bahuguna Pushpendra Singh and Kashif Raza.",,,

This time though would be the last time he’d do that and he came armed with a joke.

“I’ll probably have to buy a ticket the next time we have a dual meet here” Marinelli said and chuckled.

Michael Kemerer sitting next to him started laughing.

“I don’t know if Alex Marinelli is going to have to buy a ticket to our next match” he added.

Saturday was Senior Day for the Iowa wrestling program. After the second-ranked Hawkeyes blitzed 16th-ranked Wisconsin 29-6 nine team members were honored — eight wrestlers plus team manager Jenna Novak. Each one has played a unique role in one of the most successful chapters of the Iowa wrestling program’s storied history.

There’s Kaleb Young the first Pennsylvania recruit to commit who became a two-time All-American. On Saturday he put forth one of his best performances of the season scoring three takedowns in an 8-3 win over Garrett Model at 157 pounds.

There's Marinelli who followed with an 8-5 win over sixth-ranked Dean Hamiti at 165 after the intermission. Marinelli came from Ohio ditching the hometown Buckeyes for Iowa’s black-and-gold. He is a two-time All-American and three-time Big Ten champion. His win over Hamiti was his 25th career win at Carver in 26 career home matches.

“I’ll remember the fans” Marinelli said. “I’ll always remember the fans cheering me on cheering my name backing me up giving high-fives to kids. That’s what we do it for. We come out here and wrestle in front of those guys and it’s so awesome.

“Seeing my coaches in the corner. It’s iconic. It’s Iowa wrestling at Carver. Growing up I had a picture of Carver above my bed.”

Then came Kemerer who used a third-period cradle for an 11-2 major decision over Andrew McNally at 174. Kemerer is a three-time All-American and returning Big Ten champ. His commitment which required an overnight 700-mile drive by Iowa coach Tom Brands is considered one of the most pivotal moments in program history.

“Marinelli and me both when we were young it was always Iowa wrestling” Kemerer said after finalizing his 26-2 career record at Carver. “Our goal was to go out there and wrestle in that arena — and not just wrestle but win tough matches out there.

“We’ve gotten the privilege to do that.”

Young Marinelli and Kemerer sparked what became six consecutive victories against the Badgers on Saturday and they received the loudest applause during the post-dual Senior Day ceremonies. The Hawkeyes won eight of 10 matches and scored bonus points in four of them to improve to 12-1 overall and 6-2 against the Big Ten.

Austin DeSanto and Jaydin Eierman two more seniors provided early firepower to give the Hawkeyes a lead they would not relinquish. They both transferred in after starting their college careers elsewhere: DeSanto from Drexel Eierman from Missouri. DeSanto scored 13 takedowns in a technical fall. Eierman scored five in a major decision.

Both were crucial in Iowa’s championship pursuit combining to score 41 team points to help the Hawkeyes score 129 at last year’s NCAA Championships. DeSanto finished third at 133 pounds and Eierman reached the finals at 141. They helped Iowa win its first NCAA team championship since 2010 and the 24th in program history.

“When you’re dealing with young people there’s a lot of pitfalls in the world and you don’t always know what you’re getting even though you do your job as a recruiter” Brands said. “What you ended up with here is some really good people that are solid. They care about each other they care about the future they care about their team.”

Three others were honored as well: Vince Turk Myles Wilson and Aaron Costello. They didn’t have the same shining roles as the other five but they each produced moments throughout their wrestling careers and will forever be part of how Iowa built this championship team.

Turk was an on-again off-again starter throughout his career. He got the nod for the 2018 postseason and took fifth at the Big Ten Championships and went 3-2 at the national tournament. He left after the 2019-20 season to join the military which froze his eligibility clock then returned for one final season this winter.

He turned 25 years old on Friday and nearly created some Carver magic on Saturday against Wisconsin’s seventh-ranked Austin Gomez a one-time Iowa State wrestler. Gomez scored a takedown in the second period for a 3-0 lead. Turk nearly scored a takedown on the edge in the third but ran out of real estate and lost 3-2.

Wilson fought for starting time during his career. He showed the depth of Iowa’s room last spring when he made the U23 men’s freestyle world team. Costello was in the Iowa room at the same time as Sam Stoll an All-American talent who struggled with injuries and Tony Cassioppi another All-American and U23 men’s freestyle world champion.

Brands gave them all a moment on Saturday after the Hawkeyes thumped the Badgers who fell to 9-2 overall and 5-2 against the Big Ten. Since Turk and Kemerer first arrived on campus ahead of the 2015-16 season the Hawkeyes are 69-7 overall in duals and have won back-to-back Big Ten tournament titles and last year’s NCAA team title.

“The place is better because of them. That’s a really good feeling” Brands said. “They’ve got big futures in front of them every one of them.”

This is the weird part about a Senior Day. It is a chance to honor those who have given so much to the program yes but so much of the season still remains.

The Hawkeyes still have two duals left against No. 5 Oklahoma State next Saturday at Globe Life Field in Texas then against No. 7 Nebraska the following weekend in Lincoln. They’ll head to Lincoln again for the Big Ten Championships in March which will set the stage for the NCAA Championships in Detroit two weeks after that.

“We’re a very forward-looking group” Kemerer said “and we have a lot of wrestling left.”

Put another way: The rest of the schedule is full of opportunities to add more lines to one of the most successful chapters of the Iowa wrestling program’s storied history.

Because what’s better than two Big Ten tournament titles and one NCAA team title? How about three and two?

“There’s a lot of work to do” Brands said. “We’ve got to work harder in matches. We’ve got to work harder to finish. We’ve got to work harder to wrestle the full seven minutes. Every time out you’ve got to be more ready.

“We’re going to have to be ready to do this again at a higher level. A lot of these guys haven’t attained what they came here to attain so we’ve got a big project in front of us.”

Half-a-dozen protesters had gathered outside a nondescript green duplex on Augustus Avenue standing quietly in the 19-degree chill — until 7 a.m. when they shattered the frigid quiet with whistles recorders and drums.

The revolution has come to Roslindale. Most mornings since early January this tranquil street of single- and multifamily homes has played host to pre-sunrise protests against its most prominent resident Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. The acrimonious dispute over Wu’s vaccine requirement for city employees — now on hold amid a legal battle with first responders unions — has come to define her early tenure in City Hall. Lately it’s been disrupting her early-morning life at home too.

Wu’s neighbors say they love this quiet area for its community feel: the coffees with a friend across the street the backyard barbecues in summer. Now their block has taken center stage in one of the city’s ugliest political dramas — and the performances start before dawn.

7:05 a.m. — Shouting in unison: “SHAME ON WU! SHAME ON WU!”

How are Wu’s neighbors enjoying their new morning guests?

“Not at all” said Lou Janos as he took out his dog Rosie a skittish lab mix. It was just after 7 a.m. and the drums and whistles were beating in time deafening from where Janos stood on a stretch of grass near Wu’s home. The protests wake him his wife and their baby every morning Janos said; once upon a time the neighborhood was “extremely” quiet.

When they arrived that morning the protesters had been quiet too bearing Ugg boots American flags and a banner proclaiming that “Medical Freedom is the New Civil Rights Movement.” At 6:59 a.m. one woman retrieved the musical instruments from the trunk of her white SUV; a minute later it began.

Their timing reflects a strict attention to the local noise ordinance which requires quiet until 7 a.m. But neighbors — some of whom have become amateur detectives downloading sound-tracking apps on their cellphones — say the demonstrations often exceed the ordinance’s 70-decibel limit. After dozens of neighbors met with local police last month the protesters have been forbidden to use electronic amplification devices like speakers and bullhorns but no other enforcement action has been taken.

Even without those devices the protesters made their thunderous presence known. One woman banged a plastic trash can against a metal mail collection box; another in oversized oatmeal-colored mittens rat-tat-tatted on a snare drum; a third made good use of a whistle. Others relied on powerful indefatigable voices. (“It’s like having a Blue Man Group audition out there” joked Liz Graham-Meredith who lives nearby.)

The sound travels up hills and around bends to houses blocks and blocks away. By now Wu’s neighbors have learned to adjust their routines. They have shifted forward or back the times of their morning runs and dog walks; they are waking up earlier and leaving for work before the drumming and screaming begin. They are blaring NPR in their kitchens attempting to drown out the shouts.

A nurse practitioner who deployed to Bosnia and Guantanamo Bay as a member of the Massachusetts National Guard Drinkwater said the racket sometimes triggers memories of his military service particularly the riot control training.

When the demonstrations began weeks ago a handful of neighbors — some wearing bathrobes — came out to talk with the protesters attempting to persuade them to quiet down or to relocate their grievances to City Hall. They did not succeed. Neighbors have mulled counterprotests but many decided that would only encourage their morning tormentors.

Now when they pass by in cars or on foot alone with their headphones or led by a dog on a leash most neighbors just keep their heads down.

7:11 a.m. — A call and response: ”NO VAX MANDATE!” one protester shouted; “NO VAX PASSPORT!” the others returned. Across the street and out of rhythm one protester editorialized: “NO MASK MANDATE!”

Wu faces opposition to her vaccine mandates practically everywhere she goes. The firefighters union has protested across Boston dogging her at City Hall and at unrelated public appearances. But it’s just this smaller troupe that has focused its anger and energies on Augustus Avenue and Wu’s family life a choice many neighbors and elected officials say crosses a line. The protesters typically number under a dozen. Many are mothers; at least some are or were public safety workers. One Shana Cottone is a Boston police sergeant who was recently put on leave amid an internal affairs investigation. Another Melissa George is a former state corrections officer who lost her job because she did not get the vaccine. George said she is not antivaccine but believes employees should get to choose for themselves.

Neighbors said that months ago before the protests even began Wu apologized to them for the police car now perennially stationed on their street. She has apologized to some of them again for the noise. And she sometimes leaves her house early in an effort to spare them figuring the protesters will depart when she does. But that can spark yet more ire. By the protesters’ tortured logic the mayor is to blame for the disturbance.

“Wu leaves here early leaving us to come here and disrupt her neighbors. Doesn’t even care about her neighbors she just wants to sneak out for herself” one protester complained in a video posted online last month.

“Sneaky little Wu” she added. “Selfish little Wu.”

The mayor’s neighbors take a decidedly more positive view of her. They enjoy the block parties Wu throws with her husband Conor; they fret over what effect the protests may have on Wu’s mother who lives downstairs and struggles with mental illness as well as on the mayor’s two young sons. Wu said on Twitter that when she turned 37 last month one of the boys was confused about why the protesters were shouting “Happy birthday Hitler!”

Joe Cappuccio a 96-year-old World War II veteran who is Wu’s next door neighbor has lived in his home since 1946 and never before had a complaint about the area. Until now Roslindale was just another sleepy Boston neighborhood and Wu was just another friendly neighbor. Lately though their block has felt like a theater for one of the country’s most painful political wars.

“You’re doing this to be at the pinnacle of frustration for the mayor and others in the hope that our neighborly frustration somehow motivates Mayor Wu to change” Graham-Meredith another neighbor said. “But it just seems like the wrong way to go about trying to get your point across.”

Robin Chalfin who lives nearby hopes the protests will bring the neighborhood closer together. Last month she and her 12-year-old twin daughters canvassed door to door distributing copies of the local noise ordinance and collecting signatures on an oversized card.

“We <3 U Wu family” her daughters wrote on the front in pink and purple marker — that is we love you. Inside was an array of encouraging notes from neighbors neat script from adults and tentative signatures from kids just learning their letters. “Together we create the beloved community” they promised.

7:19 a.m. — “YOU WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE BUT YOU’VE GOT SIX OF THEM OUT HERE EVERY MORNING!”

Almost as many officers as protesters stand watch outside Wu’s home and by now the two groups have something of an understanding. One protester thanked the officers recently explaining that he was there to disrupt Wu but hated to cause them any trouble.

That is a “positive sign” said former police commissioner William Gross. Communication between demonstrators and officers is crucial for ensuring that protests stay peaceful added Gross who supported Wu’s opponent in last year’s mayoral election.

But some critics wonder if the officers should be doing more. After weeks of 311 and 911 complaints from neighbors and a well-attended community meeting with local police the demonstrators have not been moved away from Wu’s home and no arrests have been made.

At any protest police must walk a tightrope protecting demonstrators’ free speech rights while preserving the peace. That line grows even tighter when the protest launches at 7 a.m. on a quiet residential street and when it targets the mayor who also happens to be their boss and who also happens to be pitching policies that many of their colleagues oppose.

Still law enforcement has discretion in such situations; what one officer might consider an arrest-worthy offense another might shrug off with a warning. The protesters are not trespassing nor are they violent but law enforcement experts said their behavior lives in a kind of gray area where greater enforcement could be legally justified but might be unwise. Neighbors said police advised them to ignore the protests as best they could warning that arrests would only inflame the situation.

Wu’s relationship with the city’s public safety workers was arguably tense even before the vaccine mandate sparked widespread anger; though she has denied that she wants to “defund” the police Wu has proposed major changes to the department’s operations. According to self-reported campaign finance data from last year’s election roughly one in 10 Boston Police Department employees gave to Wu’s opponent former city councilor Annissa Essaibi-George who brought in about 50 times more money than Wu from city police officers and firefighters.

By virtue of its geography the mayor’s home is guarded by officers from District E-5. Cottone a protest organizer is a police sergeant in that district though she’s currently on leave.

Gerard Bailey chief of the Police Department’s Bureau of Field Services said in an interview that officers at the scene do their job impartially putting aside their own political views and any familiarity they may have with protesters.

“There’s no conflict. Regardless of who’s at a protest or who’s in the crowd they’re basically going to be professional” Bailey said. “We’re doing the best that we can as far as making sure everyone’s rights are protected there. . . . Overall it’s been going OK.”

It’s not clear how big a role Wu herself plays in dictating the so-far low-key response to the protests and her office did not answer questions about it. But several former local law enforcement officials said City Hall is likely at least giving input on the police response.

Wu has shown “a tremendous amount of restraint” said former Suffolk County district attorney Rachael Rollins both in the way she carries herself personally and “in the response we’ve seen from the Boston Police Department and the city.”

Others were more blunt.

“If the mayor wanted [the protesters] gone she would have made that call by now and that would be history” said Tom Nolan a former Boston police lieutenant who teaches at Emmanuel College. “Many of us looking at this say ‘You’ve clearly crossed the line here and if not for the patience and forbearance of the mayor you would’ve been in handcuffs weeks ago.’ ”

For her part Wu has said she tries not to take the demonstrations personally but worries about the toll they take on her mother and neighbors.

“I’m grateful to the officers who deal with this alongside us in the mornings often becoming targets of insults and aggressive threats from the crowd as they do their jobs. I’m especially thankful for our detail team who are always professional and focused on supporting community” Wu said in a statement to the Globe. “I’m confident in their ability to keep our community and me safe.”

On that recent frigid morning it was Wu’s appearance that pitched the protest into a frenzy.

At 7:23 a.m. an officer walked up Wu’s driveway. A black SUV approached.

For the protesters these were familiar cues. The drums picked up the whistles squealed the shouts crescendoed.

“HOW MANY SHOTS DOES IT TAKE TO BE FREE? HOW MANY SHOTS DOES IT TAKE TO BE FREE?”

“WU YOUR RIDE’S HERE!”

“I AM NOT YOUR LAB RAT!”

Wu walked down her driveway in a blue coat and with a calm expression. The shouts grew frenzied cross-talking one another.

“SHAME ON YOU!”

“WE HAVE CHILDREN TOO!”

Wu climbed into the passenger seat and pulled on a black mask. Protesters clustered in the street in the path of the car. The driver honked.

At 7:25 a.m. as the car took off toward Poplar Street after a brief delay the whistles faded. With Wu gone the morning’s mission accomplished and their point made the protesters grew relaxed almost jovial. One asked another if she was headed to the day’s next demonstration (she was). After a few minutes of milling around they headed to their cars too. For the neighbors it marked a familiar moment of exquisite relief.

By 7:30 a.m. the street was quiet again. But for the sole police car stationed outside the green house it could have been any other block in Roslindale.

Deputy Arts & Culture Editor

Wall Street: perhaps the most notorious locale of American lore. The financial capital of the world embodies the spirit of extravagant wealth influence and most notably success. However as attractive as Wall Street might be getting a slice of the pie and earning employment on the legendary street is often reserved for a select elite few namely ivy league graduates individuals with family ties and those born with silver spoons. That being said one particular organization at Florida State has been prosperous in breaching into the elusive Wall Street bubble: ‘The Noles on Wall Street.’

Simply put NoWS is a highly selective and intellectually rigorous program at FSU that seeks to place FSU’s brightest business and finance students into investment banking internships and other business-oriented programs at America’s top financial firms. Funded by Willow Partners a preeminent business society at FSU the program was founded in 2015 and has already found major success. Leading graduates of NoWS have landed internships at top Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan and Citigroup and the program has an exceptional internship placement rate overall.

“Just because we are [from] a state school that doesn’t mean we're not as good as someone from Harvard” said NoWS president Jared Ford. “The end goal is to have FSU on the radar of these banks and for them to come recruit at our school.”

As a past member of the program now serving as its top brass Ford is an individual who epitomizes NoWS’ success and the opportunities it can deliver. For this summer Ford placed into a prestigious 10-week investment banking internship program in New York City at UBS one of Wall Street’s most esteemed firms.

Impressed by NoWS’ superb results and pondering which characteristics and abilities made the program so successful I visited the NoWS as a guest for one of their weekly meetings.

The meeting which lasted roughly two hours consisted of roughly four segments — each aimed to tailor members into the best internship candidates possible. The first segment of the meeting consisted of networking and internship updates. Each member candidly opened up to the club about the dozens of calls they made emails they sent and interviews they conducted with personnel employed at investment banking firms.

In a bout of spectacular news sophomore student Katie Mendonsa received a resounding round of applause from the entire group. She had just scored an internship for Houlihan Lokey the No. 1 investment bank for global merger and acquisition transactions.

“The atmosphere in 'Noles on Wall Street is competitive but a great environment” said Mendonsa. “We all sincerely want to see each other succeed so everyone is willing to help you.”

Following the networking and internship updates came market updates. During this section the group showed off their expertise on current affairs and discussed anything that could possibly affect the stock market or economy. News brought up included oil futures Microsoft’s recent acquisition of the video game giant Activision and Russian troops on the border of Ukraine.

After this segment was my personal favorite portion of the meeting — the elevator pitch and resume workshop. Each member of the program delivered a short and snappy elevator pitch of their background qualifications and career goals to the fastidious observation of the entire group. Each pitch was crafted with close attention to detail and perceivably practiced by each participant many times over. Nonetheless Ford still was able to critique each speaker with comments related to content delivery and inflection.

“The most valuable thing I’ve learned through NoWS is how to tell my story” said junior and NoWS member Joel Weeks. “The only thing that differentiates you [from other candidates] is your personality appeal and how confidently you express yourself.”

Weeks who recently qualified for a prestigious diversity program at Perella Weinberg Partners is correct. Personality and self-expression are two of the key factors which go into NoWS’ highly-selective and prolonged application process in which 60-75 people apply and only 12 are selected.

The multi-stage process goes as such:

The first stage of the application opens up in the fall and requires applicants to submit a resume and answer a variety of questions related to why they want to join the organization. NoWS’ executive board processes the scores of applications and invites the candidates who meet the GPA requirements have properly formatted resumes and interesting professional experiences to a networking event. Applicants are then screened for their personalities and how well they behave in the networking environment. From this 25 candidates are chosen for interviews with Ford and the program’s co-director Anna Wimberley. After both behavioral and technical questions such as “What is your favorite book?” and “Walk me through a discounted cash flow model” the top-performing 12 candidates are chosen for NoWS.

If that sounds like a lot it is. Yet each critical skill necessary for the application process including acute social skills and an obstinate work ethic and fiery dedication are the bare minimum to succeed in the program. Ultimately we made it to the meeting's final portion behavioral and technical interview questions. Here each member once again illustrated their tact and in the spotlight solved enigmatic standardized interview questions such as “Are you a better leader or follower?”

Right before closure the meeting concluded with a pop-quiz a happenstance right in-line with NoWS’ demanding curriculum. Wimberley who will be interning with Citigroup’s investment banking division in the summer spoke about success. “Despite the stereotype that bankers receive I do not think that success should be defined by the job you have how much money you make or the opinions of your peers'' said Wimberley. “No matter the job or role that I take as long as I know that I am giving it my all then I believe I am being successful.”

Defining success as Wimberley does NoWS is undoubtedly successful. For the future Ford Wimberley and the rest of the organization’s executive board hopes to grow the reach of the program keep placing members in prodigious investment banking internships and continue to stick it to the state-school status quo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAyLTA2L2FmdGVyLTEtMDAwLWRheXMtZ29sZG1hbi1iYW5rZXItdG8tc3RhbmQtdHJpYWwtZm9yLTFtZGItc2NhbmRhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 1000 Days Goldman Banker to Stand Trial for 1MDB Scandal,"Why did this happen?

“There’s plenty of students who grew up around finance and came to BC with the goal of doing something like [finance]” Donegan assistant dean for undergraduate career advising at the Carroll School of Management said. “That’s not the target audience for a lot of these firms as they’re looking for underrepresented students.”

This year Bank Week took place from Tuesday to Friday and featured a variety of panels and networking events where sophomores could interact with BC alumni in the investment banking industry.

“Investment banking is unique in the sense that almost all of their hiring comes through their intern programs and their intern programs are recruiting in sophomore year so it really creates a need to get our students ready” she said.

Donegan said that Bank Week aimed to foster a welcoming environment featuring events such as “Women in Finance” “Black/Brown in Finance” and “Being LGBTQ on Wall Street” to provide perspective and advice for underrepresented groups on navigating the industry.

“Networking with people I learned a lot more about the diversity programs” Remi Robertson CSOM ’24 said. “I now know a lot of banks have women’s programs and even if not a specific women’s program they have [women’s] organizations within the banks which has been really interesting to learn.”

The Diversity Networking Reception on Friday morning also gave students a smaller space to network with bank representatives before the session opened up to the general student population.

“It helped with getting a personal connection with recruiters and [current] employees and with figuring out what they’re actually doing in the company” Dhairya Dhamani CSOM ’24 said. “So you get not a scripted answer but something that is more genuine.”

Since Bank Week caters to sophomores with limited financial experience Donegan said the Bank Week website provides a variety of resources including networking tutorials bank recruiting timelines and free access to advanced technical interview preparation from Training The Street.

Students new to the industry also observed the structure and inner workings of investment banking. Omer Tanvir global co-head of campus recruiting at Goldman Sachs gave an overview of the structure of an investment bank. He explained that while investment banking is an industry it is also a specific division within investment banking firms.

“Most investment banking firms have about twenty different divisions within them one of which is investment banking” Tanvir BC ’05 said. “The first thing that bankers do is give you advice when you want to buy another company or merge with another company … The second thing they do is capital raising—they connect you with [investors] when you need money.”

Bank Week sessions allowed alumni working in more prominent divisions—including sales and trading divisions and wealth and asset management divisions—to share insight about their fields but other alumni provided perspective on lesser-known fields.

One such panel described environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) investing a field that prioritizes societal and environmental benefits through profitable investments. Paul Donofrio a UBS investment banker working on ESG reminded students to monitor the impact of their investments given the Earth’s worsening environmental condition.

“I think the reality is that everybody has kids and everybody sees where things are headed” Donofrio BC ’09 said. “And they realize that there’s a sense of urgency around some of this stuff now. I do see change.”

Overall Bank Week provided an opportunity for students to take their first steps into the investment banking industry and receive firsthand knowledge from BC alumni.

“I think there’s a lot of pressure to go into investment banking but I think we don’t really know what it is and what it’s like” Robertson said. “So I think hearing people’s firsthand experiences was really eye-opening.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vaGFucy95b3VuZy1oYW5zL3N0dWRlbnRzLXNlbGVjdGVkLWZvci1pbnRlcm5zaGlwLWF0LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtNzI4MDEx0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGFuc2luZGlhLmNvbS9hbXAvaGFucy95b3VuZy1oYW5zL3N0dWRlbnRzLXNlbGVjdGVkLWZvci1pbnRlcm5zaGlwLWF0LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtNzI4MDEx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Students selected for internship at Goldman Sachs,"Four B Tech pre-final year students of IIIT Naya Raipur Gaurav Mundada Yogesh Kumar Anurav Gupta and Nishanth Addagatla have been selected for a Summer internship at Goldman Sachs. The students will be joining the global investment banking securities and investment management firm from May 2022 onwards for two months.

The selection process was rigorous and consisted of multiple rounds and was attended by thousands of students across India. First Round was based on questions including Aptitude Language and Mathematics. The second round included Coding Mathematics and Computer Science theory questions. The next round was a series of technical and HR interviews where candidates were asked questions about Data Structures and Algorithms Web Development and previous projects from their resumes.

Selected students mentioned that they used to solve coding questions regularly on Leetcode Codeforces and Codechef platforms. They said that a better understanding of core Computer Science and Data Science concepts taught at IIIT Naya Raipur also helped them a lot in clearing the technical rounds. They shared that to achieve good internship opportunities students should focus on building good projects actively practice competitive coding and solve data structure and algorithm questions. Students mentioned that the project-focused curriculum and skill-oriented pedagogy of IIIT Naya Raipur had prepared them well.

Gaurav Mundada has one more research internship offer from Thompson Rivers University Canada for Summer 2022.

But when David Fyfe of Argus Media a publisher calls production quotas set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and its allies a “Platonic ideal”—more of a theoretical model than a practical guide—he captures the sense of self-doubt now gripping energy markets. Every month since July the group has agreed to raise its output by 400000 barrels per day (bpd). But experts cannot decide whether that is too little or too much—and whether the target means much at all.

The cartel’s latest meeting on February 2nd took place against the backdrop of heightened fears about a Russian invasion of Ukraine (Russia the world’s second-biggest oil exporter is a member of the extended cartel known as OPEC+ ). Only the week before the price of a barrel of Brent crude had spiked above $90 its highest level in seven years. The alliance promised to raise output again by the usual amount. That calmed markets a bit. The question is what happens next."

The overall value of single-family houses surged nearly 30% compared with the last revaluation in 2016. Two- and three-family houses — also considered residential real estate — saw even larger overall jumps of 38% and 46% respectively in appraisals according to the city.

The whopping increases have caught some homeowners in the city off guard while they are still struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus.

“A lot of people are really hurting” said Donna Thompson-Daniel chairwoman of the Blue Hills Neighborhood Revitalization Zone. “Not only are property taxes going up but we also know food went up. Gas went up. Clothing has gone up. But our paychecks have not gone up.”

Thompson-Daniel a retired school crossing guard who now works as a substitute teacher saw the appraisal on her 1100-square-foot 3-bedroom 1.5 bath Cape on Lyme Street jump nearly 40% to $165400 from $118400 in 2016.

Donna Thompson-Daniel at center and her children Robert Daniel II at left and Renbrook live in Hartford’s Blue Hills neighborhood. The appraisal on Thompson-Daniel’s Cape jumped nearly 40%.

“I’m waiting to see how many people are going to be able to afford to live where they are living right now” Thompson-Daniel said. “Some of these people are going to have to go and get a second job. And some of them are not young people.”

The city is going to have to figure out how to get some relief for property owners Thompson-Daniel said.

“If I was looking to sell I would be making some money” said Thompson-Daniel who has lived in her house for 34 years. “But I’m not looking to move out of my neighborhood because I love it here.”

Another equation

While residential real estate saw big gains the fallout from the pandemic had the opposite affect on most segments of commercial real estate.

The value of larger office buildings hotels and restaurants generally tumbled the revaluation found as uncertainty swirls around emerging from the pandemic. It is still unclear as to what extent companies will bring back workers to the office if they will downsize or renew leases and how business travel will be reshaped.

The city said office property values could fall by as much as 10% overall.

CityPlace I downtown Hartford’s tallest office tower for instance had its appraised value fall from $103 million in 2016 to $82 million in last fall’s revaluation a 20% decline. City Place’s owners Paradigm Properties of Boston declined to comment.

The appraised value of CityPlace I at left fell 20% in the city’s recently-completed real estate revaluation.

Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said the revaluation confirmed what the city has observed throughout the pandemic: the surge in the housing market — seen in towns and cities across the state — and the struggles in the office market.

“There is no question in this reval that residential properties will make up a larger share of the total taxable property than it did in the previous reval” Bronin said. “We are going to do our best in our budget process to mitigate the impact on homeowners by reducing the mill rate modestly if we can but that will only cushion the blow a little bit.”

Owners of larger apartment buildings with four or more units also are bracing for possible hefty tax increases. Larger apartment properties — considered commercial rather than residential real estate — was a bright spot in commercial real estate.

In Hartford and across the country investors have been shoveling funds into apartment projects and purchases pushing up values.

City officials point out that the trends aren’t all bad for office buildings downtown however with some signing leases with new tenants despite the pandemic.

For example the owners of One Financial Plaza the “Gold Building” inked a lease with Sun Life Financial last summer for 47000 square feet enough space for up to 450 employees.

Appraisals

The decline in appraisals for office and other commercial properties — the largest segment of taxable properties in the city — is taking on even greater significance in Hartford than elsewhere because of how the city’s property taxes are calculated.

Hartford’s One Financial Plaza the “Gold Building” recently signed leases including one for 47000 square feet that could eventually bring 450 workers downtown.

Property tax bills are based on a percentage of the appraised value or the assessed value. Hartford unlike all other towns and cities in Connecticut figures the assessed value differently for residential and commercial property.

Commercial property is assessed at 70% of appraised value while residential is pegged at 36.75%. The two-tiered system dates from the late 1970s and was intended to soften increases to homeowners after a long period between revaluations.

State law now requires property revaluations to be conducted every five years.

Bronin said the city could seek approval for delaying the revaluation but he is wary of doing that worried about further erosion in commercial property values in the next few years.

“This may be one of those situations where the best choice is simply the least bad option” Bronin said.

Tax exempts complicate things

Hartford has struggled with its tax rate of 74.29 mills with commercial property owners paying the highest real estate taxes in the state and some of the steepest in the country.

On top of that the value of tax-exempt real estate — government buildings hospitals and churches — exceed the value of taxable real estate by a third.

Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the tax rate by the assessed value and dividing that number by 1000.

City Assessor John Philip said Hartford is just at the beginning of the process that will lead to the tax bills that come due July 1.

The new appraisals and assessed values mailed two weeks ago to residents and commercial property owners are a key indicator of how tax bills will play out. But they are not the only piece of the puzzle Philip said.

The city’s grand list — the total of all taxable property — is expected to increase potentially pushing the tax rate down The city’s grand list now stands at about $4 billion but the grand list for 2021 is still being drawn up Philip said.

How much local tax money the city budgets to provide services to taxpayers also weighs heavily on the tax rate.

Property owners who do not agree with their appraisals and resulting assessments can discuss them with the consultant that performed the appraisal. If still not satisfied a formal appeal can be filed with the city Philip said.

Bronin said the two-tiered assessment system which is much lower for residential property actually puts Hartford in line with — or in some cases lower — than some surrounding suburban towns when it comes to taxing residential properties.

The city’s assessment system is the cause for a lot of confusion Bronin said and a better approach might be establishing separate tax rates for residential and commercial property.

However 43-year-old James Travis Barnett was actually in touch with an undercover Blackford County sheriff's deputy.

He was arrested after he arrived in Montpelier at a planned meeting location with those prescription medications and others in his possession.

Barnett was charged this week in Blackford Circuit Court with dealing in a narcotic drug possession of a narcotic drug dealing in a controlled substance and making an unlawful proposition.

According to an affidavit Barnett initiated online contact with the deputy on Dec. 14 and eventually indicated he was willing to give ""the woman"" tablets of Vicodin a prescription pain-killer and Xanax usually prescribed to treat anxiety if they met.

Barnett at first asked for revealing photographs in exchange for the medications but then offered them in exchange for sexual activity according to a transcript of the online conversation included in the court document.

He also allegedly sent the deputy a photograph of his genitalia.

The Hartford City man was arrested when he arrived at the planned meeting place in Montpelier.

He reportedly tried to persuade investigators he had not intended to give the woman any of the controlled substances saying he ""can tell her whatever he wants to tell her just to meet up with her.""

The most serious of the charges against the Hartford City man dealing in a narcotic drug is a Level 5 felony carrying up to six years in prison.

Barnett who was released from custody after posting bond will be directed to appear for an initial court hearing set on Feb. 28.

By Katherine Breer Bruns West Hartford Recycling Coordinator

West Hartford’s own Bugbee Elementary School is off to a great start with its new cafeteria food scrap collection and composting program. Bravo to all the eager K-5 students who have worked hard to learn to manage their lunch waste in a whole new way. And thank you to Bugbee Principal Kelly Brouse as well as the teachers and dedicated custodial staff for helping to make it all possible.

Before starting this program due to COVID protocols for school lunch set-up students threw their lunch waste into one trash barrel. Currently all school lunches are free under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and are pre-packed in brown bags. With the new food scrap collection program students now have four containers in which to sort their scraps: liquids food scraps recyclables and trash. They have learned quickly and eagerly help each other out. The students are always amazed to see how much food is diverted from the trash.

Collected food scraps are sent to Quantum Biopower in Southington and turned into energy and compost. Food scrap disposal costs the town almost 40% less than solid waste disposal – so not only is there environmental incentive to divert food scraps there is also financial.

Food waste comprises about 25% of Connecticut’s solid waste stream. West Hartford as part of its varied programs to reduce trash made it a priority to start food scrap composting programs in all of its public schools. Before COVID four elementary schools had the program in place: Charter Oak Duffy Smith and Morley school. As of this publication those programs are still on hold with plans to restart as soon as possible.

The Department of Public Works will start the program one-by-one in the rest of the elementary schools before moving onto the middle and high schools. If anyone is interested in helping with the roll out volunteers are very welcome as soon as COVID protocols allow.

Please contact Recycling Coordinator Katherine Bruns ([email protected]) to let her know of your interest. She would be most grateful!

Diverting food scraps from trash is great but PREVENTING food waste in the first place should be the priority. When COVID protocols permit again we will reinstate “Food Share” tables for sealed uneaten food. Students can place good food here rather than putting edible food into compost.

We encourage parents to talk with their children about their lunch room experience and ways to prevent food waste. And for those packing lunches from home this is a good opportunity to have conversations with your children about how much can realistically be eaten and pack accordingly. There is a lot of uneaten food at school lunches. The average American family of four throws away about $1.600 a year in uneaten food and about 40% of all food produced is never eaten. We have the power to start changing these numbers.

Bravo Bugbee students! Keep up the good work!

This is intended for young Padawans so the design is pretty well built to take a few beatings. Even though it only has seven LEDs the blade illuminates pretty well and I was curious to see how they’re being diffused.

The blade is made up of three pieces that are clam shelled together with about a dozen screws. The black covers feature standoffs that fit through the holes across the blade. The core of the blade is transparent plastic with a recess in the center for the PCB. Eight err seven LEDs are very spaced apart on this rather long and skinny PCB (Note: One of the LEDs are actually not populated I didn’t notice after this write-up). Each is LED is labeled and the PCB faces down against the plastic when assembled.

The tip of the blade has a free-wired common 5mm LED hot glued in place. This is a good way to get the tip lit given the shape and angle of the blade.

The end of the PCB near the hilt features two different SMD LEDs. The blade only uses two colors white and blue.

The other end of the PCB has the manufacturing date and other markings.

The hilt is two halves that are secured together with screws located behind the AAA batteries. The hilt features a built-in battery holder with a standard single-screw covering. The mode switch is at the bottom of the pommel below the speaker. The main PCB is fitted just behind the on/off switch.

The front of the board has a rubber actuator fitted on top of a momentary button. The chip is behind a black blob standard practice for a consumer product.

The back of the board has labeled pins for the ribbon cable that connects the LED strip. I’m assuming the black cylinder is the tilt-switch for triggering sounds and animations.

While putting it back together I forgot to adjust the ribbon cable before sliding the blade back into the hilt so the cable got kinked – Oops! Just peeled some wire insulation nothing some Kapton tape wouldn’t fix. Lesson learned.

And it still works! Adding more LEDs sure does sound fun but that will have to wait for another weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS90cmFuc2Zvcm1lcnMtd2Fycy1lbmQtaWR3LWNvbWljcy1zZXJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ancient evils arise in IDW's new 'Transformers: War's End' comic book miniseries,"San Diego-based IDW Publishing has been at the front lines of ""Transformers"" tie-in one-shot and spinoff comic books starring those sentient robots in disguise since they first acquired the licensing rights from Hasbro back in 2005.

Since then IDW has been the champion of more than 400 ""Transformers""-centric issues representing the longest-running era of “Transformers” continuity since the toy line was introduced back in 1984.

Sadly IDW will lose the publishing rights to both ""G.I. Joe"" and ""Transformers"" at the conclusion of 2022 after a respectful legacy of stewardship of the pop culture properties. But before they pass the torch they’re going out in high style with the first of multiple ""Transformers"" miniseries arriving throughout the year. To kick off the grand finale ""Transformers: War's End"" arrives this month as a dynamic companion to the publisher’s ongoing flagship ""Transformers"" series.

Transformers: War's End on Kindle/Comixology: $3.99 at Amazon. You can pre-order the kickoff of IDW's Transformers comic series finale coming on Feb. 23 2022.

Written by Brian Ruckley the creative force behind IDW's monthly ""Transformers"" title and illustrated by artist Jack Lawrence (""Transformers: Lost Light"") ""Transformers: War's End"" is a four-issue limited series that exposes a terrifying ancient evil that links past present and future.

""War's End is about unfinished business: for both the characters and for Cybertron as a whole"" Ruckley said in an official IDW press release. ""It's the return of Cybertron's traumatic past to upend its present ... and answers the question: If your planet has at its core the collective Spark of your entire civilization just how vulnerable might that make you? I love the fact that we will get to act this out with some of my favorite characters: Cyclonus Team Stream Pyra Magna Geomotus and Exarchon. They all get to take center stage play for the highest of high stakes and discover their fates and their futures.""

The storyline reveals that notorious warlord Exarchon the villain who drove Cybertron into a period of darkness ages ago is back and teamed up with his old generals Shockwave and Skywarp. Cyclonus a noble gladiator still maimed by the trauma of that long-ago battle searches for capable allies in the form of the Decepticon's legendary leader Megatron who has his own divisive agenda that's already shattered Cybertron society into disparate allegiances.

""Up to now my Transformers work has been post- or pre-war so with ""War's End"" I'm excited to contribute to the Cybertronian war itself"" added Lawrence in the statement. ""This story is understandably darker and grittier than what I've worked on before so I'm looking forward to going shadowy and ominous with it. Plus I get to draw characters I haven't worked with in a big way – characters I've loved for more than 35 years. There aren't really words for how incredibly exciting that is!""

When the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan declared a major incident at hospitals in the capital due to the spread of the Omicron variant and a staffing crisis it was once again a stark reminder of the pressure they've been put under during the last two years.

But while ICU pressure might have subsided and the 'major incident' alarm has been stood down staff are continuing to tackle emergencies mental health and community care and the huge elective surgery backlog.

Amid the huge pressure the health service was under at the end of last year the Care Quality Commission (CQC) the independent regulator of health care services postponed inspections in hospitals and GP services.

However the CQC announced they will now begin to inspect more health care providers.

But what do the current inspections say? How good are London hospitals?

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) rates every hospital in the country from ‘Outstanding’ through to ‘Requires Improvement’.

The CQC conducts regular inspections and this might include speaking to patients and staff inspecting policies and observing care.

It rates each service on a variety of measures- including waiting times whether staff treat patients with respect and whether staff are trained effectively.

If a practice fails to make enough improvement and is still rated inadequate - the CQC will place it into 'special measures' and it risks closure.

In London 13 hospitals received the highest rating of 'Outstanding'.

For the rating 'Good' there were 136.

56 were rated 'Requires Improvement' and four were 'Inadequate'. 13 were not rated.

The hospitals rated outstanding (includes both NHS and private) were:

Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust

The Royal Marsden - Sutton

First Community Health & Care C.I.C.

The Harley Street Clinic (Private specialised in oncology cardiology and neurosciences)

HCA Healthcare UK at University College Hospital (Specialist Cancer and Haematology)

The Lister Hospital Chelsea (Private Hospital)

The London Bridge Hospital (Private Hospital)

Moorfields Eye Hospital Islington.

The Royal Marsden Chelsea and Sutton hospitals (Specialist cancer care)

East London NHS Foundation Trust ( includes hospitals offering mental health services including Newham Centre for Mental Health The Tower Hamlets Centre For Mental Health and City And Hackney Centre For Mental Health)

Chelsea and Westminster Hospital

Homerton University Hospital Hackney

Queen Charlottes and Chelsea Hospital Hammersmith (Maternity women's and neonatal care hospital)

Pressures on hospitals may be reducing as Covid staff absence falls and bed occupancy decreases.

In intensive care there were 170 adult critical care beds empty on January 16 according to the latest figures.

On the Sunday before that there had been 156 beds free.

But Ambulance's are still facing long wait times to hand-over patients at hospitals doors.

A total of 2201 ambulances had to wait more than 30 minutes to handover patients at London A&Es last week (17 per cent) including 627 waiting more than an hour (4.8 per cent).

That’s the equivalent of one in six ambulances facing a wait of more than half-an-hour with one in 21 waiting more than an hour.

The target is for handovers is under 15 minutes.

Furthermore there is a key challenge regarding patients taking up beds in hospital despite being medically fit to be discharged - a problem which extends across the country.

Last Sunday (23rd) London hospitals had 1210 beds occupied by patients who no longer needed to be in hospital.

That was the equivalent of 8.9 per cent of the general and acute and adult critical care beds.

There are a number of reasons for why hospital patients may have had their hospital discharge delayed.

They include:

the impact of Covid has meant that some patients’ conditions have become more serious and they need longer recovery time in hospital

increased number of patients with complex needs so they need more support once discharged

workforce capacity/capability to discharge (a level of seniority is required to discharge patients confidently and safely)

patient carer and family choice

But experts have said the key cause of the current delays is the pressured situation in social care and in particular home care.

“In social care services are struggling to meet the needs of people already in receipt of social care simply don’t have capacity to take on new clients who are being discharged from hospital” Natasha Curry deputy director of policy at the health think tank the Nuffield Trust told the BMJ.

Katherine Henderson president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said freeing up beds will help to “prevent exit block dangerous crowding and corridor care” but added “It is often the case that long stay patients are the most vulnerable who need support from social care services in their return to the community.

""The ongoing social care crisis is preventing these vulnerable patients from safely returning home or to their community when they have completed their treatment.”

Columnist

Greg Hershey is a son of Mel and Dianna Hershey who make their home in Pavonia near Ashland. The village was a family affair — Grandma Frances Conkey Uncle Ray and Aunt Wanda Hershey and Howard and Barb Finn all lived close to one another there. Greg said he couldn’t get away with anything; the family was watching him but he tried anyway.

Greg enjoyed wrestling in school and went on to Pioneer Career and Technology Center in his junior year and graduated from Crestview High School in 1989. While at Pioneer Greg met Leanna Sherman a student from Colonel Crawford. She also graduated in 1989; they married after graduation and lived in Shenandoah not far from Pavonia.

During that time the Gulf War was going on and Greg said “I’m an able-bodied man I should do my part.” By that time they also had a daughter Jordan. Their second daughter Paige was born while dad was in training. Ironically the war ended before he actually got in the service. Greg stayed in the Army for eight years stationed in Virginia Korea and Georgia. During those years their third daughter Casey was born. Military life can be ""a lot"" and Leanna was more than ready to move back home.

In 1998 the Hershey family moved to Sulphur Springs where their son Alex was born along with their daughter Rae. In 2014 they added their sixth child Drevyn quite by accident. He needed a family. He has been a huge blessing.

Greg did factory work for a couple months until he was hired by the state as a corrections officer at Mansfield Correctional Institute for two years. He told his wife that “civilian life isn’t for me.” Then about 15 minutes later he got a call from the Bucyrus Fire Department asking him if he was still interested in the job. “Yeah I’ll give it a try"" he said. It was always a job that interested him — serving others and just helping folks.

The fire department fits his personality and gives him the opportunity to serve and help people in need. Greg just wants to be there. When a person in need is at one of his or her worst moments Greg likes to be the one with the ability to help resolve the problem. During a part of his fire department life he continued on in the National Guard and retired from there in 2013.

Greg went to fire school at the State Fire Academy in Columbus in 2000 for firefighting and then a few months later he went back to become an emergency medical technician. Bucyrus Fire Department employees are all required to either be an EMT or paramedic. Greg is continuing college work at the present time. Bucyrus took over EMS coverage in the city and some surrounding townships in November 2021. They work 24 hours on duty and in a 48-hour period it's one day on and two days off.

The fire department is a family. They live and work together and share their lives. All of their families are close.

“They take care of their own"" says Greg. ""Retirees never really retire. They just don’t have to come to work but they always come back home.""

The kitchen table in the fire department is not just a place to eat. You gather. You talk. If you have a problem it gets fixed there. When they go out on call the lessons learned on that call are reviewed at the table when they return. The table is a big part of all of their lives. Greg said they had a table about the same size but in all those years they had never built a table for their own needs. Some of the guys said yes we should do that but Greg didn’t realize that ""we would mean me!"" The funny part — Greg has never had formal training in woodworking His experience was in his dad’s workshop with many projects. Greg says he doesn’t really make plans on paper; he just sees it in his head. Another woodworking project was building his own kitchen cupboards.

The firemen tried to draw some ideas for the designs on the table but in the end they came up with the American flag the Bucyrus Fire Department logo and the red axe for the thin red line. Underneath the table it reads “For those that come before us … to those that will come after us … embrace this table most sacred place in the firehouse … remember the conversations lessons learned and lessons taught. These memories will follow you deeper into life than any fire you will fight. 2nd Platoon Dec. 10 2020"" — the date when the table was built. Ryan Sparks Grey Hershey and Jeremy Gillam worked together to build the table and when an extra pair of hands was needed Kevin Phillips pitched in too.

Terry Fletcher their dad took the family to the Mile High Nationals at Bandimere Speedway in Morrison Colorado in 2019. They met Mike Salinas a NHRA Top Fuel racer with Scrappers Racing who has won numerous national titles.

“He stopped us on the way out because of Terralynn” Terry said. “He wanted to give her a piston which she’s still got to this day.”

Salinas talked with Terralynn about his own girls who are also racers and told her she should think about doing it as well.

“That was in July” Terry said. “In August Terralynn came up to me and said ‘Dad I’ve been thinking’ and that’s where it started. We got her in it and of course Alliana went along.”

Though Alliana admits she was hesitant when her dad and mom Bobbi asked if she was interested in racing as well.

“If we’re going to start out with honesty I didn’t want to do it” Alliana said. “I didn’t want my parents spending over $5000 to put me in something I never tried and not enjoy it. So I told them I wasn’t going to do it.”

But her parents didn’t give her the option.

“My dad said ‘No you’re going to’ threw me in a car and it became my passion” Alliana said.

Her dad said Alliana has attention deficit disorder. Racing gives her a respite and helps her to focus.

“I like the peace that comes out of it” Alliana said. “I mess a lot with myself mentally and when I’m pulling up to the (starting lights) tree you literally can’t think of anything else.

“A lot of people wouldn’t say it’s peaceful because you’re going 85 mph within an eighth of a mile but it’s literally the most peaceful thing I could do and I just love doing it. It’s a mental game.”

Terry said Alliana found a niche that she truly enjoys.

“And I’m surprisingly good at it” Alliana said.

Terralynn was the first of the Fletcher girls to get started. Salinas gave Terralynn the encouragement she needed to give racing a try.

“What made me want to race is that I have courage” Terralynn said. “I knew I could do it from the start and Mike Salinas told me someday I might get in one of those cars and here I am in one of these cars.”

Terry bought a car for Terralynn and they practiced up and down the street next to their house in Hershey. She had to get a racing license which includes a medical checkup among other “intense” steps like driving tests and demonstrating familiarity with the track.

After going through the process the girls joined the NHRA Summit Racing Jr. Drag Racing League. It offers kids ages 5 through 17 a chance to race half-scale dragsters in a controlled environment at the NHRA’s 130 member tracks throughout the United States and in Canada long before they can obtain a state driver’s license.

Terralynn’s first race was at Kearney Raceway Park.

“I don’t remember who I was going against but I was still learning how to turn onto the track so some people helped me” Terralynn said. “I don’t know if I won or not but I felt really happy that I started doing it.”

Terralyn’s engine is about 17 horsepower and Alliana’s is about 52 horsepower. Alliana’s top speed is 85 mph and Terralyn said “the fastest I’ve gone is 62 mph.”

According to Terry the engines are based off the Briggs and Stratton flathead engine which is a single cylinder. The bore size is different in the two cars.

“It’s just a lawn mower on steroids” Alliana said.

The girls race at the Julesburg Dragstrip most of the time. They like the competition and camaraderie that is found there.

“The sportsmanship is huge” Bobbi said. “Win or lose these kids are out there every race giving knuckles wishing good luck before the race. After the race they get out of their cars and give high fives knuckles.”

This season the girls are signed up for the Western Conference Finals that will take place at Bandimere June 24 to 26. Racing teams will come from all over the western United States as well as Canada and Mexico.

Last season the girls competed at the Division 5 finals at Bandimere and performed well.

“There were 69 cars in my class and I placed sixth” Alliana said.

Bobbi said it was her daughter’s first time racing at Bandimere. Terralynn finished third out of about 20 cars.

In September the girls will compete in the District 7 finals in Las Vegas.

Hickory which before Saturday never advanced to a championship final in the meet's 24-year history won the title with a 44-27 victory over the Fort LeBoeuf Bison.

The Hornets not only defeated the tournament's top-seeded team but also beat one of only two programs that accomplished what coach Nick Clepper and his wrestlers did this weekend at Sharon High School.

LeBoeuf and the Reynolds Raiders whose nine-year district reign and district-record five-year PIAA tournament reign ended Saturday were the only D-10 small-school champions before then.

""I kind of forgot about that"" Clepper said. ""We're still going to go (to Hershey) and try to win as many (duals) as we can for this great season.""

The Hornets were led by defending state champion Louie Gill just a sophomore freshman Dylan O'Brien and veterans such as Carter Gill Cody Miller Connor Saylor and Ty Holland

Hickory (12-2) will make its state debut in the main portion of this season's tournament.

The Hornets automatically advanced to Thursday's first round at Hershey. They'll face the winner of Monday's preliminary round dual between Montgomery District 4's second seed and West Perry District 3's third seed.

Bison and Beavers get berths

LeBoeuf and Corry claimed the district's second and third PIAA invitations available during Saturday's action. Each must win Monday in order to join Hickory at the Giant Center in Hershey next weekend.

The Bison (13-4) despite their title round loss will host Burgettstown at 7 p.m. The Blue Devils (14-1) were upset by Quaker Valley 36-35 in the semifinals of the WPIAL 2A tournament but recovered to eliminate Mount Pleasant 43-20 in the third-place dual.

Coach Shane McChesney was proud LeBoeuf advanced as far as it did given the team competed Saturday minus two of its significant starters.

Sophomore middleweight Conner McChesney Shane McChesney's son and junior upperweight Danny Church sat out the meet with injuries. Shane McChesney said they remain questionable for Monday's dual against Burgettstown.

""For our team to wrestle without those two and still make the final I'm very proud of that"" he said. ""My biggest challenge was making sure we were ready without them. We made it known to (some of) the backups that they had to step up and get the team still believing in each other.""

Corry eliminated Saegertown 37-28 in Saturday's third-place dual.

The Beavers (13-3) will travel to Tyrone (11-6) for Monday's 6 p.m. PIAA 2A opener against District 6's second seed. Forest Hills edged the Golden Eagles 36-34 in their championship dual on Saturday.

Corry experienced the longest route to the PIAA tournament among the district's three qualifiers.

The sixth-seeded Beavers had to beat Northwestern during last Wednesday's round-of-16 just to get into the quarterfinals. It was during that round Saturday Corry upset No. 3 Greenville 37-21.

A 36-25 semifinal loss to Hickory dropped Corry into the third-place dual. However Saturday's 37-28 victory over Saegertown not only extended its season but also avenged a 32-27 loss to the Panthers on Jan. 5.

That dual doubled as Travis Proper's first as coach of the Beavers. He was an assistant to Mark Munsee who resigned after last season.

""I'm definitely proud of the kids (Saturday)"" Proper said. ""We were the (team) nobody was talking about. It was Greenville Hickory Fort LeBoeuf and Reynolds. Well here's Corry. We felt like we had nothing to lose so I told them that.""

Extreme outcomes for Panthers

Saegertown was epitome of how unusually random Saturday's tournament was.

The Panthers' dual season ended even though they were responsible for ending Reynolds' lengthy district and PIAA title runs. They barely held on for a dramatic 34-32 quarterfinal victory vs. the Raiders whose final record of 9-7 was an anomaly for one of the state's elite wrestling programs.

Reynolds down 34-9 won the dual's last five matches. The Raiders would have recorded an all-time comeback had Vito Gentile been able to pin the Panthers' Keenan Schaaf in their 172-pound finale.

That nearly happened with 12 seconds left. Schaaf though was able to roll out of bounds stop the clock and return to the neutral position.

Gentile won 13-1 but his major decision still left the Raiders two team points shy of tying the dual.

Had Gentile pinned Schaaf Reynolds would have won based on the first tiebreaker match victories. The Raiders won seven to Saegertown's six.

TERRENCE O'BRIEN: Usually all people care about when talking supercomputers is speed. The big thing now is the race to build an exascale computer which is being spearheaded by Intel and Cray. But honestly the harder and arguably more important work around supercomputers is figuring out how to make them more eco-friendly.

Unsurprisingly it takes a lot of energy not only to power a supercomputer but also keep it cool. For example the Department of Energy's 200 petaflop Summit is currently the world's most powerful supercomputer. It's the size of two tennis courts. And it's comprised of 4608 servers with more than 9022 core IBM processors and over 27000 NVIDIA GPUs.

Cooling this monstrosity takes 4000 gallons of water a minute and uses enough electricity to power 8100 homes. By comparison NASA's 3.69 petaflop Aitken looks positively quaint. But that's more than enough computing power to run the advanced simulations that will be crucial to planning our next manned mission to the moon. More importantly though Aitken can represents a real leap in efficiency. It's 46080 cores and 221 terabytes of storage are cooled through a mixture of fans recirculated water and plain old California air.

Through the creative use of the Bay Area's naturally cool temperatures NASA and Hewlett Packard Enterprise were able to remove the need for a cooling tower and save millions of gallons of water. $3 million in 2018 alone. Aitken also uses about two million kilowatt hours less electricity than a similarly powered supercomputer. Part of its efficiency is due to its reliance on modules.

The system is built around second generation Intel Xeon processors connected over Mellanox InfiniBand and housed inside Schneider Electric Smart shelter containers. This gives the system greater flexibility for cooling speeds deployment and makes them quite scalable. So 3.69 petaflops isn't the limit. It's just the first step. And if you want to make sure you find out what the next step is you should make sure to click that subscribe button.

View the current offers here.

Palm Springs California has long been an oasis for Southern Californians — and those from farther afield — looking to escape the busyness of daily life or the cold of winter with a trip to the warm desert.

Set in the stunning Sonoran Desert and surrounded by mountains (that often have snow at the top even in the summer) the Palm Springs area has something for everyone. The weather is great year-round (though it gets very hot in the summer; it is the desert after all). There's an abundance of golf courses and tennis courts plus a plethora of cultural attractions and a vibrant dining and drinking scene.

As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on travelers — and the travel industry — have realized the potential of this destination as a perfect escape.

The city and surrounding area have actually benefitted tremendously from the shift in travel preferences away from crowded cities and international destinations for places closer to home with lots of outdoor space.

Don’t go there” she said. “Everything is super expensive.” They might be expensive yes but they’re also inviting to the weary traveler: a cold can of Coca-Cola a refreshing bottle of water or a tiny bottle of booze paired with a can of Pringles and bag of M&Ms. That’s practically a meal.

But over the past decade many hotel companies have steered clear of the once-vaunted amenity. “Hotels call time on the minibar” The Independent wrote in 2013 referencing the hassle and cost of upkeep. “The Death of the Minibar Is Nigh” an Esquire headline proclaimed that same year. The Atlantic ran a story that year simply titled “Elegy for the Minibar.”

The Atlantic piece reported that a German company invented the minibar in the early 1960s. The first one to become famous was at the Madison Hotel in D.C. Hilton claims to have “popularized” the in-room concept in 1974 in Hong Kong.

The heyday that followed for minibars is largely over. Large hotel chains have been scaling down their use for several years. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that Hyatt Hotels & Resorts was removing stocked minibars from some convention hotels and Hilton and Omni were making similar moves.

Popular new brands emphasize a communal atmosphere with wine hour in the lobby or a market near the front desk. Delivery services also make it easier to order a meal to the door — even if room service isn’t available.

“Are minibars still necessary if you can order things to be delivered to you whether it’s at 8 a.m. 2 p.m. or 2 a.m.?” said Henry Harteveldt travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group.

But some hotels have held on — and even tried to reinvent the amenity.

I am 32 years old and still deeply terrified that consuming anything from the hotel room minibar will bankrupt my entire family somehow — Mountain Lion In My Backyard 🦁🌇 (MLIMBY) (@ArmandDoma) August 21 2021

Buckley who once avoided minibars at all costs is now invested in their success as vice president of food and beverage for Atelier Ace the company behind the small boutique chain Ace Hotel. The company seeks out local partners to build its minibar program with a focus on diversity and inclusion — while also stocking choices that will appeal to the masses.

“That’s our goal right now to really work with that diversity and really work with interesting vendors that are putting out amazing products and small businesses that don’t have the opportunity to penetrate these bigger markets” she said.

At one of the company’s newest properties the Ace Hotel Brooklyn that means the kombucha gummy bears and whiskey are from borough-based companies whose owners are women people of color or members of other underrepresented groups.

“It gives people the opportunity to shop local but also learn about the community that they’re traveling in” Buckley said.

The top seller is water she said — Ace partners with boxed water brand Just Water co-founded by actor Jaden Smith — and gummy bears granola and power bars are also popular. While Buckley said the company will include a small amount of well-known items such as M&Ms about 80 percent of the minibar stock is locally sourced.

Quirky boutique hotels may have their own approach. But many luxury properties and casino resorts have also held on to the minibar. That’s where Bruno Agrario vice president of sales and marketing for Bartech Systems International gets the bulk of his business.

The family-owned company supplies automated minibars and trays to 1300 hotels around the world with this selling point: Technology keeps track of everything so the daily labor demand is significantly lower than a traditional minibar that requires someone to check each room regularly.

“Our minibar system is fighting all the negative aspects of traditional minibars” Agrario said. “In other words we fully understand why minibars are usually hated (by guests and hoteliers).”

Agrario said water is the top seller; cashews beer white wine Kettle Brand chips Pringles and chocolate almonds also do well. Diet Coke is the top-selling soda. He touts a “familiar is best” approach and he encourages customers to avoid specialized local products because he argues the heart wants what it already knows and craves — not something new.

A hotel minibar allows you to see into the future and find out what a can of Coke will cost in 2030. — Madhu (@arian_earthling) June 13 2019

“You don’t know those local items” he said. “A minibar is all about impulse purchase; you see the item you consume. If you don’t know the item you are not likely to use as much.”

MGM Resorts which has minibars in its luxury Las Vegas properties said in a statement that hotels “always keep the favorites in stock” — including vodka tequila beer chips nuts and candy bars.

“We evaluate and review all feedback provided on a regular basis and then use that information to make decisions based on trends and common themes” the company said. “Additionally we will test new products on a floor or two within one of our properties to get real-time feedback so we can use that data to make sound choices on products we will carry in the future.”

Minibars had a pop culture moment late last year an in episode of the HBO comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Larry David the creator of the show who plays a version of himself wants to curate the offerings for his friend’s hotel but his suggestions — wasabi peas Parmesan crisps figs and the “coup de grace” York Peppermint Patties — fail to impress.

“If you don’t have the vision to know how amazing a wasabi pea would be in a minibar I don’t really want anything to do with you” David grumbles before storming out of the meeting.

(Buckley with Ace Hotel said the fictional David would probably get hired as a minibar curator: “We like that avant-garde approach” she said.)

The pandemic dealt the latest blow to the old amenity and inspired a new round of “so long minibar” predictions. In May 2020 NPR quoted one consultant as saying: “I think the death of the minibar is probably finally here.

Harteveldt said there were practical reasons for hotels to ditch the stocked fridges or trays of non-perishables as the coronavirus spread: Properties needed to limit the presence of workers in guest rooms and get rid of unnecessary contact points.

Buckley and Agrario said they noticed a different trend as the pandemic progressed: After initial restrictions on minibars lifted they saw demand increase.

“Sales are up because a lot of times people don’t feel comfortable going out” Buckley said. “People like to be in their safe space.”

So what’s next for the minibar? Experts say there is plenty of downside — including an ongoing labor shortage and the persistence of covid-19 — but opportunity remains.

Mehmet Erdem an associate professor of hotel operations and technology at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas said innovative and creative approaches could appeal to a new generation of travelers. If hotels could figure out a pricing model that would make the minibar more attractive he said they might keep more people spending money on-site rather than looking elsewhere.

“It can be a win-win for everybody: nice affordable convenience for the guest and it can be one more amenity offered for the hotel room that adds to the competitive edge of a particular brand” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJydXNzZWxzdGltZXMuY29tLzIwNDgyMy9naWFudC1lZC1zaGVlcmFuLW11cmFsLXJlbW92ZWQtYXMtYnJ1c3NlbHMtbWFrZXMtd2F5LWZvci1iZWxnaXVtcy1sYXJnZXN0LWhvdGVs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giant Ed Sheeran mural removed as Brussels greenlights Belgium's largest hotel,"The giant art installation has been removed following an approval of planning permission to build Belgium's largest hotel.

A giant Ed Sheeran mural that dominated the Brussels city streetscape has been painted over just as hotel chiefs secured planning permission to build Belgium's biggest hospitality venue.

The gargantuan wall painting by Flemish street artist Eres_125 adorning the key commercial intersection at Place Rogier between Brussels' main shopping artery of Rue Neuve and its Gare du Nord rail hub was commissioned to advertise the English singer-songwriter's summer 2022 tour dates.

But painters have now removed the mural upon receipt of planning permission from City Hall to extend the DoubleTree by Hilton Brussels City Hotel -- an independently-controlled and operated franchise of Hilton international facing Belgium's federal finance tower at Botanique -- to a 504-bedroom luxury symbol of life after three winters of Covid travel restrictions.

""It is likely that the works might start as early as April or May"" the group's marketing PR boss Thomas Verbaet told The Brussels Times as he proudly showed off the blank canvass awaiting flagship construction work at the heart of the EU capital.

""The contract with the agency that rented our wall for the mural came to an end on December 31st and we agreed to extend it for a month"" he added.

Authorities said Evans would carry small expensive items out of the store under her uniform without permission and ""..took photographs of the stolen items with her cellphone and shared these photographs with him through messaging.""

She would then receive a total of $750 from Bobadilla for the stolen goods which he would take to another Home Depot store and return the merchandise for store credit.

Evans reportedly admitted her role but told investigators ""The thefts were Bobadilla's idea and he instructed her on what merchandise to steal.""

LEVITTOWN Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- A businessman from Florida has lost his dog in the Levittown area and is asking for the community to keep an eye out for her.

Paul Singh from Daytona Beach stopped in at the Home Depot at the Levittown Center off Route 13 almost two weeks ago.

His dog Fido went missing after jumping out of the window Singh left slightly open while he ran into Home Depot.

""The gentleman that was pushing the carts around I said 'Hey have you seen a dog by any chance? Because I saw the window down a little bit.' He said 'Yeah there was a dog out here and some people started chasing the dog'"" said Singh.

But he's holding onto hope after a possible sighting Saturday.

""We may have had a sighting today. We're not sure trying to confirm it"" said Singh.

He says when it first happened he frantically searched for Fido but had no luck.

""I found another group of people that told me that they also tried to chase her. So it became an event here of people chasing this poor little six-pound dog"" said Singh.

He says since he's done everything he knows to try and find her including posting more than 2000 signs. He vows he won't go home until he does.

""We continue the foot searches and going into the woods in different areas. I have very specialized infrared nighttime cameras out here running through the canals and through woods"" said Singh.

For him like so many Fido is more than just a pet. She's family to him and goes with him on all of his business journeys.

""She's my bestie. I took responsibility for her when I saved her from going to the pound and I still owe that responsibility to her"" said Singh. ""I'm not leaving here until I find Fido.""

He knows it's been a while since she went missing and realizes he needs a miracle.

""For having so few sightings it's very indicative that she may have made it into some shelter. There may be somebody that doesn't know who she belongs to"" Singh said.

He's also left his rental car in parking at the Home Depot with hopes Fido might come back to the spot and wait near the car.

He's also offering a $2500 reward for whoever helps find her.

If you do you can contact Singh. His number is (305) 842-1217.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvcmV2aWV3ZWQvMjAyMi8wMi8wNS9hcHBsaWFuY2UtZGVhbHMtc2hvcC1wcmVzaWRlbnRzLWRheS1zYWxlcy1iZXN0LWJ1eS1hbmQtc2Ftc3VuZy82Njc0OTQyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snag the best early Presidents' Day appliance sales at The Home Depot Best Buy Lowe's and Samsung,"— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Best leadership advice:

Act with purpose. Earlier in my career I was unintentional in determining my next career steps. Oftentimes I would get “tapped” to solve a problem and because of where I was in my career I didn’t think I had the right to say no and I saw my career span across many different functions.

One of my former bosses pulled me to the side and asked me what I wanted to do next and for so long I had allowed the “tap” to guide me. At that point I realized I really didn’t know. This is when he gave me some advice that changed my career. He said to be intentional about what you want to do next and control the moves that take you there. From that point on I continued to be “tapped” but I regularly passed on opportunities that I felt did not lead to my ultimate goal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDE2NDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Glenn Theodore Svensk,"Svensk Glenn Theodore Age 98 of NE Mpls.

Beginning next year U.S. Army vehicle crewmen will begin receiving improved helmets that should provide better protection and comfort. Last month the U.S. Army awarded ArmorSource LLC. a Hebron Ohio-based ballistic helmet manufacturer a $6 million contract to supply 14000 Advanced Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmets (ACVC-H).

ArmorSource will provide the U.S. Army with a modernized version of the crewman helmet based on its next generation ballistic solutions that utilize some of the most advanced Honeywell ballistic composite materials available. The first deliveries of the new ACVC GEN II model are expected to be delivered to the military in early 2023.

""It is a huge honor to be selected by the U.S. Army to supply our troops with such an innovative product"" says Brad Grunden president of ArmorSource.

""We are extremely excited for all of the men and women who will soon be equipped with the most advanced combat vehicle crewman helmet technology available in the industry"" added Gunden. ""ArmorSource's ACVC GEN II helmet exceeds the ballistic and fragmentation performance of the legacy ACVC but at a much lighter weight. We believe this product sets a new standard of safety and comfort for these users.""

Improved Brain Bucket for Tankers

The Advanced Combat Vehicle Crewman's Helmet (ACVCH) program began in the late 2000s as a development effort to improve upon the Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet (CVC-H) – the primary head protection system for the mounted soldier – that had first been introduced in the 1970s.

The CVC-H consisted of a hard ballistic helmet shell integral communication system and inner helmet assembly. It was found that the CVC-H Shell provided only limited ballistic protection when compared against infantry-based platforms such as the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH).

The ACVC-H was developed to provide improved ballistic protection over the previous CVC-H system but at a lighter weight without affecting form fit and function.

The United States Marine Corps had initiated a similar program in January 1992 and extensive concept evaluations were conducted on early prototypes developed and built by the USA Natick RD&E Center. The evaluations took place at Aberdeen Proving Ground Ft. Rucker the National Training Center and Ft. Knox. The evaluation results were highly favorable.

The ACVC-H

The Army's current Advanced Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet (ACVC-H) mission is to provide integrated communication and ballistic protection to the mounted Soldier’s head temples ears and neck without degrading vision stability and hearing.

As with the previous versions it consists of an outer shell inner liner and communications system. However the ACVC-H provides 9mm protection and fragmentation protection to mounted personnel along with communication and noise attenuation capabilities. The ACVC-H shell attaches to a fabric mesh inner liner and communication system by snap fasteners and hook and-pile tape. Fastener mounts on the front of the helmet attach the shell to the chin strap.

The ACVC GEN II helmet will continue to improve upon the design and it exceeds the ballistic and fragmentation performance of the past versions. It provides ballistic protection in accordance with the AR/PD 12-03 Standard with a 30 percent weight reduction.

The ACVC GEN II was one of ArmorSource's next generation helmet solutions formally introduced to the public at last month's Shooting Hunting Outdoor Trade Show (SHOT Show). In addition to the ACVC GEN II ArmorSource will also present its ACH GEN II 'AS-501-G2' a next generation military helmet and the 'AIRE LE' a next generation law enforcement helmet.

A po­lice of­fi­cer who was de­clared to have aban­doned or re­signed his job af­ter he re­turned from sus­pen­sion and was not re-is­sued an of­fi­cial uni­form for over three years has won his law­suit against the Of­fice of the Com­mis­sion­er of Po­lice.

De­liv­er­ing a 19-page writ­ten judg­ment yes­ter­day High Court Judge Eleanor Don­ald­son-Hon­ey­well up­held PC Gopaul Ra­goo­nanan’s ju­di­cial re­view law­suit in which he was al­leg­ing that the com­mis­sion­er’s of­fice act­ed un­fair­ly and un­rea­son­ably in tak­ing the de­ci­sion with­out con­sid­er­ing the rel­e­vant cir­cum­stances.

Ac­cord­ing to the ev­i­dence in the case Ra­goo­nanan was sus­pend­ed for an al­leged as­sault in March 2009 and was or­dered to re­turn his kit in ac­cor­dance with the TTPS stand­ing or­ders.

Ra­goo­nanan’s kit in­clud­ed po­lice uni­forms and boots a bul­let proof vest TTPS shoul­der ti­tles and a TTPS iden­ti­fi­ca­tion card.

The case against Ra­goo­nanan was dis­missed in Ju­ly 2013 but the sus­pen­sion was on­ly lift­ed in Au­gust 2016.

Ra­goo­nanan did not im­me­di­ate­ly re­sume du­ty as he was in­struct­ed to pro­ceed on two years out­stand­ing leave.

While on leave Ra­goo­nanan made sev­er­al un­suc­cess­ful at­tempts to col­lect his kit in prepa­ra­tion for his even­tu­al re­turn to du­ty.

When his leave end­ed Ra­goo­nanan who was still with­out his kit at­tend­ed the San Juan and San­ta Cruz Po­lice Sta­tions dai­ly but could not per­form his du­ties.

In Oc­to­ber 2018 Ra­goo­nanan made en­quiries and was told that of­fi­cial records showed that he had not re­turned the kit when he was sus­pend­ed al­most a decade ear­li­er.

Ra­goo­nanan sent sev­er­al text mes­sages to for­mer po­lice com­mis­sion­er Gary Grif­fith over the is­sue be­fore he stopped re­port­ing for du­ty.

In March 2019 a de­part­men­tal or­der was is­sued in­di­cat­ing that the kit had to be re-is­sued how­ev­er Ra­goo­nanan did not re­ceive the cor­re­spon­dence un­til two months lat­er.

Sev­en weeks lat­er Ra­goo­nanan was told that he had to sub­mit a re­port on his ab­sence be­fore be­ing re-is­sued his kit.

In Ju­ly 2019 he was is­sued a de­part­men­tal or­der in­di­cat­ing that he had aban­doned his job.

Sev­er­al weeks lat­er he re­ceived a sec­ond let­ter which spoke about an in­ten­tion to de­clare that he had re­signed by his ac­tions of be­ing ab­sent from du­ty with­out leave or rea­son­able ex­cuse.

Ra­goo­nanan through his at­tor­neys made rep­re­sen­ta­tions on the is­sue but the de­ci­sion re­mained the same with the com­mis­sion­er’s of­fice in­di­cat­ing that he should re­turn the kit which was in fact nev­er re-is­sued.

In the judg­mentDon­ald­son-Hon­ey­well ruled that the com­mis­sion­er’s of­fice con­flat­ed dif­fer­ent ter­mi­na­tion cir­cum­stances to Ra­goo­nanan’s ac­tion name­ly res­ig­na­tion and aban­don­ment.

She ruled that the on­ly ill-ad­vised de­ci­sion Ra­goo­nanan took was to stop re­port­ing for du­ty with­out of­fi­cial­ly in­form­ing the TTPS of the rea­sons.

“If any­thing a more rea­son­able ac­tion to be tak­en against the claimant by the de­fen­dant would be to have con­sid­ered the fail­ure to pre­pare a re­port on his ab­sence as a dis­ci­pli­nary mat­ter” Don­ald­son-Hon­ey­well said.

She ruled that the com­mis­sion­er’s of­fice failed to take in­to ac­count Ra­goo­nanan’s lack of kit his re­peat­ed re­quests and his ex­pla­na­tion for ab­sence.

“In all the cir­cum­stances there was no ra­tio­nale or fair ba­sis for the de­fen­dant’s de­ci­sion” she said.

Be­sides is­su­ing a de­c­la­ra­tion against the de­ci­sion Don­ald­son-Hon­ey­well al­so quashed it and di­rect­ed that it be re­con­sid­ered.

The TTPS was al­so or­dered to pay Ra­goo­nanan’s le­gal costs for pur­su­ing the law­suit.

Ra­goo­nanan was rep­re­sent­ed by Janet Pe­ters and Ra­jiv Rick­hi while Tson­da Gayle and Amy-Marie Castagne rep­re­sent­ed the com­mis­sion­er’s of­fice.",,,

About $0.62 a few ingredients and an emotional connection to the signature blue box that Kraft has cultivated for decades.

Inflation is expected to test many consumers' allegiance to brands that charge more for a similar product. This could give store brands — sometimes called ""generic"" or ""private label"" — their best opportunity in years to take market share away from name brands.

For most of the pandemic many U.S. shoppers had extra savings due to stimulus cash and reduced spending on vacations and dining out. With some financial cushion they largely stuck with name brands — but the tide is starting to turn.

""I think there's going to be a correction"" said Darren Seifer a food and beverage analyst for the NPD Group. ""You've got to eat and that's a big reason we're always watching our food expenditures; it's not something you can put off.""

As student loan payments return and higher costs for everything eat up that extra cash it's likely more consumers will shift their habits. ""That's when consumers start getting squeezed again this year"" Seifer said.

Shoppers told IRI in a survey this past fall that they look at taste then price when deciding what to buy but inflation may cause those priorities to switch.

The cost of food nationally rose 6.5% last year a result of high demand supply chain backlogs and companies raising prices to maintain profit margins. Yet store brands paradoxically lost market share during the pandemic.

""Current inflation and economic uncertainty would indicate that growth of private brands should be outpacing that of name brand products but that's not the case"" according to a December report from IRI a Chicago-based market research firm.

It's typically up to retailers to market their in-house products which usually happens through advertising inserts or in-store promotions and placement.

""Our eating habits are just that — habits"" Seifer said. ""When it comes to what we know and love and have been eating for a long time it's going to take a lot of effort to change that.""

University of Minnesota marketing professor Joe Redden routinely has students compare brand name and private label products in a classroom experiment to see if they can identify which is which and which they prefer.

""You can see a dramatic difference across categories"" he said about whether students can tell the difference between major brands and generics in a blind taste test. ""Brand name cereal is the one that wins all the time.""

There are signs that more shoppers are starting to put less expensive cereal in their carts said TD Dixon chief growth officer at Lakeville-based Post Consumer Brands.

""At the end of the day taste will always reign supreme when it comes to purchase decisions"" he said ""but now there are many 'value' options that offer the same high-quality taste as premium brands so it's making that consumer decision a lot easier.""

Europe's private-label market is more developed than the United States. Private brands account for 31% of all consumer packaged goods sales in Europe compared to just 18% in the U.S. according to IRI.

During the pandemic when name brands are in short supply UNFI which owns Cub Foods as well as several well-known private label brands has been filling empty shelves with its store brands instead.

""We've also seen traction with a new save-everyday pricing program for our value items that are positioned to be attractive affordable alternatives to national brands"" Chris Testa UNFI president said in December.

Even as inflation and supply chain problems provide a lucrative opening for store brands big private label producers like Illinois-based TreeHouse Foods have not been immune to shortages and price hikes.

""While we expect demand for our products to continue there will certainly be some limits on how much of that demand we will be able to service"" TreeHouse chief executive Steven Oakland told investors in the fall.

Consumers are highly unlikely to find a store brand to be superior to be a name brand according to IRI surveys but in some categories — salad dressing and salty snacks — shoppers see a high level of similarities which means a purchase decision could come down solely to price.

That's one reason Hormel Foods sees store brands as a primary competitor for Planters.

""Acting as a big leader in the category ... we need to differentiate versus private label by bringing quality snack offerings"" Planters marketing head Rafik Lawendy said in an interview last month.

Private label brands explained

What are store brands/private label?

A store brand or private label product is the in-house alternative to a name brand — think Costco's Kirkland Signature brand Target's Good & Gather Walmart's Great Value and nearly everything sold by Aldi and Trader Joe's. While long seen as ""knockoff"" products retailers have increasingly looked to innovate and build brand loyalty for these high-margin items.

Why are store brands less expensive?

The price of any product reflects the cost of making it moving it and selling it at a profit — and any discounts and promotions used to sell more product even at a lower profit margin. Name brands typically go through extensive research and development and launch national multi-million-dollar advertising campaigns. Store brands often have fewer marketing and R&D expenses and operate nearly ""direct to consumer"" said Darren Seifer at NPD Group.

""It's up to the retailer to market their private-label store brands"" said TD Dixon chief growth officer at Post Consumer Brands. ""When it comes to selling these products retailers know their customers well and tailor their selections to best meet their needs by market and even by store.""

Do major food manufacturers make the store brands they compete with?

Yes and no. Seifer said that ""in many cases there are major manufacturers making it"" but many food producers rely on co-packers — third-party manufacturing facilities — to process and package their products. These co-packers often produce both name-brand and private label like Seneca Foods canning Green Giant as well as store brand peas.

In some cases name brands and store brand operations fall under a corporate umbrella. Last year the parent company of Lakeville-based Post Consumer Brands bought the private label cereal business of TreeHouse Foods for $85 million giving the country's third-largest cereal producer a larger presence on store shelves.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

The following are the results for transient group and contract business in comparison to 2023 performance for the Company's current portfolio:

Under U.S. GAAP costs to develop units for resale are considered an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and categorized as inventory. This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

_______________

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTE1Mzc0NTIwL2hvc3QtaG90ZWxzLWJ1eXMtMS1ob3RlbC1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW1iYXNzeS1zdWl0ZXMtZm9yLTUzMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhc2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Buys 1 Hotel Nashville Embassy Suites for $530 Million Cash,"Host Hotels & Resorts bought the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million in an all-cash deal.

The Bethesda Maryland-based hotel real estate investment trust said in a news release that the price represents a 12.6-times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or a capitalization rate of approximately 7.4% on the property's estimated 2024 results.

The sellers of the properties were Starwood Capital Group Crescent Real Estate and High Street Real Estate Partners.

1 Hotels is a brand under SH Hotels & Resorts which is the operator of the 1 Hotel Nashville. Starwood Capital owns SH Hotels & Resorts. Davidson Hospitality Group operates the Embassy Suites property.

Host Hotels expects the hotel will be among its top 25 properties based on estimated full-year results. It has an expected combined revenue per available room of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $58550.

Host President and CEO James Risoleo said in the release REIT executives are excited to add both properties to the portfolio. The property built in 2022 has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had a RevPAR compound annual growth rate of 7.7% from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply.

Risoleo also cited the popularity of Nashville as a leisure destination and its No. 2 ranking as a convention destination in the U.S.

""With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the property will generate outsize growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders"" he said.

Together the two hotels have a combined key count of 721 rooms with average size of approximately 500 square feet with a 75% suite mix.

So people often go for printers that aren’t too expensive and can deliver reasonably good performance without the hassle of changing cartridges too often. The HP DeskJet Ink Advantage Ultra 4826 is one such printer. Priced at Rs. 10279 the printer comes with two full cartridge sets that can print up to 2600 mono pages and about 1400 colour pages.This is a rather no-nonsense printer that does the job effectively and efficiently. You can print plain paper photo paper even brochure paper with this printer. It looks like most printers and doesn’t take too much space. It has seven buttons including power resume colour copy and cancel job. An array of LED indicator lights also adorns the top of the printer. For a printer speed matters as you don’t want to endlessly wait for a page to come out.This wireless printer can print about seven black and white pages in a minute and about five colour pages which is reasonably good. Like many printers it also offers scanning functionality which does the job effectively. There’s the HP Smart companion app that can be used on laptops and smartphones to print and share files. It offers Wi-Fi connectivity though we did find that to be a hit and miss as quite often it got disconnected.The printer is compatible with Windows mac OS and Chrome OS . You can get this printer on ecommerce sites for less than Rs 10000 and it will be a good deal. The HP DeskJet Ink Advantage Ultra 4826 is a multifunction printer that is suitable for most homes and small offices as well. The cost of printing is relatively low and the cartridges that come bundled should last for quite some time and you wouldn’t have to worry about changing them.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydGlmaWNpYWxsYXd5ZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDUvbWlrZS1seW5jaC1zdGVwcy1kb3duLWZyb20tbHVtaW5hbmNlLWJvYXJkLXRvLWZpZ2h0LXVzLWV4dHJhZGl0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mike Lynch Steps Down From Luminance Board To Fight US Extradition,"Mike Lynch the founder of Luminance has stepped down from the Board of the legal AI company so that he can focus ‘on fighting his appeals and clearing his name’ in the ongoing extradition battle with America.

Artificial Lawyer asked the company on Friday evening about why the company Lynch had founded and then incubated inside Slaughter and May had issued a formal notice that his directorship of Luminance Technologies Limited had been terminated as of 4th February.

A spokesperson confirmed the departure and added: ‘We can confirm that Mike Lynch offered to step down from the Board whilst he focuses on fighting his appeals and clearing his name. Dr Lynch has been an invaluable advisor to Luminance and we thank him for his contribution. We are pleased to have another Invoke Partner Charlotte Golunski join the Board of Directors and welcome Invoke’s continued support for the business.’

Invoke is the investment fund Lynch helped to form following the sale of his earlier company Autonomy to HP back in 2011. And it was this sale that has been at the root of his legal problems. As is well documented now HP was not happy to put it mildly after buying the UK company and legal proceedings have dogged Lynch ever since.

Source: Companies House (UK) 4 Feb 2022.

At the end of last month the UK’s Home Secretary ruled that Lynch could be extradited to the US to face accusations of fraud there. However he intends to fight the extradition.

At the time of the UK announcement Chris Morvillo of Clifford Chance a lawyer for Lynch said: ‘Dr Lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the US and will continue to fight to establish his innocence. He is a British citizen who ran a British company in Britain subject to British laws and rules and that is where the matter should be resolved. This is not the end of the battle — far from it. Dr Lynch will now file an appeal to the High Court in London.’

While Lynch has never formally been the CEO of Luminance since it launched under the leadership of Emily Foges back in September 2016 it would be a massive underestimation not to appreciate how influential he has been for the company.

And being realistic even after stepping down as a Director his influence will remain substantial given that Invoke has funded Luminance since the beginning.

In other news related to Luminance Companies House data shows that its most recent CEO Eleanor Weaver who joined in early 2021 after working at another Lynch company DarkTrace was granted 20225 ‘Growth Shares’ in Luminance Technologies. These shares were granted in Dec 2021 and are not the usual Ordinary Shares that its main shareholders own.

Source: Companies House Dec 2021.

Artificial Lawyer asked the company about why they had granted these new shares but it did not comment on this point.

Interestingly the Growth shares come with the following conditions: that they grant no voting powers and that ‘in the event of a winding-up the growth shares entitle the holder to participate in the excess of a hurdle amount set for the shares at the time of issue’.

What Next?

One last point is whether the departure from the Board by Lynch will be the precursor for a sale process of Luminance? I.e. that a buyer would perhaps understandably not want to enter into talks with a target that had a key Board member facing serious charges in the US. But now that pathway could be open.

Artificial Lawyer specifically asked Luminance about this point but they also chose not to respond to it.

Will Lynch’s departure from the Board make it more likely that Luminance will be sold? It’s hard to say but it would be a bit less complicated. That said Invoke is clearly very closely connected to Luminance still and even the new board position as noted above is being taken by someone from Invoke…..and Lynch remains listed as the founder of the fund.

However regardless of Lynch’s position or what happens with the extradition battle Luminance could do with some form of a boost whether that is a takeover by a much larger entity or a new funding round to power it forwards.

The company made just £2.78m ($3.69m) revenues globally in 2020 with losses of £4.4m ($5.84m). Its average revenue per client based on 250 clients in December 2020 was £11112 ($14753) – which is lower than in 2019 the company’s latest accounts show.

According to CarNewsChina Dongfeng will equip the body-on-frame off-roader with electric motors with 800 kW (1070 horsepower) and a 140 kWh battery pack that should grant the vehicle a maximum range of 500 km (most likely calculated on the optimistic NEDC test cycle). The source says the manufacturer is targeting an electricity consumption figure of 26 kWh/100 km (2.39 miles/kWh).

Apparently the vehicle will be able to accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than 5 seconds and also weigh less than the diesel-burning version. This is a bit hard to believe but the source claims the EV will weigh around 3.1 tons while the diesel weighs 3480 kg - we’ll have to wait and see if this is confirmed when the vehicle is officially shown and if it’s so it would be a first (an EV lighter than an ICE version of the same vehicle).

It will be assembled in a new factory that’s currently under construction specifically designed to build more rugged vehicles and it will even include its own off-road test track and proving grounds. In terms of price the electric Warrior should be quite a bit cheaper than comparable electric trucks sold in the United States.

It is also very unlikely that this vehicle will be sold anywhere outside China especially since the local market has shown a lot of interest in buying the diesel version so the EV should prove quite popular. Maybe we could see one come to the US as a grey market import - it might be surprisingly good given the fact that the vehicle retains the original Hummer's off-road credentials especially its amazing approach and departure angles.

The area under floriculture has witnessed a 47% decrease in the last five years.

Flowers were grown on 710 hectares in 2015-16 but the area has now reduced to 373 hectares. Before the pandemic flowers grew on 705.77 hectares in 2018-19. Cut-flower growers across six districts of Sirmaur Chamba Mandi Kangra Solan and Shimla have suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic and have now begun to diversify to vegetable growing.

“Flower cultivation is no more profitable” said Ram Gopal Thakur a cut-flower grower and president of Flower and Vegetable Growers’ Cooperative Society. Ram Gopal who’s been in flower cultivation for the last six years has now shifted to bell pepper growing. “I used to grow flowers particularly lilies on 3000 square metres of land but this year I am growing them on 1000 square metres. On the remaining land I have cultivated bell peppers” he added. A stick of lily is sold between ₹30 and ₹60 in the wholesale market while the price ranges from ₹100 to ₹200 in the retail market.

Flower cultivation around Shimla had been gaining ground for the last decade but farmers are now preferring crops to break even the losses suffered in the last two years. Chrysanthemum carnation gladiolus rose gerbera and lilies are grown in villages close to the town’s airport at Jubbarhatti. “In last two years we have been bearing losses. The government only gave us marginal compensation for one year” said Khemraj Thakur of Khairi village while claiming that as they were unable to transport flowers last year they had to feed them to domestic animals.

Demand for flowers is relatively low after Covid outbreak in Shimla. “Flowers bring happiness but the environment is gloomy. The pandemic has reduced my sales by 60%” said Amit Sood a flower retailer in Shimla’s Lower Bazaar. Sood said he used to earn ₹1.5 lakh per month by selling flowers before the pandemic.

Florists are facing hardships in Chamba’s Churah valley as well which is known for its exotic flowers. Most of the residents in the backward valley in Chamba are agriculturists. Before Independence the region was known for producing high-quality honey grains and milk. In later years it slipped into backwardness and poverty due to neglect lack of road connectivity malnutrition and illiteracy.

Churah Valley Vegetable and Agriculturists’ Cooperative Society was started with 20 farmers in 1995-96 bringing a floral revolution. Nearly 400 farmers grew flowers. But the number of florists is gradually dwindling. “There are lots of the problems being faced by the farmers in the region. We lost nearly ₹25 lakh in flower growing in last two years. I used to grow flowers on five bighas which has now been reduced to one bigha. Transportation and low demand in the market has hit the flower business hard” said OP Sharma a retired customs official and a progressive farmer.

With limited transport facilities farmers transported their produce in HRTC buses to Delhi’s Ghazipur market. “As public transport had come to an abrupt halt during the Covid-induced lockdown farmers faced difficulty in transportation and gradually started losing interest in flower growing” rued Jiya Lal another farmer from Churah.

A flower grower from Mandi Bobby Kumar said he suffered losses as the demand was nil in the market due to the lockdown in 2020. “The situation hasn’t improved much since then. We sell our produce in Delhi markets but for two years now the business is running into losses. I am considering switching to other cash crops” he added.

No takers for Pushp Kranti scheme

In 2018 Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur-led government had launched ambitious Pushp Kranti scheme to revolutionise flower growing. The state government drew an ₹150-crore five-year plan to boost floriculture in the state. Various incentives are being provided to progressive farmers to encourage them to adopt this lucrative cash crop venture. The main objective of the scheme is to encourage farmers to adopt commercial cultivation of flowers and ornamental crops under the protected environment with a view to make Himachal a pioneer state in floriculture in near future.

The government aimed to generate employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labour. The department of horticulture laid stress on encouraging greenhouse techniques and providing post-harvesting facilities particularly marketing on national and international levels so that farmers could get the remunerative price of their produce.

However there are hardly any takers for the scheme. “Covid has hit the floral business hard. The department of horticulture is committed to exploring opportunities of floriculture along with providing better marketing and transport facilities to the flowers. We will also try to place a mechanism to compensate floriculturists for losses due to natural calamities” said Sudesh Kumar Mokta director horticulture.

The department has already set up six nurseries in Navbahar and Chharabra of Shimla Parwanoo in Solan Bajaura in Kullu and Dharamshala and Bhatoon in Kangra.

Two model floriculture centres – one at Chail in Solan and one at Palampur in Kangra – with tissue culture labs for quality planting material have also been established.

Currently marigold gladiolus carnation rose lily gerbera and seasonal flowers are being cultivated in the state and there is a potential to grow exotic flowers such as alstroemeria limonium iris tulips and orchids."

IBM (IBM 1.75%) is saying farewell to Watson Health. The tech giant plans to sell the healthcare-focused artificial intelligence (AI) business to a private equity firm. In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on Jan. 26 Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli talk about what's next for healthcare AI after IBM's move.

10 stocks we like better than IBM

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and IBM wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Keith Speights: Brian a company I don't know that you and I have talked about at all since we've been doing this together for probably going on at well over a year now. But IBM of course a technology giant but IBM has been involved quite a bit in healthcare in recent years.

A few years ago the company seemed to be on to something really big with its Watson Health artificial intelligence system. But IBM is throwing in the towel. It plans to sell Watson Health to a private equity firm for a reported $1 billion dollars.

First of all why is IBM making this move? Secondly what do you think is next for healthcare artificial intelligence after this disappointment?

Brian Orelli: Yeah I feel like Watson was a party trick of healthcare two Jeopardy contestants but I'm not sure speed is the most important improvement of healthcare outcomes. IBM seems to be selling off Watson because it's just not useful for improving healthcare outcomes. That's what people actually care about not how quickly can I come up with an answer.

In the immediate future the benefit of AI I think is likely to be at the molecular level so there's companies using AI to find drugs for drug development and I think and then once a drug target is identified AI can be used to develop drugs that can inhibit that target and so I think those are probably the two biggest uses for AI right now.

Speights: I think you're probably right. I will admit though Brian that when IBM first rolled out Watson and said they were going to apply their AI technology to healthcare. I thought there could be a lot of opportunity here because there's so much change going on in the medical world and how physicians stay abreast of all the changes in new research is just staggering how much new information comes out every week every month.

I thought hey AI might be great for being able to process all of that and help come back with really solid recommendations. I guess Watson Health has had some successes but it's just not been nearly what everyone had hoped it would be.

Orelli: Yeah. I think I agree with you I had high hopes too but I think that it's not been able to come up with information that they actually needed to improve outcomes and that's really what doctors and their patients want.

Speights: I think you're right. AI targeting drug development is really where the action is right now. I would not rule out AI being much more involved in diagnosis down the road. I think there's obviously some wrinkles to iron out here yet.

Orelli: I'm sure that this private equity firm that's spending a billion dollars thinks they can improve it. Presumably [laughs] if you're spending a billion dollars on anything here you're hoping that they can get better.

Speights: Exactly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDYvaWJtLXBhbG10b3AtcnVubmluZy1tb2Rlcm4tbW9kaWZpZWQtbGludXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM PalmTop Running Modern (Modified) Linux,"The handheld computing market might seem dominated by smartphones today but before their mass adoption there were other offerings for those who needed some computing power on-the-go. If a 90s laptop was too bulky there was always the IBM PalmTop which packed punch for its size-to-weight ratio and for the era it was created in. [Mingcong Bai] still has one of these antiques and decided to see if it was still usable by loading a customized Linux distribution on it.

The PalmTop sported modest hardware even for its time with an Intel 486SL running at 33 MHz with 20 MiB of RAM. This one also makes use of a 1 GB CompactFlash card for storage and while [Mingcong Bai] notes that it is possible to run Windows 95 on it it’s not a particularly great user experience. A Linux distribution customized for antique hardware AOSC/Retro helps solve some of these usability issues. With this it’s possible to boot into a command line and even do some limited text-based web browsing as long as the Ethernet adapter is included.

While the computer is running at its maximum capacity just to boot and perform basic system functions it’s admirable that an antique computer such as this still works especially given its small size and limited hardware functionality.

Which One Is The Fastest?,"Source: Getty Images

Supercomputers are essential for modern-day technologies like the internet but what exactly are they? A supercomputer is a high-performance computer (HPC) often used for complicated algorithmic tasks. These tasks can vary from testing mathematical equations to predicting weather and machine learning.

Supercomputers have multiple CPUs to achieve high computational speeds. What sets these systems apart is their use of vector arithmetic. This lets them do various complex tasks simultaneously with high speed and accuracy.

As for operating systems most of these computers run Linux-based OS. All of the world’s fastest 500 supercomputers run on Linux.

What are Supercomputers used for?

Some years ago supercomputers were mainly used for national security nuclear weapons design and cryptography. However it has become cheaper to build a supercomputer with time and many companies use it.

These computers are now used regularly in the aerospace petroleum and automotive industries. They are also used for scientific research mainly involving subatomic particles and the origin and nature of the universe. Online gaming companies also use supercomputers to handle vast amounts of concurrent players.

Types of Supercomputer

There are two main types of supercomputers: general-purpose supercomputers and special-purpose supercomputers. General-purpose supercomputers are divided into vector processing machines tightly connected cluster computers and commodity computers.

Special-purpose supercomputers are known for being good at achieving a particular task. Quantum Supercomputers use photons to store data and perform computations. Due to this these computers can outperform even the fastest supercomputers thanks to this advantage.

Then there are AI supercomputers that use machine learning to carry out more calculations per second using the same hardware.

Fastest Supercomputer

For a list of the world’s fastest supercomputers take a look at Top500.org (an independent organization that publishes the rankings twice a year). Currently the fastest supercomputer is Japan’s Fujitsu Fugaku.

The Fugaku has a performance of 442 petaflops surpassing the combined performance of the following four supercomputers on the TOP500 list. It is based on ARM architecture the same design principle used in smartphone processors.

Meta (formerly Facebook) has also claimed that they are building the world’s fastest AI supercomputer which will be completed before 2022.

The Future

With technological advancements there might come a time when even small-scale businesses and developers can afford a supercomputer. It is already getting cheaper and cheaper to build these high-performance computers so it might not be a long time from now.

Two out of the three accused belong to Odisha while another hails from Maharashtra.

The accused were identified as Abhisekh Mohanty 22 of Ichhapur under Balikuda police limits in Jagatsinghpur Kaliprasad Rath 35 of Sishu Vihar area in Patia under Chandrasekharpur police limits and Abhijit Arun Netake 33 of Wagholi area in Pune district of Maharastra.

Sources claimed that the trio who used to work reportedly in a job consultancy firm in Bangalore city had reportedly collected more than Rs 20 lakh from 70 youths in 2019 and 2020 promising the aspirants to provide them employment in the IBM’s office in Manyata Tech Park in Bangalore.

The accused along with other members of the consultancy firm gave the victims fake job offers with fake logo of IBM and signatures of its human recourses department officials.

However the aspirants were shocked to know that they had been cheated when they went to the IBM office and came to know that all the offer letters and signatures were fake.

Later the IBM authorities lodged a case (5/22) at the Sampigehalli police station in Bangalore city over the issue. The accused have fled to Odisha and have been staying in the city for last two years.

They have started a logistics firm at Chandrasekharpur area. The Bangalore police team Saturday produced the accused before the court that granted them permission to take the accused on a transit remand for further probe.

Nearly 41% of US adults surveyed in 2020 said they didn't feel comfortable visiting their healthcare provider in the months following the pandemic.1 While LeVar Burton does not suffer from a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) unfortunately for the 200000 people living with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) a group of rare chronic and progressive blood cancers not making or keeping a regular doctor appointment could have serious consequences.2

While his mother did not have an MPN LeVar Burton recalled how she did not manage her health properly in her later years motivating him to partner with Incyte on the ""You Have To Go To Know"" campaign. The initiative is meant to encourage those living with MPNs to make and keep their doctor appointments even during the most challenging of times—a global pandemic.

Because MPNs cause the bone marrow to not operate correctly the body can produce too few or too many red or white blood cells or platelets. MPNs include polycythemia vera (PV) myelofibrosis (MF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET); they can affect people at any age but are typically found in older adults.2 Common symptoms are fatigue headaches and dizziness—signs that can be mistaken for aging and are often overlooked.3

Since the symptoms are easy to miss many patients struggle to receive an accurate diagnosis and actively monitoring their disease can be a challenge. For some a headache is just that but for some MPN patients it can be their body signaling that their condition may be progressing.4 That's why regular and proper management is so important.

LeVar has put his creativity and mastery of storytelling to use to spread the word far and wide literally.

LeVar has also had the chance to talk with people living with MPNs and to hear their stories. He was touched by inspiring stories of resilience and hope that show it's possible to manage life with a rare chronic blood cancer. He feels those voices can be just as important as his own in helping to remind others with an MPN to be present and advocate for their care.

""I strongly believe in the power of seeing ourselves through the experiences of others"" said LeVar Burton. ""The personal stories of people with MPNs moved me almost beyond words yet also lifted me up and empowered me to support the MPN community as we continue to navigate this time of uncertainty.""

Kathryn a teacher who lives with an MPN shared her story with LeVar. She explained her health journey its ups and downs and how she learned to never shy away from those important healthcare appointments and communicating how she felt with her doctor and supportive family.

""Though our world was turned a bit upside down I've strived to maintain open communication with my doctor and be my own best advocate by sticking to those important appointments. So I strive to be careful and honest when I am feeling unwell and listen to my body.""

In listening to stories like Kathryn's as well as MPN experts LeVar hopes to highlight lessons learned so that others can establish strong health management plans early on. Some tips that LeVar would like to pass on are:

For a rare and often misunderstood disease like an MPN it's important to connect with others living with MPNs and build a strong support group. Regularly track all signs and symptoms and communicate any change with your MPN expert or healthcare professional. Establish a strong trusting relationship with your MPN expert and care team. Play a vocal active role in your disease management. Ask questions no matter how small they may seem. Finally make and keep your appointments with your doctor. MPNs are a progressive disease. If you miss an appointment you miss a critical opportunity to monitor your MPN.

You have to go to know…because your MPN isn't waiting.

Insulet executive vice-president and chief operating officer Charles Alpuche said the new manufacturing facility to be located in Gelang Patah would produce the company’s Omnipod Insulin Management System involving approximately 400000 sq ft of manufacturing space.

He said the facility is expected to be operational by the middle 2024.

“Insulet plans to hire more than 500 full-time employees once the facility is operating at full capacity. This new Malaysian factory will help support our fast-paced growth robust innovation pipeline and global expansion.

“The facility’s architectural design includes sustainable elements that qualify for Green Building Initiative (GB) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification” he said at the groundbreaking ceremony for the facility today.

The groundbreaking ceremony was officiated by Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi.

Meanwhile Onn Hafiz said at a press conference later that the investment is a milestone for Johor’s development while creating job opportunities for Johoreans.

“We expect more investments to come to Johor in the months ahead according to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority” he said.

Earlier in his speech Onn Hafiz said the state government would be looking at reducing red tapes to attract more investments into Johor.

“Johor Investment Committee (JIC) will ensure the ease of doing business continues to be enjoyed by our business fraternity and Johor continues as a preferred destination for investment and one that offers an enviable quality of life embracing both progress and tradition“ he said. – Bernama",,,,,,,,,,,,

This leak came from the Puget Systems online results browser via Benchleaks a specialist digging up this kind of information. The system's overall score under scrutiny was 1034.5 in the PugetBench for Lightroom Classic 0.93 Lightroom Classic 11.0 suite of tests. Before going on it is essential to say that this particular test doesn't stress the GPU in particular. Still it is interesting to see the results and the system specs filed alongside the benchmark submission.

The system appeared as the ""MSI Summit E16 Flip Evo A12HWT."" The device is likely to be the successor to the MSI Summit E16 Flip which most would not classify as photo processing workstation material (Puget's benchmarks target creative workstations). MSI's Summit Flip series are thin and light 2-in-1s. While modern portables can be highly admirable in what they can do in a restricted power/space envelope they can't compete with other contemporary systems.

PugetBench for Lightroom Classic runs through approximately 40 tests doing various everyday Lightroom tasks like importing multitudes of images building hundreds of preview files and processing all these photos with multiple operations and filters. Reading thus far you can understand the idea that this is an excellent benchmark for weighing up the image processing performance of a workstation particularly one facing hundreds of batch operations. However it is not extremely useful for GPU performance comparisons unless you managed to find systems with identical specs which vary only by the GPU. That needle in a haystack might give you something meaningful in this regard.

We have dutifully checked GPU comparisons through various other PugetBench for Lightroom Classic benchmark results. If you do the same you will see this headlining approximately 1000 score is better than achieved by many systems packing the flagship GeForce RTX 3090 yet can be trounced by designs with GPUs such as the GeForce GTX 1660. For this kind of photo processing activity many tasks lean much more heavily on CPU I/O and storage and good choices here will pay the best dividends.

Summing up the MSI Summit E16 Flip Evo 2022 isn't a photo processing beast but is probably capable enough for non-pros. The other big takeaway is of course that people are now testing these new Intel Arc A370M Graphics packing laptops in all sorts of tasks as the launch date for Intel's laptop-making partners draws nearer.

For less than $4 USD per month you can help support our site while the funds generated allow us to keep doing Linux hardware reviews performance benchmarking maintain our community forums and much more.

The Linux 5.18 kernel this spring is adding support for the Intel Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI also talked about sometimes as the Enhanced Hardware Feedback interface - EHFI).The Intel Hardware Feedback Interface is used for communicating performance and energy efficiency capabilities of individual CPU cores of the system. Linux in turn will use the Intel HFI data for making improved task placement decisions about where to place given work among the available CPU cores/threads.

Intel HFI is important for new Intel Alder Lake processors and forthcoming hybrid processor designs marketed as having ""Thread Director"" so the kernel has the appropriate knowledge for placing important tasks on the CPU cores with the greatest performance potential and placing background tasks and other less important work onto more energy efficient cores.

The Intel Hardware Feedback Interface isn't static (well at least by the design some platforms/firmware may only decide to program it at boot time but the HFI design is that it can dynamically change every ""tens of milliseconds"") but the feedback to the kernel/OS can change ultimately depending upon current thermal conditions and other factors.Intel's Hardware Feedback Interface is what is already supported by Microsoft Windows 11 while now coming to Linux. Back in December I wrote more about this work in Intel HFI Code Revised For Improving Alder Lake's Hybrid Support On Linux . It was back in late 2020 when Intel first began documenting the Enhanced Hardware Feedback Interface . This will also be very important for future Intel processors.The news this weekend is that the Intel HFI Linux kernel code has been merged into linux-pm's linux-next branch. With Linux power management subststem maintainer Rafael Wysocki (and Intel employee) having picked up the intel_hfi driver into the ""-next"" code this basically signals it is ready for appearing in the next kernel cycle that will be Linux 5.18.The Linux 5.18 merge window will formally happen around the end of March once v5.17 releases but Linux 5.18 stable won't be out until late May or so. Unfortunately that puts this Intel HFI driver out of scope for shipping out-of-the-box in the spring Linux distribution releases (aside from the distros that are rolling release or like Fedora who ship major new kernels as stable release updates) but at least should be all baked for the autumn Linux distributions.So look for the Intel HFI code appearing on Linux in the coming months for improving the kernel's scheduler task placement among their latest processors for better performance/efficiency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL25leHQtZ2VuLWludGVsLWFyYy1nYW1pbmctZ3B1LXRvLXV0aWxpemUtbXVsdGktY2hpcGxldC1kZXNpZ24v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbmV4dC1nZW4taW50ZWwtYXJjLWdhbWluZy1ncHUtdG8tdXRpbGl6ZS1tdWx0aS1jaGlwbGV0LWRlc2lnbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next-Gen Intel Arc Gaming GPUs To Utilize Multi-Chiplet Design As Hinted Within Patent,"As we get close to the launch of Intel's first major discrete graphics family the latest patent has revealed that the blue team is also working on its own multi-chiplet GPU design for the next-gen Arc gaming lineup.

Intel's Next-Gen Arc Gaming GPUs To Leverage From MCM Design Hints New Patent

Intel is no stranger to MCM technology in fact their Ponte Vecchio GPU is a full-on Multi-chiplet design though it is being designed and built for the data center segment. However a new patent titled 'Position-Based Rendering Apparatus and Method for Multi-Die/GPU Graphics Processing' which has been discovered by Underfox talks about how several GPUs (MCM) can work together for image rendering.

Patent: Position-based rendering apparatus and method for multi-die/GPU graphics processing - Intel Intel MCM GPUs is coming... More details: https://t.co/GIkfwrXGzV pic.twitter.com/sXGt9nbJ1S — Underfox (@Underfox3) February 3 2022

In the patent Intel proposes a solution to GPU-based graphics rendering by integrating multiple silicon dies into a single cohesive unit (MCM) capable of running a single 3D context in order to address manufacturability salinity and power delivery problems. It is stated that doing this will require solutions for multiple classes of scalability and interconnect challenges in order to deliver the best performance on a single 3D application running multiple GPU dies. Some of the algos that are currently in use to solve these problems include AFR (Alternate Frame Rendering) and SFR (split frame rendering).

The patent specifically talks about integrating tile-based checkerboard rendering which is a very common rendering technique used on current GPUs along with distributed GPU vertex position calculation to enable more efficient scaling on multi-die GPUs. The draw calls are partitioned in the form of puzzles and sent to the individual GPUs on the MCM chip so that they can execute POSH (Position-Only Shaders) to determine the full-frame visibility data for the draws for all dies.

Visibility data then indicate if the given primitive is present on each of the pre-defined set of screen space tiles (checkerboard). When the relevant visibility data is received each GPU die will use it to limit the geometry work only to relevant primitives and perform pixel processing work for all the titles of the checkerboard that it owns. These GPUs work really fast in working on the single-frame.

Overall with such a design the next generation of Intel Arc gaming MCM GPUs can deliver scaled-up performance with more dies being added to the chip without facing the performance limitations of existing multi-die solutions such as AMD XDMA/Crossfire and NVIDIA SLI/NVLINK. Intel states that these solutions are limited in terms of performance and while one should expect a perfect scaling of 200% performance with a 2-way and 400% with a 4-way configuration the actual GPU performance is significantly lower and in most cases non-existent hence why most GPU makers aren't investing in these technologies any more.

2 of 9

This would allow the GPU system to scale more efficiently. Now one would say that the 4-GPU/tile solution that is used as the example is official but that's the design that has been proposed and the final number of GPUs per tile could be vastly different.

2 of 9

As mentioned earlier all GPU makers are investing in multi-GPU technologies with AMD already out with the world's first MCM solution in the form of their Instinct MI200 series NVIDIA releasing Hopper this year with MCM. There are also the gaming consumer parts such as the AMD RDNA 3 lineup which is expected to utilize the same tech when it launches later this year. Intel themselves are working on several tile-based multi-chip CPU & GPU solutions such as their Meteor Lake and Granite Rapids designs and within 1 or 2 gens we could see a proper MCM solution within the Arc gaming graphics lineup.

Sure they don't reveal much but they show that Intel is making steady progress towards their release.

Above is a photo of an Arc GPU given to VideoCardz by an anonymous source. It depicts a combination of design elements from the previous two photographed prototypes: the black shroud seen in May and the black PCB pictured in October.

Four ports can be seen on the left; one HDMI and three DisplayPort. According to a leaked driver update Arc GPUs will be some of the first to support DisplayPort 2.0.

In the video below which may be from the same source that provided VideoCardz with the photographs the GPU is pulled out of a shipping box.

Its small size (for a modern GPU) stands out. It's dual-slot and standard height and width leaving only enough room for two fans. It won't have impressive cooling but it won't need to: with only an 8 + 6 pin PCIe connector it's limited to 225W.

Below is a photo of the GPU's PCB taken from the rear by an anonymous source. It's likely that the final version will have a backplate but it's convenient that this prototype doesn't because we can take a look at its internals.

As rumored there are the traces for eight memory modules around the GPU die. If they're used with 2 GB memory modules they'll provide 16 GB of VRAM.

Intel is evidently distributing their prototypes to partners which suggests that they're nearing the final phases of development. Some commentators believe that Intel can still squeeze the release into Q1 with a mid-March launch but it's equally likely that Intel will need longer to manufacture the cards and finalize the drivers.

In some ways Intel has caught a lucky break with the chip shortage. If AMD and Nvidia weren't raking in record profits by re-releasing old architectures at insane prices then they probably would've released a new generation of GPUs by now and left Intel in the dust. As it is Intel could arrive just in time with an RTX 3070 / Ti competitor that could be in hot demand."

Here are a few items to honor and celebrate the birthday of the 40th US president President Ronald Wilson Reagan (pictured above at an AEI event year unknown).

1. Amazingly in the entire history of the United States there have only been two sitting US presidents who have visited the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while in office: Ronald Reagan in 1985 (pictured above) and George W. Bush in 2007. After his presidency Reagan visited the NYSE again in 1992 with Mikhail Gorbachev to mark the exchange’s bicentennial.

Shortly after Reagan’s death on June 5 2004 the New York Stock Exchange published this tribute to the 40th president of the United States on its website (emphasis added):

On March 28 1985 President Ronald Reagan made his first of two visits to the NYSE to salute the robust American expansion as well as the central role of the New York Stock Exchange as the nerve center of entrepreneurial capitalism (see bottom photo above). President Reagan was the first sitting U.S. president to visit the NYSE. At 9:53 a.m. that morning President Reagan—amid a roaring ovation—addressed the Exchange community from the bell podium. Flanked by his chief of staff Donald T. Regan and NYSE chairman and CEO John J. Phelan President Reagan proclaimed: “We’re bullish on the American Economy. The American economy is like a race horse that’s begun to gallop in front of the field.” Aiming to drive “the bears back into hibernation” he said “that’s our economic program for the next four years—we’re going to turn the bull loose.” Throughout his presidency the President continued to champion the principles and power of free people competing in free markets. During the first year of his Administration in September 1981 Reagan communicated his core beliefs to members of the IMF and the World Bank when he stated: “We who live in free market societies believe that growth prosperity and ultimately human fulfillment are created from the bottom up not the government down. Only when the human spirit is allowed to invent and create only when individuals are given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success – only then can societies remain alive dynamic prosperous progressive and free. “Trust the people. This is the one irrefutable lesson of the entire post-war period contradicting the notion that rigid government controls are essential to economic development. The societies that have achieved the most spectacular broad-based progress are neither the most tightly controlled nor the biggest in size nor the wealthiest in natural resources. No what unites them all is their willingness to believe in the magic of the marketplace. “Everyday life confirms the fundamentally human and democratic ideal that individual effort deserves economic reward. Nothing is more crushing to the spirit of working people and to the vision of development itself than the absence of reward for honest toil and legitimate risk. So let me speak plainly: We cannot have prosperity and successful development without economic freedom; nor can we preserve our personal and political freedoms without economic freedom. Governments that set out to regiment their people with the stated objective of providing security and liberty have ended up losing both. Those which put freedom as the first priority find they have also provided security and economic progress.”

Comment: As I recommended in a 2016 CD post shortly after Trump was elected president it would be a powerful symbol of his support of our country’s market-based economy and its “nerve center of entrepreneurial capitalism” on Wall Street if he were to visit the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as soon as possible. Trump never visited the NYSE during his tenure. Now I’ll recommend that President Biden schedule a visit to the NYSE especially because he referred to himself as a “capitalist” multiple times last fall but I am confident that is nowhere on Team Biden’s radar.

2. Maybe more than any US president Ronald Reagan had a wonderful sense of humor and he demonstrated his keen wit in many of his public speeches. You can see many great examples of Reagan’s humor in the video below titled “The Best of Reagan.”

3. Perhaps one of President Reagan’s most famous and influential speeches was his “Berlin Wall speech” at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin Germany on June 12 1987. It was in this speech (at about 12:00 in the video below) that Reagan made his famous and history-changing demand “Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall!” That statement and speech helped changed the course of history and there’s even an entire Wikipedia entry for “Tear Down This Wall.”

According to the Wikipedia entry “The speech was also a source of considerable controversy within the Reagan administration itself with several senior staffers and aides advising against the phrase saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters including Peter Robinson thought otherwise.” Here’s the full passage of what preceded Reagan’s famous line:

We welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace. There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev tear down this Wall!

4. Less than two years after Reagan’s Berlin Wall speech the Berlin wall did fall unexpectedly on November 9 1989 in what Peter Jennings in this news report describes as “perhaps the most important announcement made in Central Europe since the end of World War II certainly since the wall went up in 1961.”

Bottom Line: Happy 111th Birthday President Ronald Reagan!

Over the years I’ve featured Reagan frequently on CD e.g. see posts here here here here here and here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the International Labor Organisation (ILO) standards. The PRI’s 2020 report Why and how investors should act on human rights clarifies how the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set expectations for investors to act on human rights including those related to DEI.

It is clear that DEI and financial performance are related (as outlined in this paper). However efforts to address DEI are not widespread across industries and geographies and inequalities have been further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

One of the key obstacles is social bias. Efforts focused solely on diversity – defined as a difference of identities or characteristics such as gender race and sexual orientation among others – assume a level playing field based on meritocracy: that as long any person works hard they will be able to reap the benefits. Consideration of equity and inclusion alongside diversity is needed to ensure not just equal opportunity but also equal outcomes for people.

Investors have a very important role in advancing DEI efforts for all groups in society including indigenous communities women people of colour religious minorities and others. To act on DEI investors need to seek to shape inclusive corporate cultures business models and societies.

This paper outlines how and why investors can contribute to equity for all and provides the case for integrating DEI into investment and ownership decisions. It also outlines how investors can lead by example and address DEI within their own organisations.

Our work was developed through interviews with investors and other stakeholders research on investor practices and a literature review on the current DEI landscape within investment activities. The paper can be used by asset owners investment managers and service providers globally to develop their approach to DEI.

Human rights is the overarching umbrella for our work on social issues. Alongside this work on DEI we are developing a position on the decent work agenda which will cover four pillars including equity opportunity and treatment as well as living wage and social protections which are connected to the right of non-discrimination. Our objective is for investors to consider these issues holistically rather than in isolation.

PRI-commissioned research: DEI and voting practices Mentions of DEI in signatories’ proxy voting policies have more than doubled from 6% in 2017 to 21% in 2020. Mentions of DEI within the PRI’s Reporting Framework have also been growing steadily between 2014 and 2019. However the overall number of investors mentioning or working on DEI in their proxy voting polices is still low which does not match the increasing public commitment from investors to work on these issues – notably following the 2020 global Black Lives Matter protests.

COVID-19 and inequality: A crisis The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated inequalities. McKinsey & Co calculated that by June 2020 women’s jobs were 1.8 times more vulnerable to the crisis than men’s jobs and that although women made up 39% of the global workforce they accounted for over half of overall job losses.[1] The current pandemic has also highlighted the inequity in health and wellbeing amongst different groups. In the US African American people make up 13% of the total population but constitute 33% of COVID-19 hospitalisations.[2] In Brazil indigenous people who contract the virus die at nearly double the rate of the general population. In the UK people of colour are at 10-15% higher risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to their white counterparts.

What is diversity equity and inclusion?

The terms diversity equity and inclusion are often used interchangeably. It’s important to note that each term has a unique and significant meaning. Diversity Diversity can be defined as the presence of difference within a given context such as an organisation. The term can refer to a diversity of identities or characteristics such as gender race and sexual orientation. Diversity refers to a group rather than an individual. However a person can bring additional diversity to a company or group. Inclusion Inclusion can be described as the actions taken to understand embrace and leverage the unique strengths and facets of identity for all individuals so that they feel welcomed valued and supported. It goes beyond representation. It is the level of empowerment and participation individuals have within a given setting. Inclusion is not a natural consequence of diversity. American activist and DEI thought leader Verna Myers stated that “[d]iversity is being asked to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance”. Equity Equity means people have fair access opportunity resources and power to thrive. The goal is to move beyond historical and systemic barriers to achieve greater fairness of treatment and outcomes. Equity is often confused with equality. Equality means that all people are treated identically without consideration for barriers and disadvantages that exist for particular groups. Studies referenced often use the terms ‘equity’ and ‘equality’ interchangeably. The focus of DEI efforts will vary depending on the type of organisation and corporate culture. For example some organisations may focus more on diversity of thought or cognitive diversity whereas other organisations may focus more on individual characteristics such as gender race disability age sexual orientation gender identity religion or belief care-giving responsibilities socio-economic background and linguistic groups. The specific solutions or interventions will depend on the area of focus. Driving DEI beyond diversity and gender Until recently investors have focused largely on gender and diversity such as the percentage of female representation on company boards rather than on broader issues of inclusion and equity and on characteristics beyond gender. From diversity to inclusion and equity For investors diversity could be considered one of the clearest ways to measure and evidence progress. This has been a good starting point for DEI; however investors need to look beyond diversity and address equity and inclusion as well. Inclusion is key to ensure different groups in society can access positions with decision-making power. This work also needs to be coupled with efforts aimed at equity by ensuring everyone in society enjoys fairness of treatment and outcomes. Inclusion drives diversity at all levels of the workforce. An inclusive company will likely find it easier to hire and retain employees especially employees from underrepresented groups.[3] Focusing solely on quotas at board level may have a detrimental effect in generating a larger pipeline of potential female executives.[4] When talking about gender diversity a recent report from MSCI shows there has been a steady improvement in the percentage of women on boards (currently at 20.6% for the MSCI ACWI).[5] However looking more closely at women in positions of influence which is more linked to inclusion and equity the report shows that only 4.8% of the MSCI ACWI constituents have a female CEO. From gender to all groups in society Gender diversity does not necessarily lead to other types of diversity. Even though we have seen an increase of women in senior positions – for example a study from McKinsey & Co shows that women make up 21% of C-suite positions in the US in 2020 an increase of 3.7% from 2015 – the number of women of colour remains low representing only 3% of those positions.[6] These facts highlight the importance of intersectionality where the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism sexism and classism) combine overlap or intersect especially in the experiences of marginalised individuals or groups.[7] For example it would be beneficial to seek information on the turnover of Black women at an organisation rather than looking at women and Black employees separately. This information could provide greater insight into how groups are treated in the workforce and the barriers that groups face when they have more than one identity which typically experiences inequity or a lack of inclusion. For example the most recent Stonewall Top 100 Employers benchmark shows a decrease in levels of engagement for LGBTIQ+ employees with disabilities and non-binary respondents compared to those who identify as gay and lesbian.[8] The latest Disability Equality Index shows that one in four Americans have a disability but they are twice as likely to be unemployed compared to those without disabilities.[9]

Why should investors take action on DEI?

Legal and regulatory developments Governments around the world are increasingly introducing legislation to ensure that businesses and investors are delivering social value. Many countries already have national legislation that addresses DEI explicitly for example the Canadian Business Corporation Act requires federally distributing corporations to disclose information on the representation of four designated groups: aboriginal peoples; women; members of visible minorities; and persons with disabilities. They are also required to disclose their diversity policies to increase representation among board directors and senior management or explain the absence of these policies before shareholders during every annual meeting. Some additional examples are below. Country / market Regulation Commentary Chile Chilean Labour Code (Law No.21275) Companies are obliged to adopt measures to include employees with a disability. Finland Non-Discrimination Act 1325/2014 This Act requires any authority education provider or employer that regularly employs at least 30 employees to establish an equality plan. It also prohibits discrimination harassment and denial of reasonable accommodation. Iceland Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights Irrespective of Gender No. 150/2020 This Act aims to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender and to maintain gender equality and equal opportunities for the genders in all spheres of society. India The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 The Act replaces the 1995 law on disability. The Act is in line with the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and encourages establishments to have an accessible and discrimination-free workplace. Portugal Social Balance Law 7/2009 This legislation requires all companies to maintain a five-year record of the registration of their recruitment processes professional training and promotion and working conditions with a breakdown by sex. South Africa Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act This act includes a mandate for incentive schemes to support Black-owned and managed enterprises. It seeks to deracialise all aspects of the South African economy and bring marginalised communities into the mainstream. Spain Organic Law 3/2007 for the effective equality of women and men This law encourages companies to promote equality between men and women. Article 45 states that companies with over 250 employees must formulate and implement an equality plan. United Kingdom The UK Gender Pay Gap Reporting Act From 2017 mandatory gender pay gap reporting requires public disclosure of overall mean and median gender pay gaps across the workforce for companies with 250+ employees. US State of California California Corporations Code as amended by Assembly Bill 979 This law requires corporations to have at least one director from an underrepresented community by the end of 2021. It also requires corporations with five to eight directors to have at least two directors from underrepresented communities and those with more than eight directors to have at least three directors from underrepresented communities by the end of 2022. Non-compliance with the law will incur an initial financial penalty of $100000. Besides national and regional legislation financial regulators are also pursuing disclosure rules around DEI. For example Nasdaq Stock Exchange recently submitted a proposal to the US Securities Exchange Commission to change the listing rules to include disclosures around board diversity. There have also been developments of voluntary frameworks for investors with the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute developing a voluntary code to guide DEI in the investment industry for the US and Canada. The CFA plans to expand this code to other geographies.[10] Risks and opportunities Whilst many studies determine a correlation between DEI and financial performance there are a handful of studies which explore the causal relationship.[11] Strong DEI within a company can positively affect decision-making levels of employee engagement reputation amongst stakeholders innovation and access to untapped markets. There are also significant risks in failing to improve or ignoring DEI: for example studies in the US show high incidences of sexual harassment can impact market performance profitability as well as staff productivity and turnover.[12] Shifting demographics are important to note here. A recent survey shows that 47% of millennials are actively looking for diversity in the workplace when sizing up potential employers.[13] In addition in countries such as the US most workers will soon be people of colour.[14] It therefore becomes increasingly important for companies to consider how DEI features in their employee base and in their search for new talent. Decision-making Diversity within companies brings different perspectives and can reduce groupthink which can help to strengthen decision-making.[15] This cognitive diversity can lead to solving problems faster[16] strengthened risk management[17] more accurate predictions[18] and increased innovation. One study found that companies with more diverse management teams have 19% higher revenues due to innovation.[19] DEI in investment teams Specifically within investment organisations DEI can strengthen decision-making. A diverse and inclusive culture within the investment team is also crucial to ensure it is working to represent and understand the end beneficiaries. According to Willis Towers Watson investment teams with diversity in particular ethnic diversity tend to generate better excess returns.[20] There is also a growing body of research to suggest that diverse teams can strengthen performance on other ESG issues. One study finds that diversity of skills gender and age could accelerate the integration of climate-related issues by investors and boards of directors.[21] Gender diversity is also said to lead to better identification of key ESG issues as critical to corporate strategy by the board.[22] Diversity within investment organisations can also reduce conduct risk;[23] prevent risky overinvestment decisions;[24] result in fewer instances of fraud[25] and fewer financial reporting mistakes and controversial business practices.[26] Employee engagement Beyond the benefits of cognitive diversity there is significant evidence to suggest that DEI can strengthen a company’s ability to recruit[27] and retain[28][29] employees. It’s important to note that these benefits are only fully realised when inclusion (as well as diversity) is part of the organisation’s culture.[30] Put differently being more diverse does not guarantee performance improvements unless the experiences of individuals are positive.[31] A sense of inclusion can also lead to greater attendance at work;[32] improved performance productivity[33] creativity and a better assessment of consumer interest and demand.[34] Brand value and market opportunities A diverse and inclusive workforce can help companies to understand and recognise the needs of different stakeholder groups.[35] Most notably DEI within an organisation can strengthen its reputation and increase its client or customer base. Consumers are increasingly looking for products that are accessible to everyone and can be used by a diverse range of people with different identities.[36] In addition consumers want to see commitments and evidence of action on DEI – companies that are slow to progress on DEI risk losing business.[37] Example: Fenty Beauty and inclusive beauty products Fenty Beauty was launched in 2017 with the aim of offering make-up for all skin tones and ensuring that “every woman felt included in this brand”. The brand celebrated inclusivity in their make-up campaigns and put a spotlight on the need for a diverse range of beauty products. Within 40 days of the launch of Fenty Beauty it generated USD$100 million in sales. TIME also named Fenty one of the 25 best inventions of the year. In response several brands have broadened their offerings to serve a more diverse customer base. Some have called this the “Fenty Effect”. Beneficiary preferences Many beneficiaries have preferences related to their investments’ DEI performance. For example pension provider PensionBee found that 57% of its savers expect companies in their pension to publish ethnicity pay gaps.[38] Asset owners should consider beneficiaries’ sustainability preferences as critical to building trust and maintaining their social licence to operate as fiduciaries. It is also an opportunity to increase the satisfaction and pride that beneficiaries feel regarding their savings and who is managing them.[39] Therefore asset owners are showing more interest in understanding the different expectations and needs that different beneficiary groups may have of their investments and how investment managers are addressing DEI in their own organisations and through their investment activities. Asset Owner Diversity Charter In 2021 the Asset Owner Diversity Charter was formed with a set of actions that asset owners can take to improve diversity across the investment industry. The charter has two key components. The Asset Manager Diversity and Inclusion Questionnaire aims to standardise complex diversity metrics beyond gender and to improve disclosure. The questionnaire results will feed into a progress report to inform engagement on improving diversity and inclusion. The second component is the Asset Owner Charter Toolkit which helps signatories to implement the Charter and includes critical topics such as manager monitoring and selection. DEI as a systemic issue Diversified investor returns rely on overall economic performance meaning investors are incentivised to look beyond the interests of their individual investees and more broadly on systemic issues support broader sustainability outcomes and well-functioning financial markets.[40] For this reason investors have an interest in the overall DEI performance within an economy. A just equitable and fair society where everyone can participate and reach their full potential is the social capital that societies companies and investors rely on to prosper. There is a large body of evidence (set out in this section) to suggest country-level and global inequalities (including across gender and race) can be detrimental to the economy. Inequalities in wealth and education and broader discrimination can lead to occupational barriers where disadvantaged groups are less likely to pursue careers despite having ability resulting in a misallocation of talent and inefficiencies in the economy.[41] These barriers specifically impacting African Americans over the last 50 years have cost the US economy up to 40% of aggregate productivity and output.[42] Inequality can also cause political economic and financial instability. A recent IMF study found that longer spells of economic growth correlate with greater equality and in the long term reduced inequality and sustained growth may be two sides of the same coin.[43] By enabling the full economic potential of all people the size and skills of the workforce may grow productivity may increase and long-term economic growth may be boosted. One study finds that by 2050 the US stands to realise an USD$8 trillion gain in GDP by closing the US racial equity gap. It was also found that by raising the average earnings of people of colour in the US to match those of white people (by closing gaps in health education and opportunity) this would generate an additional USD$1 trillion in earnings a 15% gain.[44] Additionally it is suggested that in Britain GBP£24 billion could be added to the economy by realising the full potential of Black and minority ethnic individuals.[45] Economic inclusion of women also strengthens the economy’s ability to grow. If women’s participation in the global economy were equal to men’s the global annual GDP would be boosted by USD$28 trillion by 2025.[46] This potential is noticeable in emerging markets where better opportunities for women to earn and control income could contribute to broader economic development.[47] Economic inclusion is also shown to boost global innovation. If women people of colour and people from low-income families were to invent at the same rate as white men from high-income families there would be 4.04 times as many inventors in the US.[48] Research shows that there is a direct link between diversity equality and innovation. It was found that innovation was six times greater in the most equal cultures than in the least equal ones.[49] Reducing inequality and increasing economic inclusion of disadvantaged groups would no doubt have positive effects. For example for families of disadvantaged groups businesses that depend on them as customers and employees and societies that rely on their health well-being and tax contributions.[50] Labour alongside capital stock and technological advancement is an input for growth and the social and economic development of countries. Countries’ business environment and DEI performance will have an impact on labour participation rates and on composition of the labour force. By enabling increased labour participation of various groups with different skill sets in society DEI action could directly boost economic growth.[51] The connection between DEI and other systemic issues such as inequality has led to increasing expectations from regulators clients and beneficiaries for investors to consider the sustainability outcomes of their investments. By acting on DEI investors help to drive changes that lead to positive and sustainable outcomes for people in line with among other frameworks the SDGs and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Action areas for investors on DEI

To achieve progress on DEI investors should take meaningful action. Change will not be bought about by minimal adjustments to existing policies and processes or making commitments and statements. It will require a unified holistic approach pulling together a variety of voices — individuals community groups policy makers corporations and investors — and putting those most impacted at the heart of the conversation. Institutional investors can act across three areas: inclusive corporate cultures; inclusive business models; and inclusive societies noting that these can overlap. For example access to education (inclusive society) may impact the diversity of candidates for recruitment (inclusive corporate culture). Inclusive corporate cultures Inclusive corporate cultures ensure a diverse workforce that reflects the makeup of society which will vary according to the region or country where the company operates. Employees are empowered because structural barriers are recognised and addressed. Currently many initiatives are focused on diversity at leadership or board level; however attention should be paid to all employees as well as to different workplace processes including recruitment retention development and promotion. This action area on corporate culture focuses on direct employees of investors and investees. Inclusive business models Inclusive business models incorporate DEI into the design of the products and services a business provides and its underlying value chains including suppliers local communities and customers. For example for investors an inclusive business model means using DEI as criteria for the selection appointment and monitoring of external investment managers and other service providers. Inclusive societies An inclusive society gives individuals the tools they need so they can thrive independent of their individual characteristics. This action area refers to broader societal issues which disproportionally impact disadvantaged groups and requires interventions that go beyond the efforts of just companies and investors. To realise economic and productivity gains coordinated and comprehensive change is required across a range of policy areas as well as investor engagement to influence change across all industry sectors. Investor internal efforts Alongside driving DEI through their own portfolios investors should address DEI within their own internal activities which requires action across recruitment retention development and promotion practices including pay policies. Investors should look at the effectiveness of DEI efforts across different levels and teams within the organisation including investment committees and fund teams. Example: Old Mutual As part of Old Mutual’s transformation efforts it runs an investment analyst programme to develop and retain Black employees to become high-quality investment analysts and in so doing the company is building a strong Black talent pipeline. There is also formal training to further develop technical and interpersonal skills as well as sponsor professional studies. This is a comprehensive programme including mentorship on-the-job assignments and assessments. Investors should also consider DEI issues in relation to other stakeholders beyond employees such as local communities contractors and the rest of their supply chains. Investor levers for action Investment decisions Stewardship of investees Dialogue with policy makers and key stakeholders Investment Decisions Engagement with beneficiaries Beneficiaries may feel the impact of DEI beyond their investment returns in their role as employees consumers and citizens. Therefore investors should consider engaging with beneficiaries and clients to understand their broad values to guide investment activities related to DEI. In addition investors can assess and understand the expectations that different beneficiary groups may have of their investments (i.e. faith-based finance). Screening Investors can apply DEI-related filters to potential investees to rule out the worst performers or include those investees and engage with them demonstrating leading practice. Screening criteria for potential investees may include disclosure on DEI metrics a diversity policy or a minimum level of diversity within the workforce as well as disclosure and resolution of DEI-related grievances (such as lawsuits for pay/promotion discrimination and sexual harassment cases). Investors will need to develop clear screening criteria matched to their set objectives on DEI. For passive strategies investors can consider how the overall exposure to a particular DEI factor is reduced or increased by adjusting the weights of constituents dependent on ESG factors. This may be reflected in a bespoke index. Investment selection in private markets For those investors with higher controlling stakes an initial screening against DEI expectations could prompt further investigation during due diligence or lead to abandoning the investment entirely. The due diligence process typically involves investigating legacy issues but also identifying future risks and opportunities that will become the focus of DEI management efforts during the holding period. Investors can consider the actual and potential outcomes of investees’ business models for external stakeholders such as consumers communities and suppliers. Investors should develop clear screening criteria to match their own values and DEI objectives. Financial products Even though investors should consider DEI across all portfolios they can also consider developing specific financial products such as ETFs and mutual funds that use diversity as the main weighting criteria. Investors can also consider gathering DEI data on beneficiaries and clients (i.e. current and future savers) to assess whether existing financial products and services cater to their needs and expectations and to understand how the diversity of their own staff may need to change to better align with their client base. In this way investors could enter new markets. Example: Unipol Gruppo Unipol Gruppo an asset owner based in Italy focuses on developing products and services that help to solve pressing social issues that have come about due to growing inequalities and lower social protection. For example Unipol offers zero-interest rate funding designed to safeguard the purchasing power of the most vulnerable sections of society. The company is currently analysing the breakdown of its clients to consider how its products (including pension funds and insurance) can be developed to serve different groups. Example: BMO Real Estate Partners In 2020 BMO Real Estate Partners the pan-European property investment and asset management specialist that is now part of Columbia Threadneedle Investments announced the first round of funding for its newly developed UK housing strategy. The aim of the new fund is to address a distinct gap in the UK housing market by offering high quality sustainable community-based rental property targeted at low to middle income households whose needs are not currently being met and where a real growth opportunity exists given the UK housing market fundamentals. Investment will be governed by a social agenda aligning with ESG and impact investment objectives. The fund will use a range of criteria to evaluate the ESG credentials of a scheme including: Affordability and provision

Societal change

Quality of property management and governance

Environmental impact – local

Environmental impact – surroundings

Resilience The fund has developed defined objectives and conditions which must be achieved to demonstrate additionality. External investment managers and other service providers Asset owners can include DEI in due diligence questionnaires to external managers and other service providers. It’s important to ask specifically about investment teams which historically have lacked diversity rather than just the organisation as a whole. These teams will also be directly responsible for implementing any directives around DEI into investment decisions and engagement with investees. Investors should also embed requirements into legal documentation and identify minimum reporting disclosures. Investors can also ask about inclusion and the culture within an external manager/fund – including questions around whistleblowing harassment and discrimination policies. Example: ILPA DDQ In 2018 ILPA published an expanded version of its DDQ to advance diversity and inclusion within the private equity industry. It contains questions to understand a General Partner’s policies and procedures in areas such as harassment discrimination workplace violence and misconduct. Capital allocation Supporting growth of business owned by underrepresented groups Access to financial capital can be an obstacle for businesses owned by underrepresented groups and this is a missed opportunity for investors. Small and medium-sized companies can be considered riskier for investors. However investors can consider alternative vehicles such as venture capital growth equity and/or private venture debt without having to increase the risk profile of other investments and therefore still comply with their fiduciary duty. Whilst venture capital is a significant engine for job creation and plays a material role in funding the next generation of business leaders it has not provided proportionate or equivalent funding to underrepresented groups such as women and people of colour. In geographies where private market options such as VC are limited (i.e. Latin America)[52] investors can consider alternative financial vehicles such as social or impact bonds which can provide funding to underrepresented groups particularly SMEs or people who participate in the informal economy.[53] Supporting businesses that drive equity and inclusion Investors should consider identifying key social outcomes focused on inclusion and equity and shaping those outcomes through investments and across investors’ portfolios. Examples of possible actions are investing in companies or sectors that contribute to increasing access of all groups in society to services such as health and sanitation as well as finance education affordable housing and justice. This includes investment in the wide range of products and services that will drive positive impacts for specific groups and address actual or potential adverse human rights outcomes of investees. Spotlight: DEI and the decarbonisation of Europe’s built environment A recent report from the Institute for Human Rights and Business encourages investors and policy makers to look at how they can finance the decarbonisation of Europe’s built environment. The report explains that socio-economic and geographic disparities are closely linked to racial and ethnic disparities and that decisions about where we invest including those deemed green investments directly correlate with how and what parts of the city are developed who benefits and who is left behind. Therefore within their investment decision and capital allocation process investors need to understand whether any existing or future green investments could exacerbate social inequalities while making sure that investment also flows to areas that have traditionally been excluded. Spotlight: Transition to the low-carbon economy and indigenous peoples’ rights The mining sector is key in the transition to a low-carbon economy. According to the Transition Minerals Tracker demand for minerals such as lithium cobalt copper and nickel is expanding as “companies race to produce the technology needed to support the energy transition from electric vehicles to solar panels to wind turbines.” However human rights allegations in the sector are also growing at an alarming rate and investors need to consider the social implications of the increase in demand alongside the environmental benefits. For example in South America almost a fifth of the allegations tracked by this initiative relate to indigenous peoples’ rights including violations to free prior and informed consent. Another report for the Washington Post shows that indigenous communities report not being properly compensated for the exploitation of their ancestral lands nor receive the promised economic benefits that derive from mining activities while companies operating locally provide very limited public information about their relation with indigenous communities or economic compensation. Stewardship of investees Investors can use their influence over current and potential investees across all asset classes to improve corporate practices outcomes and public disclosure related to DEI. Investors should consider engaging with end beneficiaries and clients to understand their broad values to guide stewardship activities related to DEI. For example an asset owner may consider explicitly addressing racial diversity in their voting policy/principles where this is a priority issue for beneficiaries. While continuing efforts to promote high standards globally investors should consider adjusting their stewardship objectives depending on the size region and sector of the investee as every company is different. For instance it may be unreasonable to expect a high level of racial diversity in a company based in a country with a low level of racial diversity such as Japan. Investors should also consider legal requirements which may prevent investees from meeting investor expectations on DEI (for example French law prohibits the collection of any data based on race ethnicity or religion). Corporate engagement Engagement on public disclosure Where public disclosure will improve transparency within the market or provide investors with information to support engagement and decision-making investors should consider engaging with companies to disclose information related to its workforce DEI across several characteristics. To capture a clearer picture of the organisation investors should consider pushing for information on DEI across all levels within the organisation and within different departments. Investors should also consider pushing for disclosure of data on groups which have more than one identity and typically experience inequity or a lack of inclusion. Investors can also encourage companies to disclose inclusion metrics and look at the treatment of staff across the recruitment retention development and promotion employee lifecycle and how this is broken down across different characteristics and identities. Metrics may include the return rate from parental leave for men and women and the average turnover rate for LGBTIQ+ employees. Engagement on company practice Engagement with companies may start with high-level discussions on issues such as a diversity policy setting diversity targets and assigning senior leadership (with a sufficient level of expertise on DEI) to oversee company efforts and progress. This can evolve into more detailed discussions on company practice such as development opportunities offered to underrepresented groups fair recruitment processes and family leave policies. Investors should also consider engaging with companies on broader issues which intersect with DEI such as whistleblowing. Investors can also engage with investees on DEI issues connected to stakeholders beyond employees such as consumers local communities and contractors. For example investors can influence investees to research develop or enhance products across asset classes to better service specific groups in society or at a minimum prevent disproportionately negatively impacting specific groups. Example: Investor statement on facial recognition In 2021 CANDRIAM coordinated an investor statement which calls on companies involved in facial recognition technology to increase disclosure demonstrate awareness of the impact on human rights and adopt ethical practices. This was in response to the rapid deployment of facial recognition technology and major concerns about the impact on privacy data protection and civil liberties. The statement highlights the potential risk of racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems and calls for this technology to be monitored. Further specific groups often disproportionately make up a large proportion of a company’s supply chain for instance 30% of the full-time supply chain workforce are people of colour in the US and therefore investors can encourage investees to ensure their DEI efforts and policies extend to contractors and people in their value chain. Voting Listed equity investors can use their position (and legal rights) as partial owners of companies to influence how companies address DEI. Investors can adopt or amend their voting policy guidelines or principles to reflect their position on DEI and how they would vote at AGMs considering beneficiary preferences and an analysis of associated DEI risks to the portfolio as well as outcomes caused by or linked to the portfolio overall. For example investors may state that they will support shareholder resolutions that seek to improve DEI-related public disclosure or practice within a company. Spotlight: DEI shareholder proposals in 2021 In 2021 a record number of DEI-related shareholder proposals were filed and supported including requests that companies conduct racial equity audits issue reports on their DEI efforts and develop policies to disclose relevant data. One shareholder resolution filed at Union Pacific Corporation requested greater disclosure on quantitative comparable data to understand the effectiveness of the company’s DEI programmes. This included the board’s process for assessing the effectiveness of its DEI programmes as reflected by any goals metrics and trends related to the promotion recruitment and retention of protected classes of employees. The resolution received 81.4% support by shareholders. Investors can also use their voting rights to address board diversity. For example investors may determine a minimum acceptable level of diversity on a company board and when this level is not met use their voting rights to take appropriate action such as appointing and removing members of a company board and nominating director candidates for inclusion in the election process. Investors can also vote against the chair or members of the nomination committee where there is a lack of board diversity. Beyond voting where a company is slow to make progress investors can also consider filing a shareholder resolution requesting action or disclosure on the issue (in jurisdictions where this is possible). Example: Shareholder resolution on reconciliation and indigenous relations In 2021 a shareholder resolution was filed at TMX Group requesting that the company report on its work to: develop internal programmes and policies on DEI including those that encompass current and prospective indigenous employees and relationships with indigenous communities;

review procurement from indigenous-owned businesses and those owned by other underrepresented groups and establish appropriate disclosure practices and objectives; and

engage with indigenous and other organisations to support this work so that these programmes meet standards that are appropriate for the company and wherever possible aligned with commonly used frameworks. Also to report this work in a way that supports investors’ ability to determine the breadth depth and content of these programmes. The resolution received 98% votes in favour by shareholders. Stewardship to address systemic issues Investors should consider stewardship activities that improve social outcomes and influence change at an economic or sectoral level rather than at an individual holding level. This may include collaborating with other investors to engage with the largest companies that have international sector-wide influence to improve their practices. It can also involve engagement with stakeholders beyond investee companies such as policy makers. Investors should also consider engaging with investees to address broader issues which may be connected to DEI or disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups for example decent work and environmental justice[54] (including the just transition climate justice and deforestation). Spotlight: Living wage Although Black workers make up only 11% of the workforce in the US 38% of Black workers receive the minimum wage. Therefore urging the largest companies to pay the living wage would help to address the racial wage gap and improve the standards of living for Black workers. Example: Investor engagement on living wage One initiative focused on living wage is the Platform Living Wage Financials (PLWF). PLWF is an alliance of 11 financial institutions representing over EUR€2.3 trillion in assets under management.It was founded in September 2018 and uses its financial leverage to engage investee companies to address the non-payment of a living wage to workers in their global supply chains. See Active Ownership 2.0 for more information on using stewardship to address systemic issues. Escalation Where engagement with an investee has been unsuccessful or the investee is slow to make progress investors may consider increasing their influence by collaborating with peers. Alternatively investors may take escalatory steps such as filing a shareholder resolution speaking out publicly (such as an op-ed in the media) to draw attention to a company’s practice or DEI in general or taking legal action where it is believed that a company has not acted in shareholders’ best interests. Example: Alphabet sexual harassment shareholder lawsuit In 2019 AP7 a Swedish pension fund sued Alphabet based on reports of sexual misconduct at Alphabet and the board’s perceived mishandling of the situation. Alphabet reached a settlement with AP7. Alphabet agreed to eliminate mandatory arbitration and limit Google’s use of non-disclosure agreements while prohibiting Google from “providing severance to any employee including a senior executive terminated for sexual harassment sexual misconduct or retaliation”. Alphabet also committed USD$310 million to fund and create a diversity equity and inclusion advisory council comprised of outside experts. AP7 stated that legal action is one of its four measures of engagement for sustainable and responsible asset management. Dialogue with policy makers and key stakeholders Achieving DEI will require engagement with key stakeholders beyond corporates such as policy makers and civil society. Engagement with policy makers and standard setters Investors can encourage rules that strengthen DEI disclosures. Mandatory and standardised disclosure on DEI will allow investors to have more complete information on company performance and practices. Such disclosures should go beyond gender and include other characteristics relevant to the country of disclosure and include measurements around inclusion (e.g. data on the promotion recruitment and retention rates of different employees) that cover the whole organisation and not just the board or C-suite. Investors can also encourage and support standards policy and legislation that promote inclusion and equity by eliminating discriminatory barriers and implementing policies that support work homeownership entrepreneurship and well-being for all groups in society. Investors collaborating with other stakeholders can seek to input to policies and standards including through responding to consultations. Investors should also consider focusing efforts on policy development to tackle issues that can disproportionally impact disadvantaged groups in society such as modern slavery living wage freedom of association equal opportunities protection of cultural heritage health equity and the just transition. Engaging with policy makers and standard setters on broader sustainable investment policy may also help to strengthen DEI. For example the inclusion of DEI in stewardship codes clarifies investors’ expectations in addressing systemic issues related to achieving an inclusive society and can provide a framework for addressing DEI in different asset classes. See the PRI and World Bank Group’s Toolkit for Sustainable Investment Policy and Regulation for more information on engaging with policy makers. Engagement with affected stakeholders Engagement with affected stakeholders including local communities NGOs and employee unions is integral to the proper development of investor policies practices and public policy positions related to DEI.

Introduction

On September 12 2021 an event called “Think Tank 2022 Rally of Hope” was organized in South Korea. Due to the COVID-19 situation it was a virtual event live-streamed throughout the world. Because of the different time zones the morning of September 12 in South Korea corresponded to the late afternoon or evening of September 11 in different parts of the United States. One of the (virtual) speakers at the event which focused on the situation of world peace and the possibility of a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula was former American President Donald J. Trump.

The organizer of the event in South Korea was the Universal Peace Federation (UPF) an entity founded by Reverend Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012) and his wife Hak Ja Han Moon. Trump was criticized in the United States as he did not attend the official commemoration of the victims of the terrorist attack of September 11 2001 as if he regarded the Korean event as more important. In fact the Rally of Hope’s date was September 12 and the day had been picked up as the anniversary of the UPF foundation in 2005 although it was broadcasted in the U.S. on September 11. According to the UPF Trump had recorded his speech in August two weeks before the event.

Invitation to “Think Tank 2022 Rally of Hope” on September 12 2021. Donald Trump was just one of the speakers among Barroso Arroyo and several others.

Media criticism quickly became international. It escalated to a campaign putting together two groups not exactly popular with most media Trump and his followers and “cults” as the founders of the UPF were also the founders of the Unification Church one of the main targets of the anti-cult movement.

In the UK The Independent wrote that Trump had spoken at “an event linked to [a] controversial religious ‘cult’” (Woodward 2021). The word “cult” was also used in an article in The Huffington Post which even gave voice to a political activist named Jim Stewartson who insisted the UPF was connected with a “christofascist cult”—whatever this may mean (Papenfuss 2021). Other media outlets used the same language.

Kahina Sekkai wrote in the online edition of the French Paris Match under the title “Donald Trump Speaks at a Moon Cult Conference.” The Korean event was described as “a conference of the Unification Church the official name of the Moon cult” and Trump was criticized for having applauded the “work for peace” of both Reverend and Mrs. Moon. The article also mentioned that “two sons of Reverend Moon had formed a new pro-weapon congregation. Hyung Jin Sean Moon was at the Capitol the day of the insurrection January 6 and his organization had even organized a transportation system to bring his devotees to the protest” (Sekkai 2021).

The article like the others we mentioned is a textbook example of stereotypes which when it comes to “cults” are more frequent in France than elsewhere. Everything is there: the ghost of the “secte Moon” the use of the derogatory word “Moonie” for the members of the Unification Movement (a word banned by The New York Times and other leading English-speaking media as offensive) the confusion between the Unification Church led by Mrs. Moon (now operating in many countries as the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification FFWPU) and the Sanctuary Church in Newfoundland Pennsylvania led by Hyung Jin (Sean) Moon.

As in all religions there have been schisms in the Unification Church both before and after the death of Reverend Moon in 2012. The Sanctuary Church’s political activities are certainly controversial. Whether they did anything illegal on January 6 is a different question: being near the Capitol on “the day of the insurrection” and participating in the attack are two different things and as far as we know no member of Sean Moon’s group has been accused of any crime in connection with the protests. Be it as it may be the Sanctuary Church is certainly not part of the movement led by Mrs. Moon. The two organizations are separated by harsh criticism and even court cases (Chryssides 2017). Using the activities of the Sanctuary Church to slander Mrs. Moon’s organization is just bad journalism. Just as it is highly questionable to use the widespread political opposition to ex-President Trump as a weapon against the Unification Movement.

However the main problem of the article is that it calls a rally organized by the UPF “a conference of the Unification Church.” Is this correct? Are the Universal Peace Federation and the Unification Church derogatorily called in France “la secte Moon” one and the same? The purpose of this White Paper is to clarify the issue which has broader implications going beyond the Unification Movement.

A Hermeneutics of Suspicion

In 1965 French philosopher Paul Ricœur (1913–2005) published De l’Interprétation (Ricœur 1965) translated into English in 1970 as Freud and Philosophy (Ricœur 1970). He coined there the expression “school of suspicion” (école du soupçon: Ricœur 1965 40) and described a hermeneutics of suspicion created by three “masters of suspicion”: Karl Marx (1818–1883) Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) and Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) (Ricœur 1965 40). Because of the widespread influence of these three ideologists many came to believe that beyond philosophy culture and the arts there are always “hidden” and unconfessed motivations connected to class (Marx) power (Nietzsche) or sexuality (Freud). Philosophers poets and artists can claim that their aim is to seek the truth or produce beauty but in fact we may suspect that these claims are false and they are directly or indirectly producing propaganda for the social class they belong to seeking power or trying to satisfy their sexual desires.

Ricœur was a Protestant Christian. He believed that the hermeneutics of suspicion was primarily aimed at the “destruction of religion” (Ricœur 1965 41) by reducing it to “something else” (autre chose) and accusing religionists of “dissimulation” (Ricœur 1965 17). What many regard as the charitable works of religions the “masters of suspicion” argued in fact “dissimulate” “something else” i.e. their leaders’ and members’ quest for hegemony power and sometimes illicit sex.

William Sargant (1907–1988) a leading British psychiatrist was the scholar who tried to offer scientific evidence that religions’ charitable works disguised motivations of manipulation and power. The notion of “brainwashing” had been originally coined by American propaganda to explain how the Soviets and the Chinese were able to “convert” jailed opponents and prisoners of war to Communism (Anthony 1996; Introvigne 2022). In his 1957 book The Battle for the Mind Sargant used it to argue that while pretending to promote charity and work for peace all religions were subtly manipulating their devotees and recruiting new converts (Sargant 1957).

Sargant who disliked organized religion (saving only ancient paganism) claimed that all religions dissimulated ulterior motives behind their charitable work: indeed his main examples were Roman Catholicism and Methodism. Although influential in some psychiatric circles not surprisingly Sargant’s work met with the strong opposition of religionists and a good part of the public opinion which in the late 1950s was not prepared to accept that mainline Christian organizations were not sincere.

Sargant’s work was however brought to fruition in the United States by a clinical psychologist Margaret Thaler Singer (1921–2003) who claimed that the hermeneutics of suspicion presented in The Battle for the Mind did not apply to all religious organizations but only to some she labeled as “cults.” Religions are sincere in their endeavors Singer argued including when they promote peace and charitable activities. “Cults” are manipulative groups and their organizations allegedly promoting peace culture or charity are just “fronts” whose aim is to recruit new members for the “cultic” groups (Singer and Lalich 1995).

Singer’s preferred example of a “cult” whose cultural and public welfare organizations were in fact dishonest “fronts” was the Unification Church and in fact she worked as an expert witness against that church in most court cases involving Reverend Moon’s organization.

Singer’s theories were debunked by scholars of new religious movements who convincingly argued that the criteria she proposed for distinguishing between sincere religions and “cults” were vague and dissimulated a judgement on beliefs (Introvigne 2022). Religions whose beliefs were not part of the mainline or disapproved of by the anti-cult movement with which Singer was closely aligned including the Unification Church were labeled as “cults.” As one of Singer’s main critics American sociologist David Bromley wrote when one group is labeled a “cult” its “civic projects are deemed public relations stunts and organizational affiliates are derisively labeled front groups” (Bromley 1998 42).

Eventually American courts of law realized that Singer’s theory of “cults” was not accepted by most scholars of new religious movements as part of mainline science and her testimony was excluded with the 1990 Fishman decision from cases involving new religions (United States District Court for the Northern District of California 1990). However while defeated in American courts Singer’s ideas about manipulation by “cults” and charitable and peace organizations as “fronts” for the “cults” survived in Europe and certainly remained popular in the media.

The Universal Peace Federation

Many new (and old) religious movements are “millennialist” meaning that they believe a totally different transfigured world will soon replace our present one. The word “millennialism” comes from the idea of a peaceful kingdom that will last on earth for one thousand years found in the Christian Bible but has been adapted to non-Christian contexts as well.

American scholar Catherine Wessinger distinguished between two different forms of millennialism. A “catastrophic” millennialism believes that God will force the Millennium on humans through punishments and disasters. A “progressive” millennialism teaches that the Millennium will come when a sufficient number of humans will cooperate with God seeking a better world on earth and promoting peace with sincerity (Wessinger 1997).

Most new religions that originated in Eastern Asia believe in “progressive” millennialism (although some embrace the “catastrophic” variety). Scholars note that even when they are Christian they are influenced by local prophecies and ideas that the world will go through a “Great Transformation” (called in Korea gabyeok) and that humans should cooperate and prepare this transfiguration through their good work (Baker 2008 120).

Many founders of new religions in Japan South Korea and Taiwan have also established organizations promoting world peace and global social development. For those East Asian new religions that have a Christian origin this is not surprising. The Catholic Church and many Protestant denominations have created dozens of larger and smaller organizations promoting peace justice and social welfare. Most of them include members of different religions. One would rarely hear that Caritas Internationalis the mammoth organization created by the Catholic Church for social development and welfare is a “front” for Roman Catholicism.

In East Asia both Christian and non-Christian new religions share the idea which is rooted in the traditional local culture that working for peace and for the well-being of all human beings (not only one’s co-religionists) is part of personal self-cultivation. It is also the best way of preparing the advent of a transformed world what Wessinger calls “progressive millennialism.”

The Unification Church as a Christian new religious movement founded in Korea derives both from the history of Christianity and from local religious traditions the idea of promoting world peace through dialogue culture and social development.

The case of the Unification Church and the UPF is not isolated. Almost all East Asian new religions have promoted world peace organizations. And almost all these organizations have been accused of being “fronts” for what their opponents call “cults.”

Reverend Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han Moon UPF Founders.

Reverend Moon and his wife were hardly unique among East Asian religious leaders in establishing organizations promoting peace and dialogue. They were Koreans and the tragedy of the Korean War had been a fundamental component of their experience. Initially the aim of some of the organizations they promoted was to alert the world about the danger of Communism. However as the 20th century was coming to an end Reverend Moon and his wife recognized the changed international context and emphasized reconciliation rather than confrontation.

In 1982 Reverend Moon founded the Washington Times in Washington DC as a newspaper exposing Soviet-style Communism and balancing what he saw as the leftist leanings of the Washington Post. With the end of the Cold War it has become somewhat less militant and has opened its columns to op-eds by American activists and politicians of different persuasions while maintaining an emphasis on traditional family values and religious liberty that continues to make it a conservative daily.

On April 16 1990 Reverend and Mrs. Moon met Russian President Gorbachev and Reverend Moon embraced Gorbachev in front of the photographers. In December 1991 they visited North Korea and met President Kim Il-sung (1912–1994). To fully understand the significance of this meeting one should remember that Reverend Moon had been imprisoned and tortured under Kim’s regime between 1946 and 1950.

Rev. and Mrs. Moon meet with Mikhaïl Gorbatchev president of the Soviet Union in 1990 and with North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung in December 1991.

The meaning of the meetings with Gorbachev and Kim was not merely political. Reverend Moon’s theology assumed that the Biblical pairs of Cain and Abel and Esau and Jacob were complementary in the sense that both members of each pair had a role to play. Meeting Kim and Gorbachev symbolically represented the unification of the Cain and Abel sides which ended with a reconciliation interpreted as the reunion between Esau and Jacob. On the other hand while theology supplied the deeper motivations of such meetings the Moons also expected that they would advance the cause of world peace.

In a way Reverend Moon believed that by returning in 1991 to the same place in North Korea where he had started his work in 1951 he could now conclude his mission and pass the torch to his wife. She would soon found the Women’s Federation for World Peace and proclaim the beginning of an “era of women’s liberation” (see Introvigne 2000 19).

However this did not mean that women activities became the sole nor the main focus of the Moons’ peace activities. Several other organizations continued to operate and the Universal Peace Federation (UPF) was founded in 2005 followed among others by the International Association of Youth and Students for Peace in 2017. The UPF inaugural tour started in 2005 and reached 120 cities around the world.

Large UPF conferences gathered former (and sometimes current) presidents and prime ministers of different countries as well as religious and cultural leaders. These gatherings included the Continental Africa Peace Summit 2018 inaugurated in Dakar Senegal on January 18 2018; the South-East Europe Peace Summit opened in Tirana Albania on October 26 2019; the Asia Pacific Summit which started in Phnom Penh Cambodia on November 19 2019; the Africa Continental Summit Niger 2019 whose opening ceremony was held in Niamey Niger on November 28 2019; the World Summit 2019 in Seoul South Korea on February 7–9 2019; the World Summit 2020 which also took place in Seoul on February 3–8 2020. Regional meetings were also organized including the recent Balkans Leadership Conference organized in Tirana Albania on November 20–21 2021 which led to the signature of a Memorandum of Cooperation between the UPF and the Podgorica Club an organization established in 2019 by former presidents of Southeast European countries.

The UPF is active through a number of specialized organizations each of which holds its own events:

•The International Association of Parliamentarians for Peace (IAPP)

•The International Summit Council for Peace (ISCP)

•The International Association of First Ladies for Peace (IAFLP)

•The Interreligious Association for Peace and Development (IAPD)

•The International Media Association for Peace (IMAP)

•The International Association of Academicians for Peace (IAAP)

•The International Association for Peace and Economic Development (IAED)

The International Association of Parliamentarians for Peace (IAPP) was launched on February 15 2016 at the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea. It gathers parliamentarians from all around the world and organizes forums promoting peace and democracy and fighting corruption. National meetings of IAPP members have been organized in such diverse locations as Manila London Rome and Asunción and the association has emerged as one of the largest and most active branches of the UPF. In the United States the inaugural meeting was hosted by then pro tempore President of the Senate Orrin Hatch.

The Interreligious Association for Peace and Development (IAPD) has been launched on November 13 2017 in Seoul as a partner association of IAPP. More than 60000 attended the event at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. The idea behind IAPD is that the aims pursued by the IAPP parliamentarians and by UPF in general also have a spiritual dimension and that dialogue between religions is a necessary pre-condition for peace. Regional meetings have gathered representatives of most major religions.

The International Summit Council for Peace (ISCP) was launched on February 8 2019 during the UPF 2019 World Summit in Seoul. Its purpose is to gather together current and former heads of state and government. At the inaugural meeting former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich were the keynote speakers. Among those present were the former President of Paraguay Luis Federico Franco Gómez the former President of Albania Alfred Moisiu the former President of Ghana Jerry John Rawlings (1947–2020) and the current President of São Tomé and Príncipe Evaristo Carvalho. A second assembly was organized on February 4 2020 in Seoul.

The International Association of First Ladies for Peace (IAFLP) was launched on February 5 2020 at the UPF World Summit 2020 in Seoul in partnership with the Women’s Federation for World Peace. Among those who spoke at the inaugural event were Fionnuala Kenny wife of the former prime minister of Ireland Sujata Koirala former deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Nepal and the former first ladies of Nigeria Guatemala and Nicaragua as well as the current first ladies of Nauru and Palau.

The UPF World Summit 2020 was also the opportunity to launch the International Media Association for Peace (IMAP) on February 2 2020 the International Association of Academicians for Peace (IAAP) on February 5 2020 and at the same date the International Association for Peace and Economic Development (IAED). They cater to three communities UPF identifies as equally important for its aims: journalists academics and business leaders.

There are several other initiatives and organizations that are also part of the UPF network. Some of them continue projects that Reverend Moon and his wife had started before the foundation of UPF in 2005. Moon and some of his co-workers had a long-lasting interest in soccer and programs such as the “Peace Cup” and “Football for Peace” look at sport as a tool to promote international dialogue and friendship. Other projects pursue charitable and ecological endeavors including cleaning and development projects around Lake Baikal and other areas in Russia. At the UK Parliament a “UPF Young Achievers Award” has been organized since 2010 as an annual event where the youth involved receive their awards from their own parliamentarians.

The “Peace Road” is an old visionary project by Reverend Moon who dreamed about connecting Eurasia and America by land through a tunnel in Alaska and Japan and Korea through another tunnel. Beyond these difficult projects the World Peace Road Foundation’s idea of an “international highway” maintains that making the world more connected through tunnels bridges highways and railways is one of the ways of making it more peaceful. Parenthetically these projects constantly insist on the equal dignity and rights of all women and men and make accusations of “racism” sometimes directed by anti-cultists against the Unification Church leaders involved in the UPF ludicrous.

Moscow Russia—As part of the Peace Road project the supermarathon “Children against Drugs” concluded after 1150 kilometers from June 12 to 26 2021.

The Sunhak Peace Prize Foundation awards normally every two years $1 million to laureates who contributed to the creation of peace for future generations. In its first edition in 2015 the prize went to Kiribati’s President and international environmental activist Anote Tong and Indian biologist Modadugu Bijai Gupta whose research and activities are regarded as crucial for addressing the problem of world hunger.

2017 Sunhak Peace Prize Laureates: Sakena Yacoobi (Afghanistan) refugee resettlement through education and the late Dr Gino Strada (Italy) medical relief for refugees in the Middle East and Africa.

The main engine making the UPF projects work is the impressive network of Ambassadors for Peace more than 100000 volunteers from 160 countries who work to promote the different UPF events and organizations. They come from all religions and the vast majority of the Ambassadors of Peace are not part of the Unification Church.

A Case Study: The UPF World Summit 2020

To illustrate how the UPF and its network of organizations work in practice an analysis of the UPF World Summit 2020 may offer an interesting case study. The event was held in Seoul on February 3–5 2020 a few weeks before the COVID crisis made traveling and large gatherings impossible. Some participants however did cancel their participation at the last minute due to the epidemic including President Macky Sall of Senegal who sent a video and was awarded one of the Sunhak Peace Prizes. Some 6000 delegates from 170 countries were nonetheless able to attend the inaugural ceremony. Some 2500 participated in the following plenary sessions and breakouts where more than 300 presented papers or responses (“World Summit 2020 Executive Summary 2020” 14).

During World Summit 2020 February 4-8 in Seoul Dr Hak Ja Han Moon as the Summit’s host amidst Heads of State and Government former Heads of State international parliamentarians and other political dignitaries. Among them: Ban Ki-moon 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations; José Manuel Barroso 11th President of the European Commission; Hun Sen Prime Minister of Cambodia.

The event featured plenary sessions and sessions of the different organizations of the UPF network. Among the main speakers were the former Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon (who was also awarded a Sunhak Peace Prize) the President of Guatemala Jimmy Morales the former President of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan the Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen the Mexican scientist Mario J. Molina who was a co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his role in discovering the threat to the Earth’s ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbon the Vice President of the Philippines Maria Leonor Robredo the Prime Minister of Niger Brigi Rafini the former President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso (and several former European Presidents and Prime Ministers) the Mayor of Seoul Park Won-soon (1995–2020) the Vice President of Myanmar Henry Van Thio. Interestingly North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un sent a large floral arrangement with his greetings. President and Mrs. Trump also sent a greeting message.

In analyzing the event four comments are important for the purpose of this White Paper. First there was no attempt to hide or downplay the fact that the UPF was founded by Reverend and Mrs. Moon and the leading role Mrs. Moon still plays in it. On the contrary the official program of the conference featured a banquet to introduce Mrs. Moon’s autobiography (Moon 2020) all the material introducing the event insisted on the fact that the Moons were the founders of the UPF and the Summit’s official declaration “acknowledge[d] respectfully the leadership of Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon and her late husband Rev. Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012) and their great vision of peace of one family under God an idea they strove to achieve throughout their lives” (“World Summit 2020 Peace Declaration” 16).

Indeed many of the luminaries who spoke at the Summit mentioned and thanked Reverend and Mrs. Moon. Any claim that they were “misled” and participated in a “front” event of the Unification Church without knowing it is thus totally unfounded.

Second except for the speeches of those UPF leaders who are also members of the Unification Church some of them part of the Moon family references to the theology of Reverend Moon and his wife were surprisingly scarce. Clearly the event did not have among its purposes to advertise or promote the Unificationist theology or proselytize for the Unification Church which would have been both difficult and inappropriate considering how many leaders of different religions participated in the Summit including Bishop Munib Younan President of the Lutheran World Federation as well as Orthodox bishops and distinguished Catholic priests and theologians.

Third there was no intention to promote a particular political position or ideology. President Trump sent his greetings but so did North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Jimmy Morales from Guatemala and Newt Gingrich are conservative politicians but Cambodia’s Hun Sen and former Prime Minister of Portugal and President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso represent different incarnations of Socialism. None of them presented their respective ideologies at the Summit. They all understood the rules of the game and presented papers on subjects of general interest such as the threats of climate change and terrorism interreligious dialogue and the role and possible reform of the United Nations—the latter a theme on which UPF’s original contribution has been often acknowledged by scholars and politicians alike.

Sun Myung Moon proposing to reform the United Nations by the creation of an Interreligious Council in the UN system. (United Nations New York August 18 2000).

A conference with several hundred papers cannot avoid differences in quality and an event on world peace always includes a certain dose of rhetoric and self-congratulation. The World Summit 2020 was no exception yet many papers were valuable by both political and academic standards. For its richness of diverse perspectives and deep analysis of the issues in a good number of papers the World Summit 2020 compared favorably to many other similar conferences including those organized by the United Nations and other international bodies.

Fourth the event introduced and emphasized in several sessions the theme of the peaceful unification of Korea. It was clear that the issue was in the minds and hearts of the organizers. It was also clear that the adjective “peaceful” was not included in vain and that aggressive attitudes against North Korea were carefully avoided. Korean unification is a tricky theme. Most papers avoided rhetoric and proposed common sense approaches many could agree with.

Conclusion: Why Do They Do It?

The UPF is a huge network and the Ambassadors for Peace come from very different nations cultures and religions. Those who have studied such organizations know that it is difficult if not impossible to gather a large number of diverse people under the flag of a common ideology.

Yet if there is no full-blown ideology there are certainly values proposed by the UPF. A basic idea is that world peace comes through dialogue cooperation service to others and actions guided by morality. Obviously the UPF is aware of the fact that in our pluralistic society very different ideas of morality coexist. The UPF tries to promote the general principle that morality has a spiritual dimension and we are all part of “one human family under God.” This may in fact displease atheists although dialogue with humanists and atheists is not excluded from the scope of UPF activities.

The formula “one human family under God” is part of Reverend Moon’s legacy as is an emphasis on the family as the school where love and peace can be learned. However the formula can be interpreted differently by Unificationists and non-Unificationists. Members of the Unification Church conceive the “one family” as a community acknowledging Reverend and Mrs. Moon as the True Parents with a messianic role for our era. On the other hand acknowledging the messianic role of the Moons is not necessary to believe that we are all part of one human family and should behave as such. This is an ideal that may appeal to women and men of all faiths.

One should not confuse the motivations of those promoting certain charitable and peace activities with the nature and effects of those activities. To use again an example we mentioned previously the Vatican executives and Catholic priests who launched and lead Caritas Internationalis were and are motivated by a Christian idea of responsibility toward the poor whom they consider as daughters and sons of God who have been redeemed by Jesus Christ. We may also speculate that those Catholic bishops and priests who work today for Caritas hope that their good deeds would benefit the image of the Catholic Church which has received its good share of negative publicity on other issues. On the other hand the rules of Caritas Internationalis strictly stipulate that the delivery of humanitarian aid should not be used as a proselytization tool for converting non-Catholics to Catholicism many who are not Catholics work with Caritas and its activities are generally praised as highly effective.

Similarly those Unificationists who lead UPF work for UPF and donate to UPF (for which contributions by private donors both members and non-members of the Unification Movement are important) are certainly motivated by Reverend and Mrs. Moon’s spiritual ideas. They do not hide it as our analysis of the 2020 event demonstrated. They are also aware that the UPF events benefit the image of Mrs. Moon as a leader with valuable ideas about international issues which can be appreciated also by many who do not share her theology. On the other hand it is also true that most of the UPF volunteers and Ambassadors for Peace are not members of the Unification Church and that the UPF is not intended nor used by its Unificationist members as a tool for proselytism.

Nor is UPF used to promote partisan political ideologies or parties. The expression “reductio ad Hitlerum” is widely used to indicate that to discredit certain movements or politicians their opponents try to associate them rightly or wrongly with Nazism. Today it may appear sometimes that there is also a “reductio ad Trump.” The former American President is so unpopular among many mainline media that it seems that to disqualify an organization it is enough to associate it with Trump. This is what happened to UPF after the 2021 Rally of Hope. Attacks based on Trump’s video participation in the event were either misinformed or malicious. Politicians of all political persuasions participated in this and other UPF events. And whatever the opinion one may have of Trump in a conference discussing the relationships between other countries and North Korea inviting a former American President who had been very much involved in Korean issues should not have been surprising.

In the end we are left with two irreconcilable narratives about UPF. One is that it is an NGO and think tank whose events are attended by prestigious leaders such as Ban Ki-moon and José Manuel Barroso and which offers interesting position papers lectures and documents on international peace and development issues including on the relations between North and South Korea. As many other similar organizations it has been promoted and is led by religionists who do not hide their religious motivations. However it includes many who do not share their religious beliefs and is not used as a tool for proselytization. For purposes of converting others to Unificationist theology the UPF would be a very ineffective tool. Those invited to the UPF activities are mostly political religious and civil society leaders with well-established ideas and worldviews. They are as far away as possible from the ideal type of the “seeker” looking for a new religion.

This narrative is shared by two organizations unlikely to be engaged in the promotion of “fronts” for “cults”: the United Nations and the Vatican. Many new religious movements created charitable and peace-promoting organizations. If they are active enough and no member state of the United Nations decides to oppose them they can achieve a Special Consultative Status at the ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council) of the U.N. As of January 7 2022 there were 5003 organizations with special consultative status at the ECOSOC. However there were only 140 NGOs with general consultative status (ECOSOC 2022).

General consultative status is reserved according to the ECOSOC to “fairly large established international NGOs with a broad geographical reach” which have offered “substantive and sustained contributions” to the aims of the United Nations in “several fields.” In 2018 the UPF was granted general consultative status at the ECOSOC a position that certainly is not allowed lightly and without a long and accurate observation and evaluation.

Leaders of NGOs and even of new religious movements routinely ask to be received in the Vatican and have a photo opportunity with the Pope. If they have sponsors the Vatican wants to accommodate they are normally invited to participate in the general audiences where the Pope meets collectively hundreds of people (and may take pictures with some of them).

Private audiences are an entirely different matter and go through a very complicated process of screening. The Vatican is aware that some organizations may use meetings and pictures for publicity purposes. When a meeting is approved by the Vatican’s Secretariat of State and by the Pope himself that it happened is publicized through the daily bulletin of the Holy See. The Holy See bulletin for July 1 2019 duly reported that Pope Francis had met in a private audience “Dr. Thomas G. Walsh President of the Universal Peace Federation” (Ufficio Stampa della Santa Sede 2019).

UPF delegation meets with H.H. Pope Francis Vatican July 1 2019.

Both at the United Nations and in the Vatican the UPF passed the highest level of screening tests. It would be unconceivable that the skilled U.N. and Vatican diplomats involved were not aware of the connection of the UPF with Reverend and Mrs. Moon. Yet they concluded in our opinion correctly that the UPF was not a proselytizing or publicity arm of the Unification Church but a respected NGO that had proved its usefulness and quality throughout the years.

The second narrative of which Paris Match offered an example is that the UPF is not what it claims to be but is just a “front” for the “Moon cult” (secte Moon) which hides proselytizing and advertising aims under a façade of care for international issues and humanitarian aid.

This White Paper should have persuaded our readers that the second narrative is both unfair and factually false. It is unfair because similar peace and cultural activities by mainline religions do not receive the same criticism. It is taken for granted that their activities on behalf of peace dialogue and social welfare are promoted in good faith out of a sincere desire for a better world rather than for self-promotion or proselytization purposes. Only the activities of new religious movements are accused of dissimulating hidden motivations.

Thus a vicious circle is created. If new religious movements only spend their time in missionary and religious activities it is objected that this is typical of “cults” while “real” religions care for larger issues and help fellow human beings. If they engage in charitable social or cultural activities it is argued that these are only “fronts” for proselytization and publicity.

The theory that the UPF organizes its activities for proselytization purposes on behalf of the Unification Church is also factually false and open to empirical disconfirmation. To the best of our knowledge none of the presidents prime ministers Nobel Prize laureates religious leaders and other participants in the UPF activities converted to the Unification Church. Not only is this theoretically unlikely. It simply did not happen in practice. It would also be difficult to argue that because of the UPF activities those who accuse the Unification Church of being “a cult” became less aggressive and indeed the contrary may well be true.

The conclusion seems to us unescapable. The UPF is an organization that has been founded by Reverend and Mrs. Moon and maintains members of the Unification Church among its leaders but is supported by the volunteer work of tens of thousands who in their majority are not Unificationists. Its purpose is not to convert others to the Unification Church nor to support any partisan political perspective but to promote high-level discussions about issues connected with world peace and support in different ways charitable and humanitarian initiatives.

The quality of its work has been recognized inter alia by the United Nations and the Vatican. To regard the world leaders who participate in its conferences and the more than 100000 Ambassadors for Peace as “puppets” of a “cult” is more than offensive. It is a ridiculous theory the fruit of the very bigotry and prejudices international organizations and friends of peace and dialogue should work tirelessly to eliminate.

Both the US and EU recovery plans mention the resilience of supply chains as a policy objective.1

We know from previous work that global value chains (GVCs) are a channel of the propagation of supply chain disruptions (Boehm et al. 2015 Carvalho et al. 2021). The propagation of shocks along GVCs has been pervasive in the wake of the Covid crisis (Baldwin and Freeman 2020 Bonadio et al. 2020 Gerschel et al. 2020 Meier and Pinto 2020 Heise 2020). In a recent paper (Lafrogne-Joussier et al. 2021) we go one step further in the analysis and investigate how firms involved in GVCs can mitigate the effect of supply chain disruptions. The goal is to contribute to the debate on the resilience of GVCs through a detailed analysis of the impact of an adverse supply shock its propagation along value chains and the types of buffers that help absorb the shock. We most notably focus on two such buffers: the geographic diversification of input sourcing and firms’ inventory management.

We find evidence that inventory management helped firms weather the supply shock induced by the Chinese lockdown in early 2020 while we find no evidence that geographic diversification helped. To understand how we get to this result let us first detail the quasi-natural experiment that we exploit.

The early lockdown in China as a case study of an input disruption

At the beginning of the Covid crisis was the lockdown in China. In late January 2020 factories in the province of Hubei were forced to slow down production after the Chinese New Year. Firms around the world relying on intermediate inputs manufactured in this province faced an input disruption while Covid was still largely restricted to China. The early lockdown in China thus provides a natural experiment of an upstream supply chain disruption faced by firms relying on China for their intermediate inputs.

Based on monthly data on firm-level imports exports and domestic sales we compare the performance of French firms exposed to the Chinese lockdown relative to other importing French firms in the first months of 2020. We rely on the trade activity of firms before the pandemic to identify those participating in GVCs. We compare the imports exports and domestic sales of GVC firms that rely on Chinese manufacturers for inputs (‘treated firms’) to the activity of comparable firms that purchase their inputs outside of China (‘control firms’) between February and June 2020.

The productivity slowdown in China indeed translated into in a 7% drop in overall imports for exposed firms in comparison with the control group. The volume of imports of treated firms starts decreasing as early as in February 2020 for firms that rely on air freight but the bulk of the effect is measured in March and April 2020 when imports by sea freight start decreasing as well.

Propagation of the supply shock

We next turn to the propagation of the shock downstream using the same empirical strategy. Figure 1 displays the time pattern of the drop in domestic and export sales of exposed firms relative to non-exposed firms. The overall size of the decrease is about 5% for both exports and domestic sales which means that the sales of exposed firms decreased by 5% more than the sales of control firms between February and June 2020. The shape of the drop is similar on domestic sales and exports suggesting that the export slowdown is not driven by firms substituting away from foreign markets to keep on serving their domestic partners. Most of the adjustment comes from firms suspending shipments towards some of their partners. These extensive margin adjustments may be indicative of French exporters prioritising some of their customers at a time of capacity constraints.

Figure 1 Log change in the level of domestic and export sales of treated relative to control firms 2019-2020

Note: The figure shows the dynamics of exports (solid red) and domestic sales (dashed blue) for firms exposed to the Chinese lockdown in comparison with firms not exposed to China. Spikes represent 95% confidence intervals.

We run a variety of exercises to verify that we do not conflate the adverse effect of the Chinese lockdown with other forces such as the seasonality of imports from China the impact of other shocks most notably the transmission of the pandemic to France and the rest of the world or the specific geography or product mix of firms importing from China.

What about inflation? In our paper we run difference-in-differences specifications at the firm-product level on import and export unit values. Whereas input disruptions appear to be inflationary in some sectors we do not find evidence of a pass-through of these cost adjustments to downstream partners. The propagation of the input disruption to downstream partners is entirely attributable to volume adjustments.

Heterogeneity of the transmission at the firm level: Benefits from mitigation strategies

Convinced that the Chinese lockdown has acted as a strong supply shock for French firms importing inputs from China we then investigate the heterogeneity in firms’ ability to absorb the consequences of unanticipated input disruptions.

We first assess whether firms holding a high level of inventories managed to absorb part of the shock. We find that precautionary inventory management helped firms mitigate the input disruption. Namely treated firms that display relatively high level of inventories in 2018 balance-sheet data display export performances in the aftermath of the shock that are indistinguishable from those of control firms. The entirety of the propagation is instead driven by firms with relatively low levels of inventories (Figure 2). This result echoes theoretical work emphasising the role of just-in-time production processes in enhancing short-term fluctuations and strengthening the business cycle (e.g. Ortiz 2021).

Figure 2 Log change in the level of export sales for high vs. low inventory treated firms

Note: The figure shows the dynamics of exports for firms exposed to the Chinese lockdown in comparison with firms not exposed to China. In red are exposed firms holding low inventories. In blue are exposed firms holding high inventories. Spikes represent 95% confidence intervals.

We then explore how diversification in firms’ value chains helped weather the supply shock. If firms had been able to substitute away from China when hit by the negative supply shock we would observe an increase in treated firms’ imports of inputs from non-Chinese input providers. We would moreover expect such substitution away from China to be easier for firms already involved in diversified supply chain relationships that imported the same input from more than one country prior to the shock. We do not observe any sizeable substitution away from China in the aftermath of the shock however including within the subset of treated firms that were geographically diversified ex ante. Therefore ex-ante diversified firms did not performed better than non-diversified treated firms when the shock hit (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Log change in the level of exports of diversified and non-diversified treated firms

Note: The figure shows the dynamics of exports for firms exposed to the Chinese lockdown in comparison with firms not exposed to China. In red are exposed firms that were not geographically diversified before the lockdown. In blue are exposed firms that were diversified. Spikes represent 95% confidence intervals.

A potential reason why we do not find a sizeable impact of diversification is that global value chains involve a strong degree of input specificity (Fujiy et al. 2021). Firms that we observe sourcing the same eight-digit product from two origin countries prior to the shock may purchase two versions of the same input that are not necessarily substitutable to each other. If it is the case then our measure of geographic diversification captures the fact that firms need tailored inputs for different production lines which would in turn explain that the relative drop in exports is in part driven by the product extensive margin: In the aftermath of the Chinese lockdown exposed firms are unable to produce certain products that require specific inputs sourced from China. Indeed we do find evidence of geographic diversification having more of an effect once we focus on homogenous products that are expected to be less prone to relationship-specific investment. Another (complementary) explanation is that firms that are not diversified ex-ante import inputs that can easily be sourced from other countries ex-post. We do observe within the group of treated firms that ex-ante non-diversified firms are more likely to start importing from a new origin country after February 2020 than ex-ante diversified exporters.

Concluding remarks

Our results provide novel evidence on the factors that are likely to improve the resilience of global supply chains to localised shocks. In presence of strongly specific input-output relationships diversifying supply chains may be costly for individual firms. Holding inventories has instead been an effective buffer for the adverse supply shock in the context of the early lockdown in China. Such a strategy might be costly in normal times and the development of just-in-time production processes suggests that holding inventories may not be optimal for individual firms. However the potential losses due to a synchronised disruption of firm-level activities in a country can greatly exceed the sum of individual losses. Governments may thus consider giving incentives to firms to depart from just-in-time organisation of production – especially for firms engaged in the production of critical products.

Indigenous languages are crucial for the overall well-being and identity of indigenous peoples –not only as a means of communication but also as a repository of knowledge on their inter-relationships with their lands and resources the environment as well as for their understanding of the worldview.

This publication has come at a time when the International Decade on Indigenous Languages has just been launched. The United Nations General Assembly (Resolution A/RES/74/135) proclaimed the period between 2022 and 2032 as the International Decade of Indigenous Languages (IDIL 2022-2032) to draw global attention on the critical situation of many indigenous languages and to mobilize stakeholders and resources for their preservation revitalization and promotion.

This Decade aims at ensuring indigenous peoples’ right to preserve revitalize and promote their languages and mainstreaming linguistic diversity and multilingualism aspects into the sustainable development efforts. It offers a unique opportunity to collaborate in the areas of policy development and stimulate a global dialogue in a true spirit of multi-stakeholder engagement and to take necessary for the usage preservation revitalization and promotion of indigenous languages around the world.

In line with the objectives of the International Decade this briefing paper will help as a tool in Asia that will contribute to building a global community for indigenous languages facilitate information-sharing on activities and events organized at the different levels promote relevant resources report and monitor progress made and create new opportunities for exchange and dialogue among a wide network of stakeholders.

Currently 40 per cent of doctors on the GMC register hold primary medical degrees from foreign universities.[1] Overseas recruitment campaigns are a short term tool for filling rota gaps. In 2019 NHS Improvement set a target of recruiting 5000 foreign nurses every year until 2024.[2] The 2019 Conservative party manifesto also committed to recruiting 50000 nurses.[3]

NHS trusts have autonomy when it comes to international recruitment and can choose whether they prefer to outsource campaigns to agencies or not. However trusts in England can only use agencies approved by NHS Employers[4] and should abide by nationally-set recruitment rules. These include avoiding developing countries[5] unless the UK government has an agreement with one of them as in the case of the Philippines.[6]

Given an increased emphasis on targeted overseas recruitment by workforce planners – and the degree of discretion trusts exercise over the process – this paper compares the varied approaches taken by acute NHS trusts in England over a three-year period.

Key findings

Acute NHS trusts in England spent at least £3347084 on overseas recruitment of nurses doctors and allied health professionals.

IPG,Interpublic Group of Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXNjZW5lcy1vZi1waGFybWFjZXV0aWNhbC1naWFudC1zYW5vZmlzLXJlYnJhbmRpbmcvNDc1NjI20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Behind the scenes of pharmaceutical giant Sanofi’s rebranding | Marketing,"Under the changes Sanofi’s sub brands which include Sanofi Pasteur and Sanofi Genzyme will be united under the Sanofi brand. Internally staffers will continue to work under one of four global business units: Pasteur is the vaccines business unit and Genzyme is the specialty care business unit. The other two units are general medicine and consumer healthcare.

The refreshed branding represents the integrated way in which the company will work to achieve its ambition to transform the practice of medicine.

Sanofi embarked on these changes because it lost its stakeholders with multiple names said Josep Catllà head of corporate affairs at Sanofi.

“This is the only big pharma company remaining that still has such a broad portfolio. We want to be in every space that goes from prevention with vaccines to the more extreme rare diseases of the other side of the business to everything in the middle from oncology to [multiple sclerosis]. Our portfolio is the result of 50 years of more than 500 mergers and acquisitions.”

However when Sanofi acquired a company it didn’t change the culture look and feel of that company’s purpose with Catlla saying the company has been “very fragmented over the last few years in that sense.”

Sanofi wanted to find a theme that unites and connects all of its businesses and employees. The company listened to stakeholders both internally and externally including healthcare and patient communities. Out of that it came up with a new purpose which is that Sanofi “chases the miracle of science to improve people’s lives” said Catlla.

Some feedback it received: using the words “miracle” and “science” together may be seen as provocative since science is rational and data-driven and miracles are more aspirational.

“Yes science is very exact but the effects of science can be super-emotional to the point where they are seen as a miracle” said Catllà. For example when paracetamol makes a bad headache go away it can feel like a miracle to patients.

Sanofi used the word “chasing” in its purpose statement because when a company chases something it means it is determined and resilient to obtain it said Catlla.

Sanofi wanted to get away from typical pharma jargon that leans on outcomes and impacting patients.

“Improving people’s lives is more genuine to what we do” said Catllà. “In some cases we cure in others we bring better health or life extension but in all the cases we bring hope to people.”

Sanofi has also revealed a new logo which was “inspired by the simple and motion-oriented codes of the tech industry” it said in a statement. The two purple dots embody the scientific journey between a starting point — wondering “what if?” — and a finish line. In other words the eureka moment where innovative solutions are unlocked to impact people’s lives.

Sanofi started to think about itself differently when CEO Paul Hudson joined the company in 2019. That December Sanofi launched its Play to Win strategy which focuses on applying its platform for innovation to produce first- and best-in-class treatments and vaccines.

While business names are changing the internal structure and reporting lines will remain the same and there will be no layoffs or people moves in relation to the changes.

“This helps to position the comms team in a much more strategic manner throughout the company” Catllà said.

To promote the rebranding Sanofi is launching a series of films internally and externally with employees talking about the company “to tell our own story” said Catllà. Staffers discuss why they work at Sanofi and what they love about their jobs.

One employee is a scientist who had cancer “so she can talk to you as a researcher and also as a patient” said Catllà. Others discuss how personal passions for dance and boxing link to their roles.

“We have one single brand film now but we will reveal individual stories of all the people in that film in the next few months so they can tell us more” said Catllà.

Hudson sent a note to all employees on Thursday about the changes including the brand film. Sanofi also rebranded all of its social media channels on Thursday.

Why has our logo changed?

Because we have changed.

Despite having different pasts and traveling different paths we've arrived at a new shared purpose:

We chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives. #WeNeverSettle

This year inventory sold like gridiron hotcakes. Prices for a 30-second spot soared to $6.5m and all of the glitz and glamor of these high-profile ads is unfolding before our eyes. Here is all of the latest news about the plays marketers are drawing up for Super Bowl LVI.

Welcome to The Drum’s Super Bowl LVI ad scoreboard. Here we will track all of the brand action leading up to the big game on February 13. Check back early and often.

Suiting up:

Amazon Prime Video

Prime Video has announced it will air a Super Bowl ad this year to promote Thursday Night Football which is slated to move from Fox to Prime Video beginning in September. The move represents the NFL’s first exclusive national broadcast contract with a streaming provider. As part of Prime Video’s Thursday Night Football programming Prime Video has announced that it also plans to host pregame halftime and post-game shows. It will also offer new interactive viewing features yet to be disclosed. The Super Bowl LVI spot was created in tandem with Wieden+Kennedy and features real fans. It follows up the brand’s 2021 stunt a promo for “Coming 2 America” starring Eddie Murphy.

Anheuser-Busch

Beer behemoth Anheuser-Busch which owns Budweiser Michelob Busch Shock Top and other top beer brands returns to Super Bowl LVI this year after renewing its contract with the NFL in a multi-year extension signed in December. In a statement both the NFL and Anheuser-Busch indicated that the new contract “will include many new opportunities for the Anheuser-Busch brands led by Bud Light that will continue growing excitement among NFL fans.”

Avocados from Mexico

After a hiatus last year following a six-year participation streak Avocados from Mexico is back to the big game. It has released a teaser for its spot which sees comedy icon Andy Richter preparing to play Caesar. In full garb Richter looks into his dressing room mirror and tries to hype himself up for the part. The spot also debuts the brand’s new messaging platform “Addvocados” which endorses the idea that the smooth green fruit (yes avocados are a fruit) enhances any dish. Amidst all the action the brand has also launched ‘House of Goodness’ an immersive digital experience hosted by ex-NFLer Drew Brees. Avocados from Mexico has also rolled out in-store QR codes that direct shoppers to the brand’s website and also announced a new partnership with MikMak a firm that helps brands accelerate their e-commerce capabilities. The brand which according to data from Hass Avocado Board is responsible for 95% of avocado sales in the US has for many years hinged its growth on Super Bowl retail surges.

BIC

BIC lighters is advertising at this year's big game with the dynamic duo that is Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart. In the spot the rapper makes his way through a cloud of smoke. ""Yo Martha I didn’t know you was into this!” Stewart lifts the lid of her grill replying ""You mean smoking a turkey?"" She then offers a glowing endorsement of using a BIC EZ Reach lighter. The spot ends with Snoop suggesting that they both use the lighter for partaking in their favorite activities. The pair have appeared in BIC ads together in the past the most recently being a May 2021 spot in which they shared a 'bowl' of strawberries and fondue together. The two will also team up to host Animal Planet's annual Puppy Bowl for the second year in a row. The 80 year-old and 50 year-old will also reportedly 'coach' some of the pups partaking in the match.

BMW

BMW is back this year with a campaign headlined by A-listers Arnold Schwarzenegger and Salma Hayek Pinault who respectively star as the Greek god and goddess Zeus and Hera. The brand on February 2 released a 30-second teaser for the ad which promotes a new fully-electric model yet to be revealed. The teaser follows a January 27 Instagram post by Schwarzenegger that left fans wondering if they could expect a new Zeus-focused blockbuster in February. The ad campaign was developed with the help of creatives at AOR Goodby Silverstein & Partners.

Booking.com

As part of its larger strategy to entice traveling following pandemic blues Booking.com has purchased a 30-second spot in this year’s game. The brand is likely feeling the pressure as the category grows increasingly cutthroat; competitor Expedia will also have a Super Bowl presence.

Bud Light Seltzer

Bud Light on February 1 unveiled its Super Bowl LVI spot starring none other than celebrity chef and meme inspiration Guy Fieri. The minute-long spot sees party-goers transported to a magical place dubbed the Land of Loud Flavors which is naturally teeming with diners drive-ins and dives. And according to the beer brand it’s the obvious home for the boldly flavored Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda. As part of the campaign Bud Light Seltzer and Guy Fieri are giving fans a chance to see their name in lights at Super Bowl LVI. Through February 8 fans are invited to enter the ‘Get Your Name in the Big Game’ sweepstakes by posting on social media and using the hashtags #LandofLoudFlavors and #Sweepstakes.

Budweiser

Budweiser has unveiled its full-length Super Bowl spot after dropping two separate teasers within the last two weeks. Titled ‘A Clydesdale’s Journey’ the ad follows the story of the brand’s iconic mascot recovering after a devastating injury. The brand said in a statement that the ad directed by Academy Award-winner and Nomadland director Chloé Zhao is meant to embody “the continued resilience of the people of America.” The implications of the country’s ongoing recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic are apparent. The brand also said Zhao’s signature gritty style sets a new visual tone for the brand that will feature “a more bold and raw aesthetic.” The brewer a longtime staple at the big game returns after it sat out last year — choosing to spend its ad dollars on Covid vaccine awareness and access instead — after an unbroken 37-year run.

Busch Light

AB InBev-owned Busch Light will make a Super Bowl appearance with Grammy-winning saxophone musician Kenny G. The spot unveiled January 31 serves as a nod to Busch’s marketing origins by recycling “Head for the Mountains"" a number that originally accompanied a Busch ad from over 40 years ago. The Super Bowl spot tops of a historic year of sales for the beer brand. David Steinman vice president and executive director at Beer Marketer’s Insights told The Drum: “Busch Light is outperforming every single low-end brand. AB is keeping Busch Light high on its priority list.”

Caesars

Sports betting brand Caesars Sportsbook part of Caesars Entertainment — which includes a network of hotels and casinos — plans to run a 30-second spot in the first half of Super Bowl LVI. It will star Halle Berry JB Smoove and Peyton Eli Archie and Cooper Manning. Caesars is the NFL's exclusive casino sponsor.

Expedia

Expedia Group – which owns Orbitz Travelocity Hotels.com Hotwire and other travel brands – is also going all-in on the February 13 event. It not only secured a mid-game spot to promote its booking site Expedia but also plans to advertise its Airbnb challenger Vrbo in a pre-game spot. Expedia on February 2 debuted a behind-the-scenes teaser starring Ewan McGregor who endorses the magic of travel in recounting his memories of traveling from Scotland to France with his parents. “This is really just a vote of confidence in the travel category coming back” Jon Gieselman Expedia Brands president told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. Alongside the ad the travel brand will incentivize new sign-ups by offering exclusive mid-game giveaways of travel points for Expedia members. The campaign was developed with help from Anomaly.

DraftKings

2022 marks the second consecutive year that sports betting and fantasy sports platform DraftKings will partake in the Super Bowl. The spot will air mere weeks after New York became the 18th state to legalize online sports betting.

Frito-Lay

Snack giant Frito-Lay is going big on this year’s big game. To kick things off Frito-Lay partnered up with its parent company PepsiCo to launch a cheeky spot titled ‘Road to Super Bowl LVI’ starring Peyton and Eli Manning Terry Bradshaw Jerome ‘The Bus’ Bettis and Victor Cruz. The spot which aims to position a smattering of popular PepsiCo and Frito-Lay products as Super Bowl party necessities will run from mid-January through Super Bowl Sunday. A handful of Frito-Lay brands including Doritos and Flamin’ Hot Cheetos will have their own mid-game ads.

Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Doritos

Frito-Lay has tapped rapper and internet queen Megan Thee Stallion to serve as the face of its Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Doritos Super Bowl spot. On January 19 the brand dropped one of three teasers for the ad; in it Megan arrives at her Super Bowl photo shoot munching on a bag of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. To prepare her a handler checks to make sure she has no allergies to sloths or water buffaloes and that she’s comfortable working with crocodiles. “A croc-a-what?” exclaims the rapper. The spot closes with the tagline: ‘Unleash your Flamin’ Hot.’ The spot comes on the tails of a recent portfolio expansion; Frito-Lay debuted its new Doritos Flamin’ Hot Cool Ranch last month.

After releasing three separate teasers for its campaign Frito-Lay’s Flamin’ Hot label on February 1 dropped its full-length 60-second Super Bowl spot that features the vocal stylings of Megan Thee Stallion and beatboxing by Charlie Puth. Created in tandem with Goodby Silverstein & Partners and directed by Tom Kuntz the spot sees a cast of curious animals — from sloths and deer to water buffaloes and bears get their paws (and hooves and feet) on Flamin’ Hot Doritos and Cheetos. Their surprise and delight is magnified by Megan The Stallion’s and Charlie Puth’s rendition of Salt-N-Pepa’s 80s hit ‘Push It.’ 2022 will be the first year that Flamin’ Hot will have its own in-game spot featuring both its Cheetos and Doritos products. The spot is meant to create hype around the recently released Doritos Flamin’ Hot Cool Ranch flavor.

Lay’s

Frito-Lay mainstay Lay’s is making its grand return to gameday screens after 17 years. To usher in its big return the brand has tapped Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. Following the release of two seperate teasers Lay's unveiled the full-length spot on February 2. Made in partnership with creatives at Highdive the ad sees the two stars munching on Lay's and reminiscing on their favorite memories together — which include everything from a road trip to a kidnapping — as Rogen prepares to tie the knot. Rogen developed the script alongside his creative partner Evan Goldberg. The snack aisle staple brand also recently debuted its limited-edition potato chip made with potatoes grown in soil extracted from NFL stadiums for super fans and the superstitious alike.

Kia

Kia America has secured a 60-second spot in this year’s big game to promote its all-electric Kia EV6. The ad released February 4 following a teaser features an adorable robotic puppy who upon seeing a man charge his EV6 feels he’s found his ideal human buddy and follows him relentlessly until he makes it into the man’s life — and car. Super Bowl LVI will mark the brand’s 13th big game appearance a number of which have focused on the company’s various ‘Accelerate the Good’ philanthropic ventures including the ‘Great Unknowns Scholarship’ program which funded educational assistance for students in need and the ‘Yards for Homelessness’ project that offers resources for US youth experiencing homelessness. This year’s ad was created in partnership with El Segundo California-based branding agency David&Goliath.

General Motors

American automaker GM is returning for its third consecutive Super Bowl following a third quarter that saw the company’s revenues top analysts’ projections. GM could be in an especially favorable position at February’s event considering that competitors Audi and Hyundai – both of which have been regular Super Bowl advertisers – have opted to sit on the sidelines this year. Nissan and Toyota however will make appearances.

Gillette

Procter & Gamble razor brand Gillette is returning to the big game after a 16 year dry spell. The brand is making a comeback to promote its new GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar. The brand will air a 30-second spot that aims to stress the simplicity and speed of using the razor. Featuring the tagline ’A quick and easy shave’ the spot was created in partnership with creatives at Grey Advertising. The campaign will be augmented with various activations in Los Angeles throughout Super Bowl weekend including a branded roller skating event that suggests shaving with the GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar is as smooth as gliding across the roller disco floor.

Google

Google is returning to the Super Bowl after sitting out last year’s event per reports from Ad Age. The tech titan has yet to share details of its plans. In 2020 the company ran a tearjerker that promoted the company’s digital search and Google Assistant capabilities through the story of an elderly man trying to ensure he doesn’t forget his long-time partner.

Hellmann's

Unilever's condiment brand Hellman's is back for its second consecutive year with a spot created by WPP-owned Wunderman Thompson. The ad stars New England Patriots linebacker coach and former NFL star Jerod Mayo who is tapped by the fictional Terry Tate — the iconic 'Office Linebacker' character from early-2000s Reebok ads played by former NFLer Lester Speight — to tackle the challenge of combatting food waste. Unilever suggests that 40% of all food waste occurs within households and that major food events like the Super Bowl exacerbate the problem. At the same time Hellmann's is likely to continue to see sales surge thanks to pandemic-related upticks in condiment consumption.

Meta

Following its major rebrand that has come with not only a new name but a new vision for the future of the company Meta (formerly Facebook) has announced it will return to the big game after a hiatus last year. The tech giant on February 2 debuted a teaser for its ad which spotlights the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset. It will not only air an ad during the first quarter of the big game but also plans to run a full version of the teaser “Old Friends New Fun” on ABC’s Good Morning America ahead of the event on February 10. The brand worked with Anomaly to bring the spot to life. Increasing ad spend may help improve brand image on the tails of a post-rebrand stock spike that has since fizzled.

Monday.com

Sneak Peak! Here's a behind the scenes of how we created a world without limits for our Big Game spot ️#WorkWithoutLimits #BigGameSpot #mondaydotcom #WorkOS pic.twitter.com/pvw2F8LJG8 — monday.com (@mondaydotcom) January 25 2022

Cloud work management software company monday.com on January 25 announced it would be participating in Super Bowl LVI. monday.com teamed up with content agency Mustache to develop the spot. It released a behind-the-scenes teaser for the ad across its social platforms explaining that it took two directors five scripts and 95 crew members 10 stunt performers and much more to bring the concept to life. The whole project was of course created and managed through monday.com. It’s a step up from the brand’s first ad which run in 2018 had about a $50 budget. NFL The NFL will advertise during its own event this year. Though it’s unclear what the spot will look like the brand has in recent years focused on boosting fan engagement and improving its brand image through tactics focused on connecting real players with consumers in fun accessible ways through various media and fashion activations. Nissan

Japanese automaker Nissan returns to this year’s game for the first time since 2015. The brand has released its 60-second spot entitled ‘Thrill Driver’ an action flick-inspired film featuring A-listers Eugene Levy Brie Larson Danai Gurira and Dave Bautista. The ad developed in partnership with TBWA/Chiat/Day promotes both the new Ariya an electric crossover and the 2023 Nissan Z. The brand’s US chief marketer Allyson Witherspoon told Ad Age in December “Super Bowl isn’t something that we always do… but it is something we felt was important for this year. We have one of the freshest lineups in the industry and so we want… an opportunity on a platform such as Super Bowl to show what we have been up to as a brand.” Oikos

Greek yogurt brand Oikos is back for its third consecutive big game. The ad released February 2 stars father-and-son duo Deion ‘Prime Time’ Sanders and Shedeur Sanders. The two go head-to-head in a domestic chore competition taking on raking wood-chopping and car maintenance while trying to out-manpower one another. The brand positions its sugar- and fat-free Oikos Triple Zero and Oikos Pro as healthy snacks that go well with high-intensity labor and exercise — even if they can’t promise Herculean strength. The yogurt brand is also launching a sweepstakes in which consumers can win a limited-edition Strong Bowl billed as a “​first-of-its-kind super heavy bowl that holds your Oikos product and doubles as a 15lb weight — so you can get some reps in before the coin toss and chip dip.” Pepsi

Pepsi is the Super Bowl LVI halftime show sponsor. The brand is promoting the show starring Snoop Dogg Eminem Dr. Dre Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar through its new Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show mobile app which includes sweepstakes opportunities behind-the-scenes content creative drops augmented reality (AR) features and unique digital experiences leading up to the show. Pepsi has yet to reveal which of its brands will appear in TV spots during the telecast. In a statement shared with The Drum however the company asserted that 90% of households “will be enjoying snacks and beverages together on Super Bowl Sunday” indicating that it understands the valuable opportunities presented for its brands. Planet Fitness

Planet Fitness’ Super Bowl LVI spot pokes fun at Lindsay Lohan’s spotted past daring to ask “What’s gotten into Lindsay Lohan?” The ad created in partnership with Le Truc and AOR Publicis New York features the star herself. It depicts the actress feeling the positive effects of a newly active lifestyle: she’s trading nightclubs for good sleep and DUIs for DIY projects. Planet Fitness is this year celebrating its 30th anniversary.

Pringles

Kellogg’s Pringles will make a Super Bowl appearance for its fifth straight year with a 30-second spot developed in conjunction with creatives at WPP’s New York-based Grey Group. The brand’s 2021 spot tapped into hype around aliens SpaceX Blue Origin and a renewed cultural interest in space – mere months before the US government revealed it has long-standing evidence of UFOs – with a lighthearted tale of aerospace engineers getting distracted from important missions by the joy of stacking different flavors of Pringles to create new combos.

Salesforce

Web software company Salesforce has a new brand partner and advisor: actor Matthew McConaughey. On February 4 the brand launched its new global ad campaign ‘#TeamEarth’. In a statement the brand said the campaign “aims to inspire businesses and individuals to help build a more fair equal and sustainable future.” It kicked off the campaign with a TV spot starring McConaughey that will air during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. The ad will also appear during Super Bowl LVI.

Squarespace

Squarespace in 2022 will continue its tradition of advertising at the big game— it has made an appearance each year since 2014 with the exception of 2019. On February 3 the brand unveiled a 10-second teaser for the spot headlined by Euphoria star Zendaya cast in a mermaid-like look. The teaser features the tagline: “Everything to sell anything” which then transforms to read: “Everything to shell anything.” This year’s spot is the brand’s first creative to come out of its new Los Angeles office.

Taco Bell

Fast food chain Taco Bell will make an appearance at Super Bowl LVI; it will be the brand’s first such effort in five years. Created in conjunction with Deutsch LA the spot aims to put a fresh spin on the brand’s Live Más slogan which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary. It will star rapper and pop artist Doja Cat. The announcement comes on the heels of a couple of major developments for the brand – the December appointment of ex-Nike exec Sean Tresvant as chief brand officer and the more recent rollout of the Taco Lover’s Pass a $10-per-month taco subscription service. The brand’s Super Bowl spot could further fan the flames of brand love.

Toyota

Toyota has said it will return to the big game this year though it has shared few details. The brand has in past years had a major presence at the event airing two ads in 2015 and three ads in 2018. The brand last year ran a touching spot celebrating the story of Team Toyota athlete Jessica Long a paralympic swimmer. Toyota like other carmakers has fared much better than Wall Street predicted in the last year or so (Q3 earnings indicate that topline revenue jumped over 7% year-on-year). Super Bowl exposure certainly won’t hamper this growth.

Telemundo

Telemundo has unveiled its Super Bowl LVI spot a high-energy ad promoting the 2022 World Cup featuring iconic sports announcer Andres Cantor. In the spot Cantor ignites a global wave of his signature “Goooooooooool” cry with clips of everyone from soccer stars yogis and choir singers to Kelly Clarkson Blake Shelton and the Despicable Me minions chiming in. The spot builds on the network’s 2018 Super Bowl ad featuring the same refrain. At this year’s big game Telemundo and Universo will offer exclusive Spanish-language coverage ahead of the game led by Emmy-winning sports anchor Miguel Gurwitz. The new ad was created by Telemundo’s in-house team.

TurboTax

Intuit-owned TurboTax returns in 2022 for its ninth Super Bowl in a row. In partnership with creatives at Wieden+Kennedy Portland the brand will promote its tax-filing services ahead of Tax Day in April. But the spot won’t be the brand’s only presence during NFL playoffs this year; TurboTax Live is the lead sponsor of the playoff and postseason title games for both the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference.

Turkish Airlines

Turkish Airlines will join a handful of other travel brands at Super Bowl LVI. The brand makes its appearance after two years off. Travel is set to make a major comeback in 2022 — recent Tripadvisor research indicates that this year’s travel numbers are likely to surpass those of pre-pandemic 2019. In anticipation of the boom travel brands like Turkish Airlines are sure to be competing harder than ever for consumer dollars.

Uber Eats

Uber Eats has released a handful of rollicking teasers for its Super Bowl spot that sees stars including Gwyneth Paltrow Trevor Noah and Jennifer Coolidge sampling inedible goods that were delivered alongside their foodstuffs. In one clip Paltrow takes a bite out of a candle declaring that it tastes “funny — not bad but funny.” The campaign highlights Uber Eats’ transformation to food delivery service to well anything-you-might-need delivery service. The full spot was concepted in partnership with Special Group and was directed by Jake Szymanski known for his work for SNL Digital Shorts and Funny or Die. The campaign will also encompass out-of-home elements including creative featuring the same A-listers as well as shopping bags emblazoned with the tagline “Uber Don’t Eats”.

Vrbo

Expedia Group-owned vacation rental platform Vrbo has unleased its 60-second Super Bowl LVI pregame spot created in partnership with Wieden+Kennedy. Titled 'A Place For Together' the ad is a heartwarming display of the joys of gathering with loved ones and friends — set against Kermit the Frog's ""Right Where I Belong"" from The Muppets Take Manhattan. ""When traveling with Vrbo who you're with matters just as much as where you go"" Hector Muelas Expedia Group's senior vice-president of global creative said in a statement. ""Our definition of family isn't limited to people you're related to; it includes anyone you love spending time with.""

Vroom

New York-based used car retailer and e-commerce platform Vroom is suiting up for its second year running. The brand on January 20 unveiled its Broadway-inspired spot with choreography by La La Land choreographer Mandy Moore. In a statement shared with The Drum a brand spokesperson said the spot is mean to ""illustrate the rollercoaster of emotions that car sellers feel when they find a buyer on a peer-to-peer site who flakes on the transaction."" The effort could help Vroom maintain its e-commerce momentum; in the third quarter of 2021 the company reported that e-commerce unit sales were up 123% year-on-year. WeatherTech Automotive equipment and accessories company WeatherTech is making its ninth appearance at the Super Bowl and is following up its performance last year when it ran two mid-game ads with a new spot created in partnership with the full-service agency Pinnacle.

Newcomers to the big game:

Sam's Club

Grocery chain Sam’s Club will make its first foray into Super Bowl advertising this February with a playful spot starring Kevin Hart. Made in conjunction with VMLY&R with help from Hart’s company Laugh Out Loud Network the ad depicts Hart shopping in Sam’s Club. Hart believes he’s receiving VIP treatment throughout the store — he mistakes an outdoor furniture staging as a VIP lounge and thinks he’s allowed to use the store’s Scan & Go option (rather than wait in the checkout line) because he’s a celebrity. Little does he know that Sam’s Club treats all its members like this. In a statement the brand said “Kevin’s authenticity and humor made him the perfect fit for the warehouse retailer who is continuing to experiment with new ways to reach members while highlighting the benefits of being part of the club.” The retailer has hinted at additional gameday VIP offers but has yet to share details. Carvana

Popular online car marketplace Carvana is making its first foray in Super Bowl advertising this year. The 30-second spot plays on a concept many consumers can relate to: a chatty mom. The ad called “Oversharing Mom” depicts a mother who won’t stop raving about her recent purchase of a Mini Cooper on Carvana. She extolls the customer service and ease of the whole ordeal — selling points that the brand is focused on promoting as competitive differentiators in the used car space. The brand is a direct competitor of another Super Bowl LVI advertiser: Vroom. ClickUp

Project management platform ClickUp has unveiled its first-ever Super Bowl spot a mere three months after closing its Series C funding round which raked in $400m. The new ad created almost entirely by the brand's in-house team is a rollicking reimagination of the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence. In it a bumbling John Hancock seems to have misplaced the latest version of the document to the great distress of all his colleagues. Luckily ""Tommy"" a youthful redheaded rendition of Thomas Jefferson has saved the task on ClickUp. When one of the Founding Fathers goes to sign with a feathered quill Jefferson butts in: ""No no no no — just click!"" The document is signed and the group rejoices. Crypto.com The popular cryptocurrency marketplace which has witnessed incredible growth in the past year-plus will make its Super Bowl debut this year. The move comes after the company shelled out $700m to rebrand the Staples Center the Crypto.com Arena and announced it will also sponsor the city’s new professional women’s soccer team the Angel City Football Club. FTX Another manifestation of the boom of crypto Bahamian-based exchange FTX will run an ad at this year’s big game. Chief exec Sam Bankman-Fried said to Bloomberg: “There is no bigger more mainstream event to share a message like that than the Super Bowl.” Bankman-Fried owns the title of the richest person in crypto today. Intuit QuickBooks Accounting software QuickBooks which is owned by Intuit plans to air an ad at Super Bowl LVI as part of its ongoing ‘Early Start’ campaign which aims to shine a spotlight on the double-edged-sword nature of small business ownership and promote QuickBooks tools for new small businesses. Intuit predicts that this year more than 17m new small businesses will be launched representing a much higher rate than has been seen in recent years. “Many of these new entrepreneurs will be watching the big game and as they begin their journeys we want to make sure we’re supporting them with the confidence to start and grow their business from day one with QuickBooks and [our recent acquisition] MailChimp” Javier Martin QuickBooks’ global brand development director told The Drum. Intuit has previously run Super Bowl ads for its brand but this will be QuickBooks’s first foray. The company will also put out a Super Bowl spot for another one of its brands TurboTax. Rakuten

Rakuten Rewards a US branch of Japanese e-commerce titan Rakuten plans to join in on the fun with an ad that builds on Rakuten’s recent rebrand including its new creative platform and slogan ‘We bring the Cha-ching.’ The brand’s vice-president of brand and creative Victoria McRae told The Drum that this concept offered the perfect foundation on which to build the campaign because it ties the feeling of getting cash back to winning or scoring a good deal. “What better place to share that emotion than at the Super Bowl?” A team of in-house creatives developed the spot for which Rakuten Rewards unveiled a teaser featuring Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham. In it Waddingham is seen practicing her deliciously evil laugh in a dressing room mirror before experiencing a minor hiccup. Hologic In its first-ever consumer advertising effort Hologic a medical tech company focused primarily on improving women’s health will run a 30-second spot during the first half of Super Bowl LVI. The spot which was brought to life by CHÉ Creative and directed by popular commercial and music video director child. is meant to express that if the always-booked-and-busy Mary J. Blige can make time to get her annual women’s health screenings then regular patients can too. The brand told The Drum that Blige was the right spokesperson for the campaign because she has a track record of advocating for women’s health issues among Black women through the Black Women’s Health Imperative and with Hologic’s Project Health Equality program. The effort is part of Hologic’s broader Well-Woman campaign which includes resources to help people learn about different types of diagnostic screenings for women. The initiative was developed after Hologic found in its proprietary research that nearly 50% of American women it surveyed did not get their annual health screenings in the last year. In addition to airing nationally during the game the ad will run from February 13-20 in select local markets. Hologic also plans to advertise during the Winter Olympics in an effort to reach as wide a market as possible. Wallbox Barcelona-based electric vehicle (EV) charging brand Wallbox will this year make its Super Bowl debut with the brand’s chief marketer Barbara Calixto telling Ad Age: “The US is going to be one of the largest markets for EVs in the coming years. We’re going to the Super Bowl because that’s where our consumers are. Any potential EV car buyer is a potential Wallbox buyer as well.” The company offers charging equipment for various private and public applications.

Sitting on the sidelines:

Chipotle Chipotle the fast-casual chain that last year jumped on CBS’s reduced price tags on Super Bowl spots will sit out this year’s big game despite seeing strong growth during the pandemic (2021 third-quarter earnings indicate that revenue was up almost 22% year-on-year). Coca-Cola Coca-Cola announced that they will be punting on the game. After all PepsiCo is blistering the airwaves and Interwebs with promos for its Pepsi half-time show. Other PepsiCo brands are likely to bask in the Super Bowl spotlight as well. Fiverr B2B brand Fiverr which has invested a lot in recent advertising efforts has decided to surpass opportunities presented by this year’s game. Last year the company’s chief marketer Gail Arnon struck a different tune telling The Drum in January: “We obviously want to be and are aspiring to be one of the biggest brands out there so the Super Bowl is the stage for us.” Hyundai Carmaker Hyundai will not air an ad during Super Bowl LVI marking its second year out of the spotlight. Prior to last year the brand had run ads in 12 of the previous 15 Super Bowls. Kraft Heinz In a similar vein as Hyundai Kraft Heinz will sit out this year’s game for the second year running. The decision is a far cry from the brand’s previous strategy; in 2020 Heinz went all-in running four unique spots at the same time in a split-screen mashup while the company’s popular peanut brand Planters also aired a spot. Lexus Toyota-owned Lexus which first made its Super Bowl debut 10 years ago will sit out this year’s event. Mars Wrigley Candy giant Mars Wrigley which owns brands including M&M’s Skittles and Snickers will pass up this year’s event having previously participated in 12 consecutive Super Bowl games. Tide A surprising development considering the brand has in recent years established a notable presence at the event Tide plans to sit on the sidelines in 2022. Last year it garnered laughs with its wacky Jason Alexander hoodie spot.

Other noteworthy activations:

Animal Planet The network plans to offer a series of NFT trading cards to promote its annual Puppy Bowl event. The move adds to a growing wave of branded NFT offerings as crypto markets heat up. Twitter Twitter on January 31 called for fans to tweet their ""wildest Super Bowl predictions"" in six or fewer words. The social network says it will project select tweets on the roof of SoFi stadium in Inglewood California during the game. The move adds to a pattern of Super Bowl activations for the brand; in 2020 and 2021 Twitter teamed up with NFL to drop confetti containing fans' tweets after the big game. State Farm

Instead of running a traditional in-game ad (few can forget Super Bowl LV’s ‘Drake From State Farm’ spot featuring the Canadian rapper alongside Patrick Mahomes Aaron Rodgers and Paul Rudd) the insurance firm is launching a TikTok challenge. The #TeamStateFarm challenge sees the iconic brand voice Jake from State Farm play a talent scout on the lookout for TikTok’s best and brightest — to star in a commercial alongside him. In a campaign video Jake invites users to use the platform’s ‘Duet’ feature to show him what they’ve got. Winners will have the opportunity to join a special meet and greet with Jake and will have their own role in an upcoming State Farm commercial.

Subway

Popular fast-casual franchise Subway has launched 'The Vault' an exclusive new menu featuring sandwiches created by top US athletes available only online and through the Subway app. Three of the new subs were created by NFLers Russell Wilson Marshawn Lynch and Trevor Lawrence. To turn up the excitement Subway is offering fans the chance to enter the 'Subway Vault' at the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s in Los Angeles and potentially win a sandwich signed by one of the three football superstars. “Our athlete partners are some of our most passionate Subway fans so it was a natural fit to create a collection of their favorite sandwiches and Super Bowl LVI is the ideal location to introduce these sandwiches and The Vault to our fans” said Carrie Walsh Subway's global chief marketing officer in a statement.

Quaker

PepsiCo subsidiary Quaker is launching ‘Pregrain with Quaker Oats’ a new campaign that puts oats at the heart of gameday celebrations. As part of the initiative the brand is giving away limited-edition 6-packs of Quaker Oats to get football fans fed and fired up for the main event. Fans can enter to win the special edition oats by commenting on Quaker’s Instagram post tagging a friend and adding the hashtags #QuakerPregrain and #Sweepstakes. 100 fans will win oats ahead of Super Bowl LVI.

Vita Coco

To help fans recover from their Super Bowl celebrations Coconut water Vita Coco is launching its Hangover Shop on February 14 the day after the big game. Consumers can pick out hangover helpers and have items like Advil DiGiorno frozen pizzas and of course Vita Coco delivered to their doorsteps in mere minutes. As a pilot program the shop will be available on major food delivery platforms in New York City Miami and Los Angeles. The activation is part of Vita Coco’s larger service The Hangover Subscription which enables consumers to sign up for automatic coconut water deliveries ten days before all major holidays — including the Super Bowl. The brand has also announced a partnership with Lyft to help fans make it home safely after the big game. Riders can enter the discount code COCOMODE for $10 of their ride — and a playful map interface that displays available cars as coconuts — on February 13 and 14.

Real estate investment trusts or REITs have historically invested in multifamily residential real estate not single-family homes. However that has started to change in recent years. In this Fool Live video clip recorded on Jan. 21 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel breaks down what investors need to know.

10 stocks we like better than Invitation Homes Inc.

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Invitation Homes Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Matt Frankel: But just to give you some statistics about these companies and why the build-to-rent model and the single-family rental model is so popular these days. Invitation Homes (INVH 1.19%) ticker symbol I-N-V-H. They are the biggest single-family real estate investment trust. They have about 80000 homes in 16 different markets.

Over the past 12 months their new lease spread meaning when someone vacates a home and then they release it the difference in rent is 16%. As home prices have soared so have rental rates. The average renewal lease rate is 8% meaning if someone just chooses to renew their lease they're going to be paying eight percent more than they were a year ago. That's a historically large releasing spread.

The economics are fantastic here. They bought almost 1700 homes in the third quarter alone. Obviously when you can charge 16% more in rent than you could a year ago your cash flow is going to jump dramatically. It gives you more capital to expand the business and that's what we're seeing here. American Homes 4 Rent (AMH 0.90%) is build for rent. They have relationships with homebuilders and they're seeing very similar numbers the releasing spread is 16% year over year with them and just to show how optimistic these companies are in the market Jason will love this.

This is from their presentation as well. Look at the headline of this slide. What's their strategic priority? Grow grow grow period the end. They see such an opportunity here. To grow grow grow. Look at 2019 2020 and 2021. Their inventory additions meaning the homes they've had built to rent have roughly quadrupled over that period of time. This is a rapidly growing as you said it was a niche market and it's fast becoming a core business model for a lot of these companies; the build-to-rent and single-family rentals is becoming very institutionalized.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21tdW5pdHkvbWF1cmljZS1iYXJyb24taW52aXRlZC13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZdIBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21tdW5pdHkvbWF1cmljZS1iYXJyb24taW52aXRlZC13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irish man invited to White House after young daughter's cancer battle,"A Waterford man living in New York has revealed the touching story of how his young daughter's inspiring recovery from a rare form of cancer led to an invitation to the White House from President Joe Biden.

Maurice Barron from Kilmacthomas in County Waterford spoke to the Ryan Tubridy Show about his young daughter Ava's battle with a malignant Rhabdoid kidney tumor that she was diagnosed with in April 2020 when she was just 13 months old.

He said Ava became extremely unwell at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and was rushed to a pediatric emergency room in New York.

""It's every parent's nightmare"" Maurice told host Ryan Tubridy.

After several ultrasounds and other tests Ava was diagnosed with the incredibly rare form of cancer which affects about 10 children in the US every year.

Maurice and his wife Kandice reached out to the pediatric oncology department at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who informed them that Ava would have to undergo surgery in addition to 11 rounds of radiation and eight rounds of chemotherapy.

Ava's right kidney was removed and she has now entered remission.

Maurice said that if she can make it to her fourth birthday (in March 2023) without the cancer returning doctors are confident that the gene mutation she has is unlikely to form another tumor.

""We were very lucky. It's a weird thing to say as a parent of a child who went through that but we feel lucky all the time"" he said.

He described his daughter as a ""bubbly"" child who ""loved life as only a toddler could"".

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ava Kay (@ava_kay_b)

Maurice revealed that Joe Biden who was vying for the presidency at the time of Ava's diagnosis became a huge source of inspiration due to how he coped with the loss of his son Beau.

""Joe Biden has known suffering and loss and he found a way out of that. For me that was hugely inspiring.""

Maurice said he wrote a letter to Biden just after Christmas 2021 as a personal exercise adding that he hoped at the time that the letter wouldn't be shredded.

""Please know that your strength gave me strength and the embrace of your emotions allowed me not to feel as if I was somehow less when mine overtook me"" Maurice wrote in the letter.

""I hope this letter reaches you on a day when you need a lift. Thank you for helping a fellow Irishman be brave when they most needed to be.""

To his surprise he received a letter from the White House inviting him to an ""Event to Reignite the Cancer Moonshot"" on Wednesday February 2. The cancer moonshot aims to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths by half in the next 25 years.

Maurice said he managed to nab a front-row seat at the event and watched as President Biden walked right beside him.

He said he needed a negative Covid test to enter the White House and said that he was informed he could avail of a test between 5 and 11 a.m. on the day of the event.

He arrived at the test center at 5:02 a.m. so as not to appear too eager.

""I was definitely the first to arrive at the White House"" he told Tubridy. ""Even the Secret Security guys were laughing at me.

Maurice described his trip to the White House as ""surreal"" adding that it was one of the best experiences of his life.",,,,,,,,,

(WLUC) - Sunday marks the final day of a FIS Ski Jumping competition in Dickinson County.

It’s the second-highest level of ski jumping behind only the FIS World Cup. “The Continental jumper boys are trying to get to the World Cup and they jump hard” Coleman Engineering Company Computer System Administrator and Ski Fan Chuck Winters said.

The event wrapped up at Pine Mountain Ski Resort Sunday after a weekend of competition. Fans from across the midwest and the world came out to see some of the best junior ski jumpers compete for a spot on their nation’s world cup team.

Iron Mountain Native Chuck Winters is one of the thousands that showed up. He claims to have missed only two ski jumping events over the last 30 years. “I did grow up on the backside of this hill so I did spend a lot of time up here” he said. “I’ve been to more ski jumping tournaments than I haven’t other than when I was gone.”

Winters works for Coleman Engineering the company that helped survey the ski jump before its recent renovation.

His father Orville A. Winters competed alongside U.S. Ski & Snowboard Hall of Famer Joe Perrault in Pine Mountain’s 14th annual Ski Jumping Tournament in 1949. “My father jumped off of this in ‘49 and ‘50 and when I grew up in the ‘60s and ‘70s every kid jumped” Winters said.

Iron Mountain Native Therese Ceda was also in attendance. She has a special connection to Pine Mountain the first woman to ski off its jump. “Pine Mountain was always my goal and I was able to accomplish my goal in 1978” Ceda said. “I also skied through the circuit being the only woman.”

Like winters Ceda has been coming to these competitions since she was a child. She says this year’s event is one of the best she has ever seen. “You can’t even explain it in words” Ceda said. “It’s the best.”

Winters says the attendance at this weekend’s Pine Mountain FIS Continental Cup is the most he has ever seen there for any event. He estimates over 5000 people showed up Saturday with a slightly lower attendance on Sunday to close out the weekend.

Today it is a thriving community with high-end apartments townhomes and a bayview condo tower well underway. In the cute town center you can get your hair styled buy a swimsuit and dine on tuna tartare and truffle fries.

The Westshore Marina District is one of three new planned communities that have sprung up in Tampa — the others are Midtown on Cypress Street just off Interstate 275 and the huge Water Street development south of downtown. While the pandemic initially was expected to drive people out of cities and into the suburbs it has only accelerated the trend toward walkable live-work-play areas where the full range of urban amenities is close at hand.

Unlike Midtown and Water Street the marina district does not have any office buildings but it is only 10 minutes from the West Shore business district and is a short trip across the Gandy Bridge to Raymond James Jabil and other major employers. And district residents working from home can do so in a setting that includes landscaped walkways small lakes and soon a 1.5-mile waterfront park.

“It’s our local neighborhood with a gorgeous lifestyle” says Rikki Radkay who with sister Remy opened the first store in the district last spring.

The district site of this month’s fashion shoot was originally planned for a grandiose residential project called Port Tampa Bay. The Great Recession killed that and a Fort Lauderdale firm BTI Partners eventually acquired the property. As master developer BTI put in roads and utilities and sold off part of the land to other developers for apartments and townhomes. BTI kept the rest of the space for its own projects: Marina Pointe where the first of three planned 16-story condo towers will be finished this year; a 150-slip marina; and the Marina Landings retail center.

Noah Breakstone CEO of BTI Partners notes that the district and many of its amenities are open to those living in surrounding areas. “The best part of Westshore Marina District is that it brings new life and energy to South Tampa” he said. “Our development and the lifestyle it creates is here for everyone to enjoy.”

The first restaurant Cru Cellars opened last spring with indoor and outdoor seating and a wine list almost as impressive as that of the original Cru Cellars in Tampa’s Palma Ceia area. (There is also a small offshoot at Armature Works near downtown Tampa.) A second restaurant Chuck Lager’s American Tavern is expected to open by this summer. And a third yet to be announced will be next to the marina area so boaters can pull up.

For district residents who don’t want to make a trip to Publix Duckweed Urban Market in the Landings carries prepared foods as well as fresh veggies meats frozen foods beer and wine. There’s also a small adjoining Duckweed liquor store.

Other shops now open in Marina Landings include Crave Spa where customers can enjoy a selection of wines while getting their nails done; Salon Colorbar a hair salon; and Sand Surf Co. which sells swim and casual wear.

The Radkay sisters moved their Sand Surf store from Tampa’s Channelside District last May after a friend told them about the new marina district. They grew up in what they call New England’s “surf culture” but went to the University of Tampa and decided to stay in the city.

“We just loved that (the district) was right on the water so it really fits our water lifestyle” Remy said. “We’re excited to see our first full spring and summer and super excited because all the places around us are really starting to open.”

The sisters are so enthused about the marina district that Remy already makes her home in the Town Westshore apartments a quick walk from the store. And Rikki plans to move to the district too.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Numerous complaints to the Division of Business Services prompted an investigation into SCC LLC’s practices. The investigation revealed that between 2014 and 2016 the Jacobs sent allegedly misleading solicitations appearing to be from a government agency to businesses operating in Tennessee. Those solicitations made it seem like the business was required to obtain either a Certificate of Authorization or Certificate of Good Standing to legally do business in the state.

SCC LLC charged businesses as much as $88 to obtain documents which actually only cost $20 directly from the division. Certificates are not required to operate a business in Tennessee and are generally only necessary for other business purposes such as obtaining a loan or entering into a contract. The Attorney General’s office determined that the company and its owners’ actions violated the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act.

The Secretary of State’s office is now accepting claims from victims. Business owners who paid SCC LLC for a certificate and would like to receive a portion of the settlement are required to produce documentation showing they paid SCC LLC between 2014 and 2016.

All claims should be submitted to the Division of Business Services:

By mail: Division of Business Services

Alexandra's grandmother used to treat her to turnovers and chocolate pistachio cake after school.

""Everything was genuine and full of love when it was made."" she said. ""So whether I was here or not I would I always think about the Gold N' Silver and think about how much I love it.""

Now she comes to the restaurant with her mom to drink ""endless cups of coffee and play cards"".

The Wylds and a family friend stood outside the restaurant Saturday morning holding posters that read ""leave it for the locals"" and ""the neon line stops here” protesting Jacobs Entertainment's purchase of the property.

They have been standing outside since 7 a.m. and plan to stay until Saturday evening. They also plan to protest on Sunday. They tied heart-shaped balloons outside the restaurant. They also cheered and hooted as drivers honked their horns in support.

The restaurant’s sale to Jacobs subsidiary Reno Property Management LLC involved six parcels in total and was finalized on Jan. 31 according to records obtained by the Reno Gazette Journal from Washoe County. The previous owner was Paine Properties LLC which lists Jeffry Paine and Kristin Paine as officers according to the Nevada Secretary of State.

The sale raises questions about the fate of the Gold N’ Silver Inn which bills itself as “Reno’s oldest casual restaurant.” A familiar fixture on the corner of West Fourth and Vine Streets the restaurant has been run by three generations of local families for more than six decades.

Employees said that the restaurant will be open for another two years before it gets demolished.

""That's not what we want. That's not what the locals want."" Alexandra said. ""I just want Jacobs Entertainment to understand this isn't a place to be demolished and to be turned into the Neon Line. It's supposed to be honored. It's one of our historic places. It's a refuge for us everyday every time of the year.""

Jacobs Entertainment also purchased and demolished several motels and has been acquiring properties from Keystone Avenue to West Street since 2017.

""To us this is the heart of Reno"" said Jana who has been frequenting the restaurant for nearly 40 years. ""We don't have much left in this town that (Jacobs Entertainment) hasn't decimated and we'd like this to remain for us.""

In fact it banks on it. Before the show returned Zendaya shared a trigger warning on her social media accounts warning fans that season 2 “is deeply emotional and deals with subject matter that can be triggering and difficult to watch.” Since its June 2019 premiere Euphoria has garnered both praise and criticism for its glaring depiction of the dark side of growing up. The show has repeatedly touched on themes like domestic violence drug use and unsafe sex often using physical violence or the anxiety brought by the threat of it to emphasize that these kids are messed up and their lives are hard. The second season has only amped that up featuring even more moments of violence from the onset ending the season premiere with Elordi’s Nate having his head smashed with a bottle. The show has also been criticized by D.A.R.E for aestheticizing trauma being “ unrelentingly explicit ” in its depictions of violence and choosing to “misguidedly glorify … high school student drug use” (although as some people on Twitter point out watching Rue almost overdose by a Whirlpool washer is probably the last thing that would make me want to try drugs).,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3RleGFzL25ld3MvamFjb2IteWktYXJyZXN0ZWQtZm9yLW11cmRlci1hZnRlci1hcmxpbmd0b24tc2hvb3RpbmctbGVhdmVzLTEtZGVhZC0xLWluanVyZWQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3RleGFzL25ld3MvamFjb2IteWktYXJyZXN0ZWQtZm9yLW11cmRlci1hZnRlci1hcmxpbmd0b24tc2hvb3RpbmctbGVhdmVzLTEtZGVhZC0xLWluanVyZWQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Yi Arrested For Murder After Arlington Shooting Leaves 1 Dead 1 Injured,"ARLINGTON Texas (CBSDFW.COM) - Arlington Police arrested a man suspected of murder and other charges after he allegedly shot two men killing one and injuring the other on Saturday February 5.

At the height of the disaster 32 roads were closed due to flooding and emergency crews responded to 17 high-water rescues. Unfortunately one of these rescues was for a little boy who was found dead hours after being swept away by floodwaters early Sunday morning.

Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore described the situation as ""scary to be in fast water.""

""It's been a difficult time for Johnson County over the last several days"" said Moore.

Emergency crews from across the county worked tirelessly to rescue those trapped in the floodwaters including Moore himself who was caught in high water on the way to rescue the Warren family.

""I accelerated and came around the corner and ended up in high water and my vehicle was surrounded"" Moore said. He had to work on top of his truck. ""I ended up spending the next hour and a half on top of my truck.""

Across the city of Venus firefighters responded to another high water rescue on County Road 616. Firefighters said a woman who was eight months pregnant was trapped.

The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvc2VhbmRncmFoYW0uY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvcm9nZXItam9obnNvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Lane Johnson Obituary 2024,"Garner NC: At 5:14AM on May 5 2024 Heaven gained another angel when Roger Lane Johnson age 72 known to many as “Rog” or the “Running Man” won his battle with cancer.

It has been an interesting offseason for the Bengals... There were solid free-agency pickups and a good draft class but two trade requests since the end of last season.

One of those trade requests came from Tee Higgins after the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him.

There has been little to no progress since the trade request according to reports but Zac Taylor has made it clear he looks forward to seeing Higgins for the 2024 season.

Cincinnati Bengals legend Chad Ochocinco hit on the topic recently and says he has been in contact with Higgins “a few times.”

“I think we’re going to work it out. We’ll figure it out” Ochocinco said when asked about the contract issues between the two sides according to TMZ Sports.

Higgins is set to make over $20 million this season with the franchise tag but it is clear he wants long-term security as well.

Ochocinco ended his conversation with TMZ saying “It’s business — it’s the nature of the business. He’s going to be all right though.”

We will see what the long-term future holds for Higgins and the Bengals but as of right now I expect to see him suited up in week one and ready to roll."

Soelect raised $11 million from GM Ventures KTB Network and Lotte Ventures an affiliate of Korea’s Lotte Chemical.

The startup based in North Carolina was founded in 2018 by Jin Cho who has worked in the battery industry for 25 years previously with LG Samsung and Johnson Controls. As Reuters writes citing Cho Soelect already has more than 20 customers mainly from the automotive industry.

Soelect considers lithium metal anodes as a key component in future battery systems. For its ‘LiX’ anode the company claims fast-charging capabilities at up to 4C and up to 100% in 15 minutes. By comparison QuantumScape announced this week that it could charge its solid-state cells to 80 per cent in 15 minutes. However QuantumScape’s tests also showed that the battery lasts 400 cycles in the process. Soelect does not detail the cycle stability on its home page.

Instead Soelect says its anode can be reused “without destroying the processes which are required for most recycling process.” The company does not provide further information on the anode’s composition or properties of battery cells with this technology. However the company is also looking into polymer-based Solid Electrolyte Membranes (SEM).

Regarding (semi) solid-state battery solutions Reuters quotes Spokesman Darryll Harrison of GM Ventures. He said GM’s investment in Soelect “complements” the automaker’s partnership with SES and “further expands our efforts to accelerate the advancement of battery chemistries.” More precisely Harrison said Soelect’s lithium-metal technology “could serve as an enabler for both future lithium-metal and solid-state EV battery anode designs.”

KTB Network and Lotte Ventures participated in the financing round alongside GM Ventures. None of the companies disclosed their share in the investment but Lotte Ventures was the lead investor. Lotte Ventures is part of the South Korean group Lotte Chemical. “Lotte Chemical’s expertise in chemical/materials manufacturing GM’s expertise in electric vehicle and battery development and KTB’s venture capital experience will be combined to drive the development and commercialization of our technology and also help us attract top talent” Cho said when commenting on the news.

ATHENS – He’s hard-nosed and hard-driving the second-highest paid banker on Wall Street at $34.5 million annually the billionaire son of Greek immigrants who hasn’t forgotten his roots so JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is investing in his homeland.

The opinionated banker came to the Greek capital to meet Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis whose New Democracy government he lauds to pay tribute to his parents and grandparents and said he’s optimistic about the country’s future despite the lingering COVID-19 pandemic.

There was also business to talk about. Dimon and Mitsotakis speak the same language – banking – the Greek having worked as a financial analyst at the corporate division of Chase Bank in London and CEO of a private equity and venture capital subsidiary he founded affiliated with the National Bank of Greece.

The two met after JPMorgan announced its investment for the acquisition of approximately 49 percent of the online bank Viva Wallet which Dimon was surprised to learn is a Greek company when first told about it.

Government sources not named said that Dimon informed Mitsotakis that JPMorgan is willing to expand its office in Greece invest further in Viva Wallet and attract high-level staff in Greece.

“As you are aware we have plans to expand over time so this may become a technology hub for JPMorgan Chase throughout the world” said Dimon reported the newspaper Kathimerini.

Mitsotakis who has been trying to lure foreign investors during the pandemic and succeeded in attracting major tech giants said JP Morgan’s acquisition was a vote of confidence in Greece too and “reaffirms the new startup culture that has appeared in Greece.”

He added in speaking to Dimon: “What I can tell you is that the country has turned a page and that Greece in 2022 has very few similarities with Greece in the time of economic crisis. I think we have laid the foundations for long-term and sustainable growth and we want you to be part of this story not just because of your Greek descent but because you truly see the opportunities that exist in the country.”

Those participating in the meeting included the head of the Prime Minister’s economic office Alexis Patelis the head of JPMorgan Chase in Greece Stelios Papadopoulos and Global Head of Wholesale Payments Takis Georgakopoulos.

In an interview with the paper Dimon referred to the Viva Wallet deal and said Greece is noted for having highly-skilled professionals making their mark in a number of sectors.

The further plans the bank has for Greece he said include creation of a hub for research and technology as Mitsotakis is trying to accelerate a slow recovery from the pandemic and an eight-year economic and austerity crisis before that.

Georgakopoulos told the newspaper in a separate interview that the hub will deal with three issues: cryptography distributed ledger technology (DLT) artificial intelligence and machine learning related to payment systems.

“These are three areas in which JP Morgan is a leader among banks” he said. The hub will be created in 2022 once the company has found “the right person to set it up and run it.”

“This is something that changed with COVID: Any country that has talented educated creative people can build businesses that don’t have to be in the U.S. It can be far away – here let’s say. That’s something every country needs to keep in mind” Dimon told the paper.

Georgakopoulos said choosing Greece for the installation of a hub as well as the acquisition of Viva was not influenced by his or Dimon’s descent.

“Finding scientists who have this specialization is difficult. Hiring such people in Silicon Valley is almost impossible. We have been thinking about Greece for two years.”

Before the pandemic hit his government was speeding an economic recovery after the stagnation of 4 ½ years of rule by the former Radical Left SYRIZA which has a hard-core element resisting any foreign investment and capitalism.

Dimon the son of Theodore and Themis with roots in Izmir – his paternal grandfather who migrated to the United States at the start of the last century changed the family name from Papademetriou to Dimon to make it sound French.

He said he was optimistic because Greece has “a rational government making rational decisions. The EU money helps. I think the EU did it the right way they have set milestones to be accomplished in order to give the money – they don’t just hand it out.”

He said the bank decided to acquire a stake in Viva Wallet which has a presence in 23 countries because “they have managed to serve stores or groups in different countries with different systems. While we are doing a good job they have created systems that we still don’t have.”

Viva Wallet provides businesses of all sizes card acceptance services through the innovative Viva Wallet POS app add-on Google Play devices and through advanced payment gateways in online stores. It also offers business accounts with local IBAN and a business Viva Wallet Mastercard card.

Dimon said he didn’t know it was founded by Greeks: Haris Karonis its CEO and Makis Antypas the CIO who developed the company that is the first in Europe to entirely use cloud-based neobanking through Microsoft Azure.

“Takis came to me and said: ‘You won’t believe it Jamie. We’re looking at a Greek company.’ I think it’s fabulous for Greece. It’s a great company a unicorn (a company that has been valued at more than $1 billion.)”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZ3Jpby5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNS9jaGFzZS1iYW5rLXJlZnVzZWQtYmxhY2stZG9jdG9yLWNoZWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase Bank refused Black doctor's $16000 check lawsuit claims,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAyLTA1L2dvb2RieWUtZWFzeS1tb25leS1hcy1oYXdraXNoLWNlbnRyYWwtYmFua3Mtc3BlZWQtdXAtcmF0ZS1oaWtlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goodbye Easy Money as Hawkish Central Banks Speed Up Rate Hikes,"Why did this happen?

Lakeside living in Kelowna has taken another step forward with Juniper Grove part of the master-planned community of McKinley Beach at the northern end of the city.

Twenty-five bare land strata lots within the 872-acre master-planned community are bordered by forests and ponds and are available this month with options for construction of both pre-designed and custom homes. Lots start at $340000 and home with lot will start at $900000.

In addition to four predesigned home options— a 2000-square-foot walkout and an 1800-square-foot walkout there are also pre-designs for 1800-square-foot and 1500-square-foot two-storey homes.

Buyers will have the option of working with the project’s two preferred builders Dynamic Constructors or Rykon Construction to create their own custom-built homes up to a maximum size of 2400-square-feet.

According to Andrew Gaucher vice-president of McKinley Beach the lots at Juniper Grove afford buyers a peaceful getaway just minutes from the city.

“We're really are offering the Okanagan lifestyle” said Gaucher. “We like to say we're building a community one neighbourhood at a time.”

Photo: Contributed Four predesigned home plans or custom plans are available at Juniper Grove.

He said while it may feel like resort-style living more than 80% of McKinley Beach’s residents live there full-time creating a true sense of community.

In addition to the stunning surrounding scenery Juniper Grove will also offer access to the amenities of the larger master-planned community of McKinley Beach such as a 110-slip marina an outdoor gym pickelball courts a children’s playground commercial amenities and an upcoming on-site $20 million custom-built winery. There are also kilometres of forested hiking and walking trails something that has proved popular with those already living in the McKinley Beach area.

An added feature to the homes at Juniper Grove is that they have been designed with the ability to have a legal suite a very handy feature as a future mortgage helper for those moving in.

Since its development first hit the market in 2015 the larger McKinley Beach project has grown to nearly 500 homes with an eventual projected build-out of 1300 homes over the next few years.

Gaucher said the project — the first master-planned community in the Okanagan—has proved popular with buyers and the Covid-19 pandemic just seems to have supercharged that.

Juniper Grove's 25 lots—five two-storey home lots and 20 walkout lots—will go on sale this month. Gaucher said civil construction work will take place at the site this spring and home construction will be ready to start in the summer.

McKinley Beach and the Juniper Grove neighbourhood are being developed by G Group. G Group and North American Development Group (NADG) are the master developers of McKinley Beach. NADG is the company behind the twin-tower One Water Street high-rise development in Kelowna’s North End.

Ellie Howard* was 18 when she first used a buy now pay later service (BNPL). With little financial education and no existing credit it was easy enough for her to indulge in shopping sprees of clothes and makeup seemingly with hardly any consequences. But by the age of 22 she found herself drowning in unmanageable debt for items that she “never really needed” in the first place.

Now 27 Howard is still working her way through paying back all of the money she owes but feels much more in control when it comes to her finances. While no longer a regular user of BNPL services Howard says she finds Klarna is convenient when she wants to spread the cost of unavoidable purchases such as around Christmas time when she needs to buy presents and January payday feels “a lifetime away”.

Recent years have seen the popularity of BNPL companies like ClearPay PayPal and Klarna soar. In June 2021 Klarna secured a new round of funding from investors in a deal that pushed its value to $45.6bn (£33.6bn). Seven months on it boasts 90 million active users across the world and facilitates two million transactions every day. In the UK alone it’s estimated that seven million people use its services.

For someone with a poor credit history it could give them an unrealistic idea of what they can afford Ellie Howard Klarna user

Klarna’s appeal is clear. Unlike the payday loans of earlier generations which were dredged in both interest fees and warnings of how late payment could be fatal to your credit score Klarna provides a means to finally purchase that handbag you’ve been eyeing up but can’t afford to buy in one go.

It is a business model that has paved the way for Klarna to partner with just about anyone from fast fashion retailers to car repair services. Landing on Asos it was marketed as allowing customers to “try before you buy”. The concept is simple; you place an order for all the things you want and only pay for the things you keep. “Have a huge trying on sesh at home and send whatever you don’t want back within 30 days of purchase. You’ll be charged (no interest or fees) for everything you keep and payment has to be received within the 30 days” a notice on the Asos website reads.

Klarna’s success could also be attributed to its marketing strategy which experts say is specifically geared towards millennials and Gen Z. “Klarna’s pink branding and playful marketing campaigns have more affinity with the e-commerce websites they serve rather than traditional financial service institutions” says PR and marketing consultant Ann Fiona Martin. She describes Klarna “almost as an extension” of the fast fashion brands it works with using “colourful brand image to attract a generation of spenders who want the latest outfit beauty product or home accessory immediately”.

It’s this branding that sets it apart from more traditional banks or finance providers adds Dawn Baxter founder of digital marketing agency Beyond the Dawn Digital. While banks often portray stability and dependability in a bid to appeal to family demographics and homeowners to be “Klarna is bright colourful and vibrant”.

“The messaging is the opposite of worrying about the stable savings or investments of the future” Baxter explains. “They speak a more open clear language and do not feel the need to get heavy with terms and conditions from the outset. Pay in three months and there is no interest is really clear and feeds into the accessibility of their product. The young people they are speaking to are savvy and wary of credit cards and this gives them an option that feels more casual and easier to manage.”

Last week Klarna announced the launch of a Klarna card which will allow customers to delay payment for things they buy in high-street shops for up to a month whereas they could previously only use its services for online purchases. In a statement Alex Marsh head of Klarna UK said the card will bring “the benefits” of its payment model to the offline world and give people “control” over their purchases. “Consumers are rejecting credit products which charge double-digit interest rates while allowing repayments to be put off indefinitely. For online purchases where credit makes sense BNPL has become the sustainable alternative with no interest and clear payment schedules” Marsh said.

Financial experts have warned that the Klarna card could increase the potential for financially vulnerable users to fall into debt. “As with any online payments failing to repay within the timeframe still exposes consumers to the risk of having their card frozen” Simon Kent global head of financial services at management consulting firm Kearney says adding that he hopes to see Klarna exercise “responsible lending behaviour”.

“Affordability assessments will need to be run before issuing the card to ensure users’ safety and protection. Klarna is clearly working to protect its customers as it can and until the regulation around BNPL is more clearly defined we might not have a proper benchmark to fully measure their efforts” he says.

Michelle Highman chief executive of The Money Charity says that while in theory BNPL models like Klarna’s give consumers “greater freedom and choice in their purchasing power” there is a risk that people could be taking on “unsustainable financial commitments”. “With providers beginning to offer further new options our concern remains that those using the products fully understand what they are and just as importantly what they are not and crucially how they are protected if things go wrong” Highman says.

“The new card could be a useful tool for some but it isn’t a credit card and doesn’t come with the protections of a credit card and it’s vital consumers understand this” she adds. “We call on all BNPL providers to continue engaging positively with the process of bringing the market under proper regulation as soon as possible as well as for them to take greater strides in the clarity and transparency of how their products are presented to consumers.""

Every time you opened the app there was always something new there that you could now buy something that you couldn’t afford Kirsten Dinwoodie Klarna user

In a statement to The Independent a Klarna spokesperson commented: “Last year consumers saved over £100m in interest by using BNPL instead of high-cost credit cards. We launched [the] Klarna card to extend those savings to consumers who wish to shop at retailers which have not yet partnered with Klarna – be that online or in store.

“Unlike a credit card we never charge interest or late fees on our BNPL products so consumers only ever owe the cost of their original purchase. We re-evaluate the amount consumers can spend on a daily basis and we freeze the card as soon as a payment is late to stop consumers from getting further into debt. These controls don’t exist on traditional credit cards because if everyone paid off their credit card bill on time the lenders would go out of business.”

One concern around Klarna’s payment model highlighted by Howard is how easy it was for her to get approved despite her poor financial history. “My credit score was atrocious and Klarna still gave me credit” she says adding that her score was “definitely in the red” and in the 200s figure. While Howard began using Klarna after having educated herself about her finances she worries that others may fall into similar debt as she did at a young age. “There needs to be more education. When you sign up for it you click through the terms and conditions and you don’t look at them properly. For someone with a poor credit history it could give them an unrealistic idea of what they can afford.”

This ease of use of Klarna and BNPL services could exploit people without financial education. “The risk of course as with any credit is that users take on unsustainable financial commitments frequently driven by the urgency of their needs and a lack of understanding of the product terms to which they are agreeing” Highman says.

Kirsten Dinwoodie had been a user of Klarna from April to December 2021. After her phone broke she decided to buy one outright and spread the cost over 12 months using a Klarna finance plan. These plans which are up to 36 months long carry an interest rate of up to 18.90 per cent. While she had a mostly positive experience – it was easy to keep up with payments and track them through the Klarna app as they left her account every month – she says her contract did not make it clear enough that her plan included interest.

Dinwoodie claims she was asked just two questions relating to her salary and share of monthly rent or mortgage payments before being approved instantly. “It also wasn’t made explicitly clear that I would be paying interest and I only realised this after the first month of payment was taken” she says. A Klarna spokesperson told The Independent that Klarna finance is covered by the Consumer Credit Act and that information regarding interest rates is made “super clear”.

As Klarna’s outreach and success has grown so has the number of brands it works with. Dinwoodie recalls receiving “constant notifications and emails” advertising products that she could buy using Klarna. “Every time you opened the app there was always something new there that you could now buy on Klarna something that you couldn’t afford and before you knew it you’d be stuck with constant monthly payments. It was debt that’s dressed up and it doesn’t sit well with me” she adds. Users can shop from brands from a whole host of industries ranging from fashion and beauty to car repair services and luxury goods.

This move into the luxury market including designers like Kenzo Stella McCartney and Aquazzura is allowing customers to purchase products “which would have been inaccessible to them before” Kent says. This is consistent with Kearney’s research which has found that people are increasingly using BNPL services to purchase “big-ticket items”. “Of course it will be crucially important for Klarna to ensure the personalised caps provided to each user are appropriately adjusted to protect consumers at every level” Kent adds.

Buy now pay later borrowing can be like quicksand – easy to slip into and very difficult to get out of Matthew Upton Citizens Advice

While some people have highlighted Klarna’s pitfalls its popularity is proof that its services are valued by many. One of these users is Lauren Fletcher who has had a very positive experience with the company. “It helps me get the things I want when I’m short and then come payday I always just pay it in full and I love that there’s no interest added” she says. “I’ve never been in debt with Klarna. I still use it mainly for clothes. I’ve also used it for the occasional beauty products and my work-from-home equipment like a proper chair to stop my back hurting.”

Some debt charities have urged people to consider the affordability of repayments before signing up to BNPL schemes. “BNPL borrowing can be like quicksand – easy to slip into and very difficult to get out of” Matthew Upton director of policy at Citizens Advice says. “Split payments are offered as a temptation at the checkout but the consequences can be devastating for those who are least able to deal with them. We’ve helped many who have slipped into trouble including one who was sent a debt collection letter over a £10 purchase.” The charity did not disclose which BNPL service sent the letter.

“Another relied on BNPL to buy things such as their children’s school uniform but couldn’t afford the repayments. While BNPL can work for some we’d be really worried if people were using it simply to make ends meet. We’re here to help anyone who is struggling to pay their bills or essential costs” Upton adds.

With a published price tag of $630 million of which $565 million was financed by risky junk bonds the Mirage had to produce an unheard of $1 million dollars a day just to service the debt. The venture proved prophetic as the Mirage would exceed expectations and revolutionize the Las Vegas Strip. (Review-Journal file)

Within 30 minutes of its opening to the general public an estimated 40000 visitors entered the $630 million Mirage Hotel and Casino. The opening on November 22 1989 celebrated the first new major hotel-casino on the strip in over a decade. The 3044-room Mirage boosted confidence in a future that would soon see the opening of The Mirageճ fellow mega-resorts Excalibur Luxor and the new MGM. (Review-Journal file)

For more than 30 years the fiery water show has entranced the masses along the Strip free to anyone who might be passing by.

But the days of The Mirage’s volcano are numbered as the transformative resort undergoes its own transformation as part of Hard Rock international’s $1.075 billion acquisition of the property.

Hard Rock International Chairman Jim Allen told Bloomberg in December that it would be torn down as part of the planned remodel. The company plans to completely rebrand the property as Hard Rock Las Vegas and create a “brand-new resort” that will include the brand’s signature guitar-shaped hotel. A rendering of what the revamped property would look like shows the new guitar hotel sitting in roughly the same location now occupied by the volcano.

The volcano is on its way to becoming the latest in a long line of Las Vegas relics that were once considered iconic only to be reduced to the archives like the original marquees of The Sands the sultan at The Dunes or the Crystal Room at the Desert Inn just to name a few.

“The volcano is incredibly iconic for its generation” said Alan Feldman a distinguished fellow at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute and former longtime gaming company executive. “I think it’s very important to remember that Las Vegas is a city that is built on change. And it has built its success on change and on reinventing itself.”

Just how much time the volcano has left isn’t clear yet.

MGM Resorts will retain The Mirage name and brand and will license it to Hard Rock for up to three years while it finalizes its plans to rebrand the property.

Following the announcement of the sale in December Allen said the company had no comment on the time frame for the resorts rebranding renovations or the construction of the new hotel tower. The company said late last month that it had no new details to share.

The history

The Mirage ushered in the new era of enormous integrated resorts when Steve Wynn opened the 3000-plus room property in 1989 completely changing the way resort casinos would be designed and built in the city going forward.

The volcano stood as the beacon signifying the city’s shift.

At the time there was no on-Strip outdoor attraction that even came close to The Mirage’s volcano. It would become an instant success drawing huge crowds of pedestrians and even its fair share of drivers along Las Vegas Boulevard who would stop their cars on the street just to watch the show according to Feldman.

Few know the history of The Mirage better than Feldman. He moved to Las Vegas in 1989 for the opening of the resort as an outside public affairs adviser. He spent 11 years with the-then Mirage Resorts and another 18 with MGM Resorts after MGM merged with Mirage in 2000.

“The volcano really symbolized the new Las Vegas in 1989 and all through the ’90s” Feldman said. “It was the symbol of Las Vegas turning a corner and becoming something much more than gambling and becoming really much more than Sin City.”

The volcano show itself though was not actually part of the original design plans for the resort.

“The volcano was accidental” Feldman said.

The developers of The Mirage had been the leaning heavily on the design of the entrance to Caesars Palace one that required people to drive a little ways to reach the front entrance of the resort — a way of building up the guest’s anticipation. The volcano Feldman said was just supposed to be a dormant one a piece of landscaping there to hide the entrance from the street.

That was until someone suggested making it an actual volcano experience.

“That all happened along the way. It was not part of the original design” Feldman said.

It didn’t take long for the on-Strip attraction pioneered by the volcano to take off. Soon it would be joined by the Battle of Buccaneer Bay at the neighboring Treasure Island and the fountains at Bellagio.

That accidental volcano became one of the true staples of the Strip. Just before it turned 20 it got a major makeover with an all-new audio/visual spectacle that included brand-new fire effects. It went from the original 38 fire-shooting devices to 152 shooters that can blast fireballs 12 feet into the air singeing the air just feet away from the attraction’s onlookers.

And it got an exclusive score composed by Grateful Dead drummer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Mickey Hart and Indian tabla sensation Zakir Hussain. The redesign completed by WET Design cost $25 million.

In a behind-the-scenes video showing the development of the score Hart said he was looking to “translate that fire image to sound.” He said he immersed himself into the legends and myths that surround volcanoes and studied the science behind how the natural wonders work. And of course the sound.

“It was about powerful drums. It was about evoking the spirits” Hart said. “It gives me the emotional impact that I would think you would have when you encountered a volcano.”

Push to save it

But as they have time and time before in Las Vegas the winds of change are coming for The Mirage and with it the volcano.

That change is not one that Elizabeth Cassidy wants to see.

Cassidy visiting Las Vegas from Michigan last week said she would be “very sad” to see the volcano go because it is one of the reasons she loves to come here. She has a hard time picturing Hard Rock’s plans when she looks up at the Strip skyline.

“I think it’s cool for the Hard Rock but it’s hard for me to picture it replacing The Mirage” Cassidy said. “I wish they’d keep the volcano.”

Convincing Hard Rock to keep the volcano is something Alden Gillespy is hoping to do.

Gillespy has been coming to Las Vegas for years after visiting for the first time as a teenager. He fell in love with what he describes as two major art installations on the Strip — the fountains at Bellagio and the volcano at The Mirage.

“I became mesmerized by them” he said. “In a town where everything costs money these were free.”

Shortly after the announcement that the property was being sold Gillespy started a Change.org petition aimed at just that.

“To hear that it was going to be demolished it kind of shocked me” Gillespy said.

It’s gotten just over 3600 signatures as of Wednesday out of listed goal of 5000. Gillespy said he’s now aiming to get to 10000 signers. Gillespy said he hopes to get the attention of the resort companies and at least start a conversation about the volcano.

Feldman said he’s sorry to see the volcano go too. But he thinks people need to give Hard Rock a chance.

“I have to be honest” he said. “A guitar-shaped hotel in the middle of the Strip? That sounds pretty darn cool.”

If that happens the Tribe cautioned then the Seminoles’ hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue sharing payments to Florida — only recently resumed after a three year dispute — could be disrupted again.

Based on those arguments Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper accepted the Tribe and its political committee Standing Up For Florida as interveners in a lawsuit filed earlier this week by Florida Voters In Charge which is trying to resurrect its North Florida casino campaign.

Florida Voters In Charge a group backed by the Las Vegas Sands Corp. of Nevada had been trying to get enough verified petition signatures to qualify a North Florida casino proposal for the November General Election ballot. But that campaign fell short at Tuesday’s statutory deadline.

On Monday in anticipation of that missed deadline the group sued Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee seeking to get a judge to grant more time for petition processing. The group charged that flaws in state law and in the ways county officials had been processing petitions prevented the campaign’s success. The group contended it had turned in plenty of petitions but a large number never got processed.

Judge Cooper has not made any decisions regarding the strength of those claims.

The casino that Florida Voters In Charge is pursuing could create new competition for the Tribe’s Hard Rock casinos in South Florida and Tampa.

The Tribe sought to intervene in the lawsuit based on the Seminoles’ 2010 Gambling Compact with the state of Florida. That pact briefly had been superseded by a new pact the 2021 Gambling Compact which was negotiated and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis early last year. That agreement was approved by the Legislature in May and OK’d by federal officials in August. But the 2021 pact was invalidated and tossed by a federal court in November.

The 2010 Compact still exists and is set to run through 2030 the Tribe noted in the case before Cooper.

“The Seminole Tribe is party to a compact with the State of Florida entered in 2010” read the Tribe’s motion to intervene.

The Tribe noted that its 2010 Compact still gives it exclusive rights to offer slot machines and similar devices in Florida “with narrow exceptions not relevant to this matter” and that the Tribe had agreed to share revenue with the state in exchange for that exclusivity.

“The proposed amendment if passed would be an infringement on the Tribe’s right to exclusivity under the Compact and threatens to disrupt a contractual relationship between the Tribe and the State that has been highly beneficial to both parties” the Tribe’s court filing claims.

The Tribe has previously for several years claimed breaches of its exclusivity rights under that 2010 Compact. The Tribe had not provided any revenue to the state for about three years starting in mid-2018.

Tribe spokesman Gary Bitner said Friday the Seminoles had resumed payments under the 2021 Gaming Compact and had made their most recent payment to the state last month even though the 2021 Compact had been tossed by the federal court.

The Tribe and the U.S. Department of the Interior are appealing the November federal court decision.

The 2021 Gaming Compact had assured annual payments of at least $500 million in revenue sharing.

The 2010 Gaming Compact had led to payments as high as $350 million.

According to the most recent campaign finance reports through Dec. 31 Florida Voters In Charge had spent $45 million on its effort.

Last week another proposed constitutional amendment to legalize online sports betting in Florida folded recognizing it had no chance of reaching petition requirements by Tuesday. Florida Education Champions the organization funded by the big daily fantasy sports platforms DraftKings and FanDuel was much further behind in the process than Florida Voters In Charge. The sports betting campaign announced Jan. 28 it wass reassessing long-term options.

The Seminole Tribe seeking to protect its market spent big on counter-campaigning both gambling petitions trying to convince Florida voters not to sign. The Tribe’s Standing Up For Florida campaign spent $20 million on advertising opposing the petition efforts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhcnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZpcmVmaWdodGVycy1yZXNwb25kLXRvLWEtZmlyZS1hdC1zaWx2ZXItc2FuZHMtZmFjdG9yeS1zdG9yZS1pbi1taXJhbWFyLWJlYWNo0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93ZWFydHYuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZpcmVmaWdodGVycy1yZXNwb25kLXRvLWEtZmlyZS1hdC1zaWx2ZXItc2FuZHMtZmFjdG9yeS1zdG9yZS1pbi1taXJhbWFyLWJlYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Firefighters respond to a fire at Silver Sands Factory Store in Miramar Beach,"WALTON COUNTY Fla. -- A fire broke out at the Silver Sands Factory Store late Saturday morning.

Chief Procurement Officer Leidos

Bob Gemmill has led Leidos’ supply chain resiliency throughout the pandemic securing personal protective equipment early on collaborating with program managers and suppliers to develop creative solutions to minimize disruptions and delays and ensuring volatile lead times were clearly communicated to those who needed to know.

His team also focused on building intelligent inventory and leveraging alternative sources of supply.

“The pandemic has C-suites and board rooms across the globe focused on what has been labeled the Great Supply Chain Disruption” Gemmill said. “There has never been a more challenging or exciting time to be in supply chain and it is up to us to deliver solutions. There will never be a better time than now to demonstrate value.”

Why Watch

In 2022 Gemmill’s team is focused on four key areas. First supply chain cybersecurity is increasingly important as foreign advisories recognize supplier systems are a potential pathway to infiltrating hardened customer and prime contractor networks. Gemmill’s team partners closely with Leidos’ chief information officer chief information security officer legal and security teams as well as its customers key suppliers and industry associations to employ practices that greatly reduce risk.

Second his team has established key performance indicators aligned to the financial objectives of the business. With a significant portion of revenue tied to its supply chain it needs to have differentiated strategies in managing outsourcing.

Third the team’s suppliers are accelerators of the innovation needed to meet the expectations of customers’ most challenging missions. Gemmill said it will continue to develop deep technology partnerships with market leaders as well as emerging technology companies.

Finally Gemmill’s team is focused on environment social and governance issues. The supply chain team is part of “Next Level Leidos” where it has made public commitments to achieve specific goals for supplier diversity and sustainable sourcing.

“Bob’s focus on supply chain resiliency is driving innovation and competitive differentiation for the business” said Vicki Schmanske Leidos executive vice president of corporate operations. “He and his team cultivate strong enduring technology partnerships with market leaders and emerging technology companies to address the critical mission challenges of our customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L3RoaXMtZGVmZW5zZS1jb250cmFjdG9ycy1mb3Itc2FsZS1oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtcG90L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Defense Contractor's for Sale. Here Are the Potential Buyers.,"A number of defense heavyweights will probably be lining up to take a look at Mantech International.

Defense contractor Mantech International (MANT) has reportedly put up a ""for sale"" sign with company co-founder George Pedersen said to be exploring options for his controlling stake.

The deal talk surrounding Mantech should come as no surprise. Pedersen is 85 and has stepped away from the business in recent years factors that had us thinking about a potential sale of the company a little over a year ago.

Mantech which is valued at about $3.1 billion would make a tempting morsel for many defense titans. The company generates nearly half of its revenue from the intelligence community. That work tends to be renewed more easily than most government IT work which makes it more valuable to would-be buyers.

But Mantech today has margins that trail some of its rivals because of the cost-plus nature of much of its business and it has forecast anemic growth in 2022. Any would-be buyer would have to be attracted to the long-term value in the portfolio and look past what could be a rough few quarters ahead.

A lot of the biggest names in defense companies like Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.19%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC -0.05%) have shifted away from defense IT and are unlikely to get involved. But there are still plenty of potential bidders.

Here are four defense companies that are likely to take a close look at acquiring Mantech.

Leidos: The biggest name in defense IT

Leidos Holdings (LDOS 0.67%) ranks as the largest government IT contractor a position it has reached by being an active acquirer. Leidos was formed by the 2016 merger between units of SAIC (SAIC 1.73%) and Lockheed Martin and in the years since it has done a number of follow-on deals.

The Reuters report discussing Mantech's plans said the company and its banker had reached out to Leidos and for good reason. Leidos is valued at $12.4 billion and has the financial wherewithal to raise the capital necessary to pay for Mantech. A purchase would be a strong strategic fit making Leidos one of the top contractors to the intelligence community.

But Leidos is still in the process of paying down some of its debt from other acquisitions. The company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio today is pushing toward 3 and the company would have to take on significantly more leverage to come up with the cash Pedersen would presumably want in a sale.

Parsons: An outsider gaining scale

Parsons (PSN 1.44%) the other company mentioned in the Reuters report is a relative newcomer to defense IT. The company's roots are mostly in construction including massive projects for the Pentagon and other government customers but has used M&A to build its tech capabilities over the past decade.

A deal for Mantech would fully establish Parsons in the defense IT world and give it a seat at the table for a wide range of contracting opportunities. But Parsons is similarly sized to Mantech and seems likely to be disadvantaged in a bidding war. Because of its smaller size Parsons would probably have to lean heavily on stock to get a deal done which might not be of interest to Mantech's key shareholder.

General Dynamics: The deepest pockets in a bidding war

General Dynamics (GD 1.12%) is the only defense IT company that comes close to matching Leidos' heft and it's one of the few top-tier defense contractors that still is heavily invested in the IT business. GD gained significant scale with its $9.6 billion acquisition of CSRA back in 2018 and given its $60 billion market capitalization it would have no problem paying for another large acquisition.

After a few years spent investing in future products including a refreshed Gulfstream jet lineup GD expects to generate more than $3.5 billion in free cash flow in 2022 alone.

However investors haven't always been on board with the company's efforts to grow the IT part of its business. General Dynamics seems almost certain to at least give Mantech a look if its primary defense IT rival Leidos is involved in the bidding but it could decide to put its cash to work on buybacks or investment in other areas instead of involving itself in a heated auction.

CACI: Fortune favors the bold

CACI International (CACI 2.12%) has been one of the more aggressive consolidators in the sector in recent years making an audacious -- and ultimately unsuccessful -- bid to break up General Dynamics' CSRA deal and then finding numerous smaller targets as consolation prizes. A deal for Mantech wouldn't be nearly as hard to pull off as the attempted CSRA buy and CACI arguably needs the acquisition more than Leidos or GD if it wants to join the top echelon of IT contractors.

CACI is about double the size of Mantech but like Leidos its net debt is already more than 3 times EBITDA because of its other acquisitions. It's hard to imagine that CACI management wouldn't at least look hard at Mantech but it could be tough to get a deal done assuming Mantech is looking for cash.

Will private equity come calling?

It's been a tough few years for defense stocks as investors initially shied away ahead of the U.S. presidential election and then ran for the exit in 2021 after a combination of pandemic-related complications and a focus on Afghanistan led to a slowdown in Pentagon contract awards.

Mantech on its own is unlikely to generate much growth before the second half of 2022 at the earliest which could make it tough for any buyer to quickly impress with revenue synergies. But there are probably cost cuts to be had: General and administrative costs totaled 8.7% of revenue through the first nine months of 2021.

Private equity has been active in defense IT and Mantech with its depressed near-term growth outlook and room for cost cuts would seemingly fit what PE tends to look for in a deal. With so many other potential bidders digesting other deals or otherwise distracted there is a strong chance that a PE firm could be drawn to Mantech with the idea of flipping it to a larger buyer a few years down the line.

Mantech for its part is set to release earnings in late February. The company for now isn't talking but if the reports are correct and its founder is exploring options there are a wide range of potential suitors for the defense IT specialist.",,,,,,,,,

Nate and Lindsay Zervos say the new Wynwood model is the perfect fit for their family. The couple has two young boys and finds the many spacious bedrooms and family rooms meet all their needs.

The five bedroom four full and one half bathroom home has a master suite on the ground level and another full master upstairs. While the boys are young the Zervos’s are using the upstairs master to be closer to the children. But when the children get older they can have more privacy in the downstairs master.

“We plan to stay in the same house and we can change it up” Nate Zervos explained.

The home has a huge loft. It’s so big that Zervos had room for not only a couch and chairs but a lot more.

“We have outdoor monkey bars inside our home” Zervos described. “All the neighborhood kids love to come over and play on the monkey bars inside our house. We also have a Foosball table. When it is so hot in the summer we just bring the fun inside.”

Janet Graham an interior designer with Baers Furniture was amazed at the size of the upstairs loft.

“That loft is so huge we needed a very large sectional and two ottomans and there was a lot of furniture” she said about how she decorated the model.

The new Wynwood model recently opened in Verdana Village in Estero. The home spans 3945 square feet under air and 5234 total square feet including the outdoor living. Prices start at $750000.

Geoff Gaudet new home consultant for Lennar says the model is popular because of its two master suites. He said the second one can be used as an in-laws suite for grown children guests or for people like the Zervos who want a master near their young children but have the option to move to the ground floor master when their children get older.

“That brings back that extended family home” Gaudet said.

Scott Schilling area sales manager says customers love the office that is right off the great room.

“People are working from home more now and they like this” he said.

Zervos turned that office into a homeschool room for his children. Then he took one of the extra bedrooms and made it into his office. He said this flexibility in the floorplan is another thing he likes.

The Wynwood is Lennar’s largest model both inside and outside. The lanai spans more than 60 feet across. Under roof there is a spacious sitting and dining area and an outdoor kitchen. Beyond is the pool and spa. That’s why it is one of the models they are featuring in the Lee BIA Parade of Homes.

“It is nice to show because people are looking for space because they are used to those 4000 square foot homes up north” Gaudet said.

Greg and Jacquie Francis and their six children moved into a Wynwood a few weeks ago. Greg Francis said the size and layout is perfect for their large family.

“We are a family of eight so obviously we need space and a good layout” he said. “After looking at all kinds of places this had the best layout. The great room is huge the deck is huge.”

The Francis family also uses the den as a homeschool room. They use the loft as a rec room. The family is used to having a basement in Wisconsin.

“So this loft becomes like the basement” Francis explained

That’s where there is a sectional by the television Pac Man and foosball.

Francis says it’s a great place for the kids to play and hang out. They also enjoy the lanai. Besides the outside sitting and dining area the family also has a ping pong table out there.

“Of all the places I looked at by far it is the biggest one” Francis said. “It spans the whole length on the house. “We use it quite a bit.”

The model’s kitchen features a stainless steel built-in wall oven and microwave stainless steel side-by-side refrigerator/freezer stainless steel multicycle dishwasher and granite countertops with a four inch backsplash. The living room is highlighted with a nickel board wall behind the television. This matches one of the walls in the two story foyer.

“I really liked that built in wall around the TV in the living room” Graham said when asked about her favorite elements in the model. ”I also liked the nickel gap in the foyer. It really made it look elegant.”

Another favorite is in the dining room.

“I have had so many people call me over those dining room chairs” she explained. “They call it the lattice chairs. People really love those chairs. I have had 3-4 people call in me the past two weeks asking how they can get these”

Graham designs about 15 of Lennar’s models every year and said she especially likes the Wynwood.

“I think the best thing about the model is the size of it. It is huge” she exclaimed. “And it is laid out well.”

Those who have a Wynwood agree.

“We love it Zervos said. It gives us a place to enjoy and the boys have the room to run all over the place and have all the adventures they want to have. It is great for guests because they can have a suite. It gives you the space that you need. If you spend the majority of your time in your house it might as well be a place that you can do all you want to do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc2Z5aW1ieS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi9uZXctcGxhbnMtcmVkdWNlLXBhcmtpbmctZm9yLTIyMzEtb21lZ2Etcm9hZC1ob3RlbC1pbi1zYW4tcmFtb24tY29udHJhLWNvc3RhLWNvdW50eS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Plans Reduce Parking for 2231 Omega Road Hotel in San Ramon Contra Costa County,"The City of San Ramon’s planning commission has been presented amended plans for the Hampton Inn and Suite hotel for 2231 Omega Road in one of the larger cities of Contra Costa County. The altered proposal has switched the parking from an above-ground garage to subterranean levels and reduced the overall parking. Gerald Goldbach of Fortune Architects is responsible for the design.

The planning commission first approved plans for the hotel in 2019 following the Crow Canyon Specific Plan. According to this most recent application “two one-year Time Extensions were approved extending the project entitlements until March 28 2022.” This revision will now conform to the San Ramon Village Specific Plan.

The proposal for 2231 Omega Road is just one of several surfaced within the San Ramon Village Specific Plan. Adopted in November of 2020 the plan imagines transforming the 134-acre swatch of offices and service commercial into a new dense hub for retail and housing along the San Ramon Valley Boulevard commercial corridor.

If built the new hotel may expect to find additional construction across the street at 2233 San Ramon Valley Boulevard by Trumark and 2251 San Ramon Valley Boulevard by ROEM Development Corp. Further up the road The True Life Company is looking to build 57 units at 500 Deerwood Road. Seven West Capital has proposed building 47 new units to replace the Golden Skate at 2701 Hooper Drive.

The whole area is overlooked by a new massive suburban expansion Lennar at The Preserve. Full development will bring 215 new homes with prices ranging between $1-2.2 million. Most of the project has already been finished.

2231 Omega Road will replace a vacant lot and surface pavement spanning 1.2 cares with a four-story hotel with 90 guest rooms at the corner of Omega Road and Deerwood Road. The new plans call for a 40-car below-ground garage and surface parking for 64 cars for a total of 104 vehicles on-site. This differs from the 2019-approved plans with a 160-car multi-level garage.

The application was reviewed by the San Ramon planning commission on February 1st. The meeting did not yield a vote or any conclusive opinions from the commission.

Dhillon Goyal Hotel Group LLC is the project owner responsible for the development.

While performing on her ""Happier Than Ever"" World Tour on Feb. 5 the ""bad guy"" singer 20 stopped her show at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta to check in on a distressed fan and offer help.

According to fan Danna Macias who was at the event Eilish put everything on pause shortly after a nearby concertgoer asked to be removed from her place in the crowd because she was having difficulty breathing during the artist's set.

""They helped her out of general admission and made sure she was okay"" Macias told E! News. ""After that Billie noticed people were struggling so she asked everyone to take a step back and make room for everyone. Suddenly people started asking for an inhaler another girl was struggling to breathe. Billie stopped everything!""

In concert footage provided by Macias (@lifeofdann) Eilish can be seen scanning the crowd before asking her team for an inhaler. ""It's OK we got one"" she then said. ""Guys give her some time. Don't crowd.""

Turning to the rest of the audience Eilish added ""Relax relax it's OK!""

Before carrying on with the show the singer — who has a history of stopping shows throughout her career to check on the safety of concertgoers told the crowd ""I wait for people to be OK until I keep going"" as seen in another video posted by TMZ.

The incident comes almost two months after 10 people died from accidental suffocation after being crushed while in the crowd at Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival in Houston. The rapper stated that he was ""absolutely devastated"" in the wake of the mass casualty incident.

Much like The Beatles who were a major inspiration for Kurt Cobain many of Nirvana’s songs have been difficult to interpret. Heart-Shaped Box has been one of the band’s most enigmatic tracks with its intended meaning still being debated to this day. Featured on the group’s third and final album In Utero released in 1993 it wasn’t until years later when Courtney Love weighed in on the discussion. Her interpretation is a lot more intimate than some fans were expecting.

When it comes to understanding the track listeners need to know the context of when it was written. Penned in 1992 by Kurt Cobain it was one of the songs that formed the 1993 hit album In Utero.



It came after Nirvana’s second album Nevermind which was a game-changer for the band. Releasing to massive commercial and critical acclaim the group’s sound was still heavily critiqued by mainstream music critics.



This was something Cobain hated as he avoided any negative feedback at all costs as the musician took such words personally. He was also a politically progressive person a strong feminist and a champion of women’s rights.



However there was a specific report that inspired the Heart-Shaped Box. READ MORE: Elvis’ biggest phobias shared by family – ‘Even I didn’t know that!’

READ MORE 'Never contributed to music' Bing Crosby slammed the King before death According to Michael Azerrad’s book Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana shortly after Love and Cobain first met she made him a literal heart-shaped box filled with pine cones seashells and toys.



The book also notes a report about children with cancer playing a major role in the inspiration for the song something Cobain directly told the author Azerrad. Yet according to Love this only makes up part of the story.



The lyrics “I’ve been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks/I’ve been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap/I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black” have particularly drawn the attention of fans trying to decipher the track.

Nirvana: Kurt Cobain wrote Heart-Shaped Box in 1992

After Lana Del Rey performed a cover of the song in 2012 it caused a resurgence of interest in its meaning. Following the rendition Love took to Twitter to share her own intimate insight into the track.



According to NME Cobain's widow wrote: “You do know the song is about my vagina right? ‘Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back’ umm. On top of which some of the lyrics about my vagina I contributed. So umm next time you sing it think about my vagina will you?” (sic) These Tweets have since been deleted for an unknown reason.



It is certainly a compelling theory about the song one Anton Corbijn’s ideas concur with. He was the director of Heart-Shaped Box’s music video who believed the track was about Cobain’s relationship with Love along with the idea of cancer for children. DON'T MISS...

Billie Eilish had a moment during her Atlanta concert Saturday night that has gone viral for all the right reasons.

The Grammy winner was performing at State Farm Arena on her Happier Than Ever world tour when she stopped her concert to help out a fan in the crowd. “You need an inhaler?” Eilish is seen asking a young woman.

The moment was caught on camera by numerous concertgoers and posted to social media. In the video clips Eilish turns to security and asks them to locate an inhaler.

A few moments go by while personnel check on the girl. Meanwhile Eilish addressed the thousands of fans in the arena by saying “It’s OK … give her some time. Don’t crowd.”

As for the girl she appeared to be fine after the scare and stayed in the audience.

His first album No Parlez went triple platinum; Paul sang the opening lines on Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas?; and shot to Number One in the States with his exquisite rendition of Daryl Hall’s Every Time You Go Away.

Superstardom was there for the taking. Only it turned out Young didn’t want it. “You get to a point when you have to have a security guard” Paul tells me. “Then you have to have two… and that wasn’t what I’d signed up for.” For him performing was and remains its own reward – which is why he’s been happily playing medium-sized venues with his Tex-Mex band Los Pacaminos for the last thirty years. In 1987 he says “I took a decision to step away. I got married I became a dad. I needed normality. I’d started to make bad decisions. I thought the third album” [1986’s Between Two Fires] “hadn’t turned out the way I wanted it.” His record company CBS agreed he could take a break – unusual but Paul had clout. His first album alone sold more than seven million copies. The pause meant Young lost his career momentum but found contentment. He’d signed the deal in 1982 after six years fronting bands. He’d kept his keyboardist from rated R&B band the Q Tips – Ian “The Rev” Kewley – and their manager Ged Doherty who’d convinced Paul to go solo. Young felt grounded but fame still hit him like a tidal wave.

“I’d had a Number One but we’d be staying in disgusting cheap hotels with nylon sheets. On stage I was still doing what I’d done in the Q Tips only now the audience were all screaming. We were still going to gigs in a little transit van but fans were turning out in force. We arrived at one venue up north and it was like trying to drive through a riot. “As soon as they saw me they surrounded the van and started rocking it. They were having fun but it was scary. We were trapped in a sea of people and for a moment you think there’s no way out.” In the States things got weirder. Paul 66 a Texan fan asked to start his US fan club. “She seemed fine but then she started writing odd letters she began to claim we were an item and started sending me weird presents like a rhinestone cow’s vertebrae a cow’s backbone sprayed silver and mounted on a wooden plinth…” Luton-born Paul shakes his head. He’s 6ft 2 still instantly recognisable and remarkably down to earth – a tribute to his parents Tony a pattern maker for Vauxhall and wife Doris. Young had a four-year apprenticeship at the same Luton factory re-boring carburettors. His older brother Mark worked there too. Paul started playing piano at eight but Free turned him on to blues rock. “I used to go from Luton to London just to go to Dobells a blues and jazz record shop in Charing Cross Road” he recalls.

Always shy Paul’s childhood stutter was cured by performing onstage. At 17 he joined his first serious group Streetband who notched up a Top 20 hit by accident in 1978 when Kenny Everett became obsessed with Toast the B-side of their first single. “We were a rock band and people started coming to our shows expecting comedy” says Paul. “It killed us dead.” After his apprenticeship Young had told his father he was quitting to go pro. “Dad wasn’t happy but he said ‘At least you’ll have a trade to fall back on’. He advised me to work nights to build up cash. I did for six months – it was horrible. But I worked nights for the rest of my life” Paul laughs. After Streetband came The Q-Tips an animated eight-piece who played 250 gigs a year. “Best time of my life...I’ve never laughed so much.” With his grounding in blues and soul Paul stood out in the synth-dominated 80s but says “I didn’t start pinching myself until Live Aid. I’d had hits across Europe and was looking to become successful in the USA. Suddenly it was bigger than I could ever have imagined.” He pinched himself again in Los Angeles. “Ged was looking after Alison Moyet there. When I landed he invited me round for tea. I got there and Bruce Springsteen was on the sofa. “I told him I’d bought myself a Harley-Davidson a 1971 Electra Glide and he said ‘Fancy going for a ride?’ Bruce showed me his motorbike collection – he had a lot! – and we rode through Coldwater Canyon down to the desert. He was like a historian explaining all the heritage. A lovely man what you see is what you get with him.” Paul was still driving a decrepit Vauxhall Viva in 1983.

Paul performing at the Live Aid dual venue benefit concert in 1985

Fans who spotted him assumed he was a lookalike. When the royalties rolled in Young bought himself a limited-edition Porsche 924 Carrera GT and a Dino Ferrari. Now he drives a humbler Lexus 450. He met his late wife model Stacey Smith on the video shoot for Come Back And Stay. They married in LA in 1987 split in 2006 and reconciled in 2009. Sadly Stacey died of brain cancer four years ago. They have two daughters and a son all grown up. Paul now lives in Barnet north London with his new love who prefers to remain unnamed. “She doesn’t like the attention – she says it’s like being burgled.” She’s family orientated he says and ticks him off if he forgets to phone his children regularly. “We see the funny side of anything you can’t last without that. She’s into comedians I’m not but I like near-the-knuckle stand-ups like Dave Chapelle Jim Jeffreys and Ron White.” Wokeness makes him despair. “People should be forgiven for things they said in the past. Now you get one chance and get sent off the pitch. We need to chill.” He loves cooking almost as he does US roots music. He formed Los Pacaminos in 1992. “It allowed me to play guitar and let other people sing. I’d stopped playing instruments in 1983 because the musicians I had around me were incredible.”

He’s building his own home studio “a proper man-cave sound proofed so can practice my guitar sing and write songs.” He co-wrote his hit Everything Must Change in the 80s. When I ask what he listens to now his soulful eyes light up and he name-checks everyone from Bruno Mars to Mott The Hoople via Lana del Ray and “incredible” Carl Hall. Paul headlines an 80s heritage pop tour later this year with T’Pau and Hue & Cry. Before that there’s an 80s cruise in March sailing out of Miami a Go West tour in April and a possible US tour this summer.

Sex jealousy infidelity divorce and drugs were all driving factors behind the record that went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide with hits such as 'Second Hand News' 'The Chain' and 'Dreams' having left a permanent mark on popular culture. The album coincided with the band's use of cocaine reaching industrial levels; Stevie and her boyfriend and musical partner Lindsey Buckingham broke up; John and Christine got divorced; and Mick's marriage broke down. While the band has seen members drift and leave in tumultuous fashion over the years it is difficult to pinpoint something that defines an official breakup.

Vice President Supply Chain Operations Lockheed Martin Corp.

Chris Stone joined Lockheed Martin in 2021 after 25 years of leading operations and supply chain teams at Aerojet Rocketdyne Textron Smiths Aerospace and within the Army.

In 2021 Stone and the supply chain leadership team embarked on a multiyear journey to evolve performance resiliency and competitiveness across business areas and with more than 17000 suppliers.

As the pandemic progressed the team began implementing improvements while continuing to execute for customers and provide critical financial support to supplier partners. Last year Lockheed Martin accelerated over $24 billion in cash payments to suppliers to help ensure their business continuity.

“I am proud of how the supply chain organization stepped up in 2021” Stone said. “We continue to execute and adjust delivering for our customers while driving the improvements needed for the future.”

Why Watch

In 2022 Lockheed Martin’s supply chain team will launch a new electronic enterprise integration hub for its supply base and make improvements to integrate supplier relationship management across the corporation. These efforts are part of an ongoing plan to optimize the organization for the future transform the way it collaborates with and manages its suppliers and streamline operations with the supply base.

Mark Stewart Lockheed Martin’s senior vice president of operations is championing the supply chain transformation the company has undertaken.

Lockheed Martin press release

Prioritizing affordability and utilizing advanced manufacturing techniques Sikorsky a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: LMT) will build nine additional CH-53K™ aircraft at a lower unit price than previous lot buys resulting in significant savings for the U.S. government and taxpayers. The company’s experienced supply chain coupled with its active digital approach drives speed and affordability throughout design development production and sustainment.

The CH-53K will further support the U.S. Marine Corps in its mission to conduct expeditionary heavy-lift assault transport of armored vehicles equipment and personnel to support distributed operations deep inland from a sea-based center of operations critical in the Indo-Pacific region.

These nine helicopters are part of the 200 aircraft Program of Record for the U.S. Marine Corps with deliveries beginning in 2025.

“By embracing resilient predictive logistics and sustainment we are enabling CH-5K crews to make smarter faster decisions to increase reliability and improve readiness and material availability at a reduced burden to the fleet. After 50 years of supporting the CH-53E Sikorsky has a deep understanding of the heavy-lift mission and an enduring partnership with the U.S. Marines Corps enabling our team and our proven supply chain to offer tailored solutions resulting in more efficient missions.”

The aircraft will be built at Sikorsky headquarters in Stratford Connecticut leveraging the company’s digital build and advanced technology production processes.

The factory is active with seven CH-53K aircraft in build and there are 47 more aircraft in various stages of production.

Sikorsky has made significant investments in workforce training tooling and machinery to increase the number of aircraft built and delivered year over year.

In total Sikorsky has delivered five operational CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopters to the U.S. Marine Corps in Jacksonville North Carolina with four more planned for delivery this year.

The CH-53K program operated by the U.S. Marine Corps entered Initial Operational Test and Evaluation in 2021 and is set to conclude in 2022.

Sikorsky has a strong foundation to support the CH-53K because the company already provides the U.S. Marines with predictive maintenance on the legacy CH-53E by utilizing the Fleet Common Operating Environment (FCOE) enabling the shift from reactive to predictive maintenance.

The CH-53K aircraft is equipped with Integrated Vehicle Health Management System (IVHMS) which will transition the U.S. Marines from fixed interval to on-condition maintenance resulting in lower maintenance crew hours reduced life cycle costs and increased aircraft readiness.

Ebbing was selected last year as the Air Force's preferred location for a pilot training center for Singapore and other countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program. The proposal would accommodate up to 24 foreign Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft and move 12 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Singapore air force currently at the Luke Air Force Base at Glendale Ariz.

Residents largely spoke in support of the mission with questions regarding how they can welcome Singaporeans when contractors can bid on construction projects and when aircraft will start arriving.

Three people raised concerns regarding potential noise levels the program would bring and whether it would affect surrounding residents. Air Force officials said no noise studies have been done because it's too early in the process.

Patrick Jeanes of the Air Force's Air Education and Training Command said the move would require increases in personnel changes in aircraft numbers and operations and construction or renovation to support the F-16 and F-35 aircraft as well as a two F-35 flight simulator facilities. He said Ebbing could expect 384 military and civilian personnel -- which would be accompanied by dependents -- and about 3500-6600 annual flights with 10%-15% done between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.

Jeanes said if the center is at Fort Smith residents can expect F-16s around June 2023 and the first F-35s in July 2024.

Jeanes said the Singapore air force must leave Luke Air Force Base so the base can accommodate incoming F-35 aircraft. He said Ebbing would eventually host various countries' air force personnel over the course of the program including Poland and Finland and the base could remain indefinitely.

David Martin environmental impact statement project manager from the Air Force's Civil Engineer Center said it's too early in the process to answer a lot of the questions especially considering Fort Smith hasn't been officially chosen as the program site.

A couple of people questioned whether the Fort Smith Regional Airport runway extension is also a part of this project.

During the public comment portion Carl Geffken city administrator said the extension is a city project for economic development.

""We are very much in favor of this project coming to Fort Smith and most importantly the city Sebastian County and the state of Arkansas have been willing and able to do what's necessary in order to secure this project"" Geffken said.

Martin said it's federal law for agencies to identify and consider environmental consequences of implementing proposals such as at Ebbing. He said the National Environmental Policy Act requires an environmental impact statement to evaluate noise air quality compatible land use environmental justice socioeconomic factors air space use and management biological resources cultural resources hazardous material and solid waste health and safety physical resources transportation and potential noise.

""The EIS process began with a notice of intent that was published in a federal register on Jan. 14 This began the formal scoping period which ends on Feb. 14 2022. Please note all scoping comments must be received or postmarked by Feb. 14 2022. We anticipate having a draft EIS out for public review and comment in the summer of this year and a final EIS in early 2023"" Martin said.

While Ebbing is the preferred location the Air Force chose Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township Mich. if the center couldn't be at Fort Smith for some reason.

Roughly eight Harrison Township Mich. residents also spoke during the public comment portion to request Selfridge Air National Guard Base be chosen for the program instead.

""We'll embrace the Air Force. We do have a history of having F-16s in the area"" Fort Smith Mayor George McGill said. ""We appreciate the information you are providing to the community and we look forward to meeting everyone and greeting everyone. Our schools are prepared to meet your students and your children when they arrive as well. We're looking forward to it and when you do an honest assessment of our base you're going to find it has everything that you need to provide a successful mission.""

Mary Golda Ross (1908 – 2008) was a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and a brilliant engineer and trailblazer who made lasting contributions to the US aerospace industry. She earned both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in mathematics and moved to California at the start of WWII where she was hired as a mathematician by Lockheed in 1942.

At Lockheed she worked on the twin-tailed P-38 Lightning fighter plane and was a founding engineer of Lockheed’s legendary top-secret Skunk Works program. Ross also worked on the earliest designs for interplanetary space travel and flyby missions to Mars and Venus crewed and uncrewed Earth-orbit flights and studies of orbiting satellites that could be used for both defense and civilian purposes.

To honor and memorialize Ross as a “hidden figure” who was a 20th century pioneer for space exploration a statue of her is being revealed at the First Americans Museum (FAM) in Oklahoma City on 7 February. FAM first opened its doors to the public in September 2021 with a mission of celebrating and creating awareness of the stories of 39 distinct tribal nations that exist in Oklahoma today.

Olay which supports women in science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) and is the statue sponsor worked with the National Air and Space Museum to make sure that the statue is historically accurate.

“The First Americans Museum is a fitting site to honor the life and legacy of aerospace engineer Mary Golda Ross because she attributed her success to her Oklahoma upbringing” says Emily Margolis curator of American women’s history in aviation spaceflight astronomy and planetary science at the National Air and Space Museum and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge Massachusetts.

“Raised and educated in Park Hill and Tahlequah Oklahoma capital of the Cherokee Nation Ross reflected that ‘a firm foundation in mathematics and qualities that came down to me from my Indian heritage’ prepared her to work on some of the most important aerospace technologies of the 20th century.”

In a statement the Mary Golda Ross Trust noted that Ross always encouraged everyone to seek education especially in STEM careers. “This statue will remind the public of what is possible when they believe in themselves and push to break through glass ceilings. As a Cherokee from Park Hill Oklahoma Mary broke through societal stereotypes to help pave the way for others to follow.” This isn’t the first honor for Mary Golda Ross. A portrait of Ross titled Ad Astra per Astra by Cherokee artist America Meredith is in the collection of the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian.

Ross’s image also appears on the reverse (tails) side of the 2019 Native American $1 coin (Sacagawea is on the front). The image of Ross shows her writing calculations with an image of an Atlas-Agena rocket launching into space in the background and an equation inscribed in its cloud. The US Mint notes that the equation denotes the energy it takes to leave Earth and reach the orbit of a distant planet and represents Ross’s important contributions to the space program.

Ross who lived to be 99 was also the subject of the Google Doodle on 9 August 2018 – on what would have been her 110th birthday.

Those who click on the Google Doodle can learn more about this accomplished woman and read this comment from her nephew on his aunt’s legacy:

A proud Cherokee woman and the great-great granddaughter of Chief John Ross Mary is an excellent role model for young women and American Indians everywhere. Her accomplishments are a testament to her determination and love for education. Our hope as a family is that her story inspires young people to pursue a technical career and better the world through science.

The in-house store credit card offers your choice of 5% off purchases or special financing offers for no-interest or low-interest payoff periods.

Although that’s tempting money expert Clark Howard says this type of offer is not for everyone. He says there are risks with store credit cards like these that you may not be aware of. I’m going to detail them in this article as well as all the pros and cons of this particular card.

Table of Contents

What Is the Lowe’s Advantage Card?

The Lowe’s Advantage Card is an in-house store credit card offered by the home improvement retailer. It does not carry a Visa or Mastercard logo which means you can use it only for purchases made at a Lowe’s store or through Lowes.com.

This card which is often pitched as a quick-approval option while in the store does offer two potential benefits. You can use it for special financing for home improvement projects home appliances and more. Or you can use it for 5% off the purchase price of eligible items. If your purchase qualifies for both you must choose one or the other.

How Can I Save Money With the Lowe’s Advantage Card?

There are a couple of different ways that you could use the Lowe’s Advantage card to enhance your purchases at the home improvement store:

Discount off the purchase price Special financing

It’s important to note that these two ways cannot be combined. The fine print on the card excludes it and it is clearly explained on Lowe’s website.

Lowes.com

When you look at these options you may notice that the 5% off is similar to what some non-branded credit cards offer in cash back or in rewards points. But the advantage here is that you’re getting an immediate 5% off your purchase price rather than a reward of a credit on your billing statement.

Clarks says the 5% discount is enough to consider this card if you’re a frequent shopper at the store. That comes with an important caveat though: He says you must pay your balance in full each month for the discount to be worth it.

The special financing offers are where people may run into trouble. Clark has a warning on retroactive interest with these purchases. I’ll explain that later in this article.

How To Use the Lowe’s Advantage Card

Discounts Off the Purchase Price Special Financing Offers 5% Off Most Everyday Purchases: There is no limit to the number of purchases you can make at the 5% discount but there are some limitations and exclusions you should note. 6 Months of No Interest Financing: If you spend more than $299 on a purchase with this card it is eligible for “special financing” that will let you pay off the balance in monthly installments for six months. However if you don’t repay the total by the end of the term you could be subject to retroactive interest all the way back to the date of sale. 20% Off First Purchase: As of January 2022 Lowe’s was running a promotional offer: 20% off the first purchase made by new cardholders. The discount was capped at $100. 84 Months of Fixed Payments: With a purchase of $2000 or more you can use this card to pay at a fixed APR. While that may sound good on the surface the fine print offers a warning: You must make fixed monthly payments for the duration of the payback period.

Is the Risk Worth the Potential Reward?

The idea of an interest-free six-month period to finance your next big household purchase is attractive on the surface. But there are risks involved.

The main risk associated with this card is retroactive interest. Let me explain how that works.

If you make a Lowe’s purchase of $299 or more you can use this card to get 0% financing on the purchase for six months.

If you fail to pay the balance in full by the end of the six months you will be assessed retroactive interest charges on the full purchase amount. And that interest accrues from the date of the purchase leaving you owing well in excess of the amount you saw at the register.

Though interest rates vary based upon your credit assessment it’s likely that your APR will be higher than the national average if you incur the retroactive interest.

After digging into the fine print on this offer I found a few other things to consider:

Making the required monthly payments is not necessarily going to be the path to paying off your purchase: “Depending on purchase amount promotion length and payment allocation the required minimum monthly payment may or may not pay off purchase by end of the promotional period.”

If you have more than one purchase financed on the card your payments may not go directly to the special finance offer: “Some or all of the minimum payment based on the promotional balance may be applied to other account balances.”

Clark doesn’t like the special financing but if you use it solely to get the 5% back and pay it off monthly this card could work. For shoppers who fit into this category you may also want to consider using a rewards credit card that can be used anywhere.

Using a cash back credit card such as the Citi Double Cash could be a way to secure 2% cash back without having to tap into a new line of credit. Revolving cash back cards such as the Discover it Cash Back Card or Chase Freedom offer 5% cash back on categories that change every three months. It’s worth checking those categories before your Lowe’s purchase to see if you may qualify for the 5% discount.

2 Alternatives to the Lowe’s Advantage Card

If you are looking for an alternative to using a store credit card Clark says these are better ways to finance your upcoming home improvement project if you can’t pay for it in cash.

Clark’s First Suggestion: Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)

If the project is large enough you may actually want to visit your local bank or credit union first. If there is equity in your home applying for a home equity line of credit may be the most prudent financial decision.

Clark says you’re probably better off securing a lower APR rate via traditional lending if you know you can’t pay off the full balance of your purchase before the introductory offer expires.

“Even though they’re going to pay interest right away they’re going to pay a much lower effective interest rate than even with 6 12 or 18 months at 0% but then goes to a 25% or higher interest rate later” Clark says.

Clark’s Second Suggestion: Low Fixed-Rate Credit Card

Is your home project expensive but not worth leveraging the mortgage on your house? Clark has another alternative: Ask your bank or credit union about its lowest fixed-rate APR credit cards.

Clark says you often can find a fixed-rate credit card at a credit union for under 10% APR. He would prefer locking in that card rate and trying to pay the balance off early instead of using the 84-month fixed-rate financing through Lowe’s.

Final Thoughts

If you are considering a large purchase at Lowe’s the temptation will be there to apply for the Lowe’s Advantage Card. Here are some pros and cons to consider before you make that decision:

Lowe’s Advantage Card: Pros and Cons

Pros Cons Up to 20% off first purchase with the card Cannot use the card anywhere but Lowe’s 5% off most Lowe’s purchases with the card There is potential for high APR interest accrual Special financing offers give 0% periods on some purchases Retroactive interest due on special financing if balance not paid in full by end of promo period

Bottom Line: If you have the financial flexibility and personal discipline to pay your bill for this card immediately you could enjoy 5% off most of your home improvement purchases. However if you’re trying to finance a home improvement project that will take you some time to repay money expert Clark Howard strongly cautions against getting involved with this type of credit.

By Mike London

mike.london@salisburypost.com

CHINA GROVE — As a high school senior at East Rowan Jonathan Lowe filled out one of those famed “Meet the Players” forms for the Salisbury Post.

Favorite Movie: Remember the Titans.

Favorite TV show: Friday Night Lights.

Lowe also competed in basketball and track and field for the Mustangs but he clearly was a football-crazy kid.

“Nothing on my list of favorites has changed” Lowe said with a laugh.

That form was filled out 10 years ago. Lowe is now a football-crazy adult a student of X’s and O’s as well as a student of character-building.

He’s a college graduate (Liberty University) a smart guy (a kinesiology major) and a clean-living role model who met his future wife at church. He’s a responsible committed Carson P.E. teacher a husband and father of twins.

Lowe will turn 28 on Feb. 15 the same day that the twins (a boy and a girl) turn 2. When that sort of cosmic stuff happens maybe you’re living a charmed life. He likes to think so.

Lowe was introduced to the Carson football team as the program’s new commander-in-chief on Friday.

The response was overwhelming. He’s a popular choice among the players as well as the coaching staff a group that will include veteran assistants/advisors such as Jason Stanley and former West Davidson head coach Barry Mitchem.

“It got pretty loud in there when (new AD) Josh Trexler introduced me to the team” Lowe said. “That was gratifying. I’ve gotten a lot of texts from players who can’t wait to get started. We haven’t even had a team meeting yet but there’s a lot of excitement.”

It’s the dream job for Lowe who grew up with aspirations of returning home after college and coaching somewhere in that East Rowan/Carson/South Rowan triangle. Now he’s another Mustang who wears orange joining a long list of notable East-to-Carson coaches that includes Trexler Chris Cauble Brian Perry Brooke Stouder Kelan Rogers and Kayela Galloway.

Lowe is taking the reins at a school with a reputation for dedicated students and athletes but it’s not an easy place to win in football.

Carson is 65-114 all-time in the sport. Part of that record is due to those difficult seasons when the program was just getting off the ground under Mark Woody but Joe Pinyan acknowledged by everyone as one of the best in county history was 28-40 there so it’s no piece of cake.

Daniel Crosby whose move to Mount Pleasant opened the door for Lowe knew his stuff and went 9-19 in three seasons.

Needless to say coaching football goes well beyond the record book. Head football coaches are incredibly impactful people who can positively affect student-athletes for the rest of their lives. You can’t save all of them but you can certainly help a lot of them get on the right road.

Lowe gets that.

“This is a great opportunity to make an impact in this community” Lowe said. “It’s been 10 years since I was a high school senior. One of my goals is to still be on that Carson sideline when this year’s seniors come back for their 10th reunion.”

Lowe was a high school quarterback one of the guys at East who kept things going between Jamey Blalock and Samuel Wyrick. He was on good teams and that went to the playoffs and he was on teams that struggled so he saw both sides of it. He was a starter and he was a backup so he saw both sides of that. He had a serious injury (ACL) during his high school career and came back from it so he’s seen adversity. His high school head coaches were Brian Hinson and Chad Tedder.

Lowe developed a passion for football early on and got started in the game playing in the Rowan YFL.

When he graduated from East and headed to Liberty in Lynchburg Va. he had a serious interest in aviation but the dream to teach and coach won out.

He went to work for the Liberty football team as a student assistant.

“Started out as low as you can possible go” Lowe said. “Washing josh straps whatever was needed. Just anything to get involved with the football program.”

He worked his way up and got noticed by head coach Turner Gill the former Nebraska quarterback. He moved into larger roles being a part of game day operations assisting with play calls from the press box breaking down film keeping charts.

“All of it was great experience” Lowe said. “Liberty had a very good program. We played UNC played West Virginia. I got two conference championship rings.”

The chance to come home materialized in February 2019 when Lowe was hired to teach and coach at Southeast Middle School. He was head football coach at China Grove Middle before moving over to Carson to become part of the Cougars’ staff in 2021. His wife is still a teacher at China Grove.

Benjamin Crawford Carson’s principal was at China Grove before coming to Carson. He’s sold on Lowe. He’s hired him more than once.

While Lowe didn’t arrive at Carson until 2021 with the COVID situation he was able to be involved with two football seasons in a single calendar year. He’s been a quarterbacks coach and a defensive backs coach.

“Being part of the Carson staff I already know our players and that’s a big advantage as opposed to coming in and having to learn a new team” Lowe said.

Lowe who is currently coaching jayvee boys basketball isn’t locked into a single football coaching philosophy

“Kids graduate kids leave so you have to adapt to the personnel you have” Lowe said.

Carson did a fine job offensively after putting in the split-back veer in the fall. Senior quarterback Hunter Burris and senior back Carter Dowd were ideal fits for that system and put up great rushing numbers for a team that was competitive most Fridays.

Teams stacked the box against the Cougars last season knowing they were only going to throw in desperate situations. Lowe expects to throw more.

“I think with the personnel we have that we’ll be a power running team on offense but we’ll be a team that can also go from the gun” Lowe said. “We’ll try to keep it simple and we want to be masters of the simple. But we want to use multiple sets give opponents several things to prepare for. Defensively we’ve got really good players returning. Our defensive line will be especially strong.”

Week 2 of the 2022 season will be interesting.

Carson vs. Crosby’s Mount Pleasant team. The two coaches are friends.

Crosby was one of the first to send Lowe congratulations on his promotion.

It’s an exciting time for Lowe and his family. The football-crazy kid has grown up and he’s ready for the next challenge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uZmVkZXguY29tL25ld3Nyb29tL2dsb2JhbC1lbmdsaXNoL2ZlZGV4LWRlbGl2ZXJzLXZpbmNlLWxvbWJhcmRpLXRyb3BoeS10by1zdXBlci1ib3dsLWx2aS1pbi1sb3MtYW5nZWxlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Delivers Vince Lombardi Trophy to Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles,"Los Angeles Feb. 5 2022 – As the sports world converges on Los Angeles for Super Bowl LVI between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy has arrived on the scene via FedEx the Official Delivery Service of the NFL. For the first time ever the trophy’s signature delivery moment was made via an electric Light Commercial Vehicle (eLCV). The company’s newest electric zero-tailpipe emissions delivery vehicle delivered the coveted trophy to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s officially kicking off the weeklong celebration leading up to Super Bowl LVI.

“The Vince Lombardi Trophy delivery is an important tradition of Super Bowl week and FedEx couldn’t be prouder to play a role in its safe timely arrival each year” said Jenny Robertson senior vice president Integrated Marketing and Communications. “This year’s delivery is particularly special as it marks the first delivery of the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Super Bowl using an all-electric zero-tailpipe emissions FedEx delivery vehicle.”

The FedEx deployment of all-electric vehicles marks an exciting moment in the brand’s journey toward operating an all-electric global pickup and delivery (PUD) fleet – a key component of the company’s goal to reach carbon neutral operations globally by 2040.

Devance Bowen a Los Angeles resident and FedEx Express courier for 31 years assisted in the delivery to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s. Helping Devance make the key delivery was Super Bowl XXXIV Champion and 7-time Pro Bowler Torry Holt. Together the duo showcased the trophy in front of a contingent of NFL fans and media.

The historic Vince Lombardi Trophy which was handcrafted by artisans at Tiffany & Co. is made of sterling silver and depicts a regulation-size football in kicking position on a pyramid-like base that features the words ‘Vince Lombardi Trophy’ and ‘Super Bowl LVI’ along with the NFL shield.

To ensure a smooth delivery to Los Angeles the trophy was monitored in real-time by SenseAware® a FedEx innovation. The trophy started its overnight journey from NFL Headquarters in New York City and then traveled across the country to its destination in Los Angeles. The SenseAware technology also tracks and communicates environmental conditions inside the container including temperature humidity shock and light detection which would indicate if the package was opened before its arrival.

Throughout the week fans visiting the Los Angeles area can get up-close and personal with the trophy at the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s starting Saturday Feb. 5 & Sunday Feb. 6 and again on Thursday Feb. 10 – Saturday Feb. 12 at the LA Convention Center. On Sunday Feb. 13 it will be awarded to either the Cincinnati Bengals or the Los Angeles Rams commemorating a Super Bowl LVI Champion for the 2021-2022 NFL season.

“Each year we love giving our fans the chance to see the Vince Lombardi Trophy up-close at Super Bowl Experience before it is awarded to the Super Bowl Champions” said Peter O’Reilly NFL EVP of Club Business and League Events. “We appreciate the help of our friends at FedEx to kick off the week-long celebration for Super Bowl LVI here in Los Angeles.”

She and her team spent a lot of time with athletes to learn what clothing makes them comfortable. The uniform creation process spanned 18 months she said.

""It was doing tons of interviews and just spending time with athletes to really understand their mindset in those moments what they needed to feel in those moments what the environment was like in those moments"" she said.

""My team was doing human insights. We did testing in our environmental chamber simulating the Beijing opening ceremony's conditions with athletes.""

Murnaghan completed a master's degree at the University of British Columbia and hoped to work in academia. A two-year plan turned into 16.

""I stayed here and did my PhD and still planned on continuing into academia but I started consulting for Lululemon"" she said.

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

4 Bezos purchased his third mansion on Miami’s “Billionaire Bunker” in April (pictured) in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million. MEGA

Florida for reference ranks 13th in the US in overall cattle numbers with a total herd size of 886000 among 15000 beef producers with total sales of $546 million according to Fortune citing the Florida Beef Council.

Before garnering US approval GOOD Meat had already been selling its cultivated chicken in Singapore. It made its debut in America in a dish curated by well-known chef José Andrés at his Washington DC restaurant China Chilcano.

The nonprofit Good Food Institute reports that the cultivated meat industry has grown to include more than 150 companies backed by $2.6 billion in investments Fortune cited — with Bezos among those funding the sector.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

Sources privy to the matter revealed to The Post that Bezos intends to take up residence in this new acquisition while orchestrating the demolition of his two previous island properties — which includes a $79 million abode and its neighboring $68 million property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L2ZyZWUtbWFkb25uYS1jb25jZXJ0LWRyYXdzLWNyb3dkLW9mLTE2bS10by1icmF6aWxzLWNvcGFjYWJhbmEtYmVhY2jSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9mcmVlLW1hZG9ubmEtY29uY2VydC1kcmF3cy1jcm93ZC1vZi0xNm0tdG8tYnJhemlscy1jb3BhY2FiYW5hLWJlYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Madonna concert draws crowd of 1.6m to Brazil’s Copacabana beach,"With the world-famous statue towering over it from Corcovado mountain Rio de Janeiro is well used to Christ the Redeemer. For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Palm Springs California has long been an oasis for Southern Californians — and those from farther afield — looking to escape the busyness of daily life or the cold of winter with a trip to the warm desert.

Set in the stunning Sonoran Desert and surrounded by mountains (that often have snow at the top even in the summer) the Palm Springs area has something for everyone. The weather is great year-round (though it gets very hot in the summer; it is the desert after all). There's an abundance of golf courses and tennis courts plus a plethora of cultural attractions and a vibrant dining and drinking scene.

As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on travelers — and the travel industry — have realized the potential of this destination as a perfect escape.

The city and surrounding area have actually benefitted tremendously from the shift in travel preferences away from crowded cities and international destinations for places closer to home with lots of outdoor space. In fact the nation's major airlines added new flights to the desert city betting that it'll remain a popular destination for Americans looking to get away from the monotony of everyday life during the pandemic.

Predictably as the popularity of Palm Springs has increased over the years there are numerous top-notch resorts that cater to a wide range of people from a solo traveler looking to get away from it all to those seeking a family-friendly spot to let the kids burn off some of that pent-up energy in the great outdoors.

The four major hotel chains — Hilton Hyatt IHG and Marriott — all have properties in the area (along with some great independent properties) but as you'll see in the list below those with Marriott Bonvoy points to burn are spoiled for choice whereas those loyal to any of the other three chains won't be able to be as picky.

Let's take a look at the top points hotels in the area should you want to take advantage of all the new flight options into Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) and enjoy a desert vacation.

The Moxy brand will have a “pretty solid resonance in India"" he said. “It will combine style with affordability and we believe we will have significant traction with this brand here"" he said.

In 2022-23 Marriott expects to open 20 properties in India including the 300-room JW Marriott Bengaluru Prestige Golfshire Resort and Spa. JW Marriott has presence in several Indian cities including Delhi and Mumbai.

Globally it owns 30 brands such as Bvlgari Hotels St Regis Edition The Ritz-Carlton and W Hotels in the luxury space besides premium hotels like Le Meridien Sheraton and Westin.

Marriott operates 128 hotels in India at present across 16 brands. Last year it signed 24 new hotels in South Asia 17 of which were in India. The company expects to have 70 more hotels in India by 2027. It will also launch its luxury brand Marriott Marquis in New Delhi.

The new additions primarily in the luxury and premium space are growing significantly Govil said. Several newly signed projects are under construction in tier II markets he said.

“We do expect to see considerable traction across all segments in India. Our South Asia region is anchored around India and it is the second biggest market for us in the Asia Pacific (after China). So it is a big big market for us. These hotels should come to fruition in the next three to five years"" Govil said.

According to hospitality consultancy Hotelivate with approximately 21000 rooms Marriott International remains the number one hotel operator in the country. Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) (Taj Hotels Resorts Palaces Safaris and Ginger) despite having more properties than Marriott International ranked second as its room count is lower.

“Another (covid) wave notwithstanding we do see a lot of indicators that point to the fact that demand is likely to return. We see a lot of our hotels growing in occupancy. We also believe that our profit margins in the business will improve in these years as we ramp up back to 2019 levels. These two years will be very important years for us"" Govil added.

In the next two years the company will open hotels in Goa Vadodara Trichy Trivandrum Amritsar Rishikesh Bengaluru and Ahmedabad besides mid-priced brand Courtyard by Marriott in Mumbai.

Late last year it signed an agreement with the Prestige Group and DB Realty to launch the Marriott Marquis in New Delhi and St. Regis at Aerocity which will be operational by 2025. The 779- room inventory across the two brands will include the 600-room Marriott Marquis.

The hospitality industry is going through seismic changes and all the companies are recalibrating their businesses from time to time Govil said. “This has not been overly helpful to us because we’ve had to recalibrate periodically"" he said. However the recovery has been faster compared to the previous waves Govil said. “This time around we are not seeing as many cancellations but instead there have been postponements"" he said.

Hotelivate said in a report that in FY21 organized rooms supply in India grew by 3.3% over the previous fiscal year. India has about 144000 branded rooms including the 4093 new rooms launched last year. A majority of this inventory came up in major metros growing 1% in FY21. Delhi topped the charts with 15181 rooms followed by Mumbai including Navi Mumbai (14330) and Bengaluru with 13901 rooms.

According to the 2021 Indian Hospitality Trends and Opportunities report by Hotelivate Marriott IHCL and Radisson Hotel Group were the three largest hotel companies in India followed by French hospitality firm Accor.

Then COVID-19 came along stalling growth and plans for the entire hospitality industry. The hotel industry suffered its “most devastating year on record” in 2020 as travel slammed to a standstill and more than 670000 hotel industry jobs vanished nationwide according to the American Hotel and Lodging Association.

But that turned around last year as travel-starved guests emerged from quarantine. The development of vaccines and “consumer optimism” led to a boost in demand in 2021 which is expected to continue into this year AHLA and Accenture predicted in a recent report. In 2022 occupancy rates and room revenue are predicted to nearly rebound back to 2019 levels Oxford Economics estimates.

The boutique hotel sector is specifically seeing expansion accounting for almost 5500 hotels across the U.S. – a 7.7% jump compared to 2021 said Christian E. Hardigree dean of the Metropolitan State University of Denver’s School of Hospitality. The pandemic has driven travelers toward the boutique market which is expected to rake in $16.9 billion in revenue this year she added in a phone interview.

“People are like ‘Hey it’s a smaller facility. I’m not dealing with thousands of people’ ” Hardigree said. “I feel safer and more in control of my environment.”

Almost two years after COVID-19 began its spread Henning Rahm regional general manager for both Limelight Hotel Aspen and Snowmass sees a silver lining for his sector: It “created an über-amount of demand.”

“We see a cancellation come in and almost two new requests for the same time frame” Rahm added in a phone interview.

He pointed to plenty of pandemic-related problems including supply-chain issues that left a facility renovation unfinished by its deadline. His company has also taken the step of requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccinations for employees and guests — not an industry standard in the U.S. but something that hotels in other parts of the country are doing.

Boutique hotels fall under different style categories and offer “curated” experiences. Mustafa Menekse director of sales and marketing at The Maven personally considers a boutique hotel as one with “no brand behind it” like Marriott International Inc. or Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. “We basically create all of the amenities from scratch and tailor towards our audience.”

The Maven opened in April 2017 in downtown Denver’s Lower Downtown neighborhood. It’s situated in Dairy Block a micro-district that once housed Windsor Dairy which lets The Maven’s team offer guests “an urban experience” Menekse said in a phone interview.

“A true boutique independent hotel doesn’t answer to any corporate brand” said Ed Blair area general manager of The Oxford Hotel in LoDo and The Crawford Hotel above Denver Union Station. A former Marriott employee Blair’s been an industry fixture since 1989. “We get to decide what our brand is and change that by the hour if we so choose.”

The two hotels tie luxury with history he added pointing to The Oxford’s recent 130th anniversary. Travelers are “looking for something that’s got heart and soul” particularly after the pandemic boxed them into their homes Blair said.

COVID-19 temporarily shuttered the doors of his hotels and that led to difficult staffing decisions in 2020. “To look in the eyes of 60 people that you love and care for and lay them off or put them on furlough was definitely the most painful and difficult professional experience I’ve ever had” Blair said.

However last year went “exceptionally well” for both The Crawford and The Oxford he said with their performance nearing that of 2019. “We expect to see a great recovery in 2022” with group business and corporate travel hopefully returning Blair added.

Because of the growing popularity of boutique hotels Don Swedberg general manager of Kimpton Hotel Monaco Denver located downtown said industry giants have attempted to shift toward the boutique style over the past decade. “A lot of my career I spent it with big major brands and they can be stuffy and uptight” said Swedberg a 30-year industry veteran who joined Hotel Monaco’s team in 2019.

However the Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group LLC is an industry powerhouse in its own right with 75 open hotels and 32 under development as of Sept. 30. The group claims it “first introduced the boutique concept” to the U.S. on its website and Swedberg calls Hotel Monaco the first boutique hotel in Denver when it opened in 1998.

Boutique hotels let guests and staff “be a little bit quirky” he added in a phone interview. Swedberg pointed to their partnership with Colorado-based Lifeline Puppy Rescue which brings puppies into the hotel to socialize them.

Candace Duran director of sales and marketing at HALCYON a hotel in Cherry Creek highlighted the small touches that enhance a traveler’s stay such as rooftop telescopes and complementary access to the Denver Botanic Gardens.

Guests are “really wanting to spend for an experience” she said with the pandemic only encouraging that attitude.

“People did not balk at rates. They were ready to travel” said Duran who’s worked at HALCYON for almost five years. “Every weekend we were sold out almost” during the summer months of 2021.

Given the hotel’s success in bouncing back from the pandemic’s initial impact she looks forward cautiously: “This next year – because it was so great last year – is a little scary.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmVhc2lhLmNvbS9pbi9ob3RlbHMvc291dGhlYXN0LWFzaWEtaG90ZWxzL2x1eHVyeS1ob3RlbHMtaW4tYmF0YW0tYW5kLWJpbnRhbi_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmF2ZWxhbmRsZWlzdXJlYXNpYS5jb20vaW4vaG90ZWxzL3NvdXRoZWFzdC1hc2lhLWhvdGVscy9sdXh1cnktaG90ZWxzLWluLWJhdGFtLWFuZC1iaW50YW4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Beautiful Resorts And Hotels In Batam And Bintan Are What You Need For Your Next Luxe Getaway!,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.travelandleisureasia.com/in/hotels/southeast-asia-hotels/luxury-hotels-in-batam-and-bintan/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmVhc2lhLmNvbS9pbi9ob3RlbHMvc291dGhlYXN0LWFzaWEtaG90ZWxzL2x1eHVyeS1ob3RlbHMtaW4tYmF0YW0tYW5kLWJpbnRhbi_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmF2ZWxhbmRsZWlzdXJlYXNpYS5jb20vaW4vaG90ZWxzL3NvdXRoZWFzdC1hc2lhLWhvdGVscy9sdXh1cnktaG90ZWxzLWluLWJhdGFtLWFuZC1iaW50YW4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Indeed this is a band - now Brit and Grammy-nominated - who have gone from poetic dissidents to spearheading the ever-expanding pack of post-punkers. As four scraggly but dapper figures saunter onto stage fortressed in by rope ladder lights affixed with fake roses trailing behind them comes lumbering vocalist Grian Chatten — a mean feat given none of the band seems to stand higher than the stacked amps. Pacing faster as “Too Real” whips itself and the crowd to life his striped shirt and dog tags hang effortlessly a small tattoo on his pale right bicep revealing itself as flashing lights match the beat. Instantly the crowd swirls along with the guitars before the venue erupts in pent up howls of “ISITTOOREALFORYAAAA!”

Following closely “Televised Mind” continues the Irish bands London takeover before the punchy mod beat of “Sha Sha Sha”. “Hullo” are the first of few words from Chatten instead throughout it’s the setlist and body language that does the talking. With “Lucid Dream” he leans reaching his hand out gesturing symbolically for guidance or to save the souls before him. The live debut of their latest single “Jackie Down The Line” finds a rousing reception along with proof that Fontaines are simply unstoppable. They’re a juggernaut of poetic prose rooting around sturdy focused driving rhythms and melodies flowing between predatory and solemn.

“Yous a Guinea pig and a half” Chatten's voice laughingly growls through the darkness at the promised debut of more cuts from their upcoming third album Skinty Fai. Next picking up a bouquet of fake flowers and clattering tambourine they break into “I Don’t Belong” followed by “You Said” before “I Love You” the second new track of the evening makes an appearance (aired previously at Ally Pally). “Consider this song a sincere and honest prayer for the kids” Chatten wryly says letting us know guitarist Carlos O’Connell has opened a callous on his hand. Their wicked Irish sense of humour plays well with their passion for creating unfurling scenes deeper than the pages of Ulysses. The clattering drums of Dogrel opener “Big” wade in. Finishing it off by violently stamping his mic stand into the stage till it retreats inside itself — the pen is mightier than the sword but it feels like Chatten can wield both indiscriminately.

“Hurricane Laughter”’s eye rotates the crowd forward ready to hungrily consume the band if not for being blocked by the security rail. Next up “I Was Not Born” sandwiches in before “Roman Holiday” the freshest of the Skinty Fai songs to get a debut. The air stills as the crowd ingest this new offering a swirling near-psychedelic lament where Chatten urges “Baby come on get stoned get stoned”. Compensating this new airings delicateness “Boys In The Better Land” finally kicks to life. The sermon finds its congregation and all are delivered.

“This is our last song” Chatten says not even believing his own words as “A Hero’s Death” springs to life. “Life ain’t always empty” is its rallying cry — and a promise from Fontaines. As the notes fall away guitars are removed from nonchalant bodies who saunter off the stage as effortlessly as they did on. “God fucking bless” Chatten mumbles once more into the mic before disappearing into that good night. True to his word it is their last song.

This is why Fontaines DC. are special. They always leave you guessing you feel you understand them but there’s always a layer they’ll keep close to their chests — an intricate subplot you miss due to the behemoth nature of the main arc. But when they can tower over the largest and smallest of stages with such mesmerising might who cares?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhyYmxvY2suY29tL3RheC1jZW50ZXIvZmlsaW5nL25vdC1yZXF1aXJlZC10by1maWxlLXRheGVzL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhyYmxvY2suY29tL3RheC1jZW50ZXIvZmlsaW5nL25vdC1yZXF1aXJlZC10by1maWxlLXRheGVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Not required to file taxes? 7 ways you may be leaving money on the table,"While not every taxpayer is required to file a tax return there are several potential benefits to doing so. Yes getting a refund back is one. But in addition to not leaving money on the table there are a few other reasons why you may want to file this tax season.

If you’ve ever asked “do I have to file a tax return every year” you might be simply thinking about making sure you’re in line with IRS rules. But with that approach you miss out on why you may want to file. So let’s change the question from “am I required to file taxes?” to “what are the potential benefits of filing taxes?”

Reasons to file so you’re not leaving money on the table by not claiming available credits

Generally you’ll have a filing requirement if your income is above a certain amount or you owe taxes. To lower your tax bill you can claim various tax deductions and credits. But some credits are “refundable” which means you could get that money back as a tax refund if you file an income tax return.

With travel broadening the mind and opening out their sound there are hints that incoming album ‘Skinty Fia’ will look more broadly at a sense of Irishness defined not merely by one location absorbing diasporic experiences in the process.

If that is indeed the case then the Dome is surely the record’s spiritual home. Located above the Boston Arms – one of North London’s most historic Irish pubs – it’s also a stone’s throw away from the still-vital Irish Centre where an emotional Ashling Murphy vigil took place mere days ago.

The band’s first London show since their epic Ally Pally stand a few months ago it’s an intimate – by their blossoming standards – show but one that allows the audience to get a better handle on the more visceral elements of their sound and frontman Grian Chatten’s perpetual search for connection.

Agreeing to play the show as part of BRITs Week presented by Mastercard for War Child – a mouthful but an undeniably wonderful cause – the set is brisk stream-lined and compact. There’s no support act meaning that the audience are treated to some early Pogues cuts – a band who made this part of the world their own a few decade’s earlier – before the glaring belch of feedback ushers the Dublin group onstage.

It's an intense incisive performance from the off with the band pouring full concentration on sound and composure. Grian Chatten says little a figure of studied vehemence; guitars Carlos O’Connell and Conor Curley make the most of the intimate surroundings the violence of their sound far out-stripping the cavernous Ally Pally.

The set draws on debut album ‘Dogrel’ and excellent follow-up ‘A Hero’s Death’; familiar favourites like ‘Cha Cha Cha’ are greeted like old friends by the partisan crowd while title cut ‘A Hero’s Death’ feels bold vibrant. It’s curious to watch the band evolve in real-time the brittleness of those early shows giving way to a more rounded confident use of space; the incisive noise rock elements remain but colour and shade have been added to triumphant impact.

Much of the real excitement however lies in the new material. Incoming album ‘Skinty Fia’ follows a breathless one-two run across an 18 month span yet all the signs are Fontaines D.C. have upped their game once more. New song ‘Roman Holiday’ is given its live debut and it seems to find the Irish group embracing beauty allowing light to permeate their songwriting it only to accentuate the monochrome. A gripping performance it raises hopes yet again for their incoming LP.

A tight neatly defined performance Fontaines D.C. exit stage right after 70 minutes of breathless jet black musicality. Post-punk as a label has always felt restrictive and reductive in places a misnomer – a band truly getting into their creative stride tonight felt like another key moment as Fontaines D.C. leave one era behind and ignite another.

What services will be impacted?

The service interruptions will begin at 10.30pm on Saturday evening when the bank’s 68 ATMs will go offline until 8am on Monday February 7.

Online transactions using HSBC-issued Visa or Mastercard cards will not be processed from 2am on Sunday morning until 8am on Monday.

Service interruptions are also expected to impact point-of-sale transactions using HSBC-issued cards starting from 2am on Sunday morning. While POS transactions will still be possible they will be restricted to a maximum of €350 for Visa debit and credit cards and Mastercard classic cards and €700 for Mastercard premier customer cards.

The upgrade will also temporarily impact internet banking transactions: payments through online banking will not be available between 2am and 2pm on Sunday.

“Since you will not be able to make any ATM transactions during the aforementioned temporary period we recommend that you make withdrawals in line with your needs in the preceding week and also carry out any online purchases beforehand if possible” the bank advised customers in an e-mail.

All services are expected to be back up and running as normal by Monday at 8am. Customers can expect to receive an SMS once the upgrade is complete.

What is the upgrade about?

The scheduled outage is part of HSBC Malta’s overhaul of its card system as the bank seeks to introduce contactless technology to its cards. While recently-issued HSBC Malta cards are equipped with NFC technology that enables contactless payments the system is not yet functional.

Contactless payments will not immediately available following the upgrade though with HSBC saying it expects them to be activated by the end of the month.

Payments of €50 and under will not require a PIN code and users will be required to enter their PIN each time they accumulate a total of €150 in contactless transactions.

Apart from enabling contactless payments the system upgrade will also allow users to change their bank PIN to any four-digit number they choose and unlock their PIN should their card be blocked. Those changes will also be activated by the end of February HSBC told customers.

HSBC is also amending its system for calculating interest on credit card payments. As of Sunday balances that are unpaid after a 56-day grace period will incur interest from the date on which the transaction was booked to customer accounts. Interest will be calculated daily and worked out on the basis of a 360-day year the bank said.",,,

'He can be our future No. 3' - MSK Prasad on Shaik Rasheed

by Vijay Tagore • Last updated on

MSK Prasad says Shaik Rasheed reminds him of Rahul Dravid in technique temperament and solidity. ""He can be our future No. 3 in red ball and white ball cricket"" the former India chief selector says of the Under 19 vice-captain who gave a stellar batting performance in the Under 19 World Cup.

Ask the same to Rasheed and his answer is one of maturity and patience something Dravid was also known for. ""We have just won the Under 19 World Cup and we are over the moon. The victory was a tribute to the bonding among the players and the coaches have ensured we stayed here (in the Caribbean) like a family. My future... I will take it the way it comes. I need to improve my game and I will work on it"" the Andhra boy tells Cricbuzz as he prepares to catch the flight home on Sunday morning.

MSK and Rasheed come from the same town in Andhra Guntur and the former India stumper has had a role in the development of the young batsman when he was the CEO of Andhra Cricket Association. ""He likes to score in front of the wicket and bats late giving himself sufficient time to play the ball. Those are very good qualities. What was most impressive was his temperament. He never looked rattled when India were under pressure"" Prasad says.

Rasheed stood his ground like a hard rock in all three knockout games in the World Cup. He hit a 26 in a low-scoring but high-intensity chase in the quarterfinal against Bangladesh anchored the innings with a well-paced 94 in the semifinal against Australia and then set the match up with a tenacious 50 in the final against England all three scores coming after early loss of wickets.

But Rasheed wonders how he managed to play those games in the first place. ""I never thought I had another chance in the tournament"" he says reminiscing the time when the Indian camp was hit by Covid-19 with half a dozen players including himself were forced into isolation.

""I had given up hope of playing any more part in the tournament. Regular testing and 15-day quarantine and I thought the tournament has ended for me"" he recalls. ""At that stage the support staff has backed us well kept us motivating. We were in isolation and they would do regular video-calling and try to explain us to treat this as a brief injury pause and not as a Covid disruption. Coaches and VVS Laxman Sir would be on the call and they would tell me there is lot more to play in the tournament - quarterfinals semifinals final and all those games. They tried to instil a positive mind-set.""

Asked to explain those innings in the knockouts Rasheed says it came naturally to him. ""Initially there was pressure but I tried to play my natural game. I am confident of my game and I played that way. Although there was not much practice before the knockouts (because of the Covid-induced isolation) we were confident. I had scored an unbeaten 72 in a practice game against Australia and that gave me a lot of confidence.""

Since the four-wicket win in the final in Antigua Rasheed has been bombarded with calls and messages. ""We have had a party. We celebrated the win stayed together. The bonding is very good. And yes I have not had time to answer all my calls and messages. I would respond to all soon"" he says.

Many of his teammates have registered for the IPL auction but he would not be one to go under the hammer as he has not played a List A or a first class game a necessity to be eligible to feature in the IPL. Rasheed is not disappointed nevertheless. ""Not exactly"" he says. ""I will get my opportunities. If I have not played this year it does not mean it is the end of the world. I will qualify eventually.""

Indian diplomat hosts the team

Dr KJ Srinivasa High Commissioner of India to Antigua and Barbuda based in Guyana hosted a reception for the team after the final on Saturday (February 5) night. The event was attended by the legends of West Indies cricket like Sir Richie Richardson and Sir Curtly Ambrose. Also present were Cricket West Indies (CWI) president Ricky Skerritt and other diplomats of the region and ministers of the local government. Apart from the full U 19 team and its selectors Ranadeb Bose and Prathik Patel VVS Laxman Hrishikesh Kanitkar Sairaj Bahutule attended the reception.

""This event brought together people to congratulate the achievements of our young team and the team was inspired by the presence and interaction with legends. This young brigade has really performed very well being unbeaten in the tournament. Their positive approach mature thinking coming back from adversity where nearly half the team was down with Covid shows that the future of Indian cricket is in great hands"" the diplomat told this website.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3NucC1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1wdWxscy1vdXQtb2YtcmFjZS0xMzEzMDMwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC9zbnAtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VyLWdyYWVtZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHVsbHMtb3V0LW9mLXJhY2UtMTMxMzAzMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Swinney set to become next SNP leader and Scottish first minister as rival quits race,"John Swinney appears set to become Scotland's next first minister after Graeme McCormick pulled out of the race to become SNP leader.

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L3NucC1hY3RpdmlzdC1ncmFlbWUtbWNjb3JtaWNrLWpvaG4tc3dpbm5leS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNvbnRlc3TSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9zbnAtYWN0aXZpc3QtZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1qb2huLXN3aW5uZXktbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jb250ZXN0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNP activist aims to challenge John Swinney for party leadership,"John Swinney could face a leadership contest before he becomes Scottish National party leader after an activist said he expected to win enough nominations to stand.

“So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS [Swinney] has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea?”

McCormick some of whose allies want the Scottish government to mount a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

So Graeme McCormick has succeeded in getting the nominations he needed. Disappointed that JS has already had a dig at him before nominations even close for daring to challenge him. He is to give ordinary members the chance to question the new leader. New idea? — Iain.lawson27 (@ILawson27) May 5 2024

Nominations to succeed Humza Yousaf as SNP leader close at noon on Monday. If another candidate crosses the nominations threshold and forces a contest Yousaf is expected to remain in post and as Scotland’s first minister until a winner is declared.

McCormick was very confident he would gather the signatures before the deadline after canvassing for support at an independence rally in Glasgow organised by All Under One Banner the Sunday Herald newspaper reported.

Swinney who has been expecting to be confirmed as the new SNP leader on Monday afternoon and be voted in as first minister this week warned on Sunday that a contest would delay his efforts to rebuild the party and put its deep divisions on public display.

“I think it would be better if we just got on with things that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength” he told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we’ve just had a rough couple of years.

“[The] SNP has not looked cohesive; the SNP has not looked together. The central point of my message is we’ve got to get ourselves together.”

An unopposed coronation would not be the SNP’s first: Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in November 2014 without a contest.

Swinney’s call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLWZhY2VzLWZyZW5jaC1mcnktc2hvcnRhZ2VzLWluLW1hbGF5c2lhLWluZG9uZXNpYS1hbmQtdGFpd2FuLTIwMjItMtIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWNkb25hbGRzLWZhY2VzLWZyZW5jaC1mcnktc2hvcnRhZ2VzLWluLW1hbGF5c2lhLWluZG9uZXNpYS1hbmQtdGFpd2FuLTIwMjItMj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's faces french fry shortages in Malaysia Indonesia and Taiwan,"Irene Jiang / Business Insider

McDonald's locations in Indonesia Malaysia and Taiwan are all facing potato shortages.

Japan started rationing McDonald's french fries in December.

McDonald's says the supply chain and flooding in Canada are to blame.

McDonald's French fries are a fast food staple and they're becoming harder to get in some countries.

Indonesia Malaysia and Taiwan all joined Japan in grappling with potato supply issues constraining french fry availability. On January 31 McDonald's Indonesia tweeted that ""Due to the limited availability of French Fries at this time"" large french fries would be unavailable beginning February 2. McDonald's Malaysia posted a similar announcement to Instagram calling it a ""large sacri-fries.""

A post shared by McDonald’s (@mcdonaldsmalaysia)

McDonald's Taiwan had a slightly different potato problem running out of hash browns in early January though french fry sales were ""normal.""

These announcements all came after McDonald's Japan made international headlines in December for suspending the sales of medium and large fries at all locations to ration the remaining supply. By the end of December three US 747s were delivering loads of potatoes to Japan to alleviate the shortage and normal sales resumed.

Issues around potato supply for the fast-food giant all come back to supply chain issues. ""Import delays have occurred due to flood damage and the impact of the Corona disaster on the global distribution network"" McDonald's Japan said in a statement.

A spokesperson for McDonald's Indonesia also attributed the temporary shortage to ""delivery constraints of potato supplies related to the COVID-19 pandemic"" in quotes to local outlet Detik. He also mentioned that McDonald's has a massive supply chain serving 39000 restaurants around the world that it can leverage to fix the problem.

Asian McDonald's restaurants largely rely on North American potato imports for french fries. Many come through the Vancouver port which faced its ""worst weather storm of the century"" according to Canadian officials. Landslides and flooding from the storm shut down highways railways and the Vancouver Port a major point of trade through North America. In December ships were stuck waiting in long lines to dock made worse by striking workers.

McDonald's did not respond to Insider's request for further comment.

What gives?

McDonald's (MCD -0.38%) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ 1.57%) are interesting to compare because they both operate on a franchise business model and both are quick-service restaurants. Since the pandemic's onset they have taken different paths with Domino's thriving right from the get-go while McDonald's initially suffered and is thriving since the economy's reopening gained momentum.

Overall they have benefited from a newly rising consumer trend of ordering food for delivery. Domino's has always offered that feature while McDonald's has capitalized on the rise of food-delivery aggregators to develop that part of its business. Recent trends aside McDonald's has long outperformed Domino's in one crucial metric. Yet interestingly the market has preferred Domino's stock over McDonald's by a wide margin. Let's find out why that's the case.

McDonald's has a much greater operating profit margin

Over the past decade McDonald's has soundly outperformed Domino's Pizza on operating profit margin -- and that disparity is widening. In fact most recently McDonald's boasted an operating profit margin of 42.5% contrasted with 18.3% for Domino's (see chart below). Considering that both restaurant businesses operate on a similar franchise business model why might this be?

Undoubtedly one reason for the disparity could be efficiencies in scale. Over the latest 12 months revenue totaled $22.9 billion for McDonald's but just $4.4 billion for Domino's. A greater revenue base can increase profit margins if a company is able to keep costs relatively fixed while revenue expands. And as a matter of fact McDonald's has done an excellent job of raising operating profit margins. From 2012 to 2021 its operating margin increased from 30.3% to 42.5%. In that period revenue decreased by a compound annual rate of 1.5%.

By comparison over the same time frame Domino's has increased revenue at a compound annual rate of 10.1% while its operating margin grew from 15.7% to 17.6%. Judging by these two metrics a difference of priority emerges. McDonald's prioritizes operating profit margin expansion while Domino's emphasizes revenue growth.

Which one is better?

To answer this question let's look at what the market thinks. Over the past decade McDonald's stock is up a respectable 161%. Considering the dramatic outperformance in margins McDonald's stock outperformed Domino's in the previous decade right? Wrong. Domino's stock in that same time is up a whopping 1300%.

To understand this vast gap let's look to operating profit again but this time in sum totals not margins. Operating profit at McDonald's grew from $8.4 billion in 2012 to $9.9 billion in 2021 an increase of 17.8%. In its most recent decade Domino's grew operating profit from $259 million to $726 million an increase of 180%.

Overall yes McDonald's is crushing Domino's concerning operating profit margin but Domino's is growing overall profits more rapidly. The market prefers to take the latter over the former.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2Zvcm1lci1tY2RvbmFsZHMtY2VvLWluZmxhdGlvbi11cy1yZXN0YXVyYW500gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former McDonald's CEO: Inflation is driving every US restaurant 'absolutely crazy',"McDonald’s is one of the companies feeling the heat of inflation forcing the franchise to raise their prices.

Former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi argued that inflation is driving every restaurant in the United States ""absolutely crazy"" and that the price of products has gone up ""substantially.""

""Portion sizes are shrinking. Prices are going up. It's just insane what's happening in the restaurant industry"" Rensi told ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast"" Friday.

INFLATION HITS MCDONALD'S ON FOOD COSTS LABOR

""It's also true of every other small business"" Rensi said. ""They're all suffering terribly from this federal inflation.""



McDonald’s says inflationary pressures will stick around in 2022 after profits and sales fell short of estimates.



In the U.S. the Golden Arches burger chain reported that same-store sales – or restaurants open at least a year – rose 7.5% from October to December [2021]. For the full year same-store sales notched 13.8% which marked ""the highest U.S. annual comparable sales ever reported"" McDonald's announced in its earnings release back in January.

""90 percent of the businesses are owned by franchisees. They're very close to their customers…they understand what their local costs are"" Rensi noted.



""McDonald's has recommended…somewhere around 6 6.5 percent increase next year. The reality of it is every franchisee gets to decide their own prices based on community needs.""

The former McDonald’s CEO continued to say that another major issue besides inflation is the trucker’s shortage which is deeply impacting the restaurant industry.

That’s what life was like until the 1970s when the US Army’s regulations forced one McDonald’s franchisee to get creative.

The concept of the drive-through has existed since the 1930s when Kirby’s Pig Stand in Dallas Texas opened a drive-in restaurant to replace carhops. Smaller restaurants across the country adopted the idea of the “drive-through” as the years went on but the majority of larger chains still preferred dine-in and takeout methods.

In 1973 David Rich opened a McDonald’s restaurant in Sierra Vista Arizona just two miles from Fort Huachuca. While the military base’s population was eager to frequent the establishment they were unable to do so as Army regulations at the time prohibited soldiers from entering businesses or being in public while wearing fatigues.

Noticing the regulations were hurting his business Rich got creative.

On January 24 1975 he unveiled his drive-through. He’d extended one of the restaurant’s walls and added a window which was manned by an employee tasked with taking orders from cars that pulled up alongside the building. Now soldiers and Army officials could grab a burger and fries without having to leave the confines of their vehicles.

The drive-through’s first customers? Fort Huachuca’s base commander and his daughter.

While Rich’s McDonald’s location housed the company’s first drive-through window he wasn’t the first franchisee to propose the idea. In 1974 the owner of a McDonald’s restaurant in Oklahoma City Oklahoma got approval to design and construct a window with character statues. It didn’t open until April 1975 a few months after Rich’s.

By the end of the 1970s over half of McDonald’s restaurants had drive-through windows.

In 1999 the restaurant in Sierra Vista was demolished and replaced with a new one. Pieces of the original structure were auctioned off and Rich’s original drive-through partition is currently on display at the Ethel H. Berger Center.

The unremarkable exterior belies the personality of the company's founder and chief executive inside.

Manny Villafana is a legend in Minnesota medical technology and beyond — but not someone who rests on past successes. At age 81 he is on his eighth startup with Plymouth-based Medical 21 which he founded in 2016.

From his desk surrounded by a museum-like collection of old pacemakers Villafana explains his vision through parables. Only they aren't parables but true stories from his past that showcase his entrepreneurial zeal.

For half a century he has launched expanded and sold medical startups that have helped define shape and amplify Minnesota's medical technology industry.

His legacy is anchored by two companies he started in the 1970s: Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. (CPI) and St. Jude Medical Inc. Abbott Laboratories bought St. Jude for $25 billion in 2017.

""He really is one of those early serial entrepreneurs that has really shaped the ecosystem for medical technology"" said Scott Ward chief executive of New Brighton-based Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and a Medtronic veteran.

With the next medical frontier always beckoning Villafana just won't quit.

""When golf is as exciting as what I'm doing maybe I'll play golf"" said Villafana.

Every weekday morning he wakes up 5 o'clock goes to the gym eats breakfast and is at his desk by 9 a.m.

Medical 21's concept is to develop an artificial artery that can be used in cardiac bypass surgery replacing the need to harvest blood vessels from elsewhere in the body — such as the legs arms and chest. For decades dozens of companies have tried to do the same thing with no success. Villafana calls the quest ""the holy grail of cardiac surgery.""

With an entrepreneur's optimism and ambition he is undeterred.

While working at Medtronic early in his career Villafana suggested that it start making pacemakers with lithium batteries. Medtronic wasn't interested. At the time several companies were making pacemakers that lasted only 18 to 24 months. Villafana saw an opportunity and left his job to found his first startup Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. in 1972.

From a telephone booth in the downtown Minneapolis skyway he raised $50000 to start CPI.

""I didn't have an office"" Villafana said. ""I used to plug in the 25 cents or nickel or whatever it was and that's how I raised money.""

The company's first pacemakers used lithium batteries and came with an initial guarantee that the device would last three years. Lithium batteries have long since become the standard for all pacemakers.

CPI was sold in 1978 to Eli Lilly and Co. for $127 million which was later spun off with the medical device unit and eventually acquired by Boston Scientific Corp.

Villafana founded St. Jude Medical in 1976; the company introduced the first bileaflet all-carbon heart valves that soon became the industry standard. Before St. Jude heart valves were ball valves; the bileaflet version had two flaps that pivot for better blood flow.

In 1987 Villafana founded Helix BioCore Inc. which later changed its name to ATS Medical Inc. and was acquired by Medtronic in 2010 for $370 million.

Villafana's influence and impact locally is still felt today. Boston Scientific has more than 10000 employees and Abbott has about 5000 employees in the state. Manny's Steakhouse a downtown Minneapolis dining institution is named after Villafana who seeded the restaurant owner's startup costs.

The Manny approach

Perhaps as important as the technological advances made by his companies was Villafana's pioneering approach to relationships.

""He began that process of closely interacting with cardiac surgeons interventional cardiologists and really understanding their needs for the product and for education"" Ward said.

In the 1970s it was rare for medical device companies to train surgeons and medical fellows on their product. But that's exactly what Villafana did.

""The reason that [St. Jude Medical] retained their market share for so many years is because they trained and educated all the fellows all the cardiac surgery fellows on how to do heart valve implants and what they were trained on was the St. Jude product"" said Ward. ""That was all Manny. Manny is all about those close customer relationships.""

Today that's common practice in the business.

Villafana grew up in the South Bronx the son of Puerto Ricans who had — as he put it — ""nada nothing."" His mother father and his three brothers all died of heart attacks so it's no coincidence his career has focused on cardiac health.

""My entire family died of cardiac disease"" Villafana said. ""They all died too young.""

Cardiac bypass procedures are a very common surgery. The market is estimated at $8 billion Villafana said ""much bigger than anything I've worked with before.""

Villafana never went to college and holds an honorary doctor of science degree from the University of Iowa. Yet when talking about the human heart and the device his company is developing Villafana could pass as a doctor to a layman's ears.

Successes and failures

The key to creating an artificial artery is ensuring that the body will accept the material and won't itself lead to other complications. Medical 21 has licensed its technology from the University of Iowa but is making updates. The artificial artery itself looks like a very soft pipe cleaner made with a synthetic material and a nickel-titanium alloy wire.

Medical 21 wrapped a financing round in December; the company has raised $11 million since its inception. Villafana has taken seven companies public and expects Medical 21 to be his next. The company is looking to raise an additional $30 million to $40 million through a regulation A+ offering sometimes called a ""mini-IPO.""

In 2017 Medical 21 began testing the product on animals first in pigs and then in sheep.

Lyle Joyce a professor of surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin is on Medical 21's medical advisory board. His son David Joyce also a cardiac surgeon is also on the board.

Villafana ""is working in an area where there is a tremendous need"" Lyle Joyce said.

The father and son duo have implanted grafts in some animals. ""It went very well"" said Lyle Joyce. ""The present design is beautiful.""

Medical 21 hopes to start clinical trials of the artificial artery in the second half of the year in the United States and Europe. Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals are still several years away.

The company is collaborating with Mayo Clinic which owns an equity stake in the company. Juan Crestanello a cardiovascular surgeon at Mayo said he and his colleagues have seen some of Medical 21's work.

""The results so far have been very encouraging"" Crestanello said. If clinical trials proceed Mayo would be interested in being a trial site.

And while Villafana has found great success he's also failed like many serial entrepreneurs do. Medical 21 is his third consecutive company aimed at improving bypass surgery. CABG Medical Inc. developed an artificial graft but shut down in 2006 after unsuccessful clinical trials. And Kips Bay Medical created a mesh designed to support natural vein grafts. That company shut down in 2015.

Ward of Cardiovascular Systems believes Medical 21 may ultimately succeed where others have failed because of its persistent leader.

""Manny never moved on"" Ward said. ""He just keeps at it. He's going to keep working on it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoYXJld2lzZS5jb20vdXMvbmV3c19hcnRpY2xlcy9EaXZpZGVuZF9BcmlzdG9jcmF0c19Jbl9Gb2N1c19NZWR0cm9uaWNfU3VyZURpdmlkZW5kXzIwMjIwMjA2XzIzMzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dividend Aristocrats In Focus: Medtronic,"Updated on February 6th 2022 by Prakash Kolli



Investors looking for high-quality dividend growth stocks should focus in part on companies that maintain long histories of dividend increases. Steady dividend raises from year to year regardless of the economic climate is a sign of a company with durable competitive advantages and long-term growth potential.

With that in mind every year we review each of the Dividend Aristocrats a group of 66 companies in the S&P 500 Index with 25+ consecutive years of dividend increases. You can download your copy of the Dividend Aristocrats list including important metrics like dividend yields and price-to-earnings ratios by clicking on the link below:

The next Dividend Aristocrat in the series is healthcare giant Medtronic (MDT).

Medtronic has an impressive history of dividend growth. The company has increased its dividend for 44 years in a row. With an approximately 2.5% yield Medtronic is not exactly a high-yield stock. However the stock’s yield is still higher than the average yield of the S&P 500.

But Medtronic typically raises its dividend at a high rate each year thanks to its strong earnings and leadership position within the medical devices industry. According to the company Medtronic has increased its dividend by 16% compounded annually over its 44 years of annual increases. These qualities make Medtronic an attractive dividend growth stock for long-term investors.

Business Overview

Medtronic was founded in 1949 as a medical equipment repair shop by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law Palmer Hermundslie. Today Medtronic is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. Medtronic is a large-cap stock with a market capitalization of ~$138 billion.

Medtronic PLC is the largest manufacturer of biomedical devices and implantable technologies in the world. Medtronic currently has four operating segments: Cardiovascular Neuroscience medical Surgical and Diabetes.

Source: Investor Presentation

On November 23rd 2021 Medtronic reported Q2 fiscal year 2022 results for the period ending October 29th 2021 (Medtronic’s fiscal year ends the Friday closest to April 30th). For the quarter Medtronic reported sales of $7.847 billion a 2.6% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Sales in the Cardiovascular Neuroscience Medical Surgical and Diabetes segments were up 3.7% up 3.5% up 0.6% and up 1.9% respectively.

Adjusted net income equaled $1.792 billion or $1.32 per share a 29.9% year-over-year increase. Medtronic guided for 7% – 8% revenue growth and earnings per share of $5.65 to $5.75.

The coronavirus pandemic has had a negative impact on the company’s results and the recent Omicron surge has had a negative effect. However we view headwinds as temporary and the company is still guiding for growth. Due to a variety of factors including the favorable economics of the U.S. healthcare industry Medtronic should enjoy many years of growth up ahead.

Growth Prospects

Medtronic is investing in growth both organically via R&D and through acquisitions. The first catalyst for Medtronic is the aging population. There are ~70 million Baby Boomers in the U.S. those aged 51-69 years. Thousands of people are entering retirement every day. Combined with longer life expectancy and rising healthcare spending the operating environment is very attractive for Medtronic.

The company has had many regulatory product approvals since 2019. The new products should drive growth allowing the company too maintain or even gain market share.

Source: Investor Presentation

Medtronic also has a major growth opportunity in new geographic markets. Specifically Medtronic has a presence in several emerging markets such as China India Africa and more. These countries have large populations and high economic growth rates. Medtronic operate globally in more than 140 countries.

Medtronic’s emerging market revenue has consistently grown at a double-digit rate for many years. In the most recent quarters emerging market constant-currency revenue increased 16% while the non-U.S. developed markets rose 2% and the U.S. declined -1%. While the U.S. currently accounts for approximately half of Medtronic’s revenue emerging markets are growing faster.

Another growth catalyst for Medtronic is acquisitions. The largest single acquisition for Medtronic was its $50 billion acquisition of Covidien in 2015. The acquisition presented significant growth potential for Medtronic.

Today Medtronic is acquiring tuck-in acquisitions and has spent more than $2.3 billion on over seven acquisitions in 2021. These companies include Medicrea RIST Avenu Medical Companion Medical Sonarmed intersect ENT and AI Biomed. In addition Medtronic has made 40+ minority investments for a total of $500 million. These investments will facilitate future tuck-in acquisitions.

Competitive Advantages & Recession Performance

The main competitive advantage for Medtronic is its research and development capabilities. The company spends heavily on R&D each year which provides it with product innovation. Medtronic’s R&D investments over the past few years are as follows:

FY 2016 R&D expense of $2.2 billion

FY 2017 R&D expense of $2.2 billion

FY 2018 R&D expense of $2.3 billion

FY 2019 R&D expense of $2.3 billion

FY 2020 R&D expense of $2.3 billion

FY 2021 R&D expense of $2.5 billion

The result of all this spending is that the company has a huge intellectual property portfolio with over 45000 awarded patents. This fact has allowed Medtronic to build a strong product pipeline across each of its business segments.

In addition Medtronic benefits tremendously from global scale. The company operates in over 140 countries around the world. It has the operational flexibility to generate industry-leading profit margins which helps fuel its growth.

Another competitive advantage for Medtronic is that it operates in a defensive industry. Consumers often cannot choose to forego medical treatments even when the economy goes into recession.

Medtronic’s earnings-per-share during the Great Recession are as follows:

2007 earnings-per-share of $2.61

2008 earnings-per-share of $2.92 (12% increase)

2009 earnings-per-share of $3.22 (10% increase)

2010 earnings-per-share of $3.37 (5% increase)

Medtronic had the rare achievement of earnings growth each year during the recession. This demonstrates its recession-resistant business model. Medtronic should be able to continue growing its dividend each year in both economic recessions and expansions.

Valuation & Expected Returns

Based on the recent share price of $103 and expected earnings-per-share of $5.70 in fiscal 2022 Medtronic stock trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.1. The current valuation of the stock is below that of the broader S&P 500 Index and Medtronic’s valuation is slightly above its long-term average.

From 2013 through 2020 it had been typical to see Medtronic stock trade hands in the 15 to 19 times earnings range even bumping up to 20+ times earnings a couple of times; this despite the idea that the firm has been exceptionally consistent through that entire period. Our expectation assumes a fair multiple of 17 times earnings.

As a result Medtronic shares appear to be slightly overvalued today. If the stock valuation retraces to our fair value estimate by 2027 the corresponding multiple contraction would reduce annual shareholder returns by approximately 1.2% per year over this period.

We expect 6% annual earnings growth for Medtronic through 2026 and the stock has a 2.5% dividend yield. There is plenty of room for continued dividend increases each year. With a dividend payout ratio below 50% and a positive earnings growth outlook Medtronic should continue its streak of annual dividend increases.

Total returns would consist of the following:

6.0% earnings growth rate

-1.2% multiple reversion

2.5% dividend yield

Medtronic is expected to return just 7.3% annually over the next five years. Medtronic’s decline in stock price since September 2021 has improved the potential annualized returns.

Final Thoughts

Medtronic has virtually all of the qualities dividend growth investors should look for. It possesses a highly profitable business a leadership position in its core markets and long-term growth potential. It also has multiple catalysts for future growth and the ability to keep growing its dividend even during recessions.

Medtronic has increased its dividend for more than four decades including a strong 8.6% increase in 2021 which is highly impressive given the continued headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The only negative aspect of investing in Medtronic stock today is the valuation. However Medtronic’s stock price is near its 52-week low. Medtronic remains a high-quality holding for long-term dividend growth investors.",,,,,,,,,

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

Has the tech giant begun to crumble?,"Facebook was much in the news last week although you may not realise that because it has been renamed Meta in the hope the bad vibes associated with its maiden name would gradually fade from public memory. (Google tried the same stunt with Alphabet and that hasn’t worked either.)

For a change though Facebook’s latest moment at the top of the news agenda had nothing to do with scandals and everything to do with its financial results which were so unexpectedly bad that the shares dropped 25% at one point taking $240bn (£177bn) off its market value which in turn led to a 2% drop in the Nasdaq index.

Given that Facebook has hitherto been a licence to print money so much so that at one stage (in 2019) when it was fined $5bn by the Federal Trade Commission its shares actually went up as Wall Street registered that the ostensibly massive fine was actually the equivalent of a fleabite on an elephant.

But this time was different. Why? Three factors stood out from reports of Mark Zuckerberg’s conference call with stock market analysts: the impact of TikTok; Apple’s move to require iPhone users to consent to being tracked by advertisers; and the revelation that the hitherto unstoppable growth in the number of Facebook users has stalled.

As a form of Chinese cultural imperialism TikTok makes Xi Jinping’s 'belt and road' initiative look amateurish

Zuckerberg’s newfound obsession with TikTok must have puzzled many observers. After all TikTok is not a social network. It’s a service that hosts short-form user videos from genres such as pranks stunts tricks jokes dance and entertainment. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance is understood by nobody over the age of 40 and has taken the world by storm. As a form of Chinese cultural imperialism it makes Xi Jinping’s belt-and-road initiative look amateurish.

So why is it keeping Zuckerberg awake at night? The answer is that TikTok caters brilliantly to a demographic group – so-called young adults – that Facebook with its ageing demographics (parents and grandparents) doesn’t seem to serve well any more. This explains its zeal to re-energise Reels (its ludicrous attempt to mimic the short-video genre) and to reprioritise young adults in its other offerings. But the real problem for Facebook is that TikTok is monopolising its users’ attention which is where the money for surveillance capitalism comes from.

As Ben Thompson the veteran tech analyst puts it: “The problem for Meta is that its business isn’t based on surfacing content from your friends; it’s based on engagement and serving ads which means any service that occupies your time and attention – and TikTok occupies a lot of it – is a fundamental threat.”

The second source of woe for Facebook is the impact of Apple’s “app-tracking transparency” (ATT) feature introduced last year with version 14.5 of its iOS mobile operating system. This required iPhone users to give explicit consent for user-level and device ID-based monitoring by apps. Not surprisingly users declined in droves. And the impact for Facebook has now become clear – in the form of $10bn in lost advertising revenue. That’s 8.5% of the company’s 2021 revenues but more significantly a quarter of its overall profit for the year.

It’s easy to see why results like these might lead investors to reconsider their stock portfolios. But Facebook has had wobbles before and recovered. As a company it has vast resources of cash and talent. Given time it might be able to find a way of luring young adults away from TikTok and of navigating round Apple’s ATT. But for anyone who takes a longer-term view of these difficulties the big story is that the company’s user base may have stopped growing. The figures revealed last week show that the number of daily active users fell by 500000 and that the numbers of monthly active users seems to have levelled off at 2.91 billion. If this is the beginning of a trend it’s really significant.

Why? Basically it’s all about network effects. Way back in 1990 Bob Metcalfe the co-inventor of Ethernet formulated a “law” that says the value of a communications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. This law has driven every networking system on the planet and harnessing it has always been the goal of company founders.

From the beginning driving growth in the number of users has been Zuckerberg’s overriding obsession

The trick was to attract users quickly (by not charging for services) and to get to the point where user numbers are big enough to make it very difficult to break into the market. Facebook reached that point long ago and if you want a measure of its power at the moment try working out what the square of 2.91bn is.

The reason the network effect is so powerful is that as long as the number of users is increasing the company is riding a virtuous circle. The more users it has the greater the incentive for new users to sign up. From the beginning driving growth in the number of users has been Zuckerberg’s overriding obsession. It’s why he has always turned a tin ear to the voices of caution when the company ran into scandals and charges of causing societal damage.

But network effects work both ways. If user numbers start to decline then the virtuous circle suddenly turns vicious leading to a downward spiral. Maybe this is what TikTok is already doing to Facebook’s Instagram for example. Zuckerberg is smart enough to know his position as master of the current universe may be transitory. Sic transit gloria and all that. Which may explain why he plans to be master of the coming metaverse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyMi8wMi8wNi93aGF0LWlzLXRoZS1uZWFyZXN0LXRlY2huaWNhbC1zdXBwb3J0LWZvci1tZXRhLW5hc2RhcS1mYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is The Nearest Technical Support For Meta (NASDAQ: FB),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2022/02/06/what-is-the-nearest-technical-support-for-meta-nasdaq-fb/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyMi8wMi8wNi93aGF0LWlzLXRoZS1uZWFyZXN0LXRlY2huaWNhbC1zdXBwb3J0LWZvci1tZXRhLW5hc2RhcS1mYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L21ldGFfZ3JvcGVfZ2FwL9IBOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS9BTVAvMjAyMi8wMi8wNS9tZXRhX2dyb3BlX2dhcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is going well: Meta adds anti-grope buffer zone around metaverse VR avatars,"Meta Platforms Inc better known for its controversial turn as Facebook says its mission is to ""Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together."" But not too close it seems.

The mega-corp wants to keep people apart in its metaverse. The ad biz besotted with virtual reality now that it can no longer move fast and break things with impunity in the real world has committed to cartoon social distancing.

Henceforth avatars in its Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues will be able to approach no closer than four feet – that distance would be rendered to whatever scale fits the viewer's display screen – to prevent virtual molestation.

Vivek Sharma VP of Meta's Horizon group refers to the company's grope gap as a ""Personal Boundary.""

""Personal Boundary prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other creating more personal space for people and making it easier to avoid unwanted interactions"" he explained in a blog post on Friday.

These Personal Boundaries he says will prevent other avatars from invading your avatar's personal space without any haptic feedback to simulate a collision.

""This builds upon our existing hand harassment measures that were already in place where an avatar’s hands would disappear if they encroached upon someone’s personal space"" Sharma explained.

Online harassment trolling and toxic behavior has been a problem on the internet since modems and bulletin boards. Those who have followed the tech industry for a while may recall a 1993 Village Voice article by author Julian Dibbell titled ""A Rape in Cyberspace"" about text-based torment.

Well that sort of behavior something every mass market multiplayer game has had to confront found its way into graphic environments where it has proven to be no more welcome and no easier to get rid of. It was a problem more than a decade ago in the precursor to the modern headset-based metaverse Second Life where virtual rape was sold for Linden dollars and sexual assaults on avatars are said to have accounted for about 20 per cent of reported infractions.

And it's a problem today. As the MIT Technology Review put it two months ago ""The metaverse has a groping problem already."" The word ""already"" here might be better interpreted to mean ""since forever.""

A Pew Research study last year found 41 per cent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment a rate comparable to 2017. But certain forms of harassment show signs of rising: 11 per cent reported online sexual harassment up from 5 per cent in 2014.

About 79 per cent of Pew Research respondents said social media companies are doing ""an only fair or poor job at addressing online harassment or bullying on their platforms.""

In a move underscoring the risk that unchecked cartoon abuse poses to Meta's multibillion dollar metaverse pivot ad biz is activating Personal Boundary by default. ""[W]e think this will help to set behavioral norms – and that’s important for a relatively new medium like VR"" explained Sharma allowing that such safety measures may get more customizable over time.

When Facebook grudgingly rolled out privacy controls for its social ad platform they generally were not on by default.

So strap on your VR headset and enjoy a romp in a pixelated world secure in the knowledge that between the hand-hiding and invisible barriers no one will ""reach out and touch someone"" as AT&T used to suggest. Just be careful not to injure yourself which happens occasionally and if you experience nausea eye strain or loss of balance discontinue use immediately. The Health and Safety warning documents for Meta Quest (Oculus) headsets are extensive [PDF].

If you lose your lunch cavorting at a safe distance from VR trolls know that Meta is losing its cash to bring this not-so-safe experience to you. At the company's recent earnings fiasco Meta for the first time broke out revenue for Reality Labs its metaverse division. In 2021 Reality Labs recorded a $10.2bn loss having spent $12.5bn to earn $2.3bn in revenue.

That's more than twice the $1.1bn in revenue Reality Labs saw in 2020 but it's not yet close to being a healthy business. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbWl4ZWQtbmV3cy5jb20vZW4vc3RlYW12ci1pbi1qYW51YXJ5LTIwMjItbWV0YS1kb21pbmF0ZXMtcGMtdnIv0gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9taXhlZC1uZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9zdGVhbXZyLWluLWphbnVhcnktMjAyMi1tZXRhLWRvbWluYXRlcy1wYy12ci8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SteamVR in January 2022: Meta dominates PC VR,"SteamVR in January 2022: Meta dominates PC VR

Meta Quest 2 makes the second biggest jump in its SteamVR history. Meta now owns two-thirds of the SteamVR market.

Valve's monthly hardware and software survey captures all VR goggles that were connected to PCs with Steam installed at least once in the month in question and whose users participate in the survey. Among other things the statistics show the percentage of SteamVR users in the total Steam user base.

The previous record value is 2.31 percent (May 2021). During the summer the percentage dropped to 1.74 percent (August 2021) closing the year at 1.93 percent. In January 2022 the value increased to 2.14 percent. The reason for the increase is a flood of new Quest users who connected their VR glasses to a PC after Christmas.

Since Steam had an average of 120 million monthly active users in 2020 the 1.93 percent SteamVR user base is roughly equivalent to 2.5 million PC VR users.

Quest 2: Big jump after second Christmas sales

The following statistics show the market shares of VR glasses covered by Steam in December 2021 and January 2022. Devices that have less than one percent market share are not listed.

VR users who only use Meta platforms and Viveport and do not have Steam installed or do not participate in Steam data collection are not included in the statistics nor are PSVR players and Meta Quest 1 and 2 users who only use their VR glasses as a standalone device. Accordingly the SteamVR statistics reflect only a relatively small portion of the overall VR market.

December 2021 January 2022 Difference Meta Quest 2 3962 % 4602 % + 639 % Valve Index 1579 % 1436 % - 143 % Oculus Rift S 1477 % 1310 % - 167 % HTC Vive 826 % 731 % - 095 % Windows Mixed Reality 569 % 499 % - 070 % Oculus Rift 484 % 418 % - 066 % Meta Quest 435 % 395 % - 040 % HTC Vive Pro 194 % 172 % - 022 % HTC Vive Cosmos 182 % 160 % - 022 % SteamVR user base 193 % 214 % + 021 %

Meta Quest 2 made the second-biggest jump in its SteamVR history last month growing by more than six percent. Only January 2021 saw an even higher figure with a 15 percent increase. All other VR devices suffered losses with PC-exclusive VR goggles Oculus Rift S and Valve Index dropping the most.

With the new Quest 2 peak Meta has a SteamVR market share of 67.25 percent. This value includes all other SteamVR-enabled devices from the manufacturer i.e. Oculus Rift Oculus Rift S and Meta Quest 1 which means that more than two-thirds of all VR goggles used with SteamVR come from Meta.

Nothing new with PC VR

How often and intensively the SteamVR glasses are actually used is not evident from the data above. However the monthly average of maximum concurrent SteamVR users gives an idea.

This number climbed to 18400 in December 2021 and should reach a new high in January 2022. This would be in line with the trend of the last few years which shows a linear growth with occasional spikes up and down reaching a slightly higher standard level after each Christmas.

The statistics show how tiny the PC VR market still is after almost six years which is why most developers have now turned to the Quest ecosystem.

For more than 30 years the fiery water show has entranced the masses along the Strip free to anyone who might be passing by.

But the days of The Mirage’s volcano are numbered as the transformative resort undergoes its own transformation as part of Hard Rock international’s $1.075 billion acquisition of the property.

Hard Rock International Chairman Jim Allen told Bloomberg in December that it would be torn down as part of the planned remodel. The company plans to completely rebrand the property as Hard Rock Las Vegas and create a “brand-new resort” that will include the brand’s signature guitar-shaped hotel. A rendering of what the revamped property would look like shows the new guitar hotel sitting in roughly the same location now occupied by the volcano.

The volcano is on its way to becoming the latest in a long line of Las Vegas relics that were once considered iconic only to be reduced to the archives like the original marquees of The Sands the sultan at The Dunes or the Crystal Room at the Desert Inn just to name a few.

“The volcano is incredibly iconic for its generation” said Alan Feldman a distinguished fellow at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute and former longtime gaming company executive. “I think it’s very important to remember that Las Vegas is a city that is built on change. And it has built its success on change and on reinventing itself.”

Just how much time the volcano has left isn’t clear yet.

MGM Resorts will retain The Mirage name and brand and will license it to Hard Rock for up to three years while it finalizes its plans to rebrand the property.

Following the announcement of the sale in December Allen said the company had no comment on the time frame for the resorts rebranding renovations or the construction of the new hotel tower. The company said late last month that it had no new details to share.

The history

The Mirage ushered in the new era of enormous integrated resorts when Steve Wynn opened the 3000-plus room property in 1989 completely changing the way resort casinos would be designed and built in the city going forward.

The volcano stood as the beacon signifying the city’s shift.

At the time there was no on-Strip outdoor attraction that even came close to The Mirage’s volcano. It would become an instant success drawing huge crowds of pedestrians and even its fair share of drivers along Las Vegas Boulevard who would stop their cars on the street just to watch the show according to Feldman.

Few know the history of The Mirage better than Feldman. He moved to Las Vegas in 1989 for the opening of the resort as an outside public affairs adviser. He spent 11 years with the-then Mirage Resorts and another 18 with MGM Resorts after MGM merged with Mirage in 2000.

“The volcano really symbolized the new Las Vegas in 1989 and all through the ’90s” Feldman said. “It was the symbol of Las Vegas turning a corner and becoming something much more than gambling and becoming really much more than Sin City.”

The volcano show itself though was not actually part of the original design plans for the resort.

“The volcano was accidental” Feldman said.

The developers of The Mirage had been the leaning heavily on the design of the entrance to Caesars Palace one that required people to drive a little ways to reach the front entrance of the resort — a way of building up the guest’s anticipation. The volcano Feldman said was just supposed to be a dormant one a piece of landscaping there to hide the entrance from the street.

That was until someone suggested making it an actual volcano experience.

“That all happened along the way. It was not part of the original design” Feldman said.

It didn’t take long for the on-Strip attraction pioneered by the volcano to take off. Soon it would be joined by the Battle of Buccaneer Bay at the neighboring Treasure Island and the fountains at Bellagio.

That accidental volcano became one of the true staples of the Strip. Just before it turned 20 it got a major makeover with an all-new audio/visual spectacle that included brand-new fire effects. It went from the original 38 fire-shooting devices to 152 shooters that can blast fireballs 12 feet into the air singeing the air just feet away from the attraction’s onlookers.

And it got an exclusive score composed by Grateful Dead drummer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Mickey Hart and Indian tabla sensation Zakir Hussain. The redesign completed by WET Design cost $25 million.

In a behind-the-scenes video showing the development of the score Hart said he was looking to “translate that fire image to sound.” He said he immersed himself into the legends and myths that surround volcanoes and studied the science behind how the natural wonders work. And of course the sound.

“It was about powerful drums. It was about evoking the spirits” Hart said. “It gives me the emotional impact that I would think you would have when you encountered a volcano.”

Push to save it

But as they have time and time before in Las Vegas the winds of change are coming for The Mirage and with it the volcano.

That change is not one that Elizabeth Cassidy wants to see.

Cassidy visiting Las Vegas from Michigan last week said she would be “very sad” to see the volcano go because it is one of the reasons she loves to come here. She has a hard time picturing Hard Rock’s plans when she looks up at the Strip skyline.

“I think it’s cool for the Hard Rock but it’s hard for me to picture it replacing The Mirage” Cassidy said. “I wish they’d keep the volcano.”

Convincing Hard Rock to keep the volcano is something Alden Gillespy is hoping to do.

Gillespy has been coming to Las Vegas for years after visiting for the first time as a teenager. He fell in love with what he describes as two major art installations on the Strip — the fountains at Bellagio and the volcano at The Mirage.

“I became mesmerized by them” he said. “In a town where everything costs money these were free.”

Shortly after the announcement that the property was being sold Gillespy started a Change.org petition aimed at just that.

“To hear that it was going to be demolished it kind of shocked me” Gillespy said.

It’s gotten just over 3600 signatures as of Wednesday out of listed goal of 5000. Gillespy said he’s now aiming to get to 10000 signers. Gillespy said he hopes to get the attention of the resort companies and at least start a conversation about the volcano.

Feldman said he’s sorry to see the volcano go too. But he thinks people need to give Hard Rock a chance.

“I have to be honest” he said. “A guitar-shaped hotel in the middle of the Strip? That sounds pretty darn cool.”

Don’t go there” she said. “Everything is super expensive.” They might be expensive yes but they’re also inviting to the weary traveler: a cold can of Coca-Cola a refreshing bottle of water or a tiny bottle of booze paired with a can of Pringles and bag of M&Ms. That’s practically a meal.

But over the past decade many hotel companies have steered clear of the once-vaunted amenity. “Hotels call time on the minibar” The Independent wrote in 2013 referencing the hassle and cost of upkeep. “The Death of the Minibar Is Nigh” an Esquire headline proclaimed that same year. The Atlantic ran a story that year simply titled “Elegy for the Minibar.”

The Atlantic piece reported that a German company invented the minibar in the early 1960s. The first one to become famous was at the Madison Hotel in D.C. Hilton claims to have “popularized” the in-room concept in 1974 in Hong Kong.

The heyday that followed for minibars is largely over. Large hotel chains have been scaling down their use for several years. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that Hyatt Hotels & Resorts was removing stocked minibars from some convention hotels and Hilton and Omni were making similar moves.

Popular new brands emphasize a communal atmosphere with wine hour in the lobby or a market near the front desk. Delivery services also make it easier to order a meal to the door — even if room service isn’t available.

“Are minibars still necessary if you can order things to be delivered to you whether it’s at 8 a.m. 2 p.m. or 2 a.m.?” said Henry Harteveldt travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group.

But some hotels have held on — and even tried to reinvent the amenity.

I am 32 years old and still deeply terrified that consuming anything from the hotel room minibar will bankrupt my entire family somehow — Mountain Lion In My Backyard 🦁🌇 (MLIMBY) (@ArmandDoma) August 21 2021

Buckley who once avoided minibars at all costs is now invested in their success as vice president of food and beverage for Atelier Ace the company behind the small boutique chain Ace Hotel. The company seeks out local partners to build its minibar program with a focus on diversity and inclusion — while also stocking choices that will appeal to the masses.

“That’s our goal right now to really work with that diversity and really work with interesting vendors that are putting out amazing products and small businesses that don’t have the opportunity to penetrate these bigger markets” she said.

At one of the company’s newest properties the Ace Hotel Brooklyn that means the kombucha gummy bears and whiskey are from borough-based companies whose owners are women people of color or members of other underrepresented groups.

“It gives people the opportunity to shop local but also learn about the community that they’re traveling in” Buckley said.

The top seller is water she said — Ace partners with boxed water brand Just Water co-founded by actor Jaden Smith — and gummy bears granola and power bars are also popular. While Buckley said the company will include a small amount of well-known items such as M&Ms about 80 percent of the minibar stock is locally sourced.

Quirky boutique hotels may have their own approach. But many luxury properties and casino resorts have also held on to the minibar. That’s where Bruno Agrario vice president of sales and marketing for Bartech Systems International gets the bulk of his business.

The family-owned company supplies automated minibars and trays to 1300 hotels around the world with this selling point: Technology keeps track of everything so the daily labor demand is significantly lower than a traditional minibar that requires someone to check each room regularly.

“Our minibar system is fighting all the negative aspects of traditional minibars” Agrario said. “In other words we fully understand why minibars are usually hated (by guests and hoteliers).”

Agrario said water is the top seller; cashews beer white wine Kettle Brand chips Pringles and chocolate almonds also do well. Diet Coke is the top-selling soda. He touts a “familiar is best” approach and he encourages customers to avoid specialized local products because he argues the heart wants what it already knows and craves — not something new.

“You don’t know those local items” he said. “A minibar is all about impulse purchase; you see the item you consume. If you don’t know the item you are not likely to use as much.”

MGM Resorts which has minibars in its luxury Las Vegas properties said in a statement that hotels “always keep the favorites in stock” — including vodka tequila beer chips nuts and candy bars.

“We evaluate and review all feedback provided on a regular basis and then use that information to make decisions based on trends and common themes” the company said. “Additionally we will test new products on a floor or two within one of our properties to get real-time feedback so we can use that data to make sound choices on products we will carry in the future.”

Minibars had a pop culture moment late last year an in episode of the HBO comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Larry David the creator of the show who plays a version of himself wants to curate the offerings for his friend’s hotel but his suggestions — wasabi peas Parmesan crisps figs and the “coup de grace” York Peppermint Patties — fail to impress.

“If you don’t have the vision to know how amazing a wasabi pea would be in a minibar I don’t really want anything to do with you” David grumbles before storming out of the meeting.

(Buckley with Ace Hotel said the fictional David would probably get hired as a minibar curator: “We like that avant-garde approach” she said.)

The pandemic dealt the latest blow to the old amenity and inspired a new round of “so long minibar” predictions. In May 2020 NPR quoted one consultant as saying: “I think the death of the minibar is probably finally here.

Harteveldt said there were practical reasons for hotels to ditch the stocked fridges or trays of non-perishables as the coronavirus spread: Properties needed to limit the presence of workers in guest rooms and get rid of unnecessary contact points.

Buckley and Agrario said they noticed a different trend as the pandemic progressed: After initial restrictions on minibars lifted they saw demand increase.

“Sales are up because a lot of times people don’t feel comfortable going out” Buckley said. “People like to be in their safe space.”

So what’s next for the minibar? Experts say there is plenty of downside — including an ongoing labor shortage and the persistence of covid-19 — but opportunity remains.

Mehmet Erdem an associate professor of hotel operations and technology at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas said innovative and creative approaches could appeal to a new generation of travelers. If hotels could figure out a pricing model that would make the minibar more attractive he said they might keep more people spending money on-site rather than looking elsewhere.

“It can be a win-win for everybody: nice affordable convenience for the guest and it can be one more amenity offered for the hotel room that adds to the competitive edge of a particular brand” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9tYW4tbG9jYXRlZC1sZWF2aW5nLXZlZ2FzLW5vdC1rbm93aW5nLWphY2twb3TSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbWFuLWxvY2F0ZWQtbGVhdmluZy12ZWdhcy1ub3Qta25vd2luZy1qYWNrcG90LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man located after leaving Vegas not knowing he won jackpot,"Nevada gambling regulators say their investigation tracked down an Arizona man who left Las Vegas after a visit last month not knowing he'd won a $229368 slot machine jackpot.

The machine being played by Robert Taylor malfunctioned due to a ""communication error"" and neither he nor the Treasure Island Hotel & Casino realized that he'd won a progressive jackpot the evening of Jan. 8 the Nevada Gaming Control Board said Friday in a statement.

The jackpot was confirmed later after a review but Taylor had returned to Arizona by then and the casino was unable to identify him the board's statement said.

The board said it then began an investigation and eventually identified Taylor after two weeks of checking surveillance video conducting witness interviews studying electronic purchase records and reviewing ride-sharing data.

According to the board it was important to locate Taylor to ensure he received what was owed to him and to maintain public trust in the casino industry.

Taylor whose hometown was not released was notified of his jackpot on Jan. 28 and he planned to collect at the casino this weekend the board said.

“The issuance of e-passports using embedded chip and futuristic technology will be rolled out in 2022-’23 to enhance the convenience for citizens in their overseas travel” said Sitharaman in Parliament.

But this is not a recent initiative by the Modi government. In 2008 the Ministry of External Affairs conducted the first phase of issuing e-passports to officials and bureaucrats in the country. The then President of India Pratibha Patil then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and then Vice-President Mohammad Hamid Ansari were the first to receive the biometric e-passports. Moreover about 20000 passports were issued for officials and bureaucrats the following month. Currently India issues passports for its citizens in printed booklets.

How e-passports function

An electronic passport or biometric passport features microchip technology as it will have a security chip embedded on the second page of the passport with personal data including the passport holder’s biometrics and a digital signature unique to each country that can be verified using a certificate. The personal details of the applicants will be digitally signed and stored in the chip. If tampered with the system will be able to identify resulting in the failure of passport authentication.

While the software is developed by the Indian Institutes of Technology Kanpur and National Informatics Centre the manufacturing of blank e-passports with electronic chip inlays and enhanced security features have been assigned to Indian Security Press in Nashik and the Ministry of External Affairs.

These electronic contactless inlays will be compliant with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization for reading passports across the world. “The Indian Passport standard goes one step ahead and defines the standard of interoperability even while personalising the passports in the passport offices across the country and missions abroad. This permits the inlays with embedded chip and antenna to be procured by the manufacturers across the world without any further implication of security than what is required for a blank passport booklet” reads the IIT Kanpur’s website .

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization more than 100 issuing authorities have rolled out e-passports. Countries like Ireland Zimbabwe Malawi along with India’s neighbours Pakistan Nepal and Bangladesh have issued such passports.

Currently India stands 84 at the Henley Passport Index 2022 with a score of 59 which means that Indian passport holders are allowed to travel visa-free to 59 countries.

The e-Passport will enhance the security of passports eliminate duplication and data tampering and will be used by border control authorities to monitor the entry and exit of passengers according to the Ministry of External Affairs.

Unauthorised data transfer will also be blocked through radio-frequency identification making the acceptance into other countries without a prior visa easier.

If you no longer want to use a Microsoft account you can remove a Microsoft account from Windows 11 and switch to a local user instead. Here’s how.

There are several advantages to logging into a Windows 11 PC with a Microsoft account. A Microsoft account allows you to sync your files and profile settings between different PCs for example.

That doesn’t mean that they’re perfect. You’re trusting Microsoft with a lot of data and if you prefer your privacy you may want to revert to using a local account. If you’re letting somebody else use your PC switching to a local account is probably a safer option.

Whatever the reason here’s a look at how you can remove a Microsoft account from Windows 11.

How to Remove a Microsoft Account from Windows 11

Microsoft accounts are tied to your PC. However if you don’t need or want that arrangement with Microsoft you can remove your account.

Note: To remove a Microsoft account you’ll need to create a local user account with admin privileges first.

To remove your Microsoft account from Windows 11 use the following steps:

Press Start and select Settings from the menu. Alternately use the keyboard shortcut Windows key + I to open Settings directly.

The next step is to add a local account with admin privileges. When Settings opens click Accounts from the left panel and then Family & other users from the right.

Next click the Add account button under the Other users section to add another user.

When the Microsoft sign-in screen appears click the I don’t have this person’s sign-in information link and click Next.

Click the Add a user without a Microsoft account link on the following screen and click Next.

When prompted type in a user name and password and click Next.

How to Set a Local User Account as an Administrator on Windows 11

Creating a local account is a necessary step in removing a Microsoft account from Windows 11. You’ll also need to give the new local user account admin privileges to ensure you have full unrestricted access to your PC using it.

To set a local user account as an administrator on Windows 11 use the following steps:

Go to Start > Settings > Accounts click the local user you created and then select the Change account type button. From the dropdown menu under Account type select Administrator and then click OK.

Log out of the Microsoft account and log back in with the local administrator account.

How to Delete a Microsoft Account on Windows 11

Now that you have a local account set up with administrator access you can remove the Microsoft account(s). This will remove the account from your PC but you’ll still be able to sign in to it elsewhere.

To delete the Microsoft account from your Windows 11 machine follow these steps:

Open Start > Settings > Accounts and click on Family & other users.

Under the Other users section select the Microsoft account you no longer need then click the Remove button.

Next click on the Delete account and data button when the confirmation screen appears.

By confirming the deletion the Microsoft account and its data are removed and it will no longer appear on the sign-in screen. If you need it back for any reason you can always add a new user on Windows 11.

How to Delete a Microsoft Account Using Control Panel

You can still remove a Microsoft account via Control Panel on Windows 11 (for as long as the Control Panel remains available). However using this method still requires you to be logged in as a local user with administrator access.

To remove a Microsoft account through the Control Panel use these steps:

Click the Start button or press the Windows key type CPL and select the top result.

When Control Panel opens click on User Accounts.

Next click on the Manage another account option.

Select the Microsoft account you want to delete from the list.

In the Delete Account menu click the Delete files button.

Finally click the Delete Account button to remove the account.

That will delete and remove the Microsoft account from your PC and it will no longer appear on the sign-in screen.

Preparing Windows 11 User Accounts

The steps above will help you to remove a Microsoft account from a Windows 11 PC.

If you have a busy household or it’s just the two of you adding another user account on Windows 11 can be helpful. Each user will have their own profile to customize their Windows experience without affecting other profiles.

It’s also worth mentioning that you can change your account name on Windows 11. In addition to changing the account name you can also change your account picture on Windows 11. If you’re tired of clicking Yes all the time when making a system change you can also disable User Account Control prompts on Windows 11.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2luZG93cy0xMS1jaHJvbWUtdnMtZWRnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Chrome vs. Microsoft Edge: Which Is the Best Windows 11 Browser?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2luZG93cy0xMS1jaHJvbWUtdnMtZWRnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzc5OTY5L2hvdy10by1sb2NrLWFuLW9iamVjdHMtcG9zaXRpb24taW4tbWljcm9zb2Z0LXBvd2VycG9pbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Lock an Object's Position in Microsoft PowerPoint,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzc5OTY5L2hvdy10by1sb2NrLWFuLW9iamVjdHMtcG9zaXRpb24taW4tbWljcm9zb2Z0LXBvd2VycG9pbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9uZXctcmVwb3J0LXNoZWRzLWxpZ2h0LWZ1dHVyZS1taWNyb3NvZnRzLWFyLXN0cmF0ZWd5LW5vdy1ob2xvbGVucy0zLWNhbmNlbGVk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New report sheds light on future of Microsoft's AR strategy now that HoloLens 3 is 'canceled',"What you need to know

A new report has revealed more about Microsoft's canceled HoloLens 3.

Futher details about Microsoft and Samsung's AR partnership have been revealed too.

It's not looking good for future HoloLens products running Windows.

Business Insider has today published a follow-up report with more details about Microsoft's canceled HoloLens 3 augmented reality (AR) headset. According to the report which outright refutes Technical Fellow Alex Kipman's recent comments suggesting HoloLens 3 was not canceled the device was codenamed Calypso and was canceled during the last year. Furthermore everyone working on the project has since been reassigned to other projects or has outright left the company.

This new info comes after Business Insider reported earlier this week that Microsoft's mixed reality division was in shambles. ""In no uncertain terms Calypso was canceled"" says a source familiar with the matter. The device was going to feature a more robust design with longer battery life and was able to be used in outdoor settings. The device was canceled as the company wanted to put engineering resources behind other projects including Samsung's AR device codenamed Bondi.

The new report says Microsoft is no longer actively working on a HoloLens 2 successor that would be powered by Windows for either business or consumer use. The company is still working on a custom HoloLens for the US military but that device codenamed Atlas is not something that Microsoft's regular customers will be able to buy or develop for.

Business Insider's report does shed light on what the future may hold for Microsoft's augmented reality strategy now that its next flagship product is no longer coming. The partnership with Samsung is said to include a headset with a set of screens inside powered by a Samsung phone in your pocket. This likely means the headset will be powered by Android and not Windows which throws the future of Windows' role in AR into serious doubt.

The report doesn't mention what exactly Microsoft's role is in this Samsung-Microsoft AR partnership. A report from last year was the first to claim that Microsoft and Samsung were working together on an AR partnership yet that report also failed to mention Microsoft's role.

Finally Business Insider mentions that Microsoft is looking into the idea of an edge-computing headset where the OS and data are streamed from the cloud directly onto the device. Business Insider's source claims this idea is still in early planning stages and could change significantly (or get canceled) before it's announced. It's unclear if this device would utilize Windows 365 or another cloud-based solution.

Overall if this report is accurate it's looking like any future AR device from Microsoft won't be running Windows. With no immediate follow-up to the HoloLens 2 on the cards it's unlikely we're ever going to see another self-contained Windows-powered HoloLens device before Apple and Google debut their own offerings. Whatever comes next from Microsoft and Samsung will likely be powered by an Android phone."

Langer 71 received his doctor of science degree in chemical engineering from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) but it was quite a while before he found a job that he liked.

It was the 1970s and the only offers he got were from oil companies whose main problem was “increasing the yield of a petrochemical by 0.01%.” He tried to work in education but nobody would hire him. He had no luck in the field of medicine either. And then he heard of a research lab run by a scientist named Judah Folkman from the Boston Children’s Hospital. Folkman was a surgeon “who sometimes hired unusual people” and who had an idea that nobody was interested in at the time: if you could stop blood vessels from growing inside a tumor you might stop the spread of cancer.

Together with his new mentor Langer discovered how to deliver the molecules that could achieve it but they were too large. Getting them to reach many internal organs was like trying to walk through a brick wall. To solve the blood vessel problem first he had to solve the delivery problem. The researchers showed it was possible to take polymer capsules and use them as tiny delivery vehicles that did not destroy macromolecules meant to block the spread of blood vessels. Their results were published in Science and Nature. Four decades later the same principle now perfected in the form of lipid nanoparticles lies behind the success of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against Covid-19.

But back then most scientists chose to ignore these findings while companies did not think of developing drugs based on them at least not for many years. And so Langer decided to create his own companies to ensure that his products would “help people.”

These days Langer is is one of 12 Institute Professors at MIT the highest honor for a faculty member. He is also the most cited chemical engineer in history and his more than 500 patents bring in billions of euros in profits. Langer has created over 40 successful biotechnology companies including Moderna. A recipient of over 220 awards he has just received the BBVA Foundation’s Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biology and Biomedicine together with Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their pioneering work on mRNA vaccines.

Langer believes that large companies are risk-averse and that it is up to governments to fund universities and public research centers to do “curiosity-driven science.” After his early experience with Folkman this son of a liquor store owner and a housewife went on to specialize in finding new forms of drug delivery. The goal was to reach organs that existing medication could not and to reduce the amount of pills and injections required to treat patients. For instance would it be possible to create a pill that remains inside the stomach and releases the right dose of medicine for days weeks months or at specific moments? Such controlled release medication would be greatly helpful for diabetics and for the millions of people on antimalarials.

It’s important to have great universities and to give them really good funding so they can do basic curiosity-driven research which is the starting point for so much

Langer’s lab has produced patches against glioblastoma one of the worst known brain tumors as well as nanoparticles that can slowly release medication against prostate conditions and endometriosis for months. It has also developed technology to engineer tissues and regenerate the skin of burn victims.

Langer has just joined Forbes magazine’s list of billionaires. A lot of it has to do with a visit he received in 2010 at his MIT office. A young researcher from Harvard Medical School named Derrick Rossi had read Karikó's research and wanted to talk about the potential of mRNA in cell reprogramming. In a recent conversation with EL PAÍS Langer described his upcoming projects and speculated about the medicine of the future.

Question. Almost nobody believed in you at first not even companies. Years later Karikó and Weissman had similar experiences. Do you think that big pharmaceutical companies are averse to important but risky ideas?

Answer. It wasn’t just the big pharmaceutical companies it was the scientists. I got my first nine grants rejected by scientists. One of them said something like ‘he’s a chemical engineer he knows nothing about biology much less about cancer. We shouldn’t fund him.’ I do think that large companies and I’ve been on boards of many are fairly risk-averse. But small companies are less risk-averse. So many big breakthroughs have started in academic places over the years like in my case or Karikó's and small start-ups have made a huge difference.

That’s the beauty of science when you create new things and you don’t know what they’re going to be useful for

Q. Did you imagine the enormous potential of Moderna when you founded it?

A. I was an advisor at Genentech [considered the first biotech company] for 30 years. Their business was making proteins and they were incredibly successful at it but it took them years to make the proteins to develop these big manufacturing procedures and I could see that if you could do mRNA it would be potentially much better and faster. You could put it in nanoparticles to protect it and inject it and in the end it’s the body that’s making the protein. You could use it with anything. When we started Moderna I remember telling my wife in 2010 “this will be the most successful biotech company in history.” At that point we didn’t know about Covid nobody anticipated it but it just accelerated everything. Moderna has 23 clinical trials going on not just for Covid but for cancer heart disease and rare diseases. All of them use mRNA and nanoparticles.

Q. Do you think we are near the end of the pandemic or will we need more vaccines and medication to stop it?

A. I wish I knew I’m not an expert but I worry that we haven’t seen the last of Covid and we probably won’t for some time. That doesn’t mean we can’t do a lot better at controlling it. Companies can make boosters specific to variants and in our own lab at MIT we’ve been working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for years on things that may not help overnight but for the future like self-boosting vaccines. It’s not ready for patients yet but with one injection you would get boosts through nanoparticles that would burst at one months two months five months. We are also working on things that I hope will be good for the developing world which I call microneedle patches almost like band-aids and maybe one day ship them across the world.

Q. You always say you want to create things to help people and change society. What are your current goals?

A. In our lab we have around 100 people working on two areas one is drug delivery and nanotechnology and the other is tissue engineering. We are working on new nanoparticles that can deliver different types of RNA and CRISPR [gene editing] inside cells. We also work with the Gates Foundation on pills you could swallow to last the entire course of treatment and which could be useful for mental health diseases schizophrenia Alzheimer’s. The Gates Foundation is also interested in antimalarials in the possibility of taking one pill representing a two-week course of treatment.

Q. Would it have other applications?

A. Yes in nutrition. Many people in developing countries do not get enough iron and vitamin A and we have developed nanoparticles that can stabilize those and you could cook them or put them in boiling water or bread. And little children don’t take medicines very well so we’ve come up with Gummi bear-style medication to treat tropical diseases.

Q. Another one of your projects involves delivering medication through ultrasound?

R. Yes we’ve been able to make little probes that can deliver drugs like in the Star Trek idea through the skin or the intestine. It can be activated once it reaches the organ through ultrasound. We also make small devices with tiny wells that are covered with a specific material and we can make a trigger so the wells can release their charge.

Q. You also create artificial tissues?

A. That was an idea we started a long time ago of taking materials and putting them in certain shapes to serve as structures for the cells of any mammal which now would include stem cells. It gives you the ability to create any tissue like artificial skin for burn victims. There are clinical trials that stemmed from this work involving new blood vessels spinal cord repair hearing loss and cell encapsulation. And it might reduce testing in animals and people.

When we started Moderna I remember telling my wife in 2010 ‘this will be the most successful biotech company in history’

Q. Sometimes your inventions have had unexpected results such as helping with hair regrowth.

A. [MIT colleague] Dan Anderson and I created material we thought would be useful for a range of things. We had patents on them and our major idea was to use them for certain disease treatments but some investors asked if they might be useful for other things like hair so we came up with ‘material libraries’ containing thousands of materials from some of the same synthesis which you can take out and test. So one prevents a hair frizz another gives it more volume. The company is named Living Proof and it’s just been bought by Unilever. That’s the beauty of science when you create new things and you don’t know what they’re going to be useful for.

Q. Do you think companies should make their patents available during the pandemic?

A. Moderna said in October 2020 that they would not enforce the patents during the pandemic so anyone could use them.

Q. How do you think the medicines of the future will look like?

A. We’re going to see more genetic medicines and gene editing. Also more cellular therapies like the kind of tissue engineering we are doing. And there are ways of using cells to treat cancer and we will see more of this. There will also be better delivery systems more targeted. There will be ways of taking an entire course of treatment with one pill. We already have something people call a robot pill that stays in your digestive system and that could one day be used to deliver insulin to diabetics.

Q. How would you advise a world leader on how to improve scientific research in their country?

A. I’ve already been asked this question by some leaders. It’s important to have great universities and to give them really good funding so they can do basic curiosity-driven research which is the starting point for so much.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmUtZmx1eC5jb20vYW5ub3VuY2VtZW50cy80NDYwODMvbWFya28tamFrZXdpdGhvdXQtYS1tYXN0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marko Jakše: Without a Master - Announcements,"Commissioner: Aleš Vaupotič director of Moderna galerija

Curator: Robert Simonišek

For more than three decades the painter Marko Jakše (1959 Ljubljana) winner of several awards has been creating a stir with his ingenious and imaginative works. Since the beginning of his artistic career he has been dedicating his intense energy exclusively to the medium of painting.

Jakše ranks among those artists that find inspiration in inventive ways of spontaneous expression rather than theory and craftsmanship with the artist’s body playing an important part in the process. He is an alert admirer of nature which he penetrates with the innocent eyes of a child exploring its fragments in their material and immaterial aspects and ingeniously and sensuously bringing them into more discerningly physical psychedelic or cosmic perspectives.

Jakše paints spaces of human imagination. Animals and strange creatures dominate over humans actual species existing on Earth are joined by hermaphrodites and apparitions from dream islands or unknown expanses of the universe or the future. In heightened emotional states the figures the shrieking animals and the hybrid creatures forge complex relationships through ritual gestures.

His canvases depict paradoxical antithetical entities relating to the symbols and relics of sunken civilizations spirituality religions mythologies and art heritage. The painter’s visions unveil an anti-world of mysteries curiosities and miracles set in archetypal landscapes and timeless architecture.

In the context of this year’s Venice Biennale theme his paintings challenge the idea of controlling nature and the related categories of existence the scientific systems and the knowledge of what actually is the primordial in and outside us and above all how something is. Jakše’s response to these questions covers a broad range from Nietzschean Dionysian abandon to meta-symbolistic and meta-romantic allegories reflecting the enthralling drama of human passions and yearning—mysterious games without a master.

Catalogue

The catalogue will include Marko Jakše’s texts by Anja Zag Golob Aleksandra Kostič Andrej Medved and Robert Simonišek. It will be designed by Jagoda Jejčič.

The Pavilion of the Republic of Slovenia is commissioned by Aleš Vaupotič director of the Moderna galerija Ljubljana as the organizer and supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia.

Morgan Asset Management chairman of market and investment strategy said bitcoin’s valuations are “the stuff that dreams are made of” — and he didn’t mean it as a compliment CoinDesk reported Friday (Feb. 4).

“I won’t be buying it even though part of me wants to regardless of consequences since that’s what some crypto holders have been counting on from the beginning” he wrote.

In a 30-page investigation called “The Maltese Falcoin: On cryptocurrencies and blockchains” Cembalest writes that crypto has a much-vaunted status that is also brittle with use cases like store of value cross-border remittances decentralized finance (DeFi) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain adoption.

He says he gets why people are interested as there’s a “massive confidence void” — but in the end the volatility is “ridiculously high.”

Meanwhile CoinDesk also reported Friday that bitcoin’s price rose 8.9% to a two-week high of $40219.

Per the report this may show that crypto traders are growing more confident that the market has stabilized after its recent slump and analysts have said there’s a possible short squeeze.

According to Crypto Finance AG senior trader Daniel Kukan his next price level target on the upside is around $42000 to $43000 with market support at $33000.

The price is still far lower than the high of $69000 from last November.

Finally Nasdaq.com reported Friday that Latin American real estate platform La Haus has closed a deal in bitcoin for an apartment in the north of Colombia a report says.

La Haus’ new deal is the first in bitcoin in Colombia and the company also recently closed a bitcoin deal in Mexico.

LBC Express Inc. topped the list of deconsolidators

Rosario Calisang was the top broker for the deconsolidator category

The Bureau of Customs (BOC)-Manila International Container Port (MICP) recently awarded its top importers and customs brokers for 2021.

Mondelez Philippines Inc emerged as the importer with the highest revenue contribution at BOC-MICP while Dexter Saylago Pepanio contributed the most revenue among all customs brokers.

For deconsolidators LBC Express Inc. led the list with Rosario Calisang as the top broker.

Richard Wayne Hill

Amarillo - Richard Wayne Hill (Rickey) was born in Amarillo Texas on March 29 1946 and was a lifelong resident of Amarillo. He died on January 26 2022 after battling Alzheimer's disease.

Rickey graduated from Amarillo High School and West Texas A & M University. He began a successful career as a stockbroker with Kidder Peabody Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and in later years retired from LPL Financial.

Rickey loved to hunt and trout fish in New Mexico and the Colorado mountains and even enjoyed an occasional round of golf. He was also an expert at trap shooting. He proudly displayed his many awards and welcomed the opportunity to show them off and share a fun story. Rickey was a member of the Amarillo Gun Club and spent many weekends shooting with friends. He loved all things John Wayne and never missed a late-night western.

He is survived by his daughters Margaret Ann Brown (Wes) of Amarillo and Catherine Lawler (Donn) of Austin four grandchildren Emily Brown Miller of Amarillo Elaine Brown of Flower Mound Lilly and Luke Lawler of Austin great granddaughters Elly and Anna Miller niece Haley Hill Sutter sister-in-law Connie Hill and several out of town cousins. He will be remembered as a kind gentle man and a loving father to his daughters. Rickey was preceded in death by his beloved mother Wanda Jo (Jody) Matthews and his brother Ronnie. He was most certainly greeted by them both as he entered Heaven.

A memorial service will be held on Saturday February 12th at 2:00 pm at Boxwell Brothers Chapel 2800 Paramount Amarillo Texas.

The family would like to acknowledge their appreciation to The Legacy at Town Square Ruby Slippers Care and High Plains Senior Care Hospice.

So says veteran market-structure analyst Larry Tabb citing a panoply of evidence including volume on legacy venues like the New York Stock Exchange as well as the quickly swelling value of shares changing hands each day in equities. Data from Morgan Stanley found big-money investment houses bringing increasing pressure to bear on the futures market while prime brokerage data showed hedge-fund selling drove the selloff in speculative tech at the turn of the year.

The change is both a cause and consequence of big shifts in the market’s volatility backdrop with concerns about Federal Reserve policy forcing a reordering of institutional portfolios. According to Tabb it’s a landscape that is likely to prove less and less conducive to the day-trading heroes whose derring-do was a big influence on prices in the post-pandemic era.

“If volatility stays high retail lags. And if I was to be a betting man I would be saying volatility will remain high for probably throughout this year” said Tabb head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Outside of another meme stock phenomenon it would seem that institutions are going to wind up driving flows.”

A market driven by these institutions is one where old-school metrics like earnings announcements valuation and guidance matter more than populist drivers like Reddit postings and name checks on TikTok Tabb says. For better or worse when big-money funds rule the roost companies in bankruptcy proceedings are unlikely to find enthusiastic buyers as Hertz Global Holdings Inc. did in 2020.

The share of overall trading represented by do-it-yourselfers has come down a lot. After spiking to 24% in the first quarter of 2021 it’s now around 18% Tabb and other BI analysts estimate. What’s more a phenomenon where the value of daily trading is rising faster than the absolute number of shares changing hands shows deeper-pocketed investors are dominating flows.

“The diversion is due to a transition to higher-priced securities and likely a result of a slowdown in retail trading participation and a shift to institutional” BI wrote in a report last month. “Retail investors have historically favored lower-priced securities and active trading in small-cap stocks.”

Not that retail traders aren’t still buying like crazy. They sent a net $41 billion into stocks last month according to estimates from Morgan Stanley’s trading desk. Increasingly though they’re running into worried institutions forced into action by the Fed. Hedge funds continued to shed holdings as the specter of higher interest rates battered their favorite growth stocks. Trend-following traders piled on with benchmark indexes falling below key support levels.

In fact money managers whose investment decisions are based on macroeconomic and market trends unwound $43 billion of equity positions in January -- enough to offset all the retail inflows Morgan Stanley data showed.

That’s “emblematic of the institutional pressure on the market” Morgan Stanley’s Christopher Metli and others wrote in a recent report. “While retail likely contributed to some of the market moves it’s likely that institutional flows are becoming an even bigger driver.”

On Friday these systematic macro funds had to sell $4 billion of S&P 500 futures in the final 45 minutes of trading potentially leading to the late-session market weakness the firm said. This group is estimated to offload between $10 billion to $20 billion of equities next week amid heightened index-level volatility.

To Max Gokhman the chief investment officer at AlphaTrAI Inc. the retail crowd’s influence has always been exaggerated. “It’s not that they had a magic touch” he said. “It’s that market dynamics created this amazing market rally and they just greased the wheels a little bit.”

Even though overall retail activity last month was at a 13-month high the group’s share of total market volume still fell to the lowest level since March 2020 according to Morgan Stanley. That happened as institutions were unwinding holdings fast enough that their selling appeared to have overwhelmed buying from the retail crowd.

Take commodity trading advisers or CTAs which watch market trends for trading signals. As the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 dropped to fresh lows to start the year these computer-driven funds were prompted to sell equities and went short against the market. Meanwhile a spike in price swings forced volatility-targeted funds to reduce leverage “significantly” according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates.

“Because of the higher volatility a lot of these institutional investors were basically forced to rebalance their portfolios -- they’re ruled-base and they have to trade” said Peng Cheng a global quantitative and derivatives strategist at JPMorgan. “Whereas for retail investors if they want to step in and buy the dip they can. If they don’t want to they don’t have to trade.”

The January carnage began with a massive selloff among expensive technology shares an area hedge funds had piled into that now face mounting valuation pressure with rates rising. The fast money quickly cut positions a process that likely exacerbated the rout. Net leverage among long-short hedge funds fell to an 18-month low by Jan. 27 data compiled by Morgan Stanley’s prime broker show.

The next few days however hedge funds tracked by the firm dipped their toes back into the market with leverage rising to 55% from 50%.

Meanwhile balanced funds and pensions were expected to start month-end rebalancing in order to return to a preset bond/stock allocation. Given the equity selloff they’d need to purchase stocks this time. Such buying amounted to a 5% market upside according to a JPMorgan estimate.

Perhaps not coincidentally stocks bounced back to finish January on a strong note. The S&P 500 went on to produce the biggest four-day rally since November 2020 before Meta Platforms Inc.’s disappointing results halted the advance.

One group that helped amplify moves in both directions: options hedgers.

As investors rushed to the options market amid market turmoil dealers providing such contracts either bought or sold stocks en masse in a bid to neutralize their fast-moving exposures -- a dynamic known as “gamma hedging.” And this time the condition was such that they needed to buy in a rising market and sell when stocks went down.

The hedging action was “contributing to the violent and ‘chase-y’ moves both higher and lower” Charlie McElligott a cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities wrote in a note this week.

Despite a painful selloff that saw the Nasdaq 100 slumping 10% this year retail demand for stocks stayed buoyant. Equity funds a favorite destination for amateur money saw inflows in 20 out of 23 trading days according to EPFR Global data compiled by Bank of America Corp.

Though their optimism remains high retail traders’ portfolios haven’t been faring well lately. Morgan Stanley estimates based on exchange and public price-feed data showed individual investors have seen their trades losing 12% this year.

Anxiety is creeping up in the options market where small-fry traders are loading up on protective bearish contracts.

“I would expect retail investors to struggle a bit with making the buying decision in the middle of a brutal market compared to program trading or institutions” said Mike Bailey director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “Psychologically the retail trade likely faces a higher bar for buying the dip rather than going with the flow and buying on the way up.”

Peloton (PMCCF) Interactive Inc has drawn interest from potential buyers including e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) according to a person familiar with the matter as the exercise bike maker struggles to maintain pandemic-fueled growth.

Shares of Peloton surged 30% in extended trading on the news which comes days after activist investor Blackwells Capital urged the company’s board to put it up for sale.

Amazon is exploring an offer for Peloton and is speaking with advisers about whether and how to proceed a source said. Peloton has not yet decided whether it will explore a sale according to the source.

Meanwhile the Financial Times reported late on Friday that sportswear company Nike (NKE) is also evaluating a bid for Peloton citing people briefed on the matter who said the considerations are preliminary and Nike (NKE) has not held talks with Peloton.

Peloton and Nike did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment while Amazon declined to comment.

Peloton’s sales boomed during Covid-19 lockdowns with many snapping up home fitness equipment. But its fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.

In November it hinted that demand for its exercise bikes and treadmills was slowing faster than expected and its market capitalization since then has shrunk to about $8 billion from a peak of nearly $52 billion in early 2021.

If the stock’s gains hold on Monday Peloton could reach the $10 billion market-capitalization threshold.

Last week Blackwells Capital called on the board of Peloton to remove CEO John Foley immediately accusing him of deals that set high fixed costs and for holding on to excessive inventory while misleading investors about the need to raise capital.

Blackwells criticized Foley for hiring his wife as a key executive and committing to a 300000-square-foot 20-year lease for office space in New York among other things.

The investment firm run by Jason Aintabi has also urged the board to put the company up for sale to a buyer like Walt Disney (DIS) Co Apple (AAPL) Sony (SNE) Group or Nike Inc Reuters reported on Sunday.

Peloton has tried to cushion the blow to its growth by cutting the price of its popular bike and ramping up its ad spending but growth remains stagnant.

Last month Peloton said the company was reviewing the size of its workforce and “resetting” production levels following a report that it was temporarily halting production of connected fitness bikes and treadmills after a significant drop in demand.

While many investors have become frustrated with Peloton due to a steep drop in its share price analysts also note that the company may be a difficult acquisition target because of its two classes of stock effectively allowing insiders to control it.

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The growth in the fitness band market has prompted tech giants such as Apple and Samsung (SSNLF) to introduce features for health tracking including electrocardiogram and blood pressure sensor. Google (GOOG) closed its acquisition of fitness tracking company Fitbit (FIT) in January.

Tech giants including Amazon and Alphabet have also seen a rise in their valuation after blockbuster results this week. A day after Facebook (FB) owner Meta Platforms suffered the deepest loss of stock market value in history for a US company Amazon logged the greatest ever one-day increase in value.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1saXF1aWRpdHktYWJ5c21hbC1hZGRpbmctdm9sYXRpbGl0eS1yaXNrLTIwMjItMDItMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. stock market liquidity 'abysmal' adding to volatility risk,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-market-liquidity-abysmal-adding-volatility-risk-2022-02-07/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1saXF1aWRpdHktYWJ5c21hbC1hZGRpbmctdm9sYXRpbGl0eS1yaXNrLTIwMjItMDItMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWpvci1leGNoYW5nZS1sYmFuay13aXNoZXMtbHVuYXItMDQzMzAwOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Major Exchange LBank Wishes Lunar New Year via Nasdaq Billboard on Times Square NYC,"Dubai United Arab Emirates--(Newsfile Corp. - February 5 2022) - On 1st Feburary 2022 LBank Exchange promotes the wishes to the world through Times Square NYC - Nasdaq Billboard for the celebration of the Chinese lunar New Year.

It was a week of polar extremes for Big Tech which saw stomach-churning swings that ignited the wildest volatility since the pandemic shuttered the U.S. economy in 2020.The zaniness of the past five days is hard to exaggerate: The Nasdaq 100 Index which includes some of the world’s technology behemoths had its best week since December even after Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. posted the worst one-day drop in market value in stock-market history plunging it into value territory.But it was hardly a train wreck for tech stocks this week: Amazon.com Inc. shares soared 14% Friday on strong cloud growth in the biggest single-day gain in market capitalization in U.S. history. On Wednesday Alphabet Inc. jumped the most in almost two years after the Google parent posted upbeat results which came on the heels of solid earnings from Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. a week earlier.Investors still have plenty to be on edge about with the weeks counting down before a widely expected Federal Reserve interest-rate hike. The path of monetary policy amid soaring inflation and the uncertain trajectory of the pandemic are complicating portfolio decisions now and the size and frequency of the swings in tech shares are beginning to worry analysts.“These are very difficult waters for people to navigate -- we are dealing with changing monetary policy tapering the pandemic inflation earnings and all these issues” Steve Sosnick chief strategist at Interactive Brokers said in a phone interview. “It is much harder to determine what fair value should be for a stock now and the volatile markets reflect the difficulty that people are having.”Shares of Meta collapsed 26% Thursday wiping out $251 billion in market value and sparking a global tech rout. The company’s disappointing earnings stoked worries that its flagship product and core advertising have plateaued.Meta is now trading akin to a “value” stock one that’s cheap on measures such as earnings or book value rather than a more expensive “growth” stock. For instance its forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio has fallen to about 16 the lowest since the early months of the pandemic and below the S&P 500 Value Index’s for the first time on record.The diverging earnings reports from Big Tech and growth stocks are fueling the wild swings in U.S. equities and internet shares. The realized 10-day volatility for the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index -- which tracks 42 Internet-related companies -- has surged to the highest level since April 2020.Meta’s slide briefly weighed on major technology growth and social media names with shares of Amazon sinking 7.8% on Thursday before its blowout earnings report. On Thursday Twitter Inc. Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc. all tumbled dragging the Nasdaq 100 Index down 4.2% its worst selloff since September 2020.But all three stocks rebounded Friday after upbeat results from Snap and Pinterest eased fears that a slowdown at rival Meta reflected a broad slump for social media companies."

He wasn’t that new: Van Zandt was basically reprising the New Jersey mobster persona he’d successfully deployed for nearly a decade in The Sopranos. After ratting out his associates his new character Frank “the Fixer” Tagliano had to begin a new life – in Lillehammer Norway. The sleepy snowy town didn’t know what was about to hit it. The same could be said for us: Lilyhammer was Netflix’s first original series.

Ten years on our entertainment landscape is almost unrecognisable. Netflix has changed what we watch and the way we watch it. It has successfully reorganised traditional broadcast television and theatrical cinema models and put itself at the centre growing from 24 million subscribers in 2012 to 214 million this year. It is available in more than 190 countries (Netflix UK launched the same month as Lilyhammer). It has created more than 1500 original series including planet-straddlingly massive shows such as Stranger Things and Bridgerton. In 2021 alone it released over 150 original movies – three per week. Its competitors have been playing catchup ever since. So how did it take over entertainment in just 10 years?

Lilyhammer was not exactly a smash hit even if an estimated 20% of Norway’s population watched it. But the show marked the streamer’s first tentative step into making its own content in partnership with the Norwegian broadcaster NRK1. By this stage Netflix had seen the writing on the wall. It had successfully transitioned from a mail-order DVD service to delivering content directly to consumers over the internet. This had always been the plan: the clue was in the name. But its biggest hits were existing shows such as Family Guy Grey’s Anatomy Law & Order the US Office and Parks and Recreation. It was only a matter of time before the big media players noticed Netflix’s booming subscriber numbers and reclaimed their programmes for their own streaming platforms. So Netflix borrowed a trunkload of cash ($16bn over the past 10 years) and plotted its transition from distribution to production.

Netflix has not only transformed our entertainment landscape but our social one too – and not just in terms of “Netflix and chill”. In 2010 two years before Lilyhammer the company acquired the now-feted Breaking Bad which had just finished its third season on AMC. The crime series already had a cult following by that stage but Netflix supercharged its popularity by putting the first three seasons up on its platform ahead of the fourth. Not only could new viewers quickly get up to speed they could consume Breaking Bad the same way Walter White’s customers consumed his top-grade meth.

To the under-35s the idea of dutifully congregating round the living room television at the same time each week to catch your favourite show sounds laughably old-fashioned. We now expect the next episode to be available when we want it – which is often straight after the previous one has ended – and where we want it be that the living room flat-screen our laptop in bed or the phone on the commute to work.

In 2013 the term “binge-watch” was a runner-up to “selfie” for the Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year. By that time Netflix itself had published the results of a survey that found that 61% of streaming viewers binge-watched regularly and 73% had positive feelings towards it. Never mind that binge-watching has been blamed for everything from political apathy to insomnia attention deficiency to declining birthrates; as Ted Sarandos Netflix’s chief content officer put it “binge-watching is the new normal”.

The year after Lilyhammer Netflix released the show that really put it on the map as a producer: House of Cards whose mix of big-name talent (David Fincher Kevin Spacey Robin Wright) buzzy political themes and cinema-standard production values were impossible to ignore. Netflix bid over the odds for the rights to the series – some $100m – and even took the unprecedented step of greenlighting a second season up front. It has continued to bring in the big names in the years since: Martin Scorsese the Coen brothers Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuarón (whose Roma won Netflix its first Oscars in 2019). It looks likely to figure again in this year’s race with contenders such as Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter. The channel has courted big names from outside cinema too signing high-profile production deals with the likes of the Obamas and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

In truth though these are the exceptions rather than the rule. The typical Netflix programme is not created by Oscar winners or royals. Indeed by design there is no “typical” Netflix programme. Where mainstream broadcasting has traditionally taken a “one size fits all” approach to programming – with that one size being determined by a small upper echelon of executives – mainly straight white American and male – Netflix has taken the exact opposite approach casting the net far and wide in search of fresh talent and tailoring content to underserved audiences.

One thing that Netflix does well is content that others wouldn’t have done because there wasn’t seemingly an audience Julia Alexander analyst

This has been key to Netflix’s success says Deborah Jaramillo a professor of film and television at Boston University: “[Traditional TV] was putting the idea out there that there was one sort of universal experience that we could all attach to and identify with when the reality was that we are many different people with many different backgrounds needs and struggles. Those things were not being spoken to by the whole model of broadcast television.” Jaramillo hates the term “binge-watching” she adds with its connotations of guilt and sin. “I think it casts a negative light on active exuberant television-viewing. Watching movie marathons or reading a book aren’t understood in the same way even though you’re still engaged for long periods of time.”

Netflix has attracted Black film-makers and showrunners such as Ava DuVernay (who has delivered documentary 13th and series When They See Us and Colin in Black and White) Spike Lee (She’s Gotta Have It) and Shonda Rhimes (Bridgerton). It has championed LGBTQ+-friendly programming such as Orange Is the New Black Sex Education and RuPaul’s Drag Race.

“One thing that Netflix does extremely well on the English-speaking side is content that others wouldn’t have done because there just wasn’t seemingly an audience for it” says Julia Alexander of Parrot Analytics. A great example for her is teen series and romcoms shows such as Never Have I Ever The Kissing Booth and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. “If you were a young girl or a woman between 14 and 34 there was no one really making television for you. And Netflix over the last 10 years really leaned into it and thought: ‘There’s an audience here. They’re hyper online and they will like it it will become their identity.’”

It has done the same in many other areas: Japanese anime adult-oriented animation true-crime documentary standup comedy fantasy and sci-fi. It has also established footholds in territories including Spain France India and South Korea. As a result non-English-language series that would otherwise never have travelled outside their country of origin have begun to find global audiences such as Spain’s Money Heist France’s Lupin and most recently South Korea’s phenomenally popular Squid Game.

Netflix matches this pluralistic approach with an unorthodox work culture a senior Netflix UK producer explains: “Rather than a situation where you’ve got a massive hierarchy within a company what you have is lots of people who have real agency and can make their own decisions but they do it whilst keeping everybody else in the company super-informed.” Netflix also encourages extreme candour: employees are encouraged to give and receive honest feedback rather than sniping behind people’s backs. For British people especially all of this takes a lot of getting used to they say.

The UK is Netflix’s third biggest production hub after the US and Canada and it has invested massively here. But it has also moved the dial of British TV in general. Unrestrained by traditional management structures public scrutiny and limited broadcasting slots Netflix has been free to go where public service broadcasters could not. At a parliamentary committee hearing in 2020 for example the MP Kevin Brennan questioned whether the BBC could have made a series such as The Crown given the outrage it would have generated from politicians and hostile media outlets. One independent producer suggested that as a result of Netflix’s edgier British fare like The Crown and Sex Education the BBC and Channel 4 had been emboldened to commission riskier material such as Normal People It’s a Sin and I May Destroy You.

Rather than a competitor Netflix sees itself as part of the thriving ecosystem of British film and television production it says. It cites the first season of The End of the F***ing World which aired on Channel 4 in the UK then on Netflix for the rest of the world. When the show returned for its second season it had gained a global audience which resulted in increased viewing numbers for Channel 4 – so a win-win.

It doesn’t always work out like that though. Last year Michaela Coel revealed she had been in discussions to make I May Destroy You with Netflix but it refused to grant her any portion of the rights to her show not even 0.5%. It told her “it’s not how we do things here” Coel said. She took the show to the BBC and HBO instead. Netflix has declined to comment on that specific case but says it does different deals with different producers. A spokesperson also points out that “for many of our commissions Netflix finances 100% of the budget and thus bears the full risk of whether the show is ultimately a commercial success or not while producers and rights holders are guaranteed their payment.”

Netflix has not always lived up to its diversity commitments either. In October 2021 it released The Closer the last of six standup specials by African American comedian Dave Chappelle. In the show Chappelle made a number of comments that were widely condemned as transphobic not least by Netflix’s own employees. Sarandos defended the show emailing employees that Netflix’s leadership “do not believe that The Closer is intended to incite hatred or violence against anyone” and that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm”. Some Netflix workers staged a walkout in protest. The queer Australian comic Hannah Gadsby who had filmed two standup specials for Netflix and was cited by Sarandos as a model of Netflix’s commitment to “marginalised communities” responded on Instagram: “Fuck you and your amoral algorithm cult.” Sarandos swiftly backed down and apologised that he had “screwed up” but the incident pointed to possible faultlines in Netflix’s model. Its desire to cater to all tastes had set two of its communities against each other.

Netflix is in all the countries Disney and Warners want to be in. They have access to the talent Julia Alexander analyst

A common criticism of Netflix is the extent to which it has atomised our viewing habits. Like Scheherazade in One Thousand and One Nights its model depends on presenting viewers with a never-ending succession of new content tailored to their personal viewing habits so that they never cancel their subscription. This is where Netflix’s fabled algorithms really do come into play. Users’ behaviour data is cross-referenced with its 2000 different “taste groups” to produce a unique homepage for each user presenting categories and “because you watched” suggestions that might appeal. Combine this fine-grained approach with the “anytime anywhere” availability of streaming content and we’re heading for a landscape where we’re all in our own discrete entertainment realities watching different things at different times.

With all this fracturing does there come a point when film and TV no longer function as “popular culture”? So far Netflix has managed to square this circle generating mainstream hits while diversifying our tastes. Look at The Queen’s Gambit for example whose success led to a boom in sales of chess sets. Or how Squid Game became the network’s most watched series ever.

Can Netflix keep it up for another 10 years? Last month for the first time it announced worse-than-expected results that saw its share price drop an alarming 20% wiping nearly $50bn off its value. Its rivals are finally catching up. Big media companies such as Disney Universal and Warner have taken back their content and used it to build their own streaming platforms. Earlier this year for example some of Netflix’s popular titles including Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother migrated to Disney+ which could translate to a loss of 750000 subscribers according to analysts. Big tech players Apple and Amazon are also making inroads fuelled by almost bottomless funds. Amazon Prime Video’s forthcoming Lord of the Rings series alone has a budget of nearly half a billion dollars. Even binge-watching is not what it used to be. Some of the most talked about rival shows of the past year such as Disney’s The Mandalorian and WandaVision and HBO’s Succession have lodged in the public consciousness partly as a result of dropping their episodes once a week old-school.

For the time being at least Netflix is one step ahead says Julia Alexander: “They’re still dominant by like aeons” she says. Comparisons are often difficult to draw but Netflix’s largest comparable rival Disney+ has about 100 million fewer subscribers. “Yes competition is affecting Netflix but at the same time Netflix is hitting a saturation point in the US and Canada they’re making up for that in regions its competitors still aren’t even in.” Netflix is still growing globally especially in Asia and Latin America. And it now has production centres across the world: Spain France Germany Brazil South Korea and more.

“They’re in these regions they have access to the talent they have the partnerships” says Alexander. “And these are places where Disney and Warner and NBC and Viacom all are going to want to be in but [those companies] are still building up their presence in the United States and Canada. So it feels like they’re playing two different games at this point: everyone is going to wind up wanting to be a global player but one of the only real global players right now is Netflix.”

We’ve come a long way from Lilyhammer. One key difference between Netflix and its rivals is that it is not part of any larger media or retail or hardware business. Netflix is just Netflix. It lives and dies by the popularity of its content. In theory therefore it has a deeper interest in giving us what we really want to watch. Although given the past 10 years it seems to have a better idea of what that is than we do ourselves.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9jZWxlYnJhdGluZy0xMC15ZWFycy1vZi1uZXRmbGl4LXNlcmllcy13aXRoLWxpbHloYW1tZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Celebrating 10 Years of Netflix Series With 'Lilyhammer',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/celebrating-10-years-of-netflix-series-with-lilyhammer on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9jZWxlYnJhdGluZy0xMC15ZWFycy1vZi1uZXRmbGl4LXNlcmllcy13aXRoLWxpbHloYW1tZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMDIvMDYvZG9udC1taXNzLWZlcmlhLW9uZS1vZi1uZXRmbGl4cy1iZXN0LWhvcnJvci1zaG93cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't Miss 'Feria' One Of Netflix's Best Horror Shows,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/02/06/dont-miss-feria-one-of-netflixs-best-horror-shows/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMDIvMDYvZG9udC1taXNzLWZlcmlhLW9uZS1vZi1uZXRmbGl4cy1iZXN0LWhvcnJvci1zaG93cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvdGVkLXNhcmFuZG9zLWxpbHloYW1tZXItZGVjYWRlLW5ldGZsaXgtb3JpZ2luYWwtc2VyaWVzLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXByZW1pZXJlLTEyMzQ5MjcyMDgv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9kZWFkbGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi90ZWQtc2FyYW5kb3MtbGlseWhhbW1lci1kZWNhZGUtbmV0ZmxpeC1vcmlnaW5hbC1zZXJpZXMtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktcHJlbWllcmUtMTIzNDkyNzIwOC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ted Sarandos Marks Decade Of Netflix Original Series On Anniversary Of ‘Lilyhammer’ Premiere,"On Feb 6 2012 Lilyhammer starring The Sopranos and E Street Band’s Stevie Van Zandt marked the first original series to premiere on Netflix and introduced the binge model of releasing full TV seasons at once. The streamer’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos marked the anniversary with an essay posted on Netflix’s Web site and a video chat with Van Zandt in which the two reminisce about how the show got on Netflix and its legacy.

There is an asterisk to Lilyhammer‘s place in Netflix’s history. As Sarandos and Van Zandt admit in the video House Of Cards was the first original series ordered by Netflix in a mega deal that shook up Hollywood. It was that news that prompted Van Zandt to seek a meeting with Sarandos. At the time Lilyhammer already had a completed first season so Netflix acquired a finished show that leapfrogged House Of Cards to the air. (Lilyhammer also makes for a more straight-forward celebration and a far less awkward conversation than a video chat with that series’ star Kevin Spacey.)

Both Sarandos and Van Zandt acknowledged the symbolism in the fact that Netflix’s first original was a local Norwegian production featuring subtitles. The streamer went on to make local production a cornerstone of its global expansion taking non-English shows mainstream and turning series such as Lupin Money Heist and Squid Game into global hits.

Read Sarandos’ note and watch the video below. In the chat Sarandos also skewers Hollywood’s penchant for remaking non-American fare — even when it’s in English — and there is an amusing parallel to today with both Sarandos and Van Zandt chuckling to the latter’s comment how Netflix’s stock price was down at the time it was entering original scripted programming with Lilyhammer.

Celebrating 10 Years of Netflix

Series With ‘Lilyhammer’

By Ted Sarandos Co-CEO Netflix

When you think about Netflix’s first original series what do you think of? The White House? The Litchfield Correctional Institute… Nope not those. Our actual first original series was Lilyhammer and today February 6 marks the 10th anniversary of its historic Netflix premiere.

A seminal moment in Netflix history began in a recording studio by the North Sea. Bergen is where Norwegian creators Eilif Skodvin and Anne Bjørnstad approached Stevie Van Zandt about a show they wrote for him set in a small Norwegian town called Lillehammer. A few months later having heard that Netflix was looking for original content I got a call directly from Stevie who wanted to send us the series. I asked if we could read the scripts and Stevie said “Scripts? I can send you the whole season.” We watched it and we loved it. I thought it was a classic fish-out-of-water story with Stevie playing a role loved by audiences and the interplay between his no-nonsense hitman Frank Tagliano and the gentle community around him made for some great comedy. It was a character that was so familiar in a culture that few audiences had seen. I wasn’t sure what would come from that first phone call with Stevie. I was (am) a huge fan of his music and I loved him in The Sopranos so I was happy just to get to talk to him for a few minutes.

In his new book Unrequited Infatuations Stevie said that the call led to the best business meeting of his life – which was when we got together in person. I remember that Stevie was a much better actor and musician than he was a salesman; he would humbly describe the show as “different odd quirky sometimes it’s in English and sometimes it has subtitles…” almost like he was trying to talk me out of it. What he didn’t know was that we had already watched the episodes and were in love with the show. We agreed to buy it and commission a second season not knowing that Norwegian TV shows mostly only ran for one season and usually took long hiatuses between seasons if they did return. We worked out a deal.

The meeting was great and Stevie loved every idea except one. When I told him that we would not be showing the episodes one per week we would deliver the entire season all at once. That stopped him in his tracks. “You labor and suffer and someone can watch a year of your work in one night? That sounds a little weird” he said. “It’s not weird” I told him. “It’s just like working on an album.” He laughed and agreed.

After first airing on Norwegian broadcast TV NRK on Jan. 25 2012 we debuted Lilyhammer on Netflix Feb. 6 2012 offering all eight episodes to our members in the US Canada and Latin America (followed by the UK Ireland and the Nordics later that year). This was the first time we streamed a show across multiple countries and languages…and it worked.

Looking back Lilyhammer was perhaps an unorthodox choice for our first show. But it worked because it was a deeply local story that we could share with the world. The jokes and references worked locally and the more universal themes of the shows traveled perfectly.

Since then we’ve seen so many great local stories resonate with people in other countries and from other cultures: shows and films set anywhere and told in any language. Lilyhammer was the forebearer of so many great shows to come – Dark Desire and Who Killed Sara? from Mexico La Casa de Papel from Spain The Rain and The Chestnut Man from Denmark Dark and Barbarians from Germany Lupin from France Sacred Games from India and of course most recently Squid Game from Korea our biggest show ever.

But the first always will be Lilyhammer.

Thank you Lilyhammer and Stevie Van Zandt for starting this incredible ten-year journey. It’s always hard to predict what’s to come in the next ten but one thing is certain: we’ll have many more great stories from anywhere that can be loved everywhere.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9kYXlicmVhay1uZXRmbGl4LXNob3ctem9tYmllcy1hcG9jYWx5cHNlLTEyMzQ2OTU2OTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Daybreak': Netflix Show Had Fresh Spin on Zombies and the Apocalypse,"[This post originally appeared as part of Recommendation Machine IndieWire’s daily TV picks feature.]

Where to Watch ‘Daybreak‘: Netflix

Part of what made “Daybreak” an enjoyable season of TV is that it mostly put its zombies in the background. The Netflix adaptation of the Brian Ralph graphic novel certainly had other things on its mind: fourth-wall breaks telestrated maps and a few other devices noted here. It’s set in a not-too-distant world where a sophisticated explosive bioweapon has targeted adults leaving kids unaffected (unless you count the destruction of buildings and the layer of washed-out permadust covering nearly everything in sight). In “Daybreak” the only zombies are the former parents and teachers and authority figures grown people reduced to muttering “ghoulies” who just amble around muttering unless they’re provoked.

If the high-school characters in “Daybreak” see themselves as the star of their own story it’s because they’re pretty much right. But for a world without parents “Anna” this most definitely is not.

It’s even more baffling in retrospect that a high school story like this one with rival groups trying to control territory in the post-nuclear explosion wastelands of Glendale didn’t get more of a Netflix boost. Maybe splitting the difference between survival tale and supersized meta teen comedy left both potential audiences underserved leading Netflix to cancel the series in late 2019 mere months after it was released. But it’s also disappointing knowing that balance is what made the show worth watching in the first place.

Your narrator and guide through the irradiated remains of the eastern LA neighborhood is Josh Wheeler (Colin Ford) a handsome loner trudging around the surroundings of his old high school in search of his girlfriend Sam (Sophie Simnett) missing since a series of bombs leveled most of LA proper. At the start of the series he quickly crosses path with Wesley Fists (Austin Crude) a former athlete and current samurai enthusiast and Sam’s pyro younger sister Angelica (Alyvia Alyn Lind). Their trio forms the backbone of the series with the show passing narrative duties between the three of them like a nuked hot potato.

“Daybreak” is coy with some of these characters’ backstory details (though after a rewatch of the pilot the clues are all pretty much there if you know where to look) but a majority of the show is not concerned with mystery. If there are discoveries to be made the varied purposely frenetic pace of the details being hurled the audience’s way keeps things moving even when its characters are stuck. Sure there’s dialogue that could be too cutesy and referential to some but overall maintains a pretty impressive balance. After almost two full season’s worth of “Euphoria” it actually slides nicely into a retroactive hybrid parody-homage mode.

That momentum gets carried along by a structure that feeds the idea that there’s never a guarantee of what’s coming next. Even though the show is clearly drawing on film references (a “Fury Road” rig that swaps in the “Monday Night Football” theme for the Doof Warrior breezy rom-com montages that play out in flashbacks the very presence of Matthew Broderick) the “[fill in the blank]-hour movie” approach isn’t the road that “Daybreak” opts for. These teenagers may be discovering the consequences of responsibilities yet “Daybreak” finds a certain freedom in not having to be locked in to a specific location or POV.

There’s the overall feeling that “Daybreak” is deliciously putting its cake on a grand pedestal and chowing down on it like one of the ravenous parents these teens are trying to avoid. As the principal of what used to be the local high school Broderick is playing on his public persona like a virtuoso on a vintage instrument. Ford takes the “Ferris Bueller” DNA (this show had the crown before “South Side” grabbed it last year) and adds in his own brand of charm. Crute’s moment in the spotlight might be the season’s best episode. The parade of other kids caught up in this web of outliving and outlasting is dotted with memorable performances like Jeanté Godlock’s who makes for a perfect second-in-command in the powerful army of jocks.

You can find a spoiler-filled discussion of some Season 2 plans and inklings that never came to fruition here. For now “Daybreak” still exists as the perfect zombie story palate cleanser one that used a different set of weapons to fight the undead.

Yes the entire country's. The hacker who goes by the handle P4x says that he launched the campaign as retaliation for the Hermit Kingdom's hacks of Western security researchers last year. Frustrated by the lack of US response he took it upon himself to send a message.

In another exclusive we published internal messages from Trickbot the notorious Russian cybercrime gang that sheds new light on the group's organizational structure. The exchanges several of which took place amid a sustained ransomware assault against hundreds of US hospitals also bring Trickbot's ruthlessness ambition and sense of impunity into sharp focus.

Over in China the Winter Olympics start this week meaning you can indulge in your quadrennial biathlon obsession. Multiple countries have warned their athletes to bring burner phones to the games in light of the host country's record of aggressive surveillance; participants have also been informed that speaking out against China's human rights abuses against the Uyghur population could spark retaliation.

We also took a look at how concerned you should really be about the kernel-level anti-cheat systems that game developers have increasingly turned to. And in 2022 expect more cyberattacks to have real-world consequences a troubling inevitability as criminal groups become ever more aggressive.

Decentralized finance systems promise to do away with the intermediaries that slow down or complicate transactions. A major hack of a major DeFi protocol this week though underscores that the future of money comes with its own set of risks. Attackers targeting Wormhole which offers a bridge between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains for cross-chain transactions made off with $320 million in various cryptocurrencies. It's the second-biggest known DeFi theft of all time after a hacker stole $610 million from Poly Network only to return the bulk of it eventually. There's no sign that Wormhole will be quite so lucky.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that its parent company News Corp had been the victim of a hack that exposed journalist emails and more. The WSJ itself was affected along with the New York Post Dow Jones and News Corp's UK news organization. The company enlisted cybersecurity firm Mandiant to assist with the aftermath of the attack. Mandiant says the hackers were “likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China’s interests.”

Will no one think of the crisps? The Conti ransomware group hit KP Snacks this week potentially disrupting the availability of Hula Hoops Skips Wheat Crunchies Nik Naks Butterkist McCoy's and more delightfully named UK treats. It's not clear if KP Snacks plans to pay the ransom or has engaged with Conti at all but shortages could last deep into March.

Elsewhere in European ransomware attacks multiple oil suppliers and ports throughout Belgium the Netherlands and Germany were stymied by malware likely from the BlackCat and Conti criminal groups. Shell had to reroute supplies and terminals in Germany were left unable to meet obligations. While the attacks all focused on the same sector government officials this week said that they don't believe they're related.

Photo courtesy of Cost Plus Drug Company. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has launched a new online pharmacy that offers more than 100 generic medications.

Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company offers the products at what company officials say is a fraction of costs that consumers currently pay.

The online pharmacy does not accept insurance so it’s a cash-payment venture.

A consumer advocate points out however that the new online pharmacy so far has no limited options and doesn’t offer brand name drugs. Mark Cuban is feeling disruptive. Again. This time he’s got his sights set on the cost of prescription drugs. Cuban the billionaire investor owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and panelist on the television show “Shark Tank” has launched an online pharmacy for generic medications. The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company will give consumers substantial discounts on various medicines according to the company’s website. “Not everyone sets the goal of being the lowest cost producer and provider” Cuban told Axios. “My goal” Cuban added “is to make a profit while maximizing impact.”

How it will work Cuban says Cost Plus Drug which will compete with such pharmacy giants as Rite Aid Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. is organized to eliminate pharmacy benefit managers from the equation. Those are the people who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of large employers health insurers and others. These middle managers are considered the quiet lesser-known partner in the pharmaceutical model. They’ve been criticized for what critics say is a lack of transparency about the rebates they receive and for keeping a large portion of cost savings from consumers. Cuban’s company’s refusal to pay spread prices to third-party pharmacy benefit managers prohibits it from processing insurance claims. So the online pharmacy is a cash-payment venture. Consumers will have access to more than 100 generic medications at prices Cost Plus Drug officials say are often less than what insurance plans’ deductible and copay requirements would total. Cuban says he wants to bring transparency to the generic drug pricing process and pass on a greater percentage of the savings to the customers. The company will buy directly from third-party suppliers and soon manufacture its own products. An $11 million 22000-square-foot factory in Dallas is expected to be ready to roll by the end of the year. The company will sell at a discount with a 15 percent markup plus a $3 pharmacist fee.

A consumer advocate responds Lucia Mueller is vice president of operations and communications at PharmacyChecker a company that helps people find the lowest prices on prescription medication among licensed U.S. and international pharmacies.

Up and running Cost Plus Drug is already in business as an online pharmacy selling more than 100 medications including for asthma heart failure and Parkinson’s disease to mental health allergies and cancer.

Yes the entire country's. The hacker who goes by the handle P4x says that he launched the campaign as retaliation for the Hermit Kingdom's hacks of Western security researchers last year. Frustrated by the lack of US response he took it upon himself to send a message.

In another exclusive we published internal messages from Trickbot the notorious Russian cybercrime gang that sheds new light on the group's organizational structure. The exchanges several of which took place amid a sustained ransomware assault against hundreds of US hospitals also bring Trickbot's ruthlessness ambition and sense of impunity into sharp focus.

Over in China the Winter Olympics start this week meaning you can indulge in your quadrennial biathlon obsession. Multiple countries have warned their athletes to bring burner phones to the games in light of the host country's record of aggressive surveillance; participants have also been informed that speaking out against China's human rights abuses against the Uyghur population could spark retaliation.

We also took a look at how concerned you should really be about the kernel-level anti-cheat systems that game developers have increasingly turned to. And in 2022 expect more cyberattacks to have real-world consequences a troubling inevitability as criminal groups become ever more aggressive.

Decentralized finance systems promise to do away with the intermediaries that slow down or complicate transactions. A major hack of a major DeFi protocol this week though underscores that the future of money comes with its own set of risks. Attackers targeting Wormhole which offers a bridge between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains for cross-chain transactions made off with $320 million in various cryptocurrencies. It's the second-biggest known DeFi theft of all time after a hacker stole $610 million from Poly Network only to return the bulk of it eventually. There's no sign that Wormhole will be quite so lucky.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that its parent company News Corp had been the victim of a hack that exposed journalist emails and more. The WSJ itself was affected along with the New York Post Dow Jones and News Corp's UK news organization. The company enlisted cybersecurity firm Mandiant to assist with the aftermath of the attack. Mandiant says the hackers were “likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China’s interests.”

Photo courtesy of Cost Plus Drug Company. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has launched a new online pharmacy that offers more than 100 generic medications.

Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company offers the products at what company officials say is a fraction of costs that consumers currently pay.

The online pharmacy does not accept insurance so it’s a cash-payment venture.

A consumer advocate points out however that the new online pharmacy so far has no limited options and doesn’t offer brand name drugs. Mark Cuban is feeling disruptive. Again. This time he’s got his sights set on the cost of prescription drugs. Cuban the billionaire investor owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and panelist on the television show “Shark Tank” has launched an online pharmacy for generic medications. The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company will give consumers substantial discounts on various medicines according to the company’s website. “Not everyone sets the goal of being the lowest cost producer and provider” Cuban told Axios. “My goal” Cuban added “is to make a profit while maximizing impact.”

How it will work Cuban says Cost Plus Drug which will compete with such pharmacy giants as Rite Aid Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. is organized to eliminate pharmacy benefit managers from the equation. Those are the people who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of large employers health insurers and others. These middle managers are considered the quiet lesser-known partner in the pharmaceutical model. They’ve been criticized for what critics say is a lack of transparency about the rebates they receive and for keeping a large portion of cost savings from consumers. Cuban’s company’s refusal to pay spread prices to third-party pharmacy benefit managers prohibits it from processing insurance claims. So the online pharmacy is a cash-payment venture. Consumers will have access to more than 100 generic medications at prices Cost Plus Drug officials say are often less than what insurance plans’ deductible and copay requirements would total. Cuban says he wants to bring transparency to the generic drug pricing process and pass on a greater percentage of the savings to the customers. The company will buy directly from third-party suppliers and soon manufacture its own products. An $11 million 22000-square-foot factory in Dallas is expected to be ready to roll by the end of the year. The company will sell at a discount with a 15 percent markup plus a $3 pharmacist fee.

A consumer advocate responds Lucia Mueller is vice president of operations and communications at PharmacyChecker a company that helps people find the lowest prices on prescription medication among licensed U.S. and international pharmacies. They describe themselves as the only independent company monitoring and verifying the credentials of international online pharmacies and comparing prices of the prescription drugs available from these licensed pharmacies.

NEE,NextEra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsYWdzdGFmZmJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20vZGVsaXZlcmluZy1wb3dlci1mcm9tLWFyaXpvbmFzLWxhcmdlc3Qtd2luZC1mYXJtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delivering Power from Arizona’s Largest Wind Farm,"Salt River Project is contracting with a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources to purchase wind power from the Babbitt Ranch Energy Center a 161-megawatt (MW) wind resource to be built on the CO Bar Ranch about 25 miles north of Flagstaff.

With some 53 wind turbines across 669 acres the project is scheduled to begin delivering clean energy on to SRP’s power grid by December 2023 producing enough power to support about 40000 residential homes and moving the utility company closer to its short- and long-term carbon-free goals.

“We will have nearly 50% of our power coming from zero-carbon resources by 2025” said SRP Spokesperson Erica Sturwold. The utility has stated its commitment to cutting its carbon fuel production from 2005 levels by 65% by 2035 and by 90% by 2050.

“Wind power from this project will bring more diversity to our resource mix which is growing rapidly in clean energy generation” said SRP Chief Strategy Corporate Services and Sustainability Executive Kelly Barr. “Furthermore utility-scale wind power is a great complement to solar power generation as wind often blows at times when the sun is not shining.”

Babbitt Ranches has been exploring renewable energy viability in Northern Arizona since 2005 measuring wind speeds and conducting solar power evaluations. In 2010 the land company signed agreements with NextEra to explore locations on the ranch. A decade of environmental studies followed.

“It is phenomenal to consider that Babbitt Ranches became part of Arizona’s agriculture industry with 860 head of cattle just 136 years ago and now is the site of diverse and co-existing efforts including renewable energy generation climate change studies landscape-scale conservation and space exploration along with ranching” said President and General Manager Billy Cordasco. “Our relatives believed in a land use ethic from the beginning a forged ethic that continues to be at the heart of the Babbitt family and owners’ decisions regarding Babbitt Ranches operations.”

Meanwhile this latest action represents SRP’s newest wind contract. “We are very pleased to continue working with SRP to deliver low-cost clean renewable energy to its customers” said NextEra Energy Resources Senior Vice President of Development Matt Handel. “The Babbitt Ranch Energy Center will also create a significant economic stimulus for the local community creating good jobs and millions in additional tax revenue.”

The project seven-and-a-half miles southeast of Valle is expected to create an estimated 250 jobs during the construction phase scheduled to start this year and four to six full-time management positions through the wind farm’s 30-year life.

SRP was the first utility in Arizona to add wind power to its energy resource mix and continues to receive all energy output from the 127-MW Dry Lake Wind Power Project near Heber which was the first large-scale wind power facility built in the state.

With the Phoenix metropolitan area growing three times the national average SRP officials say new generation resources are needed to help meet the rising energy demand from customers and support the utility’s long-term decarbonization goals.

In June 2020 SRP issued a request for information (RFI) for up to 500 MW of wind resources. Following that process and discussions with NextEra as well as other developers SRP determined the proposed Babbitt Ranch Wind Farm would be the most viable wind project that would be commercially operational within the required timeline to meet the growing demand.

“When I learned we would be receiving power from a wind farm on Babbitt Ranches it made perfect sense” said SRP Vice President John Hoopes. “Almost every cowboy I have ever met at one point or another worked for the Babbitts and commented about the constant wind they experienced while working on that ranch.”

NextEra the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and the sun also is proposing a solar farm and battery storage facility for the Babbitt Ranch Energy Center.

“Back in the 1990s the Babbitt family and Babbitt Ranches owners articulated a fresh vision for the future of these lands to specifically include agriculture conservation and scientific discovery” said Cordasco. “We couldn’t be more thrilled than to participate with renewable energy and Arizona utility companies to support the state’s and the nation’s goals in becoming less dependent on fossil fuels. We are very focused on sustainability and succession and making wise decisions that support generations to come.”

Babbitt Ranches established in 1886 will be inducted into the Arizona Farming and Ranching Hall of Fame next month. (See related story on page 10.) QCBN

Peloton (PMCCF) Interactive Inc has drawn interest from potential buyers including e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) according to a person familiar with the matter as the exercise bike maker struggles to maintain pandemic-fueled growth.

Shares of Peloton surged 30% in extended trading on the news which comes days after activist investor Blackwells Capital urged the company’s board to put it up for sale.

Amazon is exploring an offer for Peloton and is speaking with advisers about whether and how to proceed a source said. Peloton has not yet decided whether it will explore a sale according to the source.

Meanwhile the Financial Times reported late on Friday that sportswear company Nike (NKE) is also evaluating a bid for Peloton citing people briefed on the matter who said the considerations are preliminary and Nike (NKE) has not held talks with Peloton.

Peloton and Nike did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment while Amazon declined to comment.

Peloton’s sales boomed during Covid-19 lockdowns with many snapping up home fitness equipment. But its fortunes began to fade as vaccinations increased gyms reopened and rivals offered competitive products.

In November it hinted that demand for its exercise bikes and treadmills was slowing faster than expected and its market capitalization since then has shrunk to about $8 billion from a peak of nearly $52 billion in early 2021.

If the stock’s gains hold on Monday Peloton could reach the $10 billion market-capitalization threshold.

Last week Blackwells Capital called on the board of Peloton to remove CEO John Foley immediately accusing him of deals that set high fixed costs and for holding on to excessive inventory while misleading investors about the need to raise capital.

Blackwells criticized Foley for hiring his wife as a key executive and committing to a 300000-square-foot 20-year lease for office space in New York among other things.

The investment firm run by Jason Aintabi has also urged the board to put the company up for sale to a buyer like Walt Disney (DIS) Co Apple (AAPL) Sony (SNE) Group or Nike Inc Reuters reported on Sunday.

Peloton has tried to cushion the blow to its growth by cutting the price of its popular bike and ramping up its ad spending but growth remains stagnant.

Last month Peloton said the company was reviewing the size of its workforce and “resetting” production levels following a report that it was temporarily halting production of connected fitness bikes and treadmills after a significant drop in demand.

While many investors have become frustrated with Peloton due to a steep drop in its share price analysts also note that the company may be a difficult acquisition target because of its two classes of stock effectively allowing insiders to control it.

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The growth in the fitness band market has prompted tech giants such as Apple and Samsung (SSNLF) to introduce features for health tracking including electrocardiogram and blood pressure sensor. Google (GOOG) closed its acquisition of fitness tracking company Fitbit (FIT) in January.

Tech giants including Amazon and Alphabet have also seen a rise in their valuation after blockbuster results this week.

While such a milestone would normally be marked by a star-studded inauguration event a fashion or artist collaboration or at the very least some social media coverage the opening was starkly understated. As local media described  it was hard to tell a new location had even been built without asking the staff.

But the desire to lay low is understandable considering the past year the Swedish clothing company has had. In March 2021 H&M landed in hot water after it was called out by the Community Youth League on Weibo for “spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton while making a big profit in China” becoming a symbol of foreigners meddling in Chinese affairs. Nike and Burberry soon joined this growing list of offenders after their statements on Xinjiang were recirculated online.

Unlike some clumsy marketing campaigns this was not a small faux paux. Seen as an attack on China the fallout was swift and severe — and a year later can still be felt to some extent. Looking at H&M Nike and Burberry how much did this consumer boycott really set them back? And what are the lessons for other brands navigating crises in the market?

Although many brands voiced their concerns over China’s alleged human rights abuses the fast fashion giant bore the brunt of the backlash. H&M was scrubbed off Taobao JD.com and Pinduoduo its app was delisted stores were wiped off online maps and about 20 physical locations were shut. In the three months to May H&M reported that sales in China fell 23 percent year-on-year — a staggering loss of 74 million. While the country was its fifth largest market in Q2 2021 it dropped out of the top ten the following quarter.

However H&M has pledged to “[regain] the trust and confidence” of its Chinese shoppers. While its eponymous label has quietly gone about business (it hasn’t posted on Weibo since September) the group has ramped up development of its more expensive brands. In fall 2021 ARKET known for its minimalist aesthetic and womenswear brand & Other Stories both opened their first brick-and-mortar stores in Beijing and Shanghai respectively. Prior to this the two had tested the waters by launching on Tmall attracting more than 1 million and 256000 fans respectively.

ARKET recently opened a café at its Beijing store solidifying its image as a higher-quality brand. Photo: ARKET's Weibo

But is expanding under a new guise enough? “There are reports saying some consumers still turned their back to the two brands having found their link to H&M which shows the brand still hasn’t been fully forgiven by Chinese consumers” said Arnold Ma founder of China-focused digital marketing agency Qumin .

“On the other hand the latter two have challenged the image of H&M as a ‘roughly-made’ fast fashion brand by providing better quality products at a higher price” he continued. “So the premiumization to some extent helps the two win over some Chinese consumers who pay more attention to quality and design.”

The world’s largest sportswear company was not spared from China’s ire either. Nike lost brand ambassador Wang Yibo was blurred out on local television programs and saw plummeting Tmall sales of 59 percent year-over-year in April although it still managed to make 1.9 billion in the market that quarter. But business has not quite returned to normal as evidenced by the 24 percent drop in China sales in Q2 2022.

Yet these numbers disguise Nike’s many wins. Even back in March Air Jordan 4 sneakers and Nike Dunk Lows were flying off virtual shelves. Thanks to its strong digital footprint the brand also boasted a successful Singles’ Day  garnering 70 million views on its livestreams gaining 13 million new members and defending its spot as the No. 1 sports brand on Tmall. At the same Nike has recruited more local influencers including basketball player Yang Shuyu sprinter Su Bingtian and snowboarder Cai Xuetong who have helped it regain credibility.

Nike has diversified its endorsements by teaming up with snowboarder Cai Xuetong (left) and sprinter Su Bingtian. Photo: Nike's Weibo

Given its 40 years in China Sarah Yam the co-founder of Red Digital  noted that “Nike still has a strong brand heritage in China and this is pretty hard to exceed right now.” She predicts it may be 20 years or so before a local sportswear player can overtake the Western titan.

Burberry similarly lost brand ambassadors and its collaboration with the popular video game “Honor of Kings” during the cotton crisis. However it managed to flip the script: On July 21 the British house announced that it would donate 1.5 million yuan and 50000 yuan worth of supplies to the Henan flood rescue efforts becoming the first foreign brand to donate. Netizens praised the unexpected move writing that they would “forever love Burberry.” In contrast when H&M and Nike followed suit netizens retorted they would not forget how the two had insulted China.

As such the famed trench coat maker stated that the Xinjiang issue had “relatively limited impact on business” with sales in the market surpassing pre-pandemic levels by over 55 percent in the March to July quarter. Building off this momentum Burberry continued driving engagement through the first half of the fiscal year by creating highly localized campaigns dedicated capsule collections and teaming up with local Chinese artists. To further bolster its image as a responsible corporate leader Burberry also partnered with local organizations to promote youth culture.

So when Burberry opened its new flagship store at Shanghai Plaza 66 in November it did not need to keep a low profile. Rather the brand blasted the news on social media racking up 18.2 million views on Weibo within five days. Sales have remained steady as well with Burberry most recently announcing that full-price comparable store sales in China had risen 37 percent .

While H&M Nike and Burberry have all pushed ahead in China they have done so to varying degrees of success. Burberry which has bounced back faster than the others has partially benefited from being a luxury brand. As Yam who has more than a decade of Chinese digital marketing experience said “It’s harder to replace — you don’t have another Burberry. For Nike [consumers] can find the China version Li-Ning which is popular in China now. And for H&M there’s so much fast fashion.”

More importantly Ma points out that Burberry has always remained neutral on politics. “Burberry has chosen to focus on non-politicized marketing while H&M has chosen to risk their China brand image in favor of improving their brand image among their global customer base.”

None of this is surprising as China accounts for less than 5 percent of H&M’s global revenue while Burberry’s China revenue accounts for almost half of their global total Ma noted. Indeed China is just one — albeit very important — market for these global companies. Recovery therefore not only entails reevaluating China tactics but also ensuring a strong global network for when a crisis eventually hits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzb25maXJlLmNvbS9uaWtlLXNiLWlzaG9kLXN1bW1pdC13aGl0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike SB Ishod Summit White DC7232-100,Ishod Wair’s Nike SB Ishod signature sneaker appears to take inspiration from past Nike SB models most notably to Nike SB Force 58.

Standardization is the key to a streamlined and efficient operating department and while an endless parade of one particular model may become a little monotonous for fans railroad accountants are in numbers’ heaven.

With that in mind we must to wonder the reasoning why some of these roster oddball diesel locomotives were brought into the system in the first place. For the most part the oddballs are good units but sharp-eyed lineside observers usually spot them as “out of place.” Here are some of our favorites.

No. 1: St. Louis Southwestern GP7 320 later renumbered to 304

Seems like everybody had a GP7 or a GP9 on the roster back in the day but here’s an oddball diesel locomotive if ever there was one. St. Louis Southwestern better known as Cotton Belt was controlled by Southern Pacific for decades. What was good for SP was usually considered appropriate for SSW. Yet in 1950 the smaller railroad purchased a single 1500-hp EMD GP7 with a steam generator for backup passenger assignments. The company even painted it in Daylight red and orange to match its other unique purchase a 1500-hp EMD FP7. Both started out life in the then-in-vogue passenger colors. In the late 1950s it was repainted in SP’s standard black-widow paint scheme and eventually the more utilitarian red and gray. Its steam generator was also history at this point.

The unit stayed on Cotton Belt and SP’s Texas & New Orleans subsidiary operating in Texas and Louisiana until eventually being traded in for newer locomotives. Upgraded and rebuilt with a chopped nose it survived to operate on Mid-South Rail Corp. The other Cotton Belt oddity their FP7 was sent west to work the San Francisco commuter operation until its ultimate retirement.

No. 2: Southern Pacific GE 70-ton end-cab switchers

Leave it to General Electric to perfect the ultimate low-horsepower lightweight end-cab switcher ideal for shortline and industrial railroads with less-than-ideal right-of-way and wanting an easy-to-maintain locomotive. And leave it to giant Southern Pacific to have the largest fleet of them in the country at 21.

SP like many other railroads in the early stages of dieselization would specify particular locomotives to replace similar steam locomotives. A prime case were these 70 tonners. Originally they could be found throughout the western part of the system scattered from El Paso west to Los Angeles south to San Diego and north to Oregon assigned to light-rail branch lines and subsidiaries. One even worked a scheduled mixed train in Arizona. Efficient and easy to maintain many were on the roster into the late ’70s.

The little units could be seen on other Class I railroads as well including a pair on the Southern that were inherited when that railroad absorbed the original Norfolk Southern.

No. 3: Southern’s six EMD GP39Xs

Here’s a rarity. Southern picked up the only six 2600-hp GP39X units built in 1980 complete with that railroad’s usual high-short-hood option. After Southern became part of Norfolk Southern they were upgraded by EMD to GP49 standards in 1982. Successful enough to stay on the roster until 2001 these oddball diesel locomotives were upgraded again this time their high noses cut down to standard low-nose configuration and had head-end power equipment installed. Now classified as GP49PH-3s they went to work for Florida’s Tri-Rail commuter agency.

No. 4: Southern NW5 2100

Among the switcher variants offered by EMD immediately after World War II was the NW5 a 1000-hp light road-switcher equipped with a steam generator in the short hood. Alco Lima and Baldwin cataloged similar units. A total of 13 were built between 1946 and 1947.

Ten went to Great Northern a pair went to Union Belt of Detroit and Southern picked up a lone unit. It spent most of its time working the New Orleans passenger station and according to more than one area enthusiast was the one Southern unit you just had to make the pilgrimage to Louisiana to see.

Unlike many roster oddballs Southern 2100 survives today on the Massachusetts Central Railroad. For those who want to see one firsthand elsewhere one is in Duluth Minn. as part of the Lake Superior Railroad Museum collection and one of the Detroit units lettered Fort Street Union Depot is on display at the Florida Railroad Museum in Parrish Fla.

No. 5: MKT U23Bs – the only ‘modern’ GEs on the roster

For a smaller Class I Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad rostered an amazing variety of diesel locomotive models from a number of builders. In the 1960s through the ’80s it purchased a variety of EMD four-axle road-switchers — and intermixed with them was a trio of General Electric U23Bs in the ’70s.

A good locomotive nonetheless the three were seemingly out of place on the Katy which by that time had either re-engined most of its non-EMD products or scrapped them in an attempt at uniformity.

No. 6: Rock Island AB6s

If you’re a Rock Island fan the railroad’s two EMC AB6 six-axle passenger locomotives may not be a surprise to you. But for the rest of us they were truly odd units.

Two were built specifically for the road’s Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger train operating between Chicago and Colorado. I say Colorado because westbound trains would split at Limon Colo. with part of it destined for Denver the other to Colorado Springs. The reverse would happen eastbound with the two segments meeting at Limon to become one train.

When railroads were still concerned about how their passenger trains looked and the thought of streamlined passenger locomotives m.u.’d nose-to-rear elephant-style was abhorrent one answer was the AB6 a B unit with a fully functioning cab pilot and headlight. The unit a derivate of the standard E6 design originally had a baggage compartment replacing the standard second 1000-hp 567 prime mover. Later the baggage area was removed and a second prime mover installed. Both eventually wound up in the Rock Island’s Chicago-area commuter fleet and lasted into the mid-’70s before being scrapped.

No. 7: Southern Pacific M-K TE70-4S

Southern Pacific was always looking for more efficient motive power. In that quest it turned to Morrison-Knudsen of Boise Idaho to produce a quartet of 2800-hp test beds to try out the promising Swiss-designed Sulzer 12ASV 25/30 V-12 four-stroke turbocharged prime mover. What rolled out of the builder’s bays in 1978 was this group of units utilizing retired GE U25B carcasses as a starting point. Stories of railroad mechanics dreading working on them abound as they were complex machines to maintain. The railroad tested them around the West Coast and finally sent them to the Oregon freight pool where most of the time they sat out of service. They were off the roster by the mid-’80s last spotted in a scrap yard in Oakland. The units came painted in a unique red-and-orange scheme which promptly earned them the nickname “Popsicles.”

No. 8: Metrolink EMD E8A

Before Metrolink — the Southern California Regional Rail Authority – became an operating entity a short demonstration trainset was assembled to show off what the new commuter agency trains would look like.

Some of the Bombardier commuter cars had arrived but the initial order for EMD F59 diesel locomotives was still under construction. In the interim enterprising officials located a retired EMD E8A passenger locomotive that at one time worked for Chicago & North Western. It was languishing in a Southern California scrapyard. Repainted and lettered the unit and a pair of cars made the rounds throughout the area. When operations officially began in October 1992 the cars joined the rest of the new fleet in service. The E8A disappeared presumably back to the scrap yard from whence it came.

No. 9: A Union Pacific not-so-Big Boy

Here’s the ringer in our list. Commonly found on industrial and small switching operations requiring diminutive locomotives to traverse tight curves and light rail Union Pacific employed this 3-foot-gauge 0-4-0 saddletanker as a Pocatello Idaho tie-plant switcher. At the end of its life the little tea kettle was presumably cut up on the spot. Apparently as a piece of maintenance-of-way equipment it had the status of any other vehicle; when it was used up or its job no longer necessary it was removed from the roster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvc2luZ2VyLW9saXZpYS1yb2RyaWdvLW5hbWVkLWJpbGxib2FyZC1zLTIwMjItd29tYW4tb2YtdGhlLXllYXIvYXJ0aWNsZV85ZGJkMzhhZS0wYWY2LTVkMjEtOTUxZS02NzFmOTBjNDc0N2MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singer Olivia Rodrigo named Billboard's 2022 'Woman of the Year',A man shot a would-be thief who was spotted trying to steal his car after he left it running in his driveway early Monday according to police and KIRO-TV.

Something went wrong please try again later.

Concerns have repeatedly been raised over recent years about a crisis-hit health trust on Teesside.

Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust (TEWV) provide patients with mental health learning disabilities and autism services.

Earlier this week the trust was once again told to make improvements by Teesside and Hartlepool's Senior Coroner.

During the inquest of the trust's late patient Leslie Charles Dickons Clare Bailey concluded that more work needed to be carried out.

Teesside Coroner's Court heard how Mr Dickons who was suffering from mental illness after being diagnosed with mouth cancer died at his home in Nunthorpe Middlesbrough after stabbing himself in the chest.

The inquest heard how his partner Nichola Bernadette Foster contacted the trust asking for him to be hospitalised and was told he was to be cared for in the community.

Sadly the business owner is not the only patient who has passed away while under the care of TEWV.

There have been repeated calls for for a public inquiry into the alleged failures at the trust following a series of deaths.

Calls have come from families of patients and campaigners as well as most recently Cllr Luke Frost.

Earlier this month Thornaby councillor Ray Godwin who spent almost 30 years working for the trust revealed how he he blew the whistle on troubles at secure mental health facilities on Teesside.

He left the organisation in October last year and flagged up failings and problems on TEWV's forensic wards to watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

The watchdog visited the trust’s secure settings last summer after it had been made aware of problems ""including unsafe staffing numbers and poor culture within the service"".

While inspectors noted work on trying to improve the trust was taking place the CQC rated services on the forensic wards inadequate - with low staffing levels affecting the quality of care provided to patients.

Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald previously said he had ""lost confidence"" in TEWV after the CQC highlighted that patients at Roseberry Park hospital and other mental health wards were not being kept safe.

The CQC also closed the trust's troubled children's mental health units at West Lane hospital in Middlesbrough in 2019 after inspectors uncovered numerous failings.

West Lane which had since been taken over by another trust and renamed Acklam Road hospital was severely criticised by the families of patients who died at the hospital.

Brent Kilmurray chief executive at the trust said: ""We fully accept that improvements must be made.

""Some have been implemented already and some will take time to make the impact we need. We are absolutely determined to deliver the necessary changes to provide the best possible care for the people in our services.

""We are a large trust serving a region with a unique set of social and economic challenges.

""The whole of the UK is seeing an upsurge in demand for mental health services but it is particularly acute in our area.

""Any death is a tragedy and our staff are saving lives every day. However we must improve and we will.""

Below we remember some of the patients who have sadly passed away while under the care of TEWV:

Leslie Charles Dickons

The 67-year-old who ran Engineering Installations Limited was found lying face down on the kitchen floor with a knife in his chest by his partner of 34 years Nichola Bernadette Foster at the home they shared in Nunthorpe.

An inquest into his death heard how he carried out the attack on himself while his partner went outside to the garage at their home in Mickleby Close to get some eggs.

Teesside Coroners' Court heard how Les had been suffering from mental illness after being diagnosed with mouth cancer and had visited James Cook University Hospital in the town for help twice in one day.

The four-day inquest sitting a Teesside Magistrates' Court heard how Les was so ill that he told medics he had murdered his partner that he could transmit radiation and he believe people were watching him.

Les who ran Engineering Installations Limited was initially kept in hospital before undergoing an assessment under the mental health act which suggested he could be treated at home.

Consultant psychiatrist Dr Alan Gemski of Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust diagnosed Les with acute and transient psychotic disorder and created a care plan for him.

The inquest heard how Les' health deteriorated two days after he was discharged from the hospital when he was told by his GP that his cancer had returned but could be treated with an operation.

Nichola told the court how her partner refused to get out of the car for two-and-a-half hours and she later rang the trust for help telling them that he needed to be hospitalised.

During her evidence she told Coroner Bailey how she was told by a nurse: ""Les has been assessed twice and it's been decided the best place for Les is at home.

Sharon Salvin Head of Nursing for Teesside at Tees Esk Wear Valley told the inquest on how a serious investigation was carried out following the death and a number changes had been made which included extra training.

The coroner said there had clearly been a considerable about of reflection and learning by the trust but that they could benefit from further work.

She told the trust that they must be satisfied that staff are managing or need extra support that staff are aware of unconscious bias within the team and home visits are undertaken.

Coroner Bailey asked them to get back to her about the changes within 28 days.

She recorded that Les died by suicide.

Elizabeth Moody Director of Nursing at the trust said: ""Our hearts go out to Leslie’s family during this incredibly difficult time.

""We completed a detailed review of Leslie’s care after his death in 2019 and identified areas of learning.

""We take on board the inquest findings as we continually strive to improve our services.""

Alison Danks (also known as Alison Bishop)

The 39-year-old disappeared from her home in Marske on May 22 2020 following a long mental health battle.

Her disappearance sparked a number of police appeals to try find her and witnesses were asked to come forward.

Alison's body was found almost a month later on a beach at Grimston in East Yorkshire.

An inquest into her death heard how she had previously been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder depression anxiety and suffered with paranoid thoughts.

She was under an intensive home plan with TEWV which included increasing her medication and supportive telephone calls.

Teesside Coroners' Court heard how police were called to reports Alison - who they identified as a vulnerable woman - trying to board a navy vessel at Teesport hours before her disappearance.

Witnesses said she was trying to make it to Spain 'to meet a spiritual leader' leading to concerns about her welfare.

Alison who ran animal business Pet Care Solutions in Marske was taken home and despite appearing mentally unwell was left alone by the trust's crisis team.

Jane O'Neil adult crisis service manager for TEWV in Teesside told the inquest there were 'lapses in Alison's care' and said plans were in place to ensure better treatment.

Coroner Bailey said: ""Alison was a lady who suffered with her mental health. She received a lot of support from her former husband and family and a lot of support by friends and neighbours. It is clear mental health services endeavoured to help Alison.

""I recognise she suffered with the bereavement of her father and break down of her marriage. Sadly she also was a lady who didn't always comply with medication.

""She did turn to mental health services for assistance but it is noteworthy there were errors and lapses in some support. However I am reassured the trust recognises the lapses and errors and should such a situation happen again the approach would be different and further questions would be asked.""

Elspeth Devanney acting director of operations Teesside at Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust added: ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Alison during this incredibly sad time.

""We have carried out a comprehensive review of Alison’s care and have taken action to address the concerns that were raised.""

Lauren Bostock

The 28-year-old mum was found dead at her home in Ingleby Barwick Stockton on June 8 2020.

An inquest into her death heard how the tragedy occurred after a year of difficulties which included issues with her mental health care and a 'dreadful' court summons process.

Teesside Coroners' Court heard how Lauren was arrested on suspicion of drug-driving after a road accident in December 2019 and tests later revealed she had cannabis in her system.

The hearing heard how the police officer dealing with the case wrongly told her that she would not be prosecuted.

A family member said his call to say there would be no further action had lifted ""a huge weight off her shoulders"".

But then shortly before her death Lauren was told this was a mistake and she would in fact be facing court proceedings.

The previous day an ex-partner had found a white substance in her kitchen and took it to Stokesley Police Station.

The court heard it was likely she had been deeply concerned about it how it all could affect her custody of her children.

Lauren's loved ones attending the hearing were also told about previous gaps in her care by TEWV.

The inquest heard how she had been known to mental health services since 2017.

From 2019 Lauren had struggled with traits of a personality disorder substance misuse and a relationship breakdown. She also suffered from chronic back pain.

Sharon Davison from the trust who carried out a review after Lauren's death said there were long gaps between her care in 2019 when she ""effectively fell through the net"".

Assistant Coroner Karin Welsh recorded that Lauren died as a result of suicide.

She said she was unable to come to the conclusion on the balance of probability that Lauren's death could have been prevented had the issues with police and mental health care services not occurred.

But she said services were ""not what they should have been"".

Assistant Coroner Welsh said: ""The actions of the mental health service were not up to the standard that would have been wished for.

""And certainly the lack of communication regarding the summons for the offences was not as it should have been.""

Pamela Jane Brown

The 57-year-old tragically took her own life after a mental health hospital run by the trust “inadequately” assessed her risks.

An inquest into her death heard how Pamela from Redcar struggled with depression anxiety ""voices in her head and intrusive thoughts"".

The mum-of-one absconded from Roseberry Park Hospital in Middlesbrough on September 20 2019 - two weeks after she was detained under the Mental Health Act.

The tragedy came after a catalogue of serious incidents and suicide attempts by Pamela who worked for the Department for Work and Pensions over a six-week period.

The civil servant's body was sadly located at the bottom of Huntcliff Saltburn around five hours after she escaped from the hospital while on an unescorted “walk”.

An investigation was launched by the TEWV following her sudden death and found there were 11 care and service delivery problems.

The root cause of the review confirmed the formulation of Mrs Brown’s risk was ""inadequate"" and there were no contributory factors.

A jury returned a verdict after hearing all of the evidence at Teesside Coroners' Court in Middlesbrough.

A foreperson told .Assistant Coroner Jo Wharton: ""At the time of her death Pamela Brown was a formal patient at Roseberry Park Hospital. The overall formulation of risk was inadequate and resulted in Pamela taking her own life.""

Ann Marshall deputy director of nursing at Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said: ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Pamela’s family and friends and we remain desperately sorry for their loss.

""We note and accept the inquest findings which reflect the outcome of a review the trust carried out following Pamela’s death in 2019.

""This review led directly to significant improvements including in clinical risk management processes training and engagement with carers and families.

""We will continue to make improvements to our services particularly around training communication and the way we collaborate with patients families and carers when assessing clinical risk.""

Jennifer Brown

The 27-year-old known as Jenny had a number of prescription drugs in her system when she died at her home in Stockton.

An inquest into her death heard how she had moved to London and was studying for a law degree but struggled with her mental health. She was diagnosed with bipolar in 2012.

Teesside Coroner's Court heard how Jenny returned to Teesside and her ""mental health fluctuated from time to time"".

She had been receiving care from TEWV at the time of her death on April 3 2019.

Ben Smith locality manager at Stockton mental health services which is run by TEWV gave evidence during the inquest via video link.

He said Jenny had received five assessments beginning in 2014 but highlighted a number of ""missed opportunities"" in providing care.

Mr Smith said the trust's investigation found there was not a care plan in place and this was a contributory factor in her death.

He explained that she still received the services provided including help from psychiatrists therapies and medication but her care plan was not written down which would have been in line with the trust's policy.

The report also highlighted that next of kin details were not provided messages from A&E were not picked up by the team delivering her care and the team were not updated of Jenny's overdose on two occasions.

A post-mortem conducted by Dr Batterchargi found Jenny had a number of prescription drugs in her system at the time of her death.

However the level of codeine in her body was at the level associated with fatality. It was ruled that Jenny’s cause of death was multi-drug toxicity.

Assistant coroner Karin Welsh recorded a conclusion of misadventure saying: ""I don't think Jenny intended to take her own life that night"".

Dominic Gardner director of operations in Teesside for Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said: “We are truly saddened by Jenny's death and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this difficult time.

""We carried out a review of Jenny’s care and have taken action to address the findings from this.

""We’re incredibly sorry that the care Jenny received was not always of the highest standard.""

Zoe Zaremba

The 25-year-old was reported missing and tragically later found dead.

Zoe from Aiskew near Bedale in North Yorkshire disappeared on June 13 2020.

The police helicopter police dog units local Mountain Rescue and Rural Watch volunteers were involved in extensive searches to help locate her.

She was sadly found dead on June 21 2020.

Zoe had been receiving care from TEWV.

Her mum Jean Zaremba said she believes the care she received ultimately led to her untimely death.

She told BBC Look North: ""The worst thing Zoe ever did was go to mental health and ask for help because it's killed her.

""Mental health didn't seem to understand the autism and they put her on a protocol for a condition she did not have.""

Jean said her daughter had autism combined with trauma depressed mood and anxiety and had made several suicide attempts which her mother said were dismissed as game playing.

She claims the trust misdiagnosed Zoe with a personality disorder and she believes it made her condition worse.

Emily Moore

The 18-year-old from Shildon County Durham died on February 15 2020.

She had been a patient at West Lane Hospital in Middlesbrough before moving to Lanchester Road Hospital in Durham.

The teenager had spent just one week at Lancester Road Hospital before she lost her life.

Both hospitals are run by TEWV.

Emily was the third girl in a matter of months to die while living at the trust's mental health facilities.

She first encountered difficulties with her mental health when she was diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder.

Her dad David Moore 51 was so unhappy with her care he protested outside West Lane Hospital with a banner.

It read: ""This hospital is sending my child home to die. Shame on you TEWV.""

(Image: Teesside Live/Katie Lunn)

Mr Moore told Teesside Live that he believed she had taken her own life and said: ""I want answers.""

He said: """"I have always had concerns with the TEWV trust (but) because of where we live we have got to go with them.

""I'm devastated I'm let down I'm angry.

""She was wonderful brilliant bright intelligent everything was good but she thought more about others than herself sadly.""

An inquest into Emily's death was initially opened in 2020.

The hearing was set to go ahead at Crook Civic Centre in Crook County Durham in July last year but was adjourned.

Senior Coroner for County Durham and Darlington Jeremy Chipperfield said that although a report from NHS England was received further reports were needed.

Christie Anne Brayley (also known as Christie Anne Harnett)

The 17-year-old was found dead in a bathroom at West Lane Hospital after a two-year battle with mental health issues.

The teenager from Newton Aycliffe County Durham had been a patient at the hospital on and off in that time.

Her father Michael Harnett slammed the ""terrible"" care he believes she received.

He claimed she was illegally strip searched restrained and repeatedly sent home despite the family's concerns that she would self-harm.

Mr Harnett told Teesside Live : ""How on earth can she kill herself in a hospital environment like that that's meant to be helping her get better?

""She has managed to escape from the wards there's been lots of things she has managed to do that she should never have been doing.""

He explained how he often had to fight to get the hospital to keep Christie and stressed how she was ""really struggling"" when she went back into hospital on the day she died.

Her father says she'd had asked to have a bath during the ward handover and nobody was aware anything had happened until the tragic discovery was made.

Elizabeth Moody director of nursing and governance and deputy chief executive added: “Our thoughts are with Christie’s family and friends at this distressing time.

""It would be inappropriate for the trust to comment on the care and treatment of any individual.

""However we always carry out a full review when someone under our care dies so there will be a full investigation which will be carried out along with other agency partners.""

Nadia Sharif

(Image: Evening Gazette)

The 17-year-old should have been under 24-hour supervision at West Lane Hospital when she died of strangulation.

Nadia who had autism had been an in-patient at the hospital in Middlesbrough for three months.

Her devastated family said she was supposed to be supervised amid concerns she would harm herself.

Nadia who had three sisters and a brother was in an isolation room and managed to strangle herself on August 5 2019

She was taken from West Lane Hospital to James Cook University Hospital where she tragically died five days later.

Her family said brain stem tests had revealed she had suffered catastrophic brain damage from which she could not have recovered.

Nadia died at the hospital six weeks after 17-year-old Christie Anne Brayley.

At the time Nadia's father Hakeel Sharif said: ""Something is going badly wrong at the hospital.

""We have lost our daughter and we are worried for the families of other young people who are still in there.

""Nadia and Christie were friends she was very affected by her death but the hospital would not let her out to go to her funeral which was very upsetting to her.

""For two families to have lost their daughters at the same hospital in such a short space of time is devastating.""

Jadzia Todd

The 19-year-old took her own life in March 2019 after spending time at West Lane Hospital.

She was just 17 when she was admitted to facility on Acklam Road in Middlesbrough in 2017.

Her sister Leonie said she was struggling with her mental health but was not given a formal diagnosis prescribed medication or began any treatment or therapy during her three-month stay.

It's alleged that the youngster was allowed to self harm with hairpins and regularly went missing from the hospital to take overdoses of prescription drugs.

Leonie claimed that Jadzia and other patients at the hospital were made to clean up their own blood after self-harming - something which Jadzia's best friend Megan Ellis who was a patient at West Lane at the same time said she regularly witnessed.

The 22-year-old from North Shields North Tyneside said: ""She never received any type of help while she was at West Lane and whatever issues she went in with were made so much worse during her time there.""

Leonie said Jadzia eventually returned home to Tyneside but continued to suffer from poor mental health and took her own life.

Megan Ellis 19 formed an intensely close bond with Jadzia during their stay at West Lane - and said she'd witnessed many of the things Leonie claims first hand.

She said: ""Some of the staff would say 'if you don't want to help yourself then we don't want to help you'. But these were teenagers with mental illness.

""You were made to feel like a burden.""

Colin Martin chief executive at Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said ""We are sorry to hear about the tragic death of Jadzia last year and our condolences go to her family and friends.

""Jadzia was an inpatient at West Lane Hospital for a short period of time in 2017 but we aren’t able to provide any further information due to patient confidentiality.

""We would encourage Jadzia’s sister to contact us so we can talk to her about these concerns.""

NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uYXNhLW91dGxpbmVzLWNvc3Qtc2F2aW5ncy1mcm9tLWlzcy10cmFuc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA outlines cost savings from ISS transition,"WASHINGTON — NASA expects that retiring the International Space Station in favor of leasing capacity on commercial space stations will ultimately save the agency up to $1.8 billion per year.

That estimate comes from an updated ISS transition report published by NASA last week. The report was submitted to Congress as an update to a 2018 report required by a provision of a 2017 NASA authorization bill seeking information on the agency’s utilization of the ISS and how it will shift to future commercial stations.

NASA currently spends about $3.1 billion a year on the space station program with more than $1.3 billion going to operations of the station and research performed there and nearly $1.8 billion on crew and cargo transportation. A chart included in the transition report projected that spending to remain flat through fiscal year 2027.

Spending would then temporarily increase in fiscal year 2028 as NASA begins efforts to decommission the station. That decommissioning would include deorbiting the station in 2031 through the use of three Progress cargo spacecraft or possibly Cygnus cargo spacecraft to bring the station down over an uninhabited region of the South Pacific Ocean regularly used for deorbiting spacecraft.

Spending on both ISS operations and research and on transportation to the station would be gradually phased out from 2028 through 2031 as spending increases on purchases of commercial low Earth orbit destination services using commercial stations whose development NASA is currently supporting through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The report estimates that NASA will spend about $1 billion a year on CLD services by 2033.

A few hundred million dollars of costs currently borne by the ISS program will be shifted to other parts of the agency the report states. That is primarily mission control and related operations as well as civil servant labor.

The rest will be savings: $1.3 billion in 2031 increasing to $1.8 billion in 2033. “This amount can be applied to NASA’s deep space exploration initiatives allowing the Agency to explore further and faster into deep space. This amount can also be applied to other NASA programs” the report states.

Phil McAlister director of commercial spaceflight at NASA Headquarters offered a similar estimate at a meeting of the NASA Advisory Council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee Jan. 19. “We anticipate once we do the retirement we’re going to save the agency about $1.5 billion” per year he said. “That is going to be a key enabler for our Artemis missions going forward.”

Committee members raised questions about that estimate noting the high costs of space transportation. “That is primarily going to be dependent on what the prices are and we don’t know what the prices are yet. I don’t think even the providers really know” McAlister acknowledged. Part of the work that the three teams led by Blue Origin Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman selected by NASA in December for CLD awards will be to improve the fidelity of their estimated prices.

He added that NASA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer performaned an independent estimate of cost savings from the transition to commercial space stations and came up with a similar number.

Part of the estimated cost savings comes from the expectation that NASA will be one of several customers for commercial space stations. “If we are just one of many customers the providers will be able to amortize their fixed cost over a bigger base” he said. “We will see cost savings just from that alone.”

McAlister added though that even if NASA is the largest or sole customer of a commercial station the agency should still see some savings compared to the ISS. “Initially they’re going to be much smaller than the ISS” he said of commercial stations and thus cheaper to operate. In addition NASA’s requirements for those stations — hosting at least two astronauts and performing 200 investigations a year — will be less demanding than the ISS and with less demand for crew and cargo transportation.

“For those reasons you’re going to see a significant decrease” in costs he concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2VhcnRoLXNwYWNlL25ldy1yb2NrZXQtaW4tdG93bi1hc3RyYS1zZXRzLWxhdW5jaC1kYXRlLWZvci1maXJzdC1saWZ0b2ZmLWZyb20tY2FwZS1jYW5hdmVyYWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3h3ZWF0aGVyLmNvbS9lYXJ0aC1zcGFjZS9uZXctcm9ja2V0LWluLXRvd24tYXN0cmEtc2V0cy1sYXVuY2gtZGF0ZS1mb3ItZmlyc3QtbGlmdG9mZi1mcm9tLWNhcGUtY2FuYXZlcmFsLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New rocket in town: Astra ready for first liftoff from Cape Canaveral,"CAPE CANAVERAL Fla. – There is a new rocket calling the Space Coast home as private space company Astra prepares to launch for the first time this week from Florida.

It won't be United Launch Alliance or SpaceX counting down for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Base for the first time in years. While there have been other launch providers in the past decade including Northrop Grumman and formerly Orbital ATK this year will welcome several new rockets to the Eastern Range bringing life to long-dormant launchpads along the Cape.

Astra's Rocket 3.3 will be the first launch under NASA's Venture Class Launch Services Demonstration 2 contract. According to NASA Astra is scheduled to launch no earlier than Saturday from Space Launch Complex 46 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff is expected at 2:10 p.m. ET within the three-hour launch window.

Space Force weather officers give Rocket 3 a 70% chance of favorable weather for the launch window opening at 1 p.m. Saturday.

The rocket will be carrying CubeSats as part of the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) mission. Three of the spacecraft are from U.S. universities and a fourth CubeSat is a demonstration mission for Johnson Space Center.

DELAYS SET UP SPACEX FOR POTENTIAL TRIPLE LAUNCH WEEK

The University of Alabama Tuscaloosa's BAMA-1 CubeSat will be another technology demonstration studying the use of a drag sail to deorbit a satellite potentially helping with the growing space debris problem in low-Earth orbit.

INCA is a New Mexico State University payload designed to improve space weather models.

Rocket 3 is also launching the University of California Berkley spacecraft called QubeSat a mission to test a device that could provide high accuracy measurements space.

Launch Complex 46 returns to life

Originally constructed as a trident missile launch site by the U.S. Navy in the late 1980s Launch Complex 46 went unused starting in 1999 for over a decade before refurbishment started and was complete in 2017 according to the U.S. Space Force. Florida's spaceport authority Space Florida now manages and leases the launch complex.

The last launch from this Cape Canaveral launch site happened in 2019 when NASA tested its Orion spacecraft abort system. Before that it was used in 2017 for a U.S. Air Force Space Command mission.

NASA TARGETING SPRINGTIME LAUNCH FOR ARTEMIS-1 MOON ROCKET

According to the Space Force the launch facility can support multiple rockets from different companies.

Founded in 2016 by Chris Kemp and Dr. Adam London Astra Space Inc. has another launch site at the Kodiak Spaceport in Alaska where it's conducted multiple test flights the most recent in November 2021 reaching orbit. The company's rocket factory is in Alameda California.

Astra went public (NASDAQ: ASTR) in July 2021 and is the first space launch company publicly traded on Nasdaq.

In December Astra announced it would begin launching from Cape Canaveral. The company says it has plans for more spaceports coming soon.

Astra's Rocket 3 can launch up to 630 kg to low-Earth orbit.

Astra has another NASA launch planned this year. NASA's TROPICS mission will gather data on tropical cyclones using a constellation of six small spacecraft. However that mission will be broken up into three separate launches over a 120-period and from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

The final TROPICS launch is slated for this summer with the first happening in early 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDUvdWd2LW1vdW50ZWQtMzBtbS14bTgxMy1idXNobWFzdGVyLWNhbm5vbi1maXJlcy1wb2ludC1kZXRvbmF0ZS1hbW1vL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDUvdWd2LW1vdW50ZWQtMzBtbS14bTgxMy1idXNobWFzdGVyLWNhbm5vbi1maXJlcy1wb2ludC1kZXRvbmF0ZS1hbW1vLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UGV mounted 30mm XM813 Bushmaster cannon fires point-detonate ammo,"WASHINGTON — The United States is trying to offer mobility and firepower to counter the battlefield. That’s why Northrup mounts a 30 mm XM813 Bushmaster cannon on an unmanned ground vehicle that fires three types of programmable ammunition: air-burst point-detonate and point-detonate with delay fuze settings to defeat a variety of targets.

XM813 has a caliber of 30×173 mm. This type of automatic weapon can be used to integrate into the three main weapon platforms – sea air and ground. XM813 is a product created according to the requirements of American weapons technology outside the United States. For the first time this cannon was integrated into the Stryker of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Germany. Following the successful performance of the cannon in Germany Northrup Gruman signed an agreement with the US government to integrate the XM813 in the chain cannon into an additional combat team of the US Army Brigade.

EMAV-MCA UGV

The video distributed by Northrup Gruman about the tests of the XM813 automatic gun shows that it is mounted on the Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle-Medium Caliber Armament [EMAV-MCA]. This vehicle weighs 3300 kg without weapons and can carry an additional payload of 3500 kg. EMAV-MCA is a chain unmanned ground vehicle that is powered by a hybrid-electric engine. It works extremely quietly and has great mobility.

EMAV-MCA can climb strong sloping surfaces on the battlefield – 60% plain slope and up to 40% lateral slope. The hull of the EMAV-MCA is quite narrow but this is done intentionally so it is designed to be easily transported in V-22 and CH-47. The maximum speed that EMAV-MCA offers is 72 km / h.

A similar experiment between the two weapons systems opens many doors for EMAV-MCA to implement a wide range of missions such as intelligence search and rescue missions surveillance of buildings and infrastructure border surveillance and transportation of goods combat missions with weapons. mounted on UGV as well as explosive ordnance disposal and demining.

More on programmable ammunition

The ammunition with which the XM813 automatic cannon fires is of the High Explosive Air Burst type – Tracer [HEAB-T] MK310. These are ammunition which is characterized by airburst mode programmable in a single shot full auto or “String of Pearls” firing sequence. MK310 works on the principle of point detonation or point detonation delay.

Soldiers from the “Hound Battalion” 3rd Battalion 67th Armor Regiment 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team 3rd Infantry Division became the first unit in service to receive the newly modernized Bradley fighting vehicles on February 1.

The service started fielding the M2A4 variant of the Bradley after resolving the issue with toxic gases from batteries that weren’t compatible with a new charger that was installed in the A4 design.

This deficiency led to the early cancellation of the Full Operational Test and Evaluation procedure after batteries overheated in all six test articles creating a safety hazard to soldiers by sending toxic fumes into the turret and crew compartment.

The Army has now corrected the deficiency with all vehicles now operationally effective demonstrating improved capability over the M2A3 in mechanized infantry platoons and companies according to the fiscal year 2021 Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) report.

M2A4 is the latest member of the Bradley family of vehicles designed to provide protected transport of soldiers and direct fires to support dismounted infantry disrupt or destroy enemy military forces and control land areas. The Bradley Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) termed M2/M7A4 includes changes intended to restore ground clearance suspension reliability and lost mobility and to improve situational awareness. The M2/M7A4 maintains the survivability enhancement features found on legacy vehicles to include the Bradley Urban

Survivability Kits Bradley Reactive Armor Tiles and Add-on Armor Kit that the Army developed and fielded based on lessons learned during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

According to BAE Systems the main contractor on the program the A4 is equipped with an enhanced powertrain that maximizes mobility and increases engine horsepower providing rapid movement in reaction to combat or other adverse situations. Wide angle driver’s vision enhancer improved Force XXI Battle Command Bridge and Below (FBCB2) software integration improves friendly and enemy vehicle identification enhancing situational awareness. The addition of a high speed slip ring greater network connectivity and smart displays that simultaneously display classified and unclassified information also improve situational awareness.

A decision from December 2021 to approve the A4 for a materiel release will pave the way for the conversion of existing M2A3 M3A3 and Operation Desert Storm – Situational Awareness versions of Bradleys into the M2A4 version and the conversion of M7A3 Bradley Fire Support Team vehicles into the M7A4 version. The current plan is to field the M2A4 and M7A4 to four brigades.

Commenting on the arrival of the new A4 Bradleys at Fort Stewart Lieutenant Colonel Mario Iglesias project manager for the Bradley fighting vehicle said the crews would now conduct operational new equipment training to acquaint themselves with the capabilities of the new vehicle.

“The main difference that the units are going to see right away is the power train which will allow the vehicle to be much more maneuverable” Iglesias said.

“This new Bradley can support a bunch of new survivability like new counter-IED technologies new active protection systems and new network capability. The technology in this new vehicle will make sure it is a dominant IFV for many years to come while we wait for the new OMFV.”

OMFV is envisioned as an optionally manned successor to the Bradley. The program is currently in the second stage of the concept design phase after the service picked five companies for work on the program last summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3RlY2gvNDYyNzQ4NS9uYXNhLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbi1wb2ludC1uZW1vL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL3RlY2gvNDYyNzQ4NS9uYXNhLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbi1wb2ludC1uZW1vL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the space cemetery near ‘Point Nemo’ where the ISS will crash and be buried along with old rockets &...,"THE International Space Station still has many years before its retirement in 2030 but now we’re getting insight into the “space graveyard” where it will be buried.

Point Nemo a remote uninhabited area of the Pacific Ocean is set to be the end of the line for the ISS according to NASA’s International Space Station Transition Report.

“This is the largest ocean area without any islands. It is just the safest where the long fallout zone of debris after a re-entry fits into” said Holger Krag Head of the Space Safety Program Office at the European Space Agency.

Due to the massive size of the ISS it’s passive it might not entirely burn up before reaching the ground when it deorbits back to Earth in 2031 said NASA.

This is why it’s being sent to the most remote area on the planet.

The area is the farthest point from human civilization and land - three thousand miles off the coast of New Zealand and 2000 miles. north of Antarctica.

Many nations have dumped their space junk around the mysterious area named after Captain Nemo from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea since the 1970s.

Russia’s Mir space station took its plunge in the water grave back in 2001. Despite weighing 143 tons only 20 tons of the station sits in the ocean.

“There’s a lot of space history down there but of course none of these spacecraft are just sitting neatly on the ocean floor in one piece. Or even two pieces” wrote Kiona Smith Strickland for Gizmodo.

“Re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere is a violence destructive process for any object that tries it whether it’s a meteor or a space station.”

WHAT COMES NEXT

The ISS was partially launched in November 1998 with more pieces following until the first astronaut crew arrived at the station in 2000.

The station’s operations were extended until 2030 by the Biden administration to “enable continuation of the groundbreaking research being conducted” said NASA in a press release.

In a statement NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said it “is a beach of peaceful international scientific collaboration and for more than 20 years has returned enormous scientific educational and technological developments to benefit humanity.”

Three US companies -Blue Origin Nanoracks LLC and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation - have been chosen by NASA to develop commercial space destinations according to a press release.

“The private sector is technically and financially capable of developing and operating commercial low-Earth orbit destinations with NASA’s assistance” said NASA’s director of commercial space Phil McAlister.

He added that NASA hopes to ensure “a smooth transition to commercial destinations after retirement of the International Space Station in 2030.”

Since last May the Pearl Jam frontman unexpectedly recorded an album with a new group of musicians and is now on the road with them for his first performances in indoor venues since July 2018.

“We had some difficult times getting here and if you feel the same now is all that we have worked for” he told the crowd during the second of two sold-out shows to start the three-week run.

More from Variety

For some it may seem a bit strange seeing an Eddie Vedder-led rock show without his Pearl Jam bandmates. Indeed this is something of a first for both parties in their 30-plus-year Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career. Few frontmen of bands this popular have formed new solo projects while their original groups are still active (Jerry Garcia and Thom Yorke come to mind). For Vedder it’s a big departure from his past decade’s worth of solo touring in which he’s largely played on his own in stripped-down acoustic settings.

On Friday it was all a balancing act he pulled off nicely: debuting a bunch of fresh material most of which won’t be released until the “Earthling” album arrives on Feb. 11 while also offering up several manna-from-heaven rarities for the scores of Pearl Jam die-hards in attendance (the performance was recorded for future broadcast on SiriusXM’s Pearl Jam radio channel).

Backed by guitarist Andrew Watt (who also produced and co-wrote the material on “Earthling”) Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith that band’s former guitarist Josh Klinghoffer Jane’s Addiction bassist Chris Chaney and solo troubadour in his own right Glen Hansard Vedder and his Earthlings eased into the show with covers of R.E.M.’s “Drive” and Tom Petty’s “Room at the Top” an appropriate amalgam of the influences that have informed Vedder’s creative ethos since his early days.

The first real eye-opener came next as the group dusted off Liverpool band the La’s’ “Timeless Melody” — a song Pearl Jam used to cover in the early aughts but hadn’t played itself since 2004. “They made one record — a truly truly magnificent record” Vedder said. “We all share an affinity for the songs.”

From there it was four cuts from “Earthling” that offered a tasty cross-section of the album’s sound: the chugging major-key “The Dark” the synth-flecked roof-raising “Invincible” the knowing Petty nod “Long Way” and the powerful rocker “Brother the Cloud” which sure seems to be about the 2017 suicide of Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell. The long sustained notes at the end of the latter two songs were a potent reminder that at 57 Vedder still has one of the best and instantly recognizable voices in rock ’n’ roll.

Although Smith’s thunderous drumming was often the loudest sound in the room the other musicians did right by everything from The Who’s “I’m One” to the piano ballad “The Haves” (dedicated to Vedder’s wife Jill) and the unabashed Beatles homage “Mrs. Mills” the studio version of which features none other than Ringo Starr on the skins. Photographer Danny Clinch joined the group to play harmonica on the ultra-fast song “Try” filling the big shoes of Stevie Wonder whose solo on the album incarnation of the song qualifies as one of his most unusual recorded guest appearances.

Long Island native Watt was clearly living out a dream playing with his musical hero Vedder especially in front of an audience of friends and family. His deep knowledge of the Pearl Jam catalog helped kick the show into a higher gear when the musicians played “Dirty Frank” a 1992 Pearl Jam B-side inspired by the band’s formative time touring with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Astonished audience screams were audible as the group began the song which borrows one of the Peppers’ high-stepping elastic grooves for a jokey romp that ends with Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready being eaten by a murderous tour bus driver. The fact that Pearl Jam hasn’t revisited “Dirty Frank” since 2006 reinforced the “Why not?” sense of adventure fueling the whole Vedder-and-the-Earthlings enterprise.

A main set-closing cover of Pearl Jam’s “Porch” kept the energy high going into the encore when the one-two punch of Pearl Jam’s “Not for You” and Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” brought it all back home with massive four-guitar energy. Vedder and Klinghoffer traded lead vocals on a finale of “Purple Rain” after which an ecstatic Watt bear-hugged Klinghoffer from behind. Fists were held aloft and high-fives with strangers were exchanged — for some the first time they’d done so in a concert setting in more than two years.

Overall the two-hour show proved that Vedder can effectively explore new territory as an individual artist with different musicians without short-changing the inimitable legacy he’s worked so hard to build with Pearl Jam. Indeed it wouldn’t be at all surprising to see this quick Earthlings detour rub off on the Seattle quintet and bear fruit sooner rather than later for them too.

Hansard opened the evening with a solo set as he has done on many Vedder tours over the past decade. At one point he mused that Vedder’s audience must be sick of him by now but judging from the mid-set standing ovation he received after performing his “Once” favorite “Falling Slowly” that is far from the case. Hansard will return to the Beacon on March 17 with his Swell Season partner Marketa Irglova as part of their first U.S. tour in 11 years.

Here is Eddie Vedder and the Earthlings’ set list:

“Drive” (R.E.M.)

CRAWFORDSVILLE Ind. (AP) — Nucor Corp. is planning a $290 million project to expand production at a steel sheet mill in west central Indiana.

The Charlotte North Carolina-based company announced this past week it would add production lines at the Crawfordsville plant potentially adding 80 jobs to its current 770 workers.

The company said the project is expected to take two years to complete as it seeks regulatory approvals and state and local government incentives.

Nucor Executive Vice President Rex Query says the project was part of the company’s strategy to grow its core steel business and expand into new product lines.

Nvidia first announced the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at CES 2022 with the promise of more details at the end of January. That deadline came and went without any additional information and the speculation is that Nvidia is struggling to produce the card in meaningful quantities prompting indefinite delays.

While we wait for confirmation from Nvidia about what’s actually going on retailers are filling the vacuum with their own listings for the upcoming card — and the prices aren’t encouraging even in a world that’s used to GPU inflation.

The latest listings come from an Estonian retailer’s listings tweeted by @momomo_us. With a currency conversion all three cards come in at around $4000 with the tax removed.

The cheapest of the lot is the Asus TUF RTX 3090 Ti at €4332.11 (or around $3968). That seems pricey until you get onto the other two — a €4413.85 (around $4043) overclocked version and €4577.40 (around $4193) liquid-cooled ROG Strix model.

As our sister site Tom’s Hardware points out this is highly unlikely to be the actual MSRP for the RTX 3090 TI. The vanilla RTX 3090s currently sells for around $2600 on Ebay when the price should be $1499 new. Assuming a similar level of gouging here that would suggest the actual price to be around the $2300 mark. Probably closer to $2000 as you’d imagine there’s an additional premium here for the new and shiny.

That’s still hugely expensive obviously but the GPU will reportedly go some way to justifying it with truly enviable specs. We’ve heard talk of a fully enabled GA102 core with 24GB of upgraded GDDR6X memory offering a total of 10752 CUDA cores. All of this power will apparently come at an energy cost though with the card reportedly having a total power draw of 450W.

But when the new graphics card will emerge is anyone’s guess. With Nvidia missing its own deadline to reveal more at the end of last month we’re now in a state of limbo as to when it’ll actually appear making these possible prices something of a moot point.

While the specs listed above will make the RTX 3090 Ti an enviable GPU for many years to come it’s worth remembering that Nvidia is rumored to be unveiling the RTX 40 series before the year is out — and with price gouging and shortages being what they are many will be tempted just to sit this generation out and see if things look better in 12 months time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1saW51eC1kcml2ZS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0yMDUwLW14NTcwLW14NTUwLWdwdS1zdXBwb3J0L9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1saW51eC1kcml2ZS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0yMDUwLW14NTcwLW14NTUwLWdwdS1zdXBwb3J0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Adds GeForce RTX 2050 MX570 & MX550 Laptop GPU Support To Linux Through Latest Drivers,"Last December NVIDIA launched three new mobility GPUs the RTX 2050 MX550 and MX570. While the MX550 is a Turing variant for NVIDIA the RTX 2050 and MX570 utilize identical GA107 cores similar to the RTX 3050. Laptop manufacturers will use these new chips in their notebooks during this first quarter of 2022.

Linux driver 470.103.01 released for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 MX570 and MX550 Mobility GPUs

A new Linux driver (470.103.01) for the RTX 2050 MX570 and MX550 is available offering more compatibility and capability in the open-source operating system.

Starting with the specifications the GeForce RTX 2050 is based on the GA107 GPU core with 2048 cores which is actually more than the GeForce RTX 2060 laptop variant. It features a boost clock of up to 1477 MHz and has a TGP of up to 45W. The GPU features 4 GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 14 Gbps but runs across a 64-bit bus interface which provides 112 GB/s bandwidth. The memory sub-system is the major blow to the RTX 2050 but it makes sense since this is not a replacement of the RTX 2060 but a more entry-level option.

Moving over to the GeForce MX570 and MX550 NVIDIA isn't providing detailed specifications but it looks like the MX570 is based on a totally new Ampere GPU SKU the GA107 while the MX550 uses the Turing TU117 GPU. The GA107 die is already shipping in RTX 3050 laptop SKUs and since the MX series is always the most entry-level die this would be the most cut-down configuration of the GA107 GPU core. The GeForce RTX 2050 and MX500 series laptop GPUs support all the latest features such as ray tracing NVIDIA DLSS Reflex and Broadcast among others. They also work seamlessly with Optimus & are a perfect solution for providing longer battery times with more horsepower over a standard iGPU.

When Samsung acquired SmartThings the Korean giant promised to maintain its cross-platform compatibility – and Samsung’s cross-platform agenda hasn’t changed.

Samsung has worked hard to integrate a number of cross-platform devices into its home setup including Amazon Echo BMWs from 2013 until now with the ConnectedDrive services feature and UK devices such as the Logitech Harmony Belkin WeMo LED Bulb and Switch Outlet and the Aeotec Siren (Gen 5) among others. The company’s recent IoTivity showcase with the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) at CES 2017 shows that Samsung’s cross-platform commitment hasn’t died and the new SmartThings compatibility with the new NVIDIA SHIELD TV shows that Samsung doesn’t intend to put any bridges between Tizen and Android.

The NVIDIA SHIELD TV powered by Google’s Android TV platform making it an Android media streamer that offers the most advanced gaming and viewing experience available on the market. NVIDIA is well-known for its graphics processors and gaming devices (hence NVIDIA SHIELD) and the new device performs as an all-in-one gaming and TV-viewing station.

The new device brings 4K HDR content (which now includes Amazon Video) and support for YouTube VUDU and Google Play Movies. With the new SHIELD TV NVIDIA has expanded its game library to feature titles such as For Honor Assassin’s Creed Syndicate and Watch Dogs 2 among others with the goal of expanding its offering to games such as Shadowgun Legends Tomb Raider and The Witness. Additionally a new AI home capability allows you to communicate with the device by way of voice command similar to Google Home and Amazon Echo. Integration with Samsung SmartThings will arrive “in the coming months” NVIDIA says so don’t expect SmartThings compatibility right away.

“By seamlessly integrating great gaming rich media content and AI NVIDIA has established a whole new standard for streamers. With its broad mix of services and immaculate execution SHIELD represents the future of home entertainment” Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin said.

The NVIDIA SHIELD TV comes with a TV remote and game controller will have Google Assistant integration and cost $199.99 later this month when it reaches the US Canada and certain European markets. A SHIELD PRO model featuring a TV remote game controller and 500GB of storage will arrive later this month as well though the price is TBA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ldXJvcGVhbi1wcmljaW5nLWVtZXJnZXMtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European Pricing Emerges for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti,"Despite not being released just yet more listings for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti have surfaced this time in Europe. As Tweeted by @momomo_us an Estonian retailer has listed three Asus ROG and TUF RTX 3090 Tis with very high prices upwards of 4332 Euros or more.

The Asus TUF RTX 3090 Ti is the cheapest and surfaces for 4332.11 Euros ($3967.92 converted without tax) from the Estonian retailer. In the middle is the factory overclocked variant at 4413.85 Euros ($4042.8 converted without tax) and the flagship ROG Strix RTX 3090 Ti -- which also happens to be the liquid-cooled variant is going for 4577.40 Euros ($4192.6 converted without tax).

We don't have an official MSRP from Nvidia yet but for reference scalped RTX 3090s on eBay are going for around $2609 right now. So if we assume these are scalped Estonian RTX 3090 Ti's they will sell for nearly twice the scalped 3090s. So we could be looking at a 1.5x to 2x higher MSRP of the 3090 Ti once Nvidia gets around to announcing it. But this is an educated guess on our part; these prices increase due to several other reasons.

Ironically Asus' listing is relatively tame compared to other listings we've seen already. For example a few days ago we covered another listing regarding a Japanese retailer selling the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500 (with tax).

Rumored specs indicate Nvidia's RTX 3090 Ti will be packing a fully enabled GA102 core and upgraded GDDR6X modules. For a total of 10752 CUDA cores and 21Gbps GDDR6X memory giving the 3090 Ti over 1TBps of memory bandwidth. These modules will also have double the capacity of the current modules used on the RTX 3090 bringing the total count from 24 to just 12. It will be very beneficial as it makes cooling the GDDR6X modules far less complicated and allows for a more straightforward PCB design.

Nvidia originally shared some specifications of the RTX 3090 Ti at CES but kept many details in the dark such as the card MSRP. The company promised to share more details about the GPU before January was over but failed to do so for unknown reasons. Supposedly Nvidia had to ask its AIB partners to halt the RTX 3090 Ti production due to quality control issues which is why Nvidia delayed sharing more details last month including the launch date of the 3090 Ti.

So for now we're still waiting on an official launch for the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. However with the number of listings for the card growing by the week it seems its launch is imminent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1cnUzZC5jb20vZG93bmxvYWQvZ2Vmb3JjZS01MTEtNzItaG90Zml4LWRyaXZlci1kb3dubG9hZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeForce 511.72 Hotfix driver download,"Download Windows 10 / 11 64-bit (Desktop & Mobile)

On Saturday they dropped a 5-2 decision to Columbia and rebounded on Sunday to knock off St. John's 4-3.



Against the Red Storm of St. John's the Monarchs took the doubles point by winning at the number two and three spots. At number two Francois Le Tallec and Younes Lalami scored a 6-3 win over Charlie James and Ryota Kaneda. The tandem of Codie van Schalkwyk and Oliver Nolan clinched the point at number three by defeating Giuseppe DeCamelis and Carl Gustavsson 6-3.



In singles the Monarchs won the first three matches to finish and clinched the match with a victory by Lalami at number four over Gustavsson 7-5 6-4. Luca Maldoner won at number two over Ignacio Garcia 6-2 6-3 while Van Schalkwyk won 6-2 6-4 over Udayan Bhakar at number five before Lalami's clincher.



In the match with Columbia the Lions swept the doubles matches to take the team point. In singles ODU got wins at number three by Yevhen Sirous with a 6-1 7-6 win over Ishaan Ravichander and number five with van Schalkwyk winning 6-4 3-6 3-2 over Austin Huang.



The men will return to action on February 16 with a 5 p.m. match against William & Mary in Williamsburg.





MUELLER ON WEEKEND

""It's nice to rebound from yesterday's match to get our first road win of the season. Being away always throws some challenges at you and I think we played a clean dual match until 4-0. We lost focus and energy for the dead matches and that's an opportunity to work on things we missed out on. Credit to St. John's for fighting until the end. I think we learned that we need to work on several things before our next match.""

(ODUSports.com) – Down 43-22 at the half the Old Dominion women’s basketball team made a concerted push in the third quarter only to fall 71-57 at WKU on Saturday afternoon. The Monarchs (16-5 6-3 C-USA) opened the half on a 12-0 run and netted 19 of the first 20 points cutting the deficit to three points on two occasions.

“Individuals did not come to answer the bell when the game started” head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones said. “Defensively we were scattered and chaotic and no one was following the scheme. We did not step up to the call.”

ODU’s run began late in the second quarter when Kaye Clark knocked down a triple with 2:23 to play and Ajah Wayne finished the half with a layup inside the final minute. Those five points shaved a 26-point margin down to a 21-point one 43-22 at the break.

The Monarchs kept the Lady Toppers (15-7 8-3) without a point for the first 5:58 of the third quarter. WKU made just one of its 16 attempts from the field (.063) in the period and did not score that basket until the 23-second mark of the quarter. Offensively ODU shot 8-of-17 in the third and was 3-of-6 from deep. Iggy Allen scored 10 of her 22 in the third and made all three of her shot attempts including a pair from long range.

Allen’s trey at the 4:35 mark began a run of seven straight points from the guard from Pompano Beach Florida. She hit two foul shots with 2:29 to play to make the score 44-38. Almost 30 seconds later Aziah Hudson hit a three and ODU was within three points 44-41. WKU scored the next three all from the foul line but Allen hit a triple with 50 seconds left to make the score 47-44. Alexis Mead scored inside the last 30 seconds to make the score 49-44 after three quarters.

The Monarchs couldn’t sustain their push in the fourth period as the Lady Toppers pulled away. WKU made 62.5-percent of its shots in the fourth including a 3-of-3 mark from deep.

WKU shot 56 percent in the first quarter and led 27-11 after 10 minutes. Mariah Adams and Wayne scored back-to-back baskets to make it a 6-4 score in favor of the hosts but from there WKU rattled off a 6-0 run. Wayne broke the run with another layup to make the score 12-6 but the Lady Toppers responded with 10 straight. Allen ended the period with a 3-pointer at the buzzer.

The Monarchs guarded the 3-point line tighter in the second quarter holding WKU to a 1-of-4 mark but entered the break trailing 43-22. Clark and Allen combined for nine of ODU’s 11 points in the second on 4-of-8 shooting. The teams went back-and-forth to start the quarter but the Lady Toppers pieced together a 9-0 run to take a 43-17 lead with 3:12 to play.

Allen led all participants with 22 points and chipped in eight rebounds to match the game high. She also had two steals and one blocked shot.

Old Dominion forced 17 turnovers scoring 24 points off those Lady Topper miscues. WKU won the rebounding battle 52-31.

Mead paced WKU with 15 and eight rebounds. Four of the Lady Toppers’ starters scored in double figures and Hope Sivori chipped in 11 off the bench.

The Monarchs face a short turnaround and a Monday home game with FIU at 6:30 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob2VuaXhtYWcuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDYvd21wby1zcG90bGlnaHQtb24tMjAyMi10b3VybmFtZW50LWNoYWlybWFuLW1pY2hhZWwtZ29sZGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WMPO Spotlight on 2022 Tournament Chairman Michael Golding,"Michael Golding was a 30-something oral surgeon with a passing interest in golf when he first heard his wife Laura a Gilbert native and ASU grad rave about Waste Management Phoenix Open.

“I would kind of laugh it off and tell her I had been to golf tournaments. I had been to The Masters” says Golding who grew up in Pittsburgh and went to dental school in Maryland. “I’m sure its great but it’s no big deal.” Then in 2012 he made his first trip to the TPC Scottsdale.

“I stepped food on the grounds and was just blown away.” Golding soon after joined the Thunderbirds and now the 43-year-old healer who co-leads the practice Oral and Facial Surgeons of Arizona is the 2022 Tournament Chairman.

Here is our Q&A with the tournament head honcho.

What’s your top priority as chairman this year?

Getting this event back to what we all know and remember. That’s been my goal since the second the 2021 tournament ended: to get back and give back in a big way. Our internal mantra

has been “Return to Rad.” That’s returning to all we know and love about this tournament.

One new event is the Concert in the Coliseum on the 16th hole the Saturday before the tournament. How did that come about?

We’ve always looked at that hole as something that was built and ready to go as a potential venue. There will be a stage in the round in the center of the fairway there with Thomas Rhett and Old Dominion appearing that night in front of 12000 fans.

You were chairman of the Birds Nest in 2019. What was that like?

That was probably my favorite year until this year as Tournament Chairman. I’m a music guy and I’ve always loved the Birds Nest. Our team and I worked really hard with the music lineup that year and having Snoop Dogg on stage with The Chainsmokers was a highlight. We had three sellout shows that week record-breaking crowds and raised almost $900000.

Did you get to spend any time with Mr. Dogg?

To kind of solidify the contract with him my wife and I spent a day on a yacht in Southern California with Snoop and his team. That was bucket list for me. His music was a part of my high school years.

The Phoenix Suns are at home the weekend of this year’s WMPO. As the team’s oral and maxillofacial surgeon will you invite them out to watch the action?

They are all invited to come out every day and stay all day."

The findings of the Chips Survey launched by the European Commission highlighted that industry expects demand for chips to double by 2030. This reflects the growing importance of semiconductors for European industry and society. There will be challenges in meeting this increasing demand especially in light of the current semiconductor supply crisis.

In her 2021 State of the Union speech Commission President Ursula von der Leyen set the vision for Europe’s chip strategy to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem.

WASHINGTON — Democrats on Friday muscled legislation through the House that they say positions the United States to better compete with China economically and on the global stage by strengthening the domestic semiconductor industry and shoring up strained supply chains.

The bill passed by a vote of 222-210. It marks an important step for a top Biden administration priority but the legislation is likely to be extensively revised as negotiators reconcile differences with what the Senate passed about eight months ago. President Joe Biden urged lawmakers to reach a deal quickly saying “America can’t afford to wait.”

The nearly 3000-page bill not counting scores of amendments added this week includes massive investments designed to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. The big-ticket items include about $52 billion in grants and subsidies to help the semiconductor industry and $45 billion to strengthen supply chains for high-tech products.

But Democrats also tucked in other priorities that have raised GOP concerns about the bill’s cost and scope. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois was the only Republican to vote for the measure while Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida was the only Democrat to vote against it.

The bill includes $8 billion for a fund that helps developing countries adjust to climate change; $3 billion for facilities to make the U.S. less reliant on Chinese solar components; $4 billion to help communities with significantly higher unemployment than the national average; and $10.5 billion for states to stockpile drugs and medical equipment.

Democrats were in a celebratory mood prior to the vote after the latest jobs report showed employers added 467000 jobs in January. They said the legislation would lead to more good news on that front.

“The bill we're talking about today is a jobs bill a jobs bill for manufacturing in America for making it in America"" Pelosi said.

The bill gives Democrats a chance to address voter concerns about the economy at a time when a shortage of computer chips has led to higher prices for automobiles electronics and medical devices. To show his administration is addressing inflation concerns Biden highlighted the vote at a White House event Friday and reminded Americans of Intel's announcement two weeks ago that it would be building two computer chip production plants in Ohio.

Republicans who for months have hammered Democrats over rising inflation panned the measure as “toothless” and short of what is needed to hold China accountable for a range of economic and human rights actions. They also said it would waste taxpayer dollars on environmental initiatives and other unnecessary programs.

“This bill is actually just a long list of progressive dream policies that have nothing to do with China at all"" said Rep. Michelle Fischbach R-Minn.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo met with House Democratic lawmakers this week to discuss the bill. She said the most “urgent need” in the bill is the $52 billion for domestic chip production because of the global chip shortage’s effect on the economy including the automotive sector and the national security implications of having so many semiconductors made overseas.

“We just cannot wait anymore” she told reporters Friday. “We are so far behind. We’re in such a dangerous place as a matter of national security just because of our reliance on Taiwan for our most sophisticated leading-edge chips.”

Big chipmakers like Intel and Samsung have recently announced plans to build new factories in the U.S. but Raimondo noted they have also indicated they could go “bigger and faster” with federal help.

One of the biggest flashpoints is the $8 billion in the legislation to help developing countries reduce their emissions and cope with climate change. Former President Barack Obama pledged $3 billion toward the fund but former President Donald Trump withheld $2 billion of that.

Rep. Michael McCaul the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called it an “unaccountable UN slush fund"" that has already provided at least $100 million to China.

Meanwhile America's share of semiconductor manufacturing globally has steadily eroded from 37% in 1990 to about 12% now. The Biden administration and lawmakers are trying to reverse that trend which industry officials say is driven by foreign competitors receiving significant government subsidies.

The pandemic has strained the supply chain for the chips. The Commerce Department issued a report last week that found the median inventory of some semiconductor products had fallen from 40 days in 2019 to less than five days in 2021. The report also said stakeholders don’t see the problem going away in the next six months. The administration cited the findings in calling for Congress to act.

Tensions with China are reflected in much the legislation. In a nod to concerns about the origins of COVID-19 the bill directs the president to submit a report to Congress on the most likely origin of the virus the level of confidence in that assessment and the challenges of making such as assessment.

Republicans dismissed the provision as “no independent investigation no sanctions no punishment."" They want a select committee of lawmakers to look into the origins of COVID-19. “Instead of taking action to get a real accountability it's going to ask them for a report"" said Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California.

Another provision would subject more lower-cost products made in China to tariffs. Currently imports valued at less than $800 are exempted from expedited processing and tariffs. The bill eliminates the threshold for certain countries most notably China.

The Senate passed its computer chips legislation in June by a vote of 68-32 representing a rare bout of bipartisanship on major legislation. Negotiators will now try to work out a compromise both chambers can accept though it's uncertain they could do so before the midterm elections.

Whatever emerges will need support from 10 Republicans in the 50-50 Senate to be passed into law.

“We'll send House Republicans a much better option to vote on in the next couple of months"" said Sen. Todd Young R-Ind. who worked with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate's version of the legislation.

“Democrats in the Senate and House know we have much more work to do to bridge our two proposals together and move this bill to the president’s desk and I believe we will” Schumer said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2M0N2U2OGEyLTBiMjEtNGQ5ZS1hMTdmLWU3NzQzOWUzODVhMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK engineer Renishaw expects chip crunch to last another 2 years,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

The film was released this week and so far has grossed an estimated $20 million. The sequel to 2010’s Jackass 3D it is the fourth main installment and the fifth overall installment in the Jackass film series.

PETA claimed a stunt in which Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O provoke honeybees into stinging Steve-O’s penis (killing many of them) and another in which a scorpion is put in someone’s mouth and hit repeatedly until the animal stings are particularly worrisome.

The organization has sent letters to Los Angeles city and San Luis Obispo County prosecutors about the matter. PETA points out that the Paramount Pictures movie—which appears to have been filmed at least partially in Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo County—likely broke state animal protection laws.

Objections included scenes that include a spider being provoked into biting an actor’s chest a turtle being harassed and goaded until the animal bites an actor’s testicles a captive snake harangued and provoked into biting a person’s nose a tarantula trapped in a tube between two participants’ faces and a bull deliberately agitated into charging Knoxville reportedly leaving him with a brain hemorrhage among other injuries.

“If Steve-O and Johnny Knoxville want to make a career out of nasty little boy fantasies they’re entitled to as long as they don’t stress harm poke prod scare or bother animals who are used as living props for their idiocy” said a statement from PETA SVP Lisa Lange. “PETA is reminding city and county prosecutors that no one is above the law and that while the rest of the world wants to save bees and recognizes animals as sentient individuals these jackasses exploit and abuse them for fun.”

Those targeted by PETA include Knoxville Stephen Glover (aka “Steve-O”) Sean McInerney Ehren McGhehey Compston Wilson Rachel Wolfson Chris Pontius and Eric André; director Jeff Tremaine; producer Spike Jonze; and those responsible for providing the animals for the production including Jules Sylvester Tom Roach LeRoy Steese and Christina Steese.",,,,,,,,,,,,

McKinsey research suggests that the consumers of the future might shop less spend less and will be happy to replace favourite brands with more affordable ones.2 The Deloitte fresh food consumer survey supports this suggestion finding that the number of respondents who said they shopped for fresh food in stores multiple times a week dropped by half from 2019 to 2020.3 Deloitte analysis of grocery receipt data shows consumers who shop for fresh food at least once a week made up about 80 per cent of fresh sales 4 so a reduction is not good news for the traditional grocery channel.

This new shift presents a great opportunity to win over new online shoppers but there is also the risk of permanently losing loyalty by doing nothing to acknowledge and subsequently address the changes. So does this unprecedented growth signal a permanent change for online groceries?

“New baselines have been established” says Matt Botham Strategic Insight Director at Kantar. “Ecommerce now has 13 per cent of grocery and this peaked at just over 15 per cent in January and looks likely to settle at around 11 per cent compared with 7 or 8 per cent before the pandemic.” He adds “Some of our pandemic shopping behaviour was circumstantial. We were in our homes and didn't need to venture out but there are clear indicators that this is sticking around.5 ”",,,,,,,,,,,,

CEO of PepsiCo Europe Silviu Popovici commented on the packaging update saying ""Flexible packaging recycling should be the norm across Europe. We see a future where our bags will be free of virgin fossil-based plastic. They will be part of a thriving circular economy where flexible packaging is valued and can be recycled as a new packet. We’re investing with our partners to build technological capacity to do that. We now need an appropriate regulatory landscape in place so that packaging never becomes waste.”

The same is about to happen in the case of Paxlovid the company’s Covid-19 oral treatment

On January 24 US advocacy group Public Citizen wrote a letter to Albert Bourla Pfizer’s Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer. It asked Pfizer to step up and make its Covid-19 treatment Paxlovid widely accessible. The letter expressed the concern that going by Pfizer’s announcements so far we can expect that more than half of the world population in need of this treatment won’t get it.

In mid-December Pfizer told investors it estimated an addressable patient population of nearly 250 million for its oral treatment. However the company will be able to manufacture only 120 million courses of treatment in 2022. The high price of treatment and different charges in different countries is equally concerning. While the US government is paying USD 530 per course Panama will pay USD 250. Meanwhile Beximco a firm in Bangladesh is selling a generic version of Paxlovid at USD 186 per treatment course. Lack of transparency of cost of production doesn’t allow rational pricing and companies such as Pfizer are able to exploit the desperation for treatment in an emergency situation like the pandemic.

Almost all the treatment courses are directed towards the populations of rich nations. According to a tracker by US-based organization Knowledge Ecology International Pfizer has signed contracts exclusively with high-income and upper-middle-income countries mostly from Europe and North America. No African country figures in the list although the region has the lowest vaccination rates and is most in need of treatments.

Unprecedented crisis unprecedented revenue

Concerns regarding access to Pfizer’s medicine emerge from the experience of glacially slow vaccination in lower and lower-middle income countries. While Pfizer was among the first few companies to have developed an effective mRNA vaccine access to the vaccine has been very low outside of the Global North.While only 11% of the African population is fully vaccinated in Europe the same stands at 63%.

With Pfizer now having an effective treatment as well as vaccine it is more necessary than ever to challenge the power it holds during an unprecedented crisis. In the 3rd quarter of 2021 (July-September) Pfizer’s revenue was USD 24.1 billion which was a 134% increase from last year. Excluding Comirnaty the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine Pfizer’s revenue grew by just 7% clearly indicating that the company’s exponential growth in 2021 relied almost exclusively on the vaccine. This revenue is set to increase as Pfizer is projecting the production of 4 billion vaccines in 2022 compared to 3 billion in 2021.

It wasn’t only selling the vaccine that has led to this spectacular performance. During bilateral negotiations for purchasing the vaccine the company signed contracts with governments which undermine their sovereignty. Some of the clauses give complete immunity to the company at the cost of national laws and assets. All contracts between Pfizer and national governments follow a non-disclosure agreement. The clause doesn’t cover only the contents of the agreement but also the talks and negotiations that preceded the final contract. Thus no one gets to know when the negotiations are on and their content is forever hidden.

However some leaked contracts give us an insight into the contents. In a report on Pfizer’s contracts Public Citizen notes “The contracts offer a rare glimpse into the power one pharmaceutical corporation has gained to silence governments throttle supply shift risk and maximize profits in the worst public health crisis in a century.” While reading the contracts it appears that a powerful entity is calling the shots compromising sovereignty of countries law of the land and decision making power of the elected governments.

State-owned enterprises as collateral

Among other things the contracts define that in the event of any dispute between the company and the government it will not be settled according to the laws of the country but rather under a secret private arbitration process under the laws of New York. The company has also kept national assets as collateral to be used in case a country’s government does not pay in accordance with the arbitral award. These include US-based assets such as foreign bank accounts foreign investments and foreign commercial property including the assets of state-owned enterprises like airlines and oil companies.

The Brazilian government has been prohibited from making any public announcement regarding its agreement with Pfizer including even its existence without prior written permission from the company. Similar non-disclosure clauses are contained in contracts with the European Commission and the US.

Pfizer has managed to absolve itself of consequences if vaccines are not delivered on time. Their contract with the government of Colombia says “Under no circumstances will Pfizer be subject to or liable for any late delivery penalties.” Similar clauses are part of contracts with Albania and Brazil.

Brazil is also denied the right to accept donations of the Pfizer vaccine or buy it from any other source without Pfizer’s permission. This in effect means that if Brazil wants to use its laws such as compulsory licensing to improve access to Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine it can’t do so. In case it does Pfizer reserves the right to terminate the contract and Brazil would have to pay full price for any remaining contracted doses. Brazil also cannot donate distribute or export the vaccine without the company’s permission. Such impunity on part of a private corporation is worrisome and calls for strict regulation by governments across the world.

Calls to facilitate mRNA vaccine technology transfer

The price for the vaccine is also high just like the oral treatment. An analysis of production techniques by Public Citizen with engineers from Imperial College London estimated that the mRNA vaccine produced by Pfizer/BioNTech could be mass produced for as little as $1.18 to $2.85 a dose. Yet it is one of the most expensive on the market at an average price of $16.25.

On January 13 seven US senators of the ruling Democratic Party wrote to the government urging the Biden Administration to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to increase the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines. They wrote that DPA should be used to facilitate mRNA vaccine technology transfer and scale up production through publicly-owned vaccine manufacturing facilities. They emphasized the importance of boosting vaccine production at home and abroad to control the devastating pandemic.

Given Pfizer’s actions during the pandemic it is no wonder Public Citizen and other health activists and academics have started raising concerns regarding access and affordability of Paxlovid early on. In its mid-December presentation to investors Pfizer indicated that LMICs will come on board for Paxlovid through the Medicines Patent Pool only in 2023. We can not allow the devastation of people’s health and profiteering of Big Pharma for one more year. Free riding on people’s suffering should be stopped and companies like Pfizer should be reigned in.

But the size of the wave which broke records for national cases and hospitalizations has given regulators and scientists an opportunity to better assess vaccine efficacy in children ages 6 months to 4 years old Dr. Scott Gottlieb a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration said on Sunday.

Dr. Gottlieb who sits on the board of the vaccine maker Pfizer said that he hopes key data expected on Friday will shed additional light on whether the federal government should grant emergency authorization for two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine for children in this age group.

“We now have an opportunity to look at a much richer data set” Dr. Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” He did not specify what that data would reveal. Still he emphasized that the toll Omicron took on children in particular gave Pfizer a stronger basis for comparison of those given vaccines and those not.

Background

Older age is a common risk factor for severe disease and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus elderly individuals have been prioritized for both primary and booster vaccination against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is of particular concern for older individuals as compared to younger individuals because there has been a greater amount of time since the elderly received their COVID-19 vaccine. While booster vaccines can induce Omicron-neutralizing activity their long-term effects on the elderly are not yet clear.

About the study

The researchers of the present study longitudinally determined SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of sera against different SARS-Cov-2 variants in a prospective cohort of 37 individuals with a median age of 82 years. All study participants were monitored for ten months after a two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination and for up to 4.5 months after receiving a single BNT162b2 booster vaccine dose.

Using a pseudovirus assay the researchers determined 50% geometric mean inhibitory serum dilutions (GeoMean ID 50 ) against the SARS-CoV-2 Wu01 vaccine strain as well as the Delta and Omicron variants. Upon completion of the two-dose vaccine regimen the researchers collected sera from the participants at one and five months.

Study findings

The results show that detectable neutralizing activity against Omicron was almost absent after two vaccine doses; however these levels returned in 89% of the participants after booster immunization. Two BNT162b2 vaccine doses induced detectable neutralizing activity against the Wu01 and Delta strains at 95% and 84% respectively in most individuals while neutralizing activity against Omicron was undetectable or only minimally detectable.

Over the four months of follow-up neutralizing serum titers declined by six- and seven-fold respectively against Wu01 and Delta strains. The researchers obtained early post-boost sera samples one month after booster vaccination and found that booster immunization led to an over 50-fold increase in neutralizing activity against the Wu01 and Delta strains. Furthermore booster immunization was found to induce a strong Omicron neutralizing activity in 89% of the elderly participants.

Follow-up samples obtained three to five months after the booster vaccination showed that neutralizing titers against the Wu01 Delta and Omicron strains declined by 2.7- 2.3- and 3.0-fold respectively. The team used linear mixed-effects models to determine the decline rate in neutralizing activity and found that neutralizing titers against the SARS-CoV-2 Wu01 Delta and Omicron variants showed similar declines following booster dose. Furthermore detectable activity was maintained against Omicron in 81% of individuals.

Longitudinal assessment of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing serum activity in elderly individuals.

Conclusions

The current study demonstrates the effectiveness of mRNA booster doses in inducing neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in the highly vulnerable elderly population. Furthermore these findings provide crucial information on the durability of vaccine response.

Furthermore booster immunizations were found to be highly valuable tools that can restore waning vaccine effectiveness and reduce the risk of severe disease in the elderly in the absence of vaccines specific to the Omicron variant. Taken together these findings also show that previous knowledge about waning humoral immunity can guide vaccination strategies against the Omicron variant in the highly vulnerable elderly population.

The S&P 500 index may shrug off disappointing Facebook results after Amazon topped market expectations

So far in the earnings season over 80% of the S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings forecasts

Pfizer and Twitter results are in focus this week which may set the tone for the broader market

Recommended by Margaret Yang CFA Get Your Free Equities Forecast Get My Guide

The Dow Jones S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices entered consolidation mode at the start of 2022 weighed by rising treasury yields inflationary pressure and expectations that the Fed may tighten monetary policy at an accelerated pace. An uneven earnings season has also led to heightened market volatility with the FAANG companies painting a divergent outlook.

While Netflix and Facebook disappointed investors with lower-than-expected forward guidance and user growth the rest - Tesla Apple Alphabet and Amazon - have topped market estimates with stellar results. These companies account for a large share of the S&P 500 index and therefore their earnings tend to have an outsized impact on the benchmark.

Facebook lost more than a quarter of its market value on Thursday dragging the S&P 500 index down by more than 2%. Investors were disappointed to see its Daily Active Users (DAUs) falling for the first time and its revenue guidance below expectations. Amazon soared 15% during after-hours trade as its earnings per share (EPS) beat consensus by a wide margin thanks to its diversified business model and investment in the electric vehicle company Rivian. S&P 500 index futures rebounded over 1% during after-hours trade as sentiment turned positive.

A divergent earnings picture underscores a challenging environment for tech giants as they attempt to maintain growth momentum amid rising wage pressures and the gradual exit from the pandemic which affects people’s lifestyle and appetite for digital services. Demand for smartphone devices goods and electric vehicles remains robust though putting supply chain constrains into focus.

So far in the earnings season more than half of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results. Among them 80% have beaten analysts’ forecasts with an average earnings surprise of +6.6% according to Bloomberg data. The percentage of companies that delivered positive surprises and their magnitude are slightly lower than in the previous quarter however.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

USA Swimming canceled a meet in Iowa and is reviewing its calendar for the rest of 2022 after the world championships were pushed back another year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The TYR Pro Swim Series Des Moines set for March 2-5 at the MidAmerican Energy Aquatic Center at the Wellmark YMCA was to be a qualifying meet for the Phillips 66 International Team Trials in April.

But the decision by world governing body FINA to delay the world championships in Fukuoka Japan for a second time has thrown the U.S. plans into turmoil.

The worlds were initially set for 2021 then pushed back to this May after the Tokyo Olympics were postponed a year. With the pandemic still raging the championships are now set for July 14-30 2023.

While that means three huge events in a one-year period — two world championships and the 2024 Paris Olympics — the powerhouse American team now has a huge gap in its schedule this year.

It was a 55-over match that saw India lose by four wickets. Over the years lessons were learnt and India grew into a force to reckon with in ODI cricket - winning the World Cup in 1983 and 2011. As the team prepares to take on the West Indies in its 1000th ODI we pick 10 of its best victories in this format.

Lord’s 1983 World Cup final : India beat the West Indies in one of the most stunning results in cricket. It was a game changer. The most-watched final of a limited overs tournament which led to an incredible boost to cricket in India. From nobody India emerged the team to watch. The team has since assumed cult status in Indian cricket and there was a fitting tribute to the victory in the shape of a movie that celebrated the feat on the big screen. To this day the West Indians talk of the hurt that the loss caused.

Melbourne 1985 WCC final: The triumph was a confirmation of India’s growing status in ODI cricket. It also put a stamp of authority on India’s ability to play best on big occasions. The thumping victory against arch rival Pakistan was a wonderful gift for Sunil Gavaskar who was leading India for the last time. The bowlers played a huge role in the match and the opening stand of 103 between K. Srikkanth and Ravi Shastri killed the contest. Gavaskar running out counterpart captain Imran Khan with a direct hit was a standout moment from the match.

Imran’s six wickets were countered by Gavaskar’s exceptional fielding which won him the Player of the Match honours. A fascinating known by Mohd Azharuddin was one of the highlights. Overall a masterful show by a confident Indian team.

This Budget comes with a lot of baggage and hence high expectations — the republic will be turning 75 the economy is recovering from Covid-19 shock and regaining the growth momentum global winds of the taper tantrum rising crude oil prices and turmoil in Eastern Europe as well as in West Asia have potential to derail all projections. The finance minister had a tough job to navigate through these and provide the appropriate framework to continue robust recovery. The blueprint presented by the FM is resource-wise optimal implementation-wise feasible and paves the way ahead for short-term recovery and laying the long-term foundation for accelerated growth.

A robust increase in expenditure will definitely push economic recovery on a fast track. The total Budget expenditure of `39.6 lakh crore is a 50% increase from the expenditure of FY 2020-21. Capital expenditure being increased by 35.4% is a huge plus for infrastructure. PM Gati-Shakti scheme with a focus on seven areas will bring a transformative approach to infrastructure development.

The extension of ECLGS and steps to reduce delayed payments by introducing trust-based governance is a big step for MSMEs. Interlinking and expanding the scope of various portals along with the programme to make MSMEs resilient and competitive through RAMP is a much-needed initiative after the Covid-19 induced uncertainty in this sector. If implemented in the letter and spirit these initiatives will unleash the growth potential of the MSME sector and propel manufacturing to the next level. Equally welcome is the move to ease the shutting down of businesses. A mature innovation-led economy must equally welcome successes and accept failures.

Ease of doing business has been a consistent theme and special focus of this government for the last few years. As the FM mentioned reduction of 25000 compliances and repealing of 1486 union laws have fast-tracked the business process significantly. Introduction of Centralised Processing Centre-Green (CPC-Green) for all green clearances is the next logical step in this regard to reduce the time required for large infrastructure projects.

With the introduction of the digital rupee this Budget has not shied away from addressing the elephant in the room; the FM has not just paved the way for legitimate and credible Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) but also made sure that unregulated crypto menace will be kept in check.

A reform that will hopefully receive more attention in the coming Budgets is measures to reduce the very high level of food stocks that we are holding (4X buffer stock requirements). This approximately two lakh crore in dead capital along with accelerated PSU disinvestment can possibly cover a large portion of the projected spending on capex needs.

Most importantly the FM deserves applause for not venturing into populist measures and distributing freebies. Despite the fact that five major states including Uttar Pradesh have elections coming up the government has strictly focused on economic recovery and growth. Budget and politics can be decoupled which may be the most important signal for creating a mature and confident India.

Local authorities say they are now cooperating with their international counterparts after a Jamaican policewoman attached to the Zones of Special Operations (ZOSO) was jailed in the United States on accusations of being a major player in a lottery scamming operation. She has been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by wire and conspiracy to commit fraud by mail.

The 18-year veteran employed to the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) Shelian Cherine Allen who resides in Stonebrook Vista Trelawny and is stationed in the parish of St James is accused of running a lottery scamming organisation that is responsible for fleecing US$1.69 million from mainly elderly victims based in the United States.

The cop’s 20-year-old son who was also under investigation for lottery scamming was also arrested.

Allen is believed to have earned US$128000 from scamming between 2019 and 2021 under what law enforcement officers in an affidavit have referred to as the ‘Allen Lottery Scheme Organisation’.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

The affidavit was filed against her in the Eastern District Court of Wisconsin in Milwaukee on Wednesday February 2 after months of investigations and admission of guilt by a number of accomplices based in the US.

At least one of the 17 vulnerable or elderly victims identified lost her house plus US$150000 in the scam said the report.

Allen was detained when she tried to enter Fort Lauderdale in the United States in September 2021. Border control officers were able to confirm her involvement in the crimes based on statements collected from her co-conspirators the serial number in her iPhone 11 Pro the IMEI and her phone number.

Yesterday the JCF revealed that the 42-year-old has been suspended with immediate effect following her arrest on Friday. Allen who was previously suspended by the JCF on corruption allegations over two years ago was only reinstated in 2021.

ON THE RADAR

According to reports out of the United States the policewoman has been on the radar of the US Department of Homeland Security as one of the leaders of the scam since 2020. Monies were traced back to multiple accounts opened by Allen in the US including a PNC Bank account. She has been travelling between Jamaica and the US for months.

The investigation was a collaborative between the Brown County Sheriff’s Office in Green Bay Wisconsin; postal inspectors with the US Postal Inspection Service; and law enforcement agencies from the US and Jamaica.

Special agent with the Homeland Security Investigations Thomas Koch in his statement to the court said the defendant conspired with others to devise and carry out a telemarketing and mass marketing scheme that targeted vulnerable victims in order to defraud and to obtain money by means of materially false and fraudulent pretences representations and promises.

Allen and her co-conspirators reportedly identified elderly citizens who had access to financial resources and once targeted the organisation would contact the selected victim informing them they had won a large lottery which they called the ‘Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes’.

Victims were told they needed to pay fees in order to get their winnings and would be contacted by phone until all of their resources were depleted. Allen and her co-conspirators reportedly did so by unlawfully wilfully and knowingly conspiring together and agreeing to devise a scheme for the purpose of obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretences said the report.

The policewoman and her team are believed to have transferred the money or property by means of wire transfers postal money orders bulk cash transfers the mail and other means which affected interstate and/or foreign commerce.

“As a result of this conspiracy Allen has been able to fraudulently enrich herself as well as her co-conspirators while ruining the lives of many of the victims” said the sworn affidavit.

VICTIM SOLD HOUSE

According to the report the victim who alerted the police providing the catalyst for the investigation was contacted by the reported scammers in the summer of 2019 and told she had won US$18 million and a Mercedes-Benz. She was urged not to disclose the winnings to her bank because it was a secret.

The victim told the investigators that she received calls day and night from persons claiming to be lottery representatives with directives to send money in cash postal orders and personal and cashier’s cheques made out to different individuals both in the US and Jamaica.

The victim was also directed to send bulk cash in order to receive her winnings. She eventually sold her house trying to secure US$30000 to meet the demands of the scammers. The victim lost US$150000 in cash overall to the scheme.

Bank records obtained for Allen’s PNC Bank account show there were only two deposits into her account other than her initial account opening deposit. On February 14 2020 there was a deposit of a Fox Communities Credit Union Check #26444 in the amount of US$6000 from Victim-1 and on April 22 2020 there was a deposit of a Fox Communities Credit Union Check #1344 in the amount of US$4000 from Victim-1.

“These deposits are consistent with Allen being one of the primary beneficiaries of the scheme as the money from Victim-1 went directly to Allen’s account. On April 21 2020 the victim wrote a personal cheque in the amount of US$4000 payable to Allen” read the report.

The affidavit said bank records were obtained for Allen’s PNC Bank account From February 18 2020 to February 24 2020 the same period international travel confirms her in the US.

Those records indicate that there were six withdrawals from various ATMs located in Florida for a total of US$1731.90. Records also indicate that there were three debit card purchases at La Quinta Inns totalling US$831.68 from that account.

Additionally records indicate that there were 24 purchases at various retailers in Florida including Gap Outlet Marshalls Macy’s Foot Locker Old Navy Elegance Perfume Polo/Ralf Lauren and Victoria’s Secret for a total amount of US$2440.43.

The total amount withdrawn from the account for these transactions was US$5004.01.

SUSPENDED ON CORRUPTION CHARGES

Allen previously served the JCF while being attached to the Hanover Police Division and later moved over to St James where she served within the ZOSO in Mount Salem when it was first declared in 2017.

She was later suspended for alleged corruption and while off duty her family was struck by tragedy when the father of her child another police constable Rohan Bucknor was shot dead on the night of August 19 2019 while sitting in a barber chair in Petersfield Westmoreland.

Allen won her case against the JCF in 2021 was called back to the force and was since assigned to the ZOSO in Norwood St James.

Her colleagues within the Area One Police Division expressed shock on learning of her arrest in the US on Friday.

“A food woman that but mi still can’t believe that she mek dem ketch her again inna corruption and she just get back har job” one officer within the Norwood ZOSO told The Sunday Gleaner.

“None a wi can’t believe seh har family a go through so much bad luck and she mek dem catch har inna corruption. She shoulda tek heed after dem kill har babyfather inna Westmoreland. She get kick out a di force and fi imagine seh she get back a bly and come dash weh everything is a disgrace.”

Johnson & Johnson (J&J) withdrew its talc-based baby powder from sale in the US and Canada in 2020. Sales of baby powder had dropped after US regulators detected carcinogenic chrysotile fibres a type of asbestos in a sample.

The company is now facing more than 34000 lawsuits including many from women who claim they used baby powder and later developed ovarian cancer.

The shareholder vote has been proposed by Tulipshare a London-based investment platform that allows customers to pool shares in order to meet the threshold to submit resolutions for shareholder votes. The proposal has been submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) to consider if it is eligible ahead of J&J’s annual meeting expected in April.

Talc the world’s softest mineral is mined in several countries with uses across industries as diverse as paper plastics and pharmaceuticals. Talc’s astringent properties mean it is used to treat nappy rash and for other personal hygiene uses.

However talc deposits can sometimes be contaminated with asbestos a mineral that can cause cancer if its fibres enter the body. Corn starch can be used as a replacement.

J&J strongly denies that its baby powder is harmful and said it only pulled the product in North America after a slump in sales “fuelled by misinformation around the safety of the product”. A spokesperson pointed to a 2020 cohort study that found no statistically significant increased risk of ovarian cancer with talc use.

A spokesperson said: “We stand behind the ingredients we use in our products and Johnson & Johnson has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure our cosmetic talc is safe. Not only is our talc routinely tested to ensure it does not contain asbestos but our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories universities and global health authorities.”

The barrage of legal claims “have no valid scientific basis” the spokesperson said.

J&J’s lawyers Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom have written to the SEC asking that it exclude the shareholder resolution as ineligible because it would affect pending lawsuits in state and federal courts in the US and in other countries including “thousands of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer”.

J&J has already spent billions on costs and settlements including a $2bn (£1.5bn) judgment by a Missouri appeals court in favour of 22 plaintiffs who suffered from ovarian cancer. In October J&J moved the potential liabilities for talc products into a separate company which then entered bankruptcy in a highly controversial move that could limit its financial exposure.

Ian Lavery a Labour MP last year sponsored an early-day motion in parliament condemning the “hypercritical and unjustifiable” decision by J&J to continue to sell talcum powder products outside North America. Lavery said he welcomed the attempt to force a shareholder vote.

“It is shocking that products that we know can cause serious illness through contamination with asbestos are still available to buy in the UK or anywhere else in the world for that matter” he said.

“Any action taken against Johnson & Johnson who continue to profit handsomely from the sale of this harmful substance despite knowing its potential effects is welcome in my book.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyaW1zYnl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvbmV3cy9ncmltc2J5LW5ld3MvaW5zaWRlLWZvcm1lci1zY2FydGhvLWJhdGhzLWJlZm9yZS00OTQ2NTU30gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3JpbXNieXRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2dyaW1zYnktbmV3cy9pbnNpZGUtZm9ybWVyLXNjYXJ0aG8tYmF0aHMtYmVmb3JlLTQ5NDY1NTcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the former Scartho Baths before it was knocked down,"The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel

About six years have passed since bulldozers rolled in to flatten Scartho Baths.

Scartho Baths formerly on Scartho Road Grimsby closed its doors on December 20 2015.

But just days before its closure the £8.4 million swimming pool in Cromwell Road Grimsby opened.

To sign up for the Grimsby Live newsletterclick here.

The affectionately known Scartho Baths actually called Grimsby Swimming Pool was built by North East Lincolnshire Council in the 1960s.

It was enjoyed by recreational swimmers and swimming clubs including CADS and Grimsby Ladies Alexandra’s Grimsby Dolphins’ Swimming Club and Grimsby Santa Marina.

Bulldozers began to demolish the well-known building in July 2016 following the removal of asbestos from the Scartho Road buildings.

The cost of levelling the area was estimated to be around £1.2 million in total – including £498000 to clear the site and carry out isolation work and draining.

Take a trip down memory lane

In 2018 North East Lincolnshire Council's Cabinet pledged to build a new sports and leisure facility on the land where the Scartho Baths once stood as it approved its sports facility strategy for 2017 to 2030.

Now we have searched through Grimsby Live’s archive to bring you 10 pictures in the above video taken by Andy Kay in 2016 which show the inside of Scartho Baths before it was knocked down.

New data shared with City A.M. has revealed the UK’s top dealmakers of 2021. The figures come on the back of a record year for mergers & acquisitions which saw the completion of more than $5 trillion worth of deals.

JP Morgan’s James Robinson ranked as the UK’s top investment banker after topping MergerLink’s charts by brokering 10 deals worth more than £21.2bn.

Last year Robinson managing director at JP Morgan Cazenove played a role in brokering cybersecurity firm Norton’s $8bn (£5.9bn) merger with Avast and helped negotiate private equity fund EQT Partners $4.6bn acquisition of transport company First Group’s US bus businesses.

The UCL economics grad also brokered Blackstone’s £1.2 acquisition of British property development company St. Modwen Properties according to data from MergerLinks that has been shared exclusively with City A.M.

M&A boom

Alisdair Gayne head of investment at Barclays came in as the UK’s second top dealmaker after striking just three deals worth almost £18bn.

But KBC which was founded in 2016 is no longer just a handful of deal-makers working out of a WeWork near Amazon’s South Lake Union headquarters quietly tasked with growing the e-commerce giant's distribution network. The secretive firm has hired scores of high-level real estate professionals across the country signaling that its ambitions are to become something much greater than just Amazon’s broker of choice.

KBC Advisors has grown its ranks while it helped Amazon expand its logistics network.

Five years ago KBC had a headcount of roughly a dozen people based in one city but today it has more than 130 employees. It has hired more than 115 people since the start of 2019 alone according to a Bisnow analysis of employee LinkedIn pages. It opened offices in Atlanta Dallas and Nashville in 2020 sources told Bisnow before launching four new outfits last year alone: in New Jersey Chicago Phoenix and San Francisco.

Over the last three years it has hired at least 18 people from CBRE 13 people from Cushman & Wakefield and 11 people from JLL. Many of the hires were high-level brokers or executives at their previous firms including CBRE’s Philadelphia market leader an Avison Young principal a Cushman & Wakefield executive managing director and a JLL executive vice president.

The company’s growth has been fueled by the rapid expansion of Amazon’s logistics network. The tech giant leases more than 280M SF of industrial space across North America and industrial brokers and developers say KBC is typically involved any time Amazon builds or leases a warehouse.

“The first call you make when you have a new project is Amazon” said an industrial broker at a national firm who requested anonymity to talk about the e-commerce giant. “Except when you call Amazon you get KBC.”

But having the sector’s largest tenant as its client appears to no longer be enough for KBC. Recent hires and property listings indicate that the company is adding new clients and business lines which could become critical to sustaining KBC’s growth — its cash cow is getting set to slow down.

Amazon will start to “moderate” its physical warehouse investments Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call last week a move it says matches the slowing pace of growth of the underlying business.

“KBC is at the mercy of Amazon’s decisions. So if they’re not doing deals and if you own KBC wouldn’t you start looking at other stuff too?” said a source who has done business with KBC and spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I think KBC is also always going to have Amazon’s business but I think to be at the mercy of one client I think they want to get ahead of it if things slow down or change.”

Bisnow spoke to 11 industrial market sources for this story including brokers and developers across the country. Many of them chose to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of working with Amazon which often requires confidentiality agreements from its partners on real estate deals.

Bisnow also reached out to more than two dozen KBC employees who have joined the firm over the last three years but none agreed to participate in an interview. A KBC executive who runs the firm’s communications efforts declined to comment for this story.

The company doesn’t appear to have ever spoken publicly about its growth strategy but its website sheds some light on its philosophy.

“Many people remark how KBC is uncommonly different” the firm’s Careers page reads. “We’re proud of that. Long ago we traded bureaucracy for something much better. The chance to disrupt and revolutionize an industry.”

Industrial professionals have held largely positive views of KBC and its presence in the market given that the firm helped developers and their brokers land Amazon and the reliable revenue and increased value that comes with having the tech giant as a tenant. But that could change as KBC expands more into other business lines and begins competing more with other brokerage firms for talent and deals.

“They could become a force in the industry” a prominent industrial developer told Bisnow. “KBC is leaning toward becoming a full brokerage company who does all the services. Basically in competition to CBRE JLL and the others.”

Inside KBC’s Growth

KBC was founded in 2016 by John Hanson and Todd Meldahl but the duo had been working on Amazon’s industrial real estate strategy long before launching the firm.

The relationship between the brokers and the tech giant began in the late 1990s when Hanson was at CBRE and one of his colleagues at the firm Rick Diedrich left to join Amazon Insider reported last month. Diedrich then brought on Hanson to help scale up the company’s industrial footprint.

Hanson maintained Amazon as a client through the 2000s as he left CBRE to work for Trammell Crow and then Cushman & Wakefield according to a 2017 report by the Puget Sound Business Journal. Meldahl joined Hanson’s team at C&W in 2007 and the two then left to launch KBC in 2016. They were joined by several other C&W colleagues and as of September 2017 KBC had 13 employees operating out of a WeWork near Amazon’s headquarters the PSBJ reported at the time.

But the assignment of expanding Amazon’s industrial real estate footprint has for years been a rapidly growing job. The e-commerce giant added 100M SF of logistics space in 2020 alone to bring its portfolio to 285M SF across North America. It doubled its spending on its network last year it said in its earnings report last week outlaying $30B between leases and build-to-suit developments.

Amazon controls more than twice as much warehouse space as its closest competitor Walmart according to CoStar. Behind all of that growth is KBC development sources who spoke to Bisnow confirmed — it is involved in virtually all of Amazon’s logistics deals negotiating for leases developments and acquisitions on behalf of the behemoth.

“They do every single industrial deal with Amazon throughout the country and Canada” said a source who has done business with KBC. The source added that KBC even has dedicated brokers who lease parking lots for Amazon’s delivery vehicles. “There’s not a deal that would go by that they’re not involved.”

You would hardly know it if you were tracking Amazon’s deals in the press.

KBC’s name has been mentioned publicly on Amazon deals in only a handful of instances: It was connected to Amazon’s 1M SF lease at DFW Commerce Center in Dallas a 250K SF lease at Victoria Station in Sonoma California and a 125K SF lease in Loveland Colorado all in 2020 as well as Amazon’s 470K SF lease at Lakewood Logistics Center II in Colorado last year.

“They’re sort of like the Keyser Söze of real estate right now. When Amazon comes to a market no one dares say it’s an Amazon deal because they’ve got heavy nondisclosures” said MK Asset Management principal Hugh Williams a Chicago-based industrial broker. “Everyone knows it’s an Amazon deal. It’s a very interesting thing that when Amazon is doing a deal people know it’s Amazon but they’re not allowed to say the name. I think there’s a fear of Amazon in some ways.”

One of the many Amazon distribution centers that have popped up in major cities across the U.S.

In cities where KBC doesn’t have on-the-ground staff the secretive firm will partner with local brokers multiple sources said. Industry insiders say the finger-to-lips approach has to do with the level of intelligence KBC has from working with the biggest occupier in the industry which also happens to be a notoriously data-driven company.

“They likely don’t want to tout what they’re up to because they are operating ahead of the curve so they do fly below the radar” said Chesapeake Real Estate Group principal Matt Laraway a Maryland industrial developer who said he has worked with KBC on around five deals. “When they come to work with us they’re usually several steps ahead of their competition more well-informed and ready to go.”

KBC’s Hiring Spree

As Amazon’s logistics network has grown exponentially in the last three years so has its industrial broker of choice.

Five years after it had roughly a dozen staffers KBC’s website lists 126 employees on its “team” page. Insider reported its headcount has reached 160 people as of last month and a Bisnow review of LinkedIn pages found that more than 130 people list KBC as their employer on LinkedIn 117 of whom have joined the company since the start of 2019.

The hiring binge has happened stealthily over the last three years — KBC doesn’t issue press releases with announcements of major hires which is common practice at other brokerage firms.

These new employees have come to KBC with a variety of specialties including leasing acquisitions debt origination data research valuation accounting property conversions and geographic information systems mapping according to their LinkedIn profiles.

“They're out in the marketplace and they're trying to steal as many brokers as possible” said an industrial broker at a firm that has seen multiple departures to KBC. “They're poaching people left and right. And to be totally honest I don't understand what even their business model is going to be. And I don't know if they're quite clear yet.”

Many of these hires have come from the nation’s three largest commercial real estate services firms.

CBRE has lost 18 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including high-level professionals such as Adam Mullen the firm’s former Philadelphia market leader and Ryan Keiser a former Dallas-based executive vice president.

Cushman & Wakefield has lost 13 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including a four-person New Jersey-based leasing team — former Executive Managing Director Jason Goldman Executive Managing Director Marc Petrella Managing Director Michael Kimmell and Director Andrew Siemsen — plus former Southern California-based Senior Director Ryan Bos.

JLL has lost 11 people to KBC since the start of 2019 including former Nashville-based Executive Vice President Bo Fulk former managing director and Western U.S. head of industrial capital markets Bo Mills and former Los Angeles-based Managing Director Tony Muscio (who was in JLL’s hotels group).

CBRE Cushman & Wakefield and JLL all declined to comment on the departures.

KBC’s hires have been focused around its headquarters and the largest industrial markets in the country over the last three years according to employee LinkedIn pages. It has hired 50 people in Seattle 14 in Dallas nine in Atlanta seven in Los Angeles and six each in New Jersey and Nashville.

“They’ve picked up some of the best professionals in the country” Laraway said. “They have attracted best-in-class talent market-to-market.”

Bisnow spoke with two industrial brokers in different parts of the U.S. who have been approached over the past three years to work at KBC. The firm pitched to one of them the depth and richness of its data compared to global brokerage firms and data quality is a big factor for brokers in considering places of employment the broker said.

“These big firms the JLL the CBs are constantly touting their big data” the broker said. “I think [KBC is] well aware of how important that is to brokers.”

The office building converted from a former bottling plant where KBC maintains its Seattle office.

KBC’s ability to hire top-level talent away from the largest firms in commercial real estate signals to some industry insiders that it is offering generous compensation packages. The brokers who had discussions about working for KBC said the conversations were preliminary and compensation wasn’t discussed.

“I can tell you there’s no executive managing director from a big firm who’s going to go from one firm to another without significant financial upside they just don’t do it” Williams said. “So that alone tells me that there’s got to be a compensation model there that’s unique because it’s hard to get a group of people like that to leave.”

But even brokers working for firms that have been harvested by KBC and have seen their industry bend to Amazon’s will said they have had positive interactions with the brokerage firm.

“They’re great guys those KBC guys. They treated me overly fair” Cushman & Wakefield Senior Director Gordon Benedict told Bisnow. “I think you’ll be hard-pressed to find anybody that says anything bad about them.”

‘Are They Competitors Or Are They Friends?’

There are more than 120000 commercial real estate outfits in the U.S. with a combined annual revenue of $112B according to research firm Dun & Bradstreet. But there are few built like KBC.

“I don't know anyone [who] can look at the landscape and say ‘You know what the market needs? Another brokerage firm’” one Southeast-based broker said. “But they have Amazon in their back pocket.”

KBC is one of a few industrial-focused brokerage shops with national reach and its access to Amazon’s wealth of data could give it an edge in a crowded competitive market if it wants it.

“They have talent. Having that client as your customer is such a big hammer” one landlord told Bisnow. “Everybody wants to do business with them. A lot of the big landlords are going to give you listings because they’re going to want to be in your good graces.”

KBC’s run of notable hires has many speculating about the future of the Seattle firm and whether that future will remain tied to Amazon. Many of the brokers KBC has hired have books of business and years of relationships they brought with them.

“I think when you build your business I don’t want to say on the back of but in relationship with one client one of the things it does is it gives you confidence” said Wendy Berger the CEO of Chicago-based industrial developer WBS Equities.

Berger founded WBS in 2004 developing food storage facilities for Arbor Investments. Her business has diversified since then although Arbor still accounts for some 70% of WBS revenue. While Berger said she is unfamiliar with KBC it makes sense that the firm would look to add other customers outside of Amazon.

“Maybe [KBC is] saying they know they've had this amazing momentum now we need to build off of it” she said. “When you build your business on one client you're not focused on the external factors you're focused on your client.”

On its website KBC lists four main lines of business: capital markets agency leasing tenant representation and site selection. It has beefed up each of these divisions with its wave of hires.

The Prologis-owned warehouse in Hayward California that KBC has on its listings page.

The firm has a property listings page where it highlights industrial properties that KBC brokers are marketing for lease across the country. The page features 59 total listings across the U.S. including 28 in the Seattle market 10 around San Francisco 10 in New York and New Jersey and six near Nashville.

It is marketing buildings for national landlords many of whom have leased millions of square feet to Amazon including Prologis Black Creek Group Principal Nicola Wealth Management Duke Realty Velocis and CenterPoint Properties.

“They’re seeing every single site around the country and Amazon’s not taking every single site so why not approach that owner and try to lease it for them?” said a source who has done business with KBC.

“They are doing more deals with all these national industrial companies — Panattoni Seefried Ryan Hillwood — these guys are doing so many deals with them it’s like why not start an agency leasing and go rep Panattoni or Ryan? They’re doing so many deals with those guys those guys need to hire brokers as well. So it’s a perfect marriage.”

In at least a handful of publicly reported projects KBC was engaged in real estate deals that didn’t involve Amazon. The firm filed permits last year to begin construction on a $1.5M 350K SF warehouse in DeSoto Texas according to the Dallas Morning News. In December KBC's Goldman and Himmel — two former C&W brokers — helped sell a 13500 SF warehouse in New Jersey to an epoxy company.

KBC has infused itself with both capital markets and development acumen in the past couple of years. Multiple sources noted that KBC’s hire of Mills the former JLL leader as its president of capital markets suggests KBC is aggressively looking to list more just than Amazon-leased warehouses.

“Are they trying to become a national brokerage firm? We’ve seen them ask for listings. Been told they’re doing brokerage work for other people” one Mid-Atlantic industrial developer said. ""Are they trying to create an independent brokerage shop that handles not only Amazon but everything else? Or are they trying to milk this for everything they can?""

The skill sets KBC has acquired along with its access to a treasure trove of site selection and real estate data amassed by Amazon over the years means the firm “could become a force in the industry” someday soon one national developer told Bisnow.

“I think there are a lot of questions: Are they competitors or are they friends?"" a Chicago-area broker said. “I think people are still trying to figure that out.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzNWNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9vaGlvLXBvbGl0aWNzL3Byb2N0ZXItYW5kLWdhbWJsZS1oZWlyZXNzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWJpbGwtdG8tc3RvcC10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtdGVzdGluZy1wLWctaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter and Gamble heiress proposes bill to stop type of animal testing,"COLUMBUS Ohio — The heiress of Procter and Gamble a multi-billion dollar consumer goods company is proposing legislation in the Ohio House to stop cosmetics testing on animals. P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

The Budget Estimates (BE) for 2020-21 had pegged the gross tax collection at Rs 24.23 lakh crore which was slashed to Rs 19 lakh crore in the Revised Estimates despite the increase in petrol and diesel duty in March and May 2020.

The government attributed the reduction in the tax collection estimate to COVID-19 in 2020. However tax collection has started declining in the previous financial year. From Rs 20.80 lakh crore in 2018-19 the number had reduced to Rs 20.10 lakh crore in 2019-20.

Noticeably the Centre had reduced the BE for gross tax collection for 2021-22 to Rs 22.17 lakh from Rs 24.23 lakh crore in 2020-21. Clearly the government was shying away from the responsibility of raising resources in a big way to help the poor who were the worst affected during the pandemic.

The NDA government has been surrendering its options of raising more resources. The 2015 Budget abolished the wealth tax. In September 2019 the Lok Sabha passed the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill 2019 to reduce the corporate tax from 30% to 22% a decision which even according to official estimates suggested could lead to a loss of about Rs 150000 crore in one year in terms of availability of resources. What was the tearing hurry to reduce the corporate tax which further eroded the resources urgently needed to help the poor in the middle of the year was never clear. The 2020 Budget abolished the dividend distribution tax.

Such regressive changes have increased the dependence on indirect taxes which is shared more equally by all people as opposed to direct taxes which specifically target the rich and the superrich. However even in the case of indirect taxes it is possible to target the rich more to a limited extent.

The government has been increasing the excise duty on fuels whose burden is shared directly and also indirectly in the form of increasing prices of a wide range of items of daily use whose transportation cost increases.

The government has also taken other measures that benefit corporate entities resulting in low tax collection. For example the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) Authority Bill 2019 deals mainly with customers outside the jurisdiction of the domestic economy. It provides for the creation of an Authority that would develop and regulate the financial services market in IFSCs. India set up its first IFSC in the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar Gujarat. GIFT City has been ranked tenth in the Global Financial Centres Index.

In its review of the IFSC titled ‘Decoding the Priorities: An Analysis of Union Budget 2020-21’ the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA) Delhi said: “The IFSC enjoys numerous tax concessions such as tax holidays to firms operating in the IFSC along with exemptions on transaction taxes and stamp duties. Capital gains tax does not apply to a transfer of derivatives and certain securities by non-residents in a stock exchange established in the IFSC including transfers received in foreign currency.”

Explaining the risks posed by speculative investment the CBGA said; “The IFSC incentivises instruments and activities related to speculative investment which is of great concern for the Indian economy as it can potentially hamper the country’s macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth rate and employment growth rate. Furthermore this has significant impacts on the government’s revenue as the IFSC provides for substantive tax exemptions and tax holidays which may be used for tax abuse.”

In another review in 2022 the CBGA noted the government’s continued shift in the international taxation policy. “There already exist incentives on capital gains stamp duties transaction taxes and other levies at the IFSC—all aimed at stimulating investment including in short-term and speculative forms.”

The increased incentives “include exempting any investment division of a foreign bank from taxation incentives for relocating foreign funds as well as complete tax deductions for companies dealing with aircraft operations registered at the IFSC” the CBGA noted.

“This along with the reduced corporate tax rate the abolition of the Dividend Distribution Tax the tax holidays and capital gains deductions from start-ups and the incentives for infrastructure investment for foreign Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds represents the continued shift of the international taxation policy.”

Various studies have drawn attention to the unprecedented number of Indians being pushed into poverty in recent times which has also been confirmed by United Nations data. At the same time inequality has also spiked with the biggest increase in the number of billionaires and the concentration of wealth in their hands so far.

The pandemic warranted more taxes on the rich to help the poor. However the government has provided more fiscal concession to the rich and the superrich.

An obscure chartered accountant from Jaipur Bhansali made his first pile by setting up shell finance companies cooking up some accounts and balancesheets for them and selling them off to crooked businessmen who needed such companies to rotate their black money. In 1985 Bhansali set up CRB Capital Markets which started merchant banking operations marketing public issues. Its list of clients is a litany of the insignificant and the fly-by-night but that list was longer than any other merchant banker's in the country. Naturally since Bhansali was willing to handle any issue at all with scant attention to the ethics and responsibilities of his profession. By 1994 Bhansali was ready to get into a bigger business: mutual funds. With SEBI(I) giving him the nod in 1994 he launched the CRB Arihant Mangal Fund and amazingly raised something around Rs 230 crore when funds with far better pedigrees could not raise even half the amount. It is now revealed that of this amount only Rs 6.25 crore came from small investors. Where did the rest come from? For that take a look at CRB Arihant's investment pattern. Eighty per cent of its corpus was in just 65 scrips while the remaining 20 per cent was distributed over 289 scrips. And around 30 of the 65 scrips on which Bhansali has been so bullish are in unquoted securities. What almost definitely happened was that Bhansali rounded up his pals in a quid pro quo deal. They routed their money into Bhansali's mutual fund which routed it back to them by buying shares in their companies from them. That's the oldest trick in town but no one in authority appears to have moved a finger though rumours about CRB have been rife in financial circles from day one. By now Bhansali was getting really ambitious. The next step-and the crucial one that would close his money-making circle was to set up a bank. The merchant banking division would manage shady share issues raising money from the unsuspecting public and rerouting crooked promoters' funds. Many of these companies would anyway be finance companies which would redirect money into Bhansali's NBFC and mutual fund which would keep the moolah flowing in an ever-widening circle with Bhansali and his clients/partners taking their cut out at every orbit. With the bank in operation Bhansali would have access to more public savings than ever before and that circle would reach its apogee moving funds faster and faster wider and wider. Of course CRB got the RBI in principle approval to set up his bank in Bhubaneshwar. Why he got it when applicants like the Tatas and Birlas (Aditya Birla group) were refused a banking license is naturally a question worth pondering. Could it have had something to do with Bhansali recruiting ex-State Bank of India chief M.K. Sinha as the head of his banking outfit? Could it have had to do with his supposed closeness to Janata Party MP Subramanian Swamy who sources claim could have pushed a few levers here and there? Then in November 1996 a routine RBI inspection revealed that the CRB group was misusing public funds and misreporting income. The RBI withdrew its banking approval but Bhansali coolly issued his Esteem Bonds and raised money to actually feed the promoter's contribution in his bank. Where did Bhansali mess up? He needed more and more money to feed his cycle and his supplies were not matching his demand for once the cycle is set in motion it's hard to get off. He started offering absurd incentives for making FDs in his company and began borrowing at exorbitant rates from the inter-corporate market. Much of that money would go into servicing his depositors paying back their principal and interest. The cycle was fast turning vicious and the only way he could have saved his empire was to set up the bank and mobilise a new large source of cheap funds. That did not happen. So he tried the last trick in his book. CRB serviced its depositors through the SBI. The company paid SBI the money required in advance every three months and against this the SBI would encash the interest warrants and refund orders that CRB depositors sent the bank. In February CRB quietly stopped making the advance payments. Amazingly no one in the SBI seemed to have noticed. That the SBI suddenly was inundated with redemption requests points to a colluded conspiracy to defraud the bank. The bank kept encashing the cheques till the figure hit the Rs 60 crore mark when someone sat up and took notice. Then the cheques started bouncing and the faecal matter hit the air generator. Chain Roop Bhansali is however still absconding. While rumours about him being sighted at places ranging from Canada to Hong Kong and Peru abound the Central Bureau of Investigation is convinced that Bhansali is still in India. There are even rumours that he could be hiding in a prominent politician's home in Delhi or Chandigarh. For Bhansali has never lacked friends in need. Are You Interested? CRB could be just the tip of the iceberg as other finance companies struggle to raise funds. By SHEKHAR GHOSH YOU can almost smell them by now. The symptoms of diseased non-banking finance companies (NBFCS) are like those of an epidemic: flashy brochures media hype ambitious plans and diversifications fancy recruitments at fancier salaries. ""When the ego of an NBFC starts riding piggyback on the promoter's id it's time to run away as fast and as far as you can"" says a BSE broker. CRB is the classic case—from the sudden hype claiming dubiously to be the number one merchant banker in the country to C.R. Bhansali's pathetic attempts at snatching influential positions. He failed to become chairman of the Association of Merchant Bankers of India. Organising seminars on financial markets where he himself would be a prominent speaker was another route to respectability. The CRB Foundation for philanthropic and religious activities also helped. The reality is that the CRB debacle will be felt by 45000-odd finance companies in India. How risk-free are the fixed deposits that many of these companies are offering? Though several NBFCS had managed to land respectable ratings from credit rating agencies the high interest rates offered by these companies should have made the investors suspicious. Many of them were offering FD rates of 18 and 19 per cent with broker incentives of 12 per cent plus free gifts ranging from thermos flasks to colour televisions. The cost of funds for these NBFCs come to over 30 per cent. To make even a minimal profit they would have to lend it at 35-40 per cent. Says G.C. Garg managing director of Lloyds Finance: ""investors should have been aware that anyone paying such high interest rates were certain to default in repayment of principal."" The very nature of the NBFC business too make the companies vulnerable to asset-liability mismatches. Most NBFCS use fixed deposits as their source of funds. Typically their borrowings have one-year terms. But the businesses most of them indulge in are leasing or hire purchase which mean an average lock-in period of three to five years. In essence they were borrowing for one year and blocking up funds for between three and five years. Thus every year they needed to raise fresh FDs just to repay the old amounts. This worked as long as interest rates were rising. But with a falling interest regime the bottom was bound to fall out. Besides instead of blocking the funds in leasing many NBFC's started resorting to paper leases without any assets to exploit depreciation and tax benefits. Lack of growth has forced many NBFCs to defer their tax liabilities from one year to the next. ""Future tax liabilities of these companies will be far more than their net worth. ITC Classic's net worth is already in the negative to the tune of Rs 473 crore. The cumulative effect on non-performing assets will be almost exponential"" says a dealer at NSE.. ""In three years the deferred tax liabilities alone could wipe off over 50 per cent of the NBFCS. "" MANY would also be very highly leveraged. After the prosperous markets of 1994 and 1995 many companies have been left holding worthless paper the result of bought-out deals or fly-by-night new issue operators. At the BSE 358 NBFCS are languishing below issue prices. Sixteen are quoted at issue prices while only 357 are quoted above their issue prices. According to market observers the CRB fiasco will only accelerate the shakeout and several NBFCS could be wiped but as investors get choosy. The RBI has shortlisted 10 major companies for closer monitoring of their activities: ITC Classic Peerless IFB Finance Ceat Financial Services Prudential Capital Markets Pressman Srei International Magna Leasing and Jenson & Nicholson Financial Services. And yet some 17 NBFCS all of the above included have also been registered by the RBI as satellite dealers in the specialised high-volume low-margin government securities market. Strange for companies like Kotak Mahindra and DSP Merrill Lynch were given the satellite dealerships much after little known names with unproven records like RR Financial Consultants Foresight Financial Consultants Hoare (India) Securities Dil Vikas Finance Prudential Stock & Securities and A.K. Capital Services. ""This is what makes the RBI suspect"" says a banker alluding to the political connections of the promoters of several of these ""dark horses"". For instance sources refer to the political connections of the Calcutta-based Vinod Bald-promoted Prudential Stock & Securities which has taken over the dubious mantle of. ""No I merchant banker"" from CRB. Having acquired Sikkim Bank last year the Hyderabad branch of the bank was inaugurated by none other than TDP MP Renuka Chowdhry and Prabhakar Rao Narasimha Rao's son. The papers carried huge ads of the inauguration to drive the political connection home. For the time being the attempt is to avoid a run on the NBFCS. Even the bluest of the blue chips are running scared. Soon after the CRB exposure Anagram Finance issued an ad saying they are open 24 hours primarily to evade a psychological run on their FD withdrawals. Some NBFCS are also selling their assets like no other. A lot of assets are being sold in the bourses these days mainly by finance companies desperate to recover whatever liquidity they can. Market experts are betting that several NBFCS Will soon be offered on the auction block. ITC tried to sell off ITC Classic but there were no buyers. ""Classic may be the first but some of the blue-chip companies are also being negotiated at ridiculous prices"" says a chartered accountant. Call it the wages of sin. WARNING SIGNALS Before putting your money in an NBFC fixed deposit check out the following points: * Is the company offering a very high interest rate and hefty incentives? * Has the company shot to prominence in the last few years growing very fast? * Has it suddenly begun advertising heavily especially on television? * Does it list plantations and real estate among its principal businesses? * Is your fixed deposit broker pushing the company very strongly to you? If the answer to any two of these questions is yes think twice. RBI Governor R. Rangarajan claims he was not aware of the irregularities in the way CRB was using public money. HOW THE SYSTEM FAILED CREDIT RATING AGENCIES Rating agency CARE assigned an A rating signifying investor safety to CRB's FD programme in September 1996 after noting in its report that CRB had liquidity problems defaulted on loans and that its asset quality was deteriorating. After RBI stopped CRB from raising fresh FDs; CARE which claims to have been monitoring CRB all through woke up and downgraded its rating quickly to C denoting high investment risk. THE AUDITORS CRB's Calcutta-based auditors D.P.Bhaiya and Company never pointed out any irregularities in CRB's operations Though the firm would have had to be blind to miss them. Just as ITC Classic's problems remained unreported by its auditors till the company collapsed. The company-auditor nexus is suspected to be fairly common in the country's financial services industry. THE RBI The July 1996 RBI gave an in-principle banking license to CRB a rare honour. In November an RBI inspection showed massive irregularities but did nothing about it while CRB happily went on collecting FDs. In December RBI put the banking license on hold but turned a blind eye to CRB raising money for its bank. Only when reports started appearing in the media in April did RBI cancel the license and stop CRB from collecting FDS. THE SEBI SEBI remained a bystander while CRB managed scores of shady share issue to become the number 1 merchant banker in the country. SEBI gave CRB permission to start a mutual fund and a share custodial service. In April 1996 when SEBI discovered irregularities in CRB's mutual fund it barred it from launching any new schemes. For just two months. THE SBI CRB's depositors encashed their interest warrants and refund orders through SBI. CRB was supposed to deposit the amounts in advance with SBI every three months. In February CRB stopped this pre-funding and continued to issue warrants and orders which SBI faithfully honoured perhpas reassured by the fact that a former SBI chief was on the CRB board. Only when the unpre-funded payouts hit a staggering Rs 60 crore did the bank wake up.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You're probably looking for some combination of better privacy (from snooping ISPs advertisers or governments) increased online security (who knows who else is on that public Wi-Fi node?) or even more flexible video streaming options. Unlike mobile operating systems (two main options) or US mobile providers (three basic choices) you might be impressed with the range of VPN providers available to you. At first glance you'll see at least a dozen options. However many of the biggest names in the industry today -- and some of CNET's top VPN picks -- are owned by just three parent companies. And those ""big three"" have gotten even larger in just the past few months thanks to an increasing wave of VPN consolidation. Pair that with the deliberately opaque and multinational ownership structure of many VPNs and it's becoming even trickier to make sense of which providers are owned or controlled by which parent companies.

To be clear the pace of mergers and acquisitions in the business world at large -- and the technology and media space in particular -- has never been frothier. Last year was a record year and with new 2022 deals like Microsoft-Activision and Sony-Bungie 2022 is already looking like a monster. Industries tend to consolidate over time and that process can sometimes bring smoother economies of scale (your Amazon Prime account now works at Whole Foods for instance). But it can also have undesirable effects on consumers. For starters consolidation often impedes or outright kills healthy competition in a given industry ultimately driving prices up for consumers while reducing the incentive for companies to innovate and improve their services for their customers.

In the VPN industry consumer privacy is paramount which means transparency is critical whenever one company acquires or merges with another. As a VPN user you want to have a clear picture of which corporate entities have access to and are controlling your data and who if anyone that data is shared with. In the wake of a merger or acquisition that picture is too often fuzzy creating confusion for existing and new subscribers about who controls their data and which legal jurisdictions and rules are in effect. That latter point can be a matter of life and death for users like dissidents and journalists -- or even just citizens looking to access the web beyond the firewall of an authoritarian government.

Mergers and acquisitions are often glazed with catch lines like ""joining forces"" and ""teaming up"" -- usually to bring ""even more value to our customers."" But consumers should be aware of how these deals affect them and their data privacy particularly when it's happening in the VPN industry.

To help you understand which parent companies you're entrusting with your privacy when you use one of these VPNs we've broken things out. These are the three companies that own and control many of the biggest names in the VPN industry today. The data here is based on public disclosures including the companies' own websites and press releases. For a more detailed (but slightly outdated) look at industry ownership you should also check out this detailed January 2022 report from VPN Pro.

Note that CNET is in the process of updating the reviews and rankings of our top VPN picks in light of these recent ownership changes.

Kape Technologies Plc (Formerly Crossrider Plc)

Kape Technologies owns at least four noteworthy VPNs the biggest being its most recent acquisition ExpressVPN. The company adopted its current name in 2018 partly to distance itself from its troubling past: It produced the Crossrider adware that allowed third parties to manipulate internet users' browser traffic.

Other notable holdings: Kape Technologies also owns prominent review sites vpnMentor and WizCase -- disclosures to this end can be found at the top of both websites. But as Restore Privacy has reported many of the Kape-owned brands above jumped in their rankings after the review sites came under the Kape umbrella calling their objectivity into question. (Kape didn't return CNET's earlier request for comment on those reports.)

Ziff Davis (Formerly J2 Global Inc.)

Ziff Davis formerly J2 Global acquired IPVanish StrongVPN and Encrypt.me from Stackpath in April 2019 for an undisclosed amount.

IPVanish: Read CNET's IPVanish review

Strong VPN: Encrypt.me (which acquired Buffered VPN in November 2019) has merged with StrongVPN along with ibVPN and SaferVPN.

Other notable holdings: Ziff Davis also owns a wide variety of technology sites (Ookla Down Detector Encrypt.me) and media outlets including Mashable IGN and PCMag.com. Note that despite the legacy branding ZDNet hasn't been part of the Ziff Davis corporate family since CNET completed its acquisition of the brand back in 2002.

Nord Security (Tesonet)

Nord Security is the parent company behind various cybersecurity tools including NordVPN and now Atlas VPN as well as Surfshark. Tesonet meanwhile is the Lithuanian IT business incubator that helped NordVPN and Surfshark get off the ground in their early days. Lithuanian entrepreneur Tom Okman is the co-founder of both Nord Security and Tesonet. Nord tells CNET that the Nord Security team has always operated independently of Tesonet. Nevertheless the management overlap between the two companies is notable.

Other notable holdings: Tesonet also lists Hostinger a prominent web host as a company it's helped create and/or invested in.",,,,,,,,,,,,

COVID-19 has also brought with it a fresh set of data challenges driven by the need for remote working and learning and the sheer amount of e-learning video data generated as a result. Across the board the ongoing pandemic has forced a whole reappraisal of institutional data storage needs within the education sector.



Old architectures and processes suddenly no longer fit the current educational environment. These factors bring storage considerations to ‘life’ prompting discussions about how to manage diverse data types data needs and architectures.



COVID response



In the early stages of the pandemic IT practices were largely reactive due to the lack of ‘coping’ methods such as policies for long-term remote working e-learning and data access within pre-existing IT strategies. And although things have settled IT leaders may be dealing with the aftershock of this for some time – creating yet more complexity in their roles.



Universities and research institutes alike have unique signifiers and sensitivities that define their approach to data management. These attributes explored in



• Research data volume. As opposed to the lighter touch approach of agile business organisations universities often find themselves contending with vast quantities of data related to research.



From enrolment to graduation these rich learning environments are exponentially generating unpredictable amounts of different data types – smart video video conferences courses tests results research images lectures and unstructured data to name but a few – that need to be properly protected and stored. As a result of this individual file sizes like video can be enormous.



This places additional strain on the data storage infrastructure within which they are managed. Naturally this impacts the storage solutions IT leaders choose to work with and the capabilities these technologies are required to provide in terms of security performance sharing and compliance.



• Organisational diversity. Universities are distinct from general business organisations because they perform a myriad of additional functions in addition to core research and operational management.



Educational organisations process personal and sensitive information about their staff and students such as financial data medical and personal records and so on.



All that information can be subject to specific local compliance requirements most notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that all European institutions need to abide by. Therefore having storage solutions that can comply with the proper encryption is crucial.



• Committee decision-making. Unlike the hierarchical management structure of large businesses educational institutions are decentralised and flatter. Any decision-making on the types of data storage solutions to use tends to be made on a committee basis as opposed to purely by senior management.



This type of decision-making challenges conventional ways where the divide between ownership and stewardship of data is more distinct.



While IT may not always know where the value resides in the data and academics and faculty may also not understand the intricacies of data storage and management in universities there is an effort to make decisions with an understanding of each other’s perspective.



• Collaboration culture. The traditionally open ethos of universities and their culture of collaboration and sharing of data and research is again distinct from the commonplace strategies pursued in businesses which adopt a more secretive approach to data in order to maintain a market advantage over their competitors.



Data sharing is a fundamental requirement in academia and so can drive the requirements in choosing more bespoke IT solutions.



The transactional process of sharing data between universities is particular to each institution. While most universities take full advantage in the exchange of data across their departments the way they share it externally differs.



For instance a representative of a public university in northern Italy spoke of using shared cloud storage whereas their IT counterpart at a public university in Scotland instead relies on the platforms of other universities.



Cloud storage and data governance



Some IT leaders give a lot of autonomy to ‘super users’ of data storage such as researchers within universities as their work drives the value of the educational institution.



A university in London spoke of modelling their data storage architecture according to the needs of their ‘super user’ researchers. Their sophisticated use of the IT infrastructure means that this data-literate cohort needs to have a key role in infrastructure decision-making.



Universities are taking advantage of cloud technology to a degree. However given the data attributes that education IT leaders work with and their storage priorities on-premises solutions are still used.



According to the report currently under a third of data in total is stored in the cloud – even less sometimes for research institutes.



One research institute in Germany stored 15 times more data on-premises as compared to the cloud. And while some are looking to move the dial in favour of the cloud both scale and the sensitivity of data are hampering greater cloud storage adoption.



Naturally this varies between the types of institutes and the data attributes. For example the research found that cloud use is more heavily favoured in cases where there is much data sharing and in smaller universities.



In addition to the four categories detailed above there is another distinct challenge facing the education sector’s data governance. Most universities surveyed have some element of data governance in place. However policies vary in complexity and frequently ‘tier’ data types according to sensitivity and value.



These policies often also determine whether data can be stored in the cloud or on-premises which can be linked to GDPR a notable concern for European universities.



For example operational data (financial data) and student data would likely be placed in the GDPR-sensitive tier whereas archival data that is not often used would likely fall into the low priority camp.



Data storage is complex and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution and both cloud and on-premises have a place. According to the survey cloud is generally viewed as the future among most IT leaders surveyed but on-premises solutions are still widely used.



Regardless of the solution it must demonstrate value scale easily and be an enabler of the future priorities and plans of the university. It must also balance levels of security and compliance as well as smooth workflows and capacity requirements for students academia and faculty.



Davide Villa is director of business development for Europe Middle East Africa and India at Western Digital. Data storage is a key requirement for any organisation.

ASUS Zenfone 6

There are a couple of reasons that make the ASUS Zenfone 6 a great device. The handset offered flagship specs at a mid-range price tag. It also packs a large 5000mAh battery and runs a near-stock version of Android.

Another interesting feature is its flip-up camera. This design approach allowed ASUS to create a phone without a notch or a punch-hole for the camera giving the Zenfone 6 a high screen-to-body ratio.

Of course the low price tag means ASUS had to cut a few corners. The phone doesn’t support wireless charging has an LCD screen instead of the OLED one found on most high-end phones and isn’t resistant to water. Yet it’s still one of the best Snapdragon 855 phones you can currently buy.

OnePlus 7 series

The OnePlus 7 Pro features high-end specs a fantastic 90Hz OLED display and even a pop-up selfie camera in place of a display notch. Not only is it a big step up from the OnePlus 6T and the vanilla OnePlus 7 it even had some of us thinking of ditching the Pixel for it.

We shouldn’t discount the OnePlus 7 either. It offers excellent value for money if you can overlook the notch. Its specs are almost as impressive as those of its Pro counterpart. However it’s hard to get it new since it’s a bit older. Used models are readily available though. More: These are the best budget phones currently available

All in all the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro are great phones but it’s worth noting that they aren’t the latest ones in OnePlus’ lineup. That title goes to the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro or the OnePlus 10 Pro if you’re in China. Of course those didn’t make this list since they are powered by newer chipsets.

If you’re an iPhone user it’s a little easier — you usually only have a few models to choose from each year. But if you’re an Android user the task of finding a new phone can be a little harder. After all hundreds of Android phone models come out every single year. Hence this phone buying guide.

If you’re in the market for a new smartphone there are a number of things that you should consider first. Some of the things listed below may not matter to you. But it’s still important to be educated on different smartphone specs so that you can make an informed decision.

Here’s everything you need to know about smartphone specifications.

Processor

First up in our phone buying guide is the processor. Like with any computer a phone’s processor has a big impact on how well it can handle tasks. If all you want to do is browse the web and scroll through social media then the processor is probably a little less important. But the more you play mobile games multitask and so on the more important a decent-performing processor is.

A number of companies make processors for smartphones. If you’re an iPhone buyer you don’t need to worry much about the processor. Apple makes processors for iPhones and the higher the number in the name the better. For example the A14 Bionic processor in the iPhone 12 is better than the A13 Bionic in the iPhone 11. Here’s a rundown of some other chipmakers.

Qualcomm

The biggest and most important Android chipmaker is Qualcomm. Qualcomm makes quite a few chips in a few different series’. The 8-series is Qualcomm’s highest-end series of chips followed by the 7-series 6-series 4-series and 2-series. Unfortunately it’s not just as easy as “the higher the number the better” though. A new 7-series chip is going to be more powerful than an 8-series chip from five years ago. But if you’re only considering recent models then anything from the 6-series 7-series or 8-series should be powerful enough for most.

MediaTek

MediaTek is another company that supplies chips for Android smartphones. MediaTek’s top-tier processors include the Dimensity 1100 and Dimensity 1200 and any phone with these chipsets should perform decently well. MediaTek’s Helio series powers many midrange phones and won’t quite perform as well as Dimensity processors. MediaTek chips that aren’t Dimensity or Helio chips are usually pretty low-end but the trade-off is that they’re cheaper than the competition.

Samsung

Samsung also makes smartphone chips in its Exynos series. Many of these chips are relatively high-end but don’t usually perform as well as Qualcomm’s processors. Samsung only really builds these chips for its own phones.

RAM

RAM or Random Access Memory is essentially where your phone stores files and applications on a short-term basis. Basically the more RAM your phone has the more room there is to keep files and code open for quick access.

RAM is generally a type of super-fast storage — and much faster than the main storage included in your phone. Generally more RAM is better however it also depends on how well your phone handles the RAM it does have. For example iPhones perform extremely well despite only having around 4GB of RAM simply because Apple has well-optomized how the operating system and other components work with the RAM that iPhones have.

Because most Android manufacturers aren’t Google they have less say over how Android uses RAM and as a result they often need more RAM to perform well. Generally phones with 8GB or more of RAM will easily handle most multitasking but devices with 4GB or 6GB should still perform well enough for most situations.

Storage

Next up in our phone buying guide is storage. Storage has less to do with how your phone performs and more to do with how much stuff you can keep on it.

Generally as time goes on devices have more and more storage. But some people don’t necessarily need much storage. That’s because of the rise of cloud services. For example the only thing I really store on my phone is apps — my music videos and even files are all stored in the cloud and only downloaded to my device as I stream them or view them.

That’s not to say that storage is unimportant. After all apps are also getting bigger and bigger meaning that you may need a little more room to store them as time goes on.

Unsure how much storage you need? Well the first step would be to see how much you currently use. On an iPhone you can do so by heading to Settings > General > iPhone Storage. On an Android device head to Settings > Storage. If you’re not close to the limit on your current device you probably don’t need much more than that on your next device.

On some Android phones you can expand on your storage through the use of a MicroSD card slot. This allows you to buy and use MicroSD cards for additional room for your files and apps.

Display size

We’ll get into other display specs in other sections so this one is pretty straightforward. If you play a lot of games and watch movies on your phone then a larger display may be important to you. If you don’t then you may not care as much — and in fact might prefer something more pocketable anyway.

These days phone displays range from around 5 inches to around 6.8 inches.

Display type

Phone displays are generally either LCD OLED or AMOLED displays. Here’s a quick rundown of each but for more check out our full guide on different display types.

LED

LED displays offer a bright image with vibrant colors. These displays can’t quite offer the same deep black levels as OLED displays simply because of the fact that they have a backlight rather than control over individual pixels. This may change however with tech like Mini-LED and Micro-LED displays — however that tech has yet to come to smartphones.

OLED

OLED displays offer deeper black levels than LED displays because they can control each pixel turning pixels off when there’s black in an image. This also helps OLED displays conserve energy. OLED displays often don’t get quite as bright as LED ones but they definitely get bright enough for most use.

AMOLED

AMOLED displays are similar to OLED displays but have an active matrix to control the LEDs which can help allow for faster refresh rates and more precise control. That’s not to say that OLED displays aren’t fast though — phones with OLED displays should still easily perform.

Display resolution

Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR

Display resolution has to do with how many pixels make up a display. More pixels make for a sharper image though a higher-resolution display will also draw more power from the battery.

Most high-end phones have a 1440p display which means that there are 1440 columns of pixels. Some phones have 4K displays (around 4000 columnes of pixels) however on a display so small most can’t really see a difference.

Midrange phones these days generally have a 1080p display which to be frank is still crisp enough for most users. Low-end phones often have a 720p display. We would recommend against buying a phone with a resolution lower than that.

Display refresh rate

A display’s refresh rate relates to how often the screen can create a new image per second. Screens don’t actually display fluid motion — they just display a static image that changes so fast that it looks like fluid motion. A 60Hz refresh rate can create a new image 60 times per second — while a 120Hz refresh rate doubles that to 120 times.

The result of a faster refresh rate is an image that looks and feels smoother and more responsive. It’s especially helpful for things like scrolling and software animations along with gaming — as long as the game in question can actually take advantage of a faster refresh rate.

Battery

Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR

Battery capacity is measured in milliamp hours and basically refers to how big a battery is. Unfortunately this is a metric that isn’t really very indicative of how long a phone will last on a charge. All kinds of things impact how long a phone will last — including the display specs network usage and how often you do things like game on your phone. As such it can be tricky to figure out how much usage you specifically will get. Most phone reviewers attempt to measure the battery though so it’s worth checking reviews before you buy if you’re worried about battery life.

Charging

How you charge a battery matters too. These days there are two ways of charging a battery — through a cable or wirelessly. Wireless charging is much more convenient than wired charging but generally slower. That said if you pop your phone on a wireless charger it should still fully charge in a few hours.

Charging speed is measured in watts. All kinds of companies have attempted to develop charging tech to charge phones faster and some phones can charge at a hefty 120W which means they can fully charge in 15 or 20 minutes. Wireless charging ranges up to around 50W but only leveraging propriety tech and fast wireless chargers. Standard wireless charging is around 10W or 15W.

To leverage the fastest charging speeds you’ll need the right charging bricks and/or wireless chargers.

Camera

Next up in the phone buying guide is camera. Camera quality is becoming increasingly important as people use their phones for more and more photography and videography. But it’s hard to actually tell the quality of a camera without using it. That’s because of the fact that while there are some specs you can look at how good an image looks is a little more subjective.

Camera type

We’ll run through a few camera specs to help you figure out what a phone camera is capable of. The first thing to consider is the camera type. These days most high-end phones come with at least a few cameras. They’ll often include one standard wide-angle camera which you’ll use in most “normal” situations. Sometimes they’ll also include an ultrawide camera which can see a wider image than the normal wide-angle camera. And sometimes they’ll come with a telephoto camera that can zoom into a scene without losing information in the process. Telephoto cameras in smartphones are usually between 2x and 4x.

Megapixels

When you’re looking at camera specifications you’ll probably see how many megapixels each camera is. The number of “megapixels” refers to a camera’s resolution. One megapixel refers to one million pixels. So a 12-megapixel camera can capture an image with 12 million pixels. Sometimes cameras don’t actually produce an image with that many pixels though — often they just use that information to create the final image that you see. Generally it’s not worth worrying too much about how many megapixels a smartphone camera is.

Aperture

You may also see a camera aperture listed. Aperture is measured in f-stops which is a ratio of the focal length divided by the size of the camera’s opening. The smaller the number the more light a camera can let in.

Generally speaking if you’re not a camera nerd we recommend just looking at reviews to see how good a smartphone’s camera is.

Operating system

Image source: Christian de Looper for BGR

In the smartphone business you generally have to choose between two operating systems — Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. These days deciding between the two also means deciding which tech ecosystem you prefer as a whole. Apple’s iOS for example integrates with devices like the Mac and iPad as well as services like iCloud Apple Music and so on. Android on the other hand leverages Google’s ecosystem better supporting deep integration with services like Google Drive Google Photos Search and more.

Generally speaking iOS is a little more consistent in how it works while Android is much more customizable. For example Android lets you install apps from third-party sources while iOS doesn’t.

If you do go the Android route you have other decisions to make too. That’s because Android manufacturers can tweak Android and how it works on their phones. Samsung famously heavily tweaks Android to look different work a little differently and prioritize Samsung’s own apps and services.

Network support

Every 10 years or so a new generation of network comes out. Right now we’re in the midst of the deployment of 5G. Only one problem — if you actually want to use 5G you both need to be near a 5G tower or cell and have a phone that supports these 5G networks.

There are different types of 5G networks too further complicating things. There are so-called Sub-6 networks that aren’t quite as fast but can travel further distances. And there are mmWave networks that are super-fast but not necessarily as reliable.

If connecting to different types of networks is important to you you’ll want to double-check that your phone supports the different networks for your carrier.

Design

Last but certainly not least is design. Who wants a phone that they find ugly? Of course this one is almost entirely subjective — different people have different design tastes. But when you’re considering how much you like a phone’s design keep in mind that you may end up putting it in a case anyway so it may not matter quite as much.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9tb2JpbGUvcmVhbG1lLWd0LW5lbzItNWctcHJpY2UtcGhpbGlwcGluZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,realme GT Neo2 5G priced in the Philippines » YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews,"realme Philippines has revealed the local pricing of the realme GT Neo2 through a listing on its official website.

Chazen Liz Claiborne’s former chief executive officer and chairman and one of the architects of the apparel giant’s phenomenal growth in the ’80s died Sunday. He was 94.

He died at home of natural causes surrounded by his family according to his son David.

Chazen spearheaded the sales marketing distribution and licensing programs that were a significant part of Claiborne’s success. He joined Claiborne in 1977 the year after it was founded by Liz Claiborne and her husband Arthur Ortenberg and Leonard Boxer. By 1989 Fortune magazine recognized the firm as the largest women’s apparel company in the U.S.

Born March 21 1927 in New York City Chazen served in the Navy in World War II and received a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he and Ortenberg met and were roommates. Chazen then went on to earn an MBA from Columbia Business School. He began his career as an analyst on Wall Street and spent the following 16 years in retailing including 11 years at Winkelman’s prior to joining Claiborne.

Chazen previously said in interviews that he Ortenberg and Claiborne in 1975 discussed the idea of forming Liz Claiborne a plan that came to fruition in 1976. Chazen who couldn’t immediately leave his job at that time joined the following year.

The four founding partners divided up responsibilities. Chazen handled sales and marketing Ortenberg focused on finance and operations Claiborne focused on design and Boxer handled production. The company was able to offer value and prices that hadn’t been previously available in the U.S. by shifting production overseas.

After Claiborne and Ortenberg retired in 1989 Chazen was named chairman and CEO and chairman emeritus in 1996. He was succeeded as chairman and ceo by Paul Charron.

Retailers and colleagues spoke highly of Chazen’s integrity and innovative initiatives.

Michael Gould former chairman and chief executive officer of Bloomingdale’s told WWD on Monday “Jerry as a partner was always honorable. He was a man of his word.” Gould said he met Chazen in 1981 when Gould was at Robinsons. “We had Liz for personal appearances and Jerry and I developed this incredible relationship. It was instantaneous friendship from 1981” said Gould.

Gould said you meet people in life who are interesting but what was unique about Chazen was he was interested in things – in travel in jazz what Gould’s kids were doing his incredible glassware collection. He said they developed a phenomenal business at Robinson’s and later Bloomingdale’s. Gould said he spoke to Chazen about two weeks ago. “He epitomized that you can do business with great integrity and build a business together” said Gould.

Terry Lundgren former chairman and ceo of Macy’s Inc. said “I knew him well. Jerry was a very powerful figure in the moderately-price apparel business. He was one of the first to source overseas in a major way and the first to talk about in-store shops. He was really innovative along those lines. These [in-store shops] are common today but they were not common then. He made his products stand out. He had a major presence at department stores across the country. Ralph Lauren wasn’t in this yet.”

William Dillard II chief executive officer of Dillard’s said “Jerry Chazen was a legend in the American apparel business. He helped change the landscape of fashion apparel retailing in the ’80s with accessible designer fashion . More importantly he was a man of his word and that trust allowed not only a great business partnership but also a lasting friendship. He was a great man and a true friend.”

Throughout his time at Claiborne Chazen was widely praised for his strong marketing skills and his solid relationships with department stores. He was also a pioneer in developing international sourcing strategies in the early Eighties and oversaw the company’s retail concepts. Chazen also brought the company into the moderate market by way of acquisition.

Upon Chazen’s retirement in 1996 Jay Margolis a former vice chairman of Claiborne told WWD “He’s done incredible things. He built an incredible franchise along with Art [Ortenberg] and Liz [Claiborne].” Margolis said that Chazen brought a “door-by-door valuation” to Claiborne which had only been done by the fragrance business. “He would study north south and tropical levels and was so consumer-dedicated” Margolis said. “He would always try to fine-tune how a Liz Claiborne assortment should go out to that store and that particular door.”

On Monday Margolis told WWD “All through the late 70s 80s and 90s there was no better company than Liz Claiborne. It was just an amazing company. Jerry was the key to distribution and Art and Liz were the vision.” Although Claiborne Ortenberg and Chazen had their differences Margolis said Chazen was instrumental in building up the store side.

“I liked Jerry. He was a good man has an amazing family and was a terrific person. He lived a great life. He was so philanthropic in what he did for museums. His home had the most amazing modern art collection” added Margolis.

Dana Buchman who was a designer at Liz Claiborne and had her own label there said “I knew him for 40 years. I was design and he was sales. I was struck in the beginning of what a warm and generous personality he had. There was an energy to Jerry that was mesmerizing. We would have these intense design flow meetings and would choose the styles we would run. He managed to keep a genial energy. The guy was brilliant.”

She said Chazen would get feedback every week by style of what sold and it was all data driven. He would hear every Monday morning what sold the week before and he he was informed by this real data He would offer this information and express his point of view without putting the kibosh on design.

“He was also a wizard with retailers” she added. He would have these parties at the Copacabana for retailers which were “very glamorous and it was very un-Liz.” She said Claiborne didn’t do p.r. and he’d host a party that was welcoming and fun. She also noted how philanthropic and generous he was and even into his Nineties he’d been attending and contributing his time and ideas to foundation meetings.

Carol Hochman who was president of the fashion accessories division at Liz Claiborne said “I stayed close with Jerry all these years. He was a remarkable man and he didn’t get the credit he deserved for the success of Liz Claiborne. He was one of the best marketing and sales executives ever. He created the concept of assortment planning for doors which not only helped Liz Claiborne’s business but also helped the retailer.”

“He had immense integrity and was a great parter for the stores” she added. “They felt they had a real partnership when dealing with Jerry and not just a salesman. His contributions to the success of Liz Claiborne can not be emphasized enough.”

Chazen who watched the company grow from $7 million when he joined to more than $2 billion in revenues attributed part of Liz Claiborne’s initial success to good timing.

“We entered the market at a time of exploding shopping centers and just at a time when women were entering the workforce” Chazen said in 1996. “We were at the right time and the right place.

“We pioneered the concept of collection in the nondesigner market” Chazen said. “At first department stores didn’t know what to do with us. We were clearly sailing in unchartered waters…but fortunately consumers saw the merchandise and it struck a chord.”

These were the days when Claiborne could count as many as 120 separate department store accounts. When he retired it had shrunk to less than 20 as the department store underwent massive consolidation.

Chazen also admitted that the company made plenty of mistakes such as the time it banked too much on terry cloth fashions in the late ’70s. “It was supposed to be really big and we had all these expectations” Chazen said. “But suddenly the consumer just stopped buying them and we were stuck with all this merchandise.”

Another mishap that occurred in the late ’70s when the bulk of the company’s line was discolored in the warehouse.

“We tried this new fabric and it faded under the fluorescent lights in the warehouse. We were supposed to sell the jackets at $60 but ended up dumping them at a dollar each at discount stores. It almost put us out of business” Chazen said.

There was also the problem with offering short hemlines in the ’80s which Claiborne thought would go over well with the more traditional consumer. The consumer snubbed the look. “The only options for women who didn’t like the short skirts was the pants” Chazen said.

Chazen said in a 1996 interview that the most difficult time was when Claiborne and Ortenberg retired from the company. “It was precisely at the same time all the retail consolidation started to happen. It was very different to separate what was happening from the outside.”

Chazen felt that the company should have gotten into the moderate business sooner. The company acquired some moderate labels Russ Togs Villager and Crazy Horse in 1992 but the category had been floundering.

At the time Chazen stepped down the company was facing heavy competition from brands such as Tommy Hilfiger Nautica and Ralph Lauren all launching lines targeted at the same customer. Chazen felt the new competition would have a positive effect and would increase traffic at department stores.

“The fashion industry has never been easy” Chazen said in 1996. “It has always been fraught with companies that think they have a good idea and try it and it doesn’t work and they go out of business.”

He felt that the difference at that time was that with increased centralized buying retailers couldn’t afford to gamble on smaller companies and they had to work with the ones that were financially secure.

In an interview in 2006 Chazen told WWD “When we started our company the failure rate was 90 percent. It was the same as opening a restaurant or a Broadway show. Looking back maybe it was easier than what it is today but it was never easy. I knew we would be right because of the background of the principals of the company.”

In the decade between 1984 and 1994 the Liz Claiborne brand was the single largest supplier for department stores according to Chazen who noted that back then retailers knew their lives depended on selling merchandise at regular price.

One of the more exciting times for Claiborne was the decision to go public Chazen told WWD in 2006. The buzz surrounding the company generated much interest in the still relatively young firm.

According to Chazen the company got lucky when a young banker at Merrill Lynch — who didn’t know much about apparel and consequently didn’t have a typical ingrown bias against fashion firms — helped Claiborne with its initial public offering.

In June 1981 Liz Claiborne went public priced at $19 a share. According to Chazen the company “for more than 10 years occupied the number-one slot for most successful IPO in the history of Merrill Lynch.”

Liz Claiborne died in 2007 Boxer died in 2009 and Ortenberg passed away in 2014.

Paul Charron who succeeded Chazen as chairman and ceo of Claiborne in 1994 said Monday ” I think Jerry was a real leader in the growing American apparel business. He and his partners created a company that in its time was a juggernaut. Jerry was smart extremely diligent and charismatic and he left me a branded and financial platform that we could built upon to help us realize its full potential.” The business grew to $2 billion under Chazen Ortenberg and Boxer and under Charron it became a $5 billion corporation acquiring brands such as Juicy Couture Sigrid Olsen Lucky Jeans and Kate Spade.

In addition Charron noted that Chazen “was so incredibly philanthropic and had so many interests.”

“He was very curious and blessed that he had the money to make an impact in so many areas. He was a curious and interested man” said Charron calling him “a lion in the industry.”

John Pomerantz former chairman and ceo of Leslie Fay Cos. Inc. said Monday “I’ve always had a lot of respect for Jerry. He was a very strong competitor but very honest and fair and did a great job with Liz Claiborne. To compete with Liz Claiborne in those days was very hard to do; but I know he had a great respect for Leslie Fay also. We could always count on Jerry to be a generous participant in the philanthropic efforts for the industry and the greater community. He will be missed.”

In 2012 Chazen wrote a book entitled “My Life at Liz Claiborne: How We Broke the Rules and Built the Largest Fashion Company in the World” (AuthorHouse). In it Chazen described how the partners took a small start-up fashion business and propelled it into the Fortune 500. Chazen wrote that he believed that he hadn’t always gotten the public recognition or credit for building Liz Claiborne into the powerhouse that it was since the perception was always that the company was run as a husband-and-wife operation by Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg. But the 84-year-old Chazen wrote that he liked to think of it as being “Liz’s and Jerry’s.”

People who worked at Claiborne during that time didn’t necessarily agree with that claim.

“Art always had difficulty giving me credit for the key role I played in the company. I had to live with that reality then and for many years after no matter how my ideas and my management guided the company to success. I guess that I was having so much fun it didn’t really matter. But to be honest sometimes it did get to me” Chazen wrote.

Internal struggles and tensions notwithstanding Chazen described how he set out to break the rules of retailing to build a major company which by the time he left in 1996 was generating more than $2 billion in revenues.

Once he left Claiborne he was often asked what he thought about the turn of events as the brand gradually withered and lost its appeal. “All I can say is it’s obvious the years have not been kind to Liz Claiborne. The company has changed dramatically and unfortunately not for the better” Chazen said. After he retired he continued to serve on the board of the Liz Claiborne Foundation the philanthropic arm. Today Liz Claiborne is now known as Kate Spade & Co. part of Tapestry Inc.

In 1991 Chazen founded the Jerome A. Chazen Institute of Global Business at his alma mater Columbia Business School. In addition to promoting academic research and symposia the institute has given the opportunity to hundreds of students to work and study internationally as part of their MBA studies.

In May 2018 Chazen received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in recognition of a career comprised of extraordinary accomplishments.

Chazen and his wife Simona a practicing psychotherapist along with their children created the Chazen Foundation to support causes they were passionate about including the University of Wisconsin Columbia Business School The Metropolitan Opera the Museum of Arts and Design The Louis Armstrong House & Archives the Lupus Research Alliance among many other social causes.

In 2003 Jerry and Simona Chazen along with John Wiley the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin worked together to expand the existing university art museum with a new building that was more than double the size. The museum opened in 2009 and was renamed The Chazen Museum of Art. The Chazens also agreed to leave the vast bulk of their world-class collection to the museum.

The couple who met at the University of Wisconsin and were married 72 years had a lifelong love affair with jazz music especially Louis Armstrong. Chazen had been a critical supporter and helped preserve Armstrong’s original Queens home and through the House Museum preserved the cultural historical and humanitarian legacy of the jazz great.

The Chazens were also early champions of the American Craft movement and have supported the American Craft Museum for many years through its transition to today’s Museum of Arts and Design. As board chair Chazen was the leader of a successful effort to move the Museum to its current home at Columbus Circle in New York successfully navigating many landmarks related issues and helping to redefine the Columbus Circle neighborhood.

Chazen’s son David spoke about his father being a leader until the very end.

“Our dad was always bigger than life to us even godlike. My sisters and I all wanted his approval to the very end. And we could always get it if we could convincingly make our case. My father had the great gift of listening. Whether it was a family member a business associate a friend (or more likely a child of a friend) looking for advice he was clearly more interested in learning about them rather than talking about himself.

“Those who knew him and business and philanthropy knew the exact same person his family knew. He ran everything – very well thank you and I can tell you that his children probably like others in his life were very happy to report to him.”

“My father was in control and relevant until the end whether talking about politics culture business or even blockchain he was smart well versed and up to date. A great model for his children.”

In addition to his wife Simona and son David Chazen is survived by children Kathy Chazen (who is married to Larry Miller) and Louise Chazen Banon (husband Sidney) and seven grandchildren and a great-grandson.

The trickle-down effect was quick and by late 1990s the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises ( SMEs ) in India well understood the importance of brands and trademarks across businesses.The next question amongst business owners was what differentiates a mere name from a strong brand name? A significant brand advantage could be for example the fact that it has a larger likelihood of customer choice which could translate into higher levels of customer loyalty towards the products/services offered by the business entity. As a result a strong brand normally commands a higher price than competitive products/services in the market. Businesses now were eager to learn more about their brands and their market positioning.Indian markets recognise unique brand equity with the value premium that the brand owners or business entities enjoy. The extreme level of brand recognition is when such unique brand names transform by its extensive usage into generic terms few such examples are JCB for land moving machines Tempos Gypsy Aspirin  etc. Further brands relating to distinct core values generates unique positioning and a long-term brand strategy correlating with the business entity. At the end of the day a strong brand is the foundation for creating long-lasting and profitable assets hence making the intellectual property in “brands” as the most important property of the Business.To benefit from the humongous potential of a business it is imperative for the brand owner to recognize secure & appreciate its legal rights over its brands. Registration of different types of intellectual property rights such as trademarks patents designs and copyrights among others can ensure the exclusivity or ownership to prevent others from replicating an intellectual property.It is essential in today’s time to evaluate a company's worldwide market presence as well as its future objectives when filing for registration of IP rights over a brand. Even though filing applications directly through each country's national registration system and paying fees to attorneys in each country is one option in most circumstances the budget will not be sufficient to cover all conceivable available protection or sometimes a brand may not necessarily be associated with single IP but with a plurality of IP forms to protect its different components. For example brands like Apple Ferrari Coca-Cola which represents a bundle of IP forms including several protected word marks numerous protected graphical signs trade dress different combinations of essential components of composite marks shape marks etc. Therefore prioritisation and determining what offers the most value in terms of aggressive IP protection is necessary.Having said the above the formation of a brand is the first step in brand management. Many new products fail because their producers fail to generate a brand name that reminds consumers of the product's availability or that makes consumers think of the product as useful desirable or simply superior to similar offerings.This could be the result of something as simple as choosing a brand name that lacks corporate identity. A good brand name can make or break a product's success. Finding a perfectly suited brand name for a product/service or an entity on the other hand is an uphill task for the proprietor or the inhouse counsel. It begins with a thorough examination of the product/service its benefits as well as the target customers and markets and last but not least the company's vision and values. A good brand name is distinguished by its uniqueness connects with the public at large is easy to remember and does not leave any room for confusion with any other existing brands.Often the evaluation of an entity’s rights over a brand is construed differently in different facts of the matter. The proprietors should be aware that merely applying for a similar mark registration in a different product class or service class may not suffice and the Court’s may still be of opinion that the mark may confuse the Customers of an already registered mark in the same class. In United States Polo Association Inc. v. Polo Ralph Lauren USA Holdings Inc. U.S.P.A moved its use of the double horseman mark earlier only on clothing to use in connection with fragrances. The Court denoted that consumers could think that U.S.P.A products are actually made by Polo Ralph Lauren. Based on this an order was issued excluding the U.S.P. A’s use of either the double horseman logo or the word “polo” in connection with fragrances.As a result branding is not just about developing a brand strategy but also about protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights. If there is an infringement one common remedy is to impose a sanction to prevent the unlawful use of the deceptively similar mark as well as award of damages to compensate for the loss caused by such infringement. In order to build a powerful brand IP rights registration and brand management are essential.Trademarks copyrights and trade dress are all effective strategies for increasing a brand’s potential value. Further a prompt and forceful enforcement of all IP rights by pursuing legal action against any party trying to misuse or exploit the IP for their unfair advantage. After all the Courts also see how vigilant a proprietor is over its IPs and accordingly the brand owner who is actively defending its brands and not allowing anyone to use the brands without consent will have better chances of success against future infringers as well. Lastly businesses building up their brands and overall reputation should also be mindful of how the brands are being promoted and presented in the market vis-à-vis competitors. Merely having registrations as trademarks copyrights patents or designs while essential but may not suffice in today’s competitive markets. Therefore the need is that the brands and businesses’ image are seen as composite reputation and every effort shall be made by the proprietors and counsels to identify brands protect popularize and enforce all IPs by ever evolving innovative means.Shrimant Singh is Partner and Khushboo is Associate S&A Law Offices.,,,,,,,,,

If you think you’ve seen the last of Tom Brady forget about it.

The legendary quarterback who announced his retirement this week after 22 years in the NFL is eyeing a bevy of ventures that will thrust him into the spotlight in 2022 and possibly for years to come.

And could make him the first former player to become a billionaire.

“I have loved my NFL career” the 44-year-old posted on Instagram after calling it quits “and now it is time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention.”

Like making a lot more money.

He no longer earns $27 million a year as a QB but Tom Terrific is looking to expand his health and clothing companies (TB12 and BRADY brand) shoot a movie that’s all about him and cash in big from cryptocurrency and NFTs.

If you hate him for all that success Brady doesn’t mind. He’s even shrewdly tapped player-hater bile to his advantage in TV ads. Is there nothing this guy can’t do?

Absolutely not according to one expert.

“He’s the NFL’s GOAT [greatest of all time] and his brand is among the strongest of any pro athlete” said Bob Dorfman a sports marketing analyst noting that Brady has snagged $180 million in endorsements during his playing days and recently got $170 million in funding for his NFT company Autograph.

“So he can pretty much do whatever he wants — broadcasting team ownership speaking engagements book-writing pitching products for current sponsors new deals with family-oriented brands or just building up his existing companies” he said.

“I don’t see Brady fading from the public eye much in the next five to 10 years. He’s got billionaire potential.”

MarketWatch this week tabbed Brady’s net worth at $475 million putting him behind only Roger Staubach — who’s got $600 million — as the richest former NFL player.

Not a Brady fan? Well you won’t want to hear this: The seven-time Super Bowl winner has started his own film company (199 Productions) and plans to release “Man in the Arena” a documentary with ESPN about his title run last year with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Also in the works is his first feature film “Eighty for Brady” which tells the true story of a group of friends whose lifelong dream is to go to the Super Bowl and meet their hero. Naturally Brady plans to play himself.

Would Hollywood be of interest?

“It seems like if Tom Brady wanted to do a movie he could do it in a minute” said Sam Spira of Xtreme Couture Management noting he “probably has friends who do huge budget movies.”

“I would advise him to get behind the camera” said Hollywood director Ron Shelton (“Bull Durham” “White Men Can’t Jump”).

“As an actor you are at the mercy of the script and the director. He is used to being the man in charge. Maybe he should stay in charge. I think Brady would be a great producer.”

Announcing or color commentary would seem a natural fit. And those jobs pay well — Tony Romo rakes in $17 million a year. Brady could earn that much or more according to Spira though he might be wary of the criticism Romo gets for his quirky and sometimes questionable remarks.

“Tom Brady doesn’t want to look bad” he said.

7 One of Brady’s riskier ventures is Autograph a company founded to take advantage of the recent surge in popularity of NFTs.

Not every startup of Brady’s is a sure thing.

When rapper Lil Nas X launched a business to produce NFTs — pixelated online images known as non-fungible tokens — the performer was at the height of his popularity. But his followers hated the idea.

“The fan base can react badly to NFTs because they think they’re a scam” said David Gerard author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain” a 2017 book that warns of pitfalls in the virtual markets.

Indeed Lil Nas got hit with a backlash Gerard said. “He promptly removed all mention of the NFT from his publicity.”

Brady is spreading the risk with his NFT company Autograph which he founded last year by roping in other famous athletes including Tiger Woods Wayne Gretzky and Usain Bolt. It produces slick graphic images of sports and entertainment stars.

Lionsgate and DraftKings also have partnered with Brady in the venture. On Jan. 19 the company announced it had raised $170 million from two venture capital firms.

Brady has backed the crypto company FTX and shot a series of humorous TV ads for a $20 million campaign that co-stars his wife Gisele Bündchen and a bunch of actors posing as regular-guy pals: a chef a plumber and Jets superfan Fireman Ed.

In one spot Brady phones up a bartender frenemy in Boston named Bill whose cellphone shows the QB’s photo and a caller ID: “TRAITOR.”

“This guy!” an exacerbated Bill says before picking up.

“I’m getting into crypto” Brady tells him.

“I’m in” says the barkeep. “But I still hate you.”

Brady’s marketing savvy was evident long before he called it quits.

For most of his playing days he accepted below-market contracts so that the teams he played for — New England and Tampa Bay — had the cash to build title contenders.

Brady’s $27 million salary last year — well below no. 1 Patrick Mahomes’ $45 million — didn’t even put him among the top 10 highest paid quarterbacks in football in 2021.

Winning Super Bowls was worth more to him than being the best paid player according to Dorfman. “In 2021 Brady’s off-the-field income of around $45M was nearly double that of his football salary” he said.

Brady’s earning potential is powered by “the three Ps” he said. “Performance personality and purity.”

Meaning he’s a great player is likable and charismatic and hasn’t been involved in any scandals — other than his messy breakup with former girlfriend Bridget Moynahan whom he impregnated then split from just two months before she gave birth to their son Jack in 2006.

But even that chapter he’s turned into a positive by Brady including both Moynahan — now happily married — and Jack into one blended family. Bündchen calls Jack a 14-year-old who works as a ball boy for the Buccaneers her “bonus child.”

And the whole Brady bunch has been photographed hanging out together.

Brady faces one formidable rival in the NFL earnings’ race: Mahomes Kansas City’s star QB who has already won a Super Bowl and league MVP outpaced Brady’s early career records with his stellar play and inked a 10-year $503-million contract in 2020 — the largest in American sports history.

Mahomes 26 is also featured prominently in State Farm’s ubiquitous TV ad campaign a deal that helps push his annual endorsement income to an estimated $7 million a year.

There aren’t many ex-athletes who are billionaires but the richest are both well ahead of Brady.

Michael Jordan ranks no. 1 with $2.6 billion followed by Tiger Woods who has $2.1 billion according to Sportico.

As Tweeted by @momomo_us an Estonian retailer has listed three Asus ROG and TUF RTX 3090 Tis with very high prices upwards of 4332 Euros or more.

The Asus TUF RTX 3090 Ti is the cheapest and surfaces for 4332.11 Euros ($3967.92 converted without tax) from the Estonian retailer. In the middle is the factory overclocked variant at 4413.85 Euros ($4042.8 converted without tax) and the flagship ROG Strix RTX 3090 Ti -- which also happens to be the liquid-cooled variant is going for 4577.40 Euros ($4192.6 converted without tax).

We don't have an official MSRP from Nvidia yet but for reference scalped RTX 3090s on eBay are going for around $2609 right now. So if we assume these are scalped Estonian RTX 3090 Ti's they will sell for nearly twice the scalped 3090s. So we could be looking at a 1.5x to 2x higher MSRP of the 3090 Ti once Nvidia gets around to announcing it. But this is an educated guess on our part; these prices increase due to several other reasons.

Ironically Asus' listing is relatively tame compared to other listings we've seen already. For example a few days ago we covered another listing regarding a Japanese retailer selling the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500 (with tax).

Rumored specs indicate Nvidia's RTX 3090 Ti will be packing a fully enabled GA102 core and upgraded GDDR6X modules. For a total of 10752 CUDA cores and 21Gbps GDDR6X memory giving the 3090 Ti over 1TBps of memory bandwidth. These modules will also have double the capacity of the current modules used on the RTX 3090 bringing the total count from 24 to just 12. It will be very beneficial as it makes cooling the GDDR6X modules far less complicated and allows for a more straightforward PCB design.

Nvidia originally shared some specifications of the RTX 3090 Ti at CES but kept many details in the dark such as the card MSRP. The company promised to share more details about the GPU before January was over but failed to do so for unknown reasons. Supposedly Nvidia had to ask its AIB partners to halt the RTX 3090 Ti production due to quality control issues which is why Nvidia delayed sharing more details last month including the launch date of the 3090 Ti.

So for now we're still waiting on an official launch for the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. However with the number of listings for the card growing by the week it seems its launch is imminent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC10aXMtcHJpY2UtbG9va3MtdmVyeS1wYWluZnVsLWZvci1ncHUtaHVudGVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti's price looks very painful for GPU hunters,"Update: PC gamers now is not the time to buy a new graphics card.

Nvidia first announced the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at CES 2022 with the promise of more details at the end of January. That deadline came and went without any additional information and the speculation is that Nvidia is struggling to produce the card in meaningful quantities prompting indefinite delays.

While we wait for confirmation from Nvidia about what’s actually going on retailers are filling the vacuum with their own listings for the upcoming card — and the prices aren’t encouraging even in a world that’s used to GPU inflation.

The latest listings come from an Estonian retailer’s listings tweeted by @momomo_us. With a currency conversion all three cards come in at around $4000 with the tax removed.

The cheapest of the lot is the Asus TUF RTX 3090 Ti at €4332.11 (or around $3968). That seems pricey until you get onto the other two — a €4413.85 (around $4043) overclocked version and €4577.40 (around $4193) liquid-cooled ROG Strix model.

As our sister site Tom’s Hardware points out this is highly unlikely to be the actual MSRP for the RTX 3090 TI. The vanilla RTX 3090s currently sells for around $2600 on Ebay when the price should be $1499 new. Assuming a similar level of gouging here that would suggest the actual price to be around the $2300 mark. Probably closer to $2000 as you’d imagine there’s an additional premium here for the new and shiny.

That’s still hugely expensive obviously but the GPU will reportedly go some way to justifying it with truly enviable specs. We’ve heard talk of a fully enabled GA102 core with 24GB of upgraded GDDR6X memory offering a total of 10752 CUDA cores. All of this power will apparently come at an energy cost though with the card reportedly having a total power draw of 450W.

But when the new graphics card will emerge is anyone’s guess. With Nvidia missing its own deadline to reveal more at the end of last month we’re now in a state of limbo as to when it’ll actually appear making these possible prices something of a moot point.

While the specs listed above will make the RTX 3090 Ti an enviable GPU for many years to come it’s worth remembering that Nvidia is rumored to be unveiling the RTX 40 series before the year is out — and with price gouging and shortages being what they are many will be tempted just to sit this generation out and see if things look better in 12 months time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9jYW4tdGhlLXJ0eC0zMDkwLXJ1bi1keWluZy1saWdodC0yLWF0LThr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can the RTX 3090 run Dying Light 2 at 8K?,"Our 8K test system PC built by Chillblast Motherboard: Asus ROG STRIX Z390-E GAMING

Dying Light 2 is the long awaited follow-up to the original Dying Light which came out all the way back in 2015 and the sequel is a fun frantic and ambitious zombie survival game.

The ambitions of Techland the developers of the game isn't just confined to the gameplay and map size of this open world game. It's also an incredibly good looking game especially on PC where it employs all manner of fancy graphical effects such as ray tracing to make for a much more immersive experience.

However as TechRadar's own components queen Jackie Thomas noted in her Dying Light 2 PC performance roundup while Dying Light 2 sets a new bar when it comes to ray tracing visuals it also comes at a big cost with even the mighty RTX 3090 GPU currently the most powerful gaming GPU in the world right now struggling to hit 60 frames per second (fps) with all the highest graphical settings turned on.

So if it struggles at 4K that doesn't bode well for 8K performance. However I'm still keen to see if there's any way to play it at 8K. After all the great thing about PC gaming is that there are plenty of options to tweak to help boost performance. Dying Light 2 also supports both Nvidia's DLSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution scaling technologies. Those have both become increasingly important in getting games running at high resolutions high settings and at high refresh rates and they allowed me to run the stunning God of War at 8K not too long ago.

I'm also changing my 8K testing setup in the coming months and I've started by swapping out the Dell UltraSharp UP3218K 8K monitor. This is a stunning monitor and still remains the only 8K monitor available but it's primarily designed for creative work not gaming and comes with an incredibly high price tag. It also needs to use two DisplayPort cables to achieve 8K at 60Hz.

Instead I'm now going to use the LG 55NANO966PA a 55-inch 8K LCD TV. It uses HDMI 2.1 and at a third of the price of the Dell UltraSharp UP3218K this is the kind of 8K screen most games will be using when (or to be honest if) 8K gaming becomes mainstream.

Putting the RTX 3090 through its paces

As you can imagine the 8K (7680 x 4320) resolution is extremely demanding even at the best of times with four times the number of pixels of 4K. This means that graphically intensive games are going to really put any graphics card through its paces.

So it probably comes as no surprise that Dying Light 2 is extremely punishing on the RTX 3090. At native 8K resolution with 'High Quality' graphical settings the game chugged along at 18.1fps. That's extremely painful and essentially unplayable.

However turning on Nvidia's DLSS feature on the 'Performance' setting which favors higher frame rates at the expense of graphical settings and upscales the image from a lower resolution to output at 8K the game hit 36.1fps on average with a minimum of 29.8fps.

I consider 30 frames per second to be the absolute minimum for a game to be enjoyable so the fact that the RTX 3090 with help from DLSS gets above that at high settings and at 8K is impressive. While DLSS means this isn't a native 8K image the tech has come a long way and the results are very impressive.

However while 30fps is the minimum we'd like to see no one would want to put down $1499 / £1399 / around AU$2030 (or more thanks global chip shortage!) for a graphics card only to play at 30fps. Dying Light 2 with its emphasis on fast parkour traversal plays best at high frame rates but is that possible at 8K?

You certainly can discount ray tracing effects. Turning those on drops the frame rates dramatically to just 16.3fps - and this is with DLSS enabled.

Dropping the visual settings to 'Medium' while keeping DLSS at 'Performance' raises the frame rate to an average of 38fps. Not a bad leap and even at medium graphical settings Dying Light 2 remains a looker.

Click to see in full 8K resolution (Image credit: Techland)

Next I dropped the game down to 'Low' and this again boosted the frame rates to 44.2fps on average. The game felt much more responsive and enjoyable but it was still a way off the 60fps milestone that I look for when playing games at 8K.

The good news is that Dying Light 2 doesn't just support Nvidia DLSS but also AMD's alternative FSR tech. Switching over to that upscaling technology gets an average framerate of 59.9fps finally! The game certainly feels better to play and it's nice to be able to say you can play Dying Light 2 at 8K... just about.

But is it worth the compromises I had to make?

Click to see in full 8K resolution (Image credit: Techland)

Tough decisions

As is so often the case with 8K gaming at the moment you're going to have to make compromises to reach that kind of resolution. This means heavily depending on upscaling technology. While games using DLSS won't look as clean as when played at a native resolution the fact is that DLSS has come on in leaps and bounds since Nvidia introduced it and AMD's FSR tech is also very impressive.

It means that impact to graphics quality is minimized while performance improvements are able to make a big difference in playability. Even on a large screen at 8K there's not a massively noticeable difference in image quality unless you go looking for it. Check out our comparison shots below all taken at 8K with Ray Tracing on its highest settings with a variety of DLSS and FSR levels applied.

What's more of a painful compromise however is having to turn the graphical settings down to their lowest to get to 60fps. While Dying Light 2 still looks good the drop in quality is still very noticeable. Textures are more blurry draw distance is reduced and lighting effects are barely there. The world feels a lot less alive - never a great thing even in a zombie game.

The bump to 8K isn't worth the compromise in this case. By playing at 4K I was able to get 59.8fps at 'High Quality' with DLSS on performance. That's still without ray tracing enabled but it looked so much better even with the lower resolution. Don't forget most games don't really take advantage of 8K yet anyway with textures and models aimed at a maximum of 4K anyway.

The fact that the might RTX 3090 can only just hit 60fps at 4K with DLSS on and no ray tracing highlights just how intensive this game is. There's also a hint of a lack of optimization about it and there's already been a day one patch to address bugs. I expect Techland to continue to patch Dying Light 2 to improve performance at 4K. At 8K though? No amount of patching will help.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1saW51eC1kcml2ZS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0yMDUwLW14NTcwLW14NTUwLWdwdS1zdXBwb3J0L9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYS1saW51eC1kcml2ZS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0yMDUwLW14NTcwLW14NTUwLWdwdS1zdXBwb3J0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Adds GeForce RTX 2050 MX570 & MX550 Laptop GPU Support To Linux Through Latest Drivers,"Last December NVIDIA launched three new mobility GPUs the RTX 2050 MX550 and MX570. While the MX550 is a Turing variant for NVIDIA the RTX 2050 and MX570 utilize identical GA107 cores similar to the RTX 3050. Laptop manufacturers will use these new chips in their notebooks during this first quarter of 2022.

Linux driver 470.103.01 released for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 MX570 and MX550 Mobility GPUs

A new Linux driver (470.103.01) for the RTX 2050 MX570 and MX550 is available offering more compatibility and capability in the open-source operating system.

Starting with the specifications the GeForce RTX 2050 is based on the GA107 GPU core with 2048 cores which is actually more than the GeForce RTX 2060 laptop variant. It features a boost clock of up to 1477 MHz and has a TGP of up to 45W. The GPU features 4 GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 14 Gbps but runs across a 64-bit bus interface which provides 112 GB/s bandwidth. The memory sub-system is the major blow to the RTX 2050 but it makes sense since this is not a replacement of the RTX 2060 but a more entry-level option.

Moving over to the GeForce MX570 and MX550 NVIDIA isn't providing detailed specifications but it looks like the MX570 is based on a totally new Ampere GPU SKU the GA107 while the MX550 uses the Turing TU117 GPU. The GA107 die is already shipping in RTX 3050 laptop SKUs and since the MX series is always the most entry-level die this would be the most cut-down configuration of the GA107 GPU core. The GeForce RTX 2050 and MX500 series laptop GPUs support all the latest features such as ray tracing NVIDIA DLSS Reflex and Broadcast among others. They also work seamlessly with Optimus & are a perfect solution for providing longer battery times with more horsepower over a standard iGPU. Nvidia states that laptops equipped with the GeForce RTX 2050 MX570 and MX550 graphics cards will start shipping during Spring 2022.

But MSI's competing GE76 Raider performed a bit better on our gaming tests and has a bigger battery.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

When you're plunking down more than $4000 on a portable gaming rig two of your top priorities are likely to be cutting-edge top-end components and stunning aesthetics. The former will make sure your frame rates stay butter-smooth for years to come while the latter will make you want to use your machine more often whether you're streaming at home or out and about in the world.



On both of those counts Alienware's updated x17 R2 excels. Externally it's the same sleek 0.84-inch thick extraterrestrial beast that we looked at last fall . The design's still a stunner and the optional mechanical Cherry MX keyboard feels as satisfying to type on as some of the best gaming keyboards we've used. The only real downside of the design as far as I'm concerned is that all the ports are at the back. But hey some people like that.

On the inside though is where the x17 R2 gets exciting. The company has updated its configuration options adding both Intel's new top-of-the-line 12th Gen Core i9-12900HK  as well as Nvidia's new flagship mobile RTX 3080 Ti . The company sent our review unit with those parts plus 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a pair of 2TB Samsung 980 Pro PCIe 4.0 SSDs in RAID delivering possibly the fastest boot drive we've seen to date among the best gaming laptops . Note that Dell doesn't guarantee you'll get these drives; the company says it uses multiple drive companies but that any buyer who chooses a 512GB or higher SSD will get a PCIe 4.0 drive or drives.

Of course all that cutting-edge high-end hardware adds up. Alienware says our configuration will sell for $4799. You can save some money by opting for half the RAM (32GB is plenty for gaming) and nixing the mechanical keyboard option. That drops the price down to $4499. And if you can live with a single 1TB SSD the price drops to $3849. Personally while we aren't sure we'd pay extra for all that RAM and storage the $50 upgrade for the mechanical keyboard is worth it. The Cherry MX switches on our review unit feel excellent although there is a fair amount of metallic ping noise on some of the keys.

With brand-new top-end components and a stunningly designed and built chassis is the Alienware x17 the best gaming laptop you can buy? That depends in part on how you use your rig and how much you value style and battery life over the highest frame rates possible.

Design of the Alienware x17 R2

The shell of the Alienware x17 R2 is the same as the R1 model we looked at last fall. But that's far from a bad thing given that it's still arguably the sleekest most premium-feeling gaming portable on the market. At 0.84 inches thick and wrapped in magnesium and aluminum the laptop feels as good as it looks. And in the ""lunar light"" (white) finish of our review unit the laptop looks both futuristic and understated (for a gaming laptop). There's RGB lighting on the keyboard the alien head logo on the lid and an oval that runs around the vents and the ports at the back adds a tasteful amount of customizable glow.



All that said while the Alienware x17 R2 is slim for a high-end gaming laptop it's not exactly small or light. At 15.72 x 11.79 x 0.84 inches (399 x 300 x 21.4 mm) it's a bit bigger than MSI's similarly powerful GE76 Raider (15.63 x 11.18 x 1.01 inches) and Asus Strix Scar G733 (15.55 x 11.11 x 1.08 inches). And at 6.82 pounds fully kitted out the Alienware is also the heaviest of the competition as the MSI is 6.39 pounds and the Asus just is 5.95 pounds. Also note that despite its extra heft the Alienware has an 87 WHr battery while the Asus has a 90 WHr and the MSI has a 99 WHr battery.

Nearly all of the Alienware x17 R2's ports are found at the rear save for the headphone jack on the right side near the back and the barrel connector for the charger on the left edge.

Surrounded by the RGB light ring and flanked by vents on the back edge you'll find a Thunderbolt 4 port two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports gigabit Ethernet USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C (which also works for charging though you'll need to use the brick for the fastest charging) a microSD card reader HDMI and a mini DisplayPort.

The connectivity here is ample though lots of people would find it more convenient to have some of these ports on the sides as well as the rear of the laptop. If that's important to you most competing big-screen portables (like the MSI and Asus models mentioned above) feature more traditional port layouts.

Gaming and Graphics Performance on the Alienware X17 R2

We don't expect massive gains between the RTX 3080 performance (as we saw it in the Asus and last-gen Alienware laptops) and the RTX 3080 Ti performance from the x17 R2 we're looking at here as well as in the MSI GE76 Raider. The new GPU should deliver some advantage at high resolutions and the new CPU should help at 1080p. But since the panel that Alienware shipped with this laptop is 1080p we'll only get a chance to see its advantages at the lower resolution.

Still when I played through the Meridian Outskirts area in Borderlands 3 on the badass preset the x17 R2 delivered smooth frame rates between the mid-90s and 130 fps. Thanks to the display's insanely high 360 Hz refresh everything looked extremely smooth and the responsive tactile feel of the keyboard made every moment more enjoyable.

On the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark on its highest settings at 1080p resolution the new Alienware x17 R2 turned in a score of 107 frames per second (fps). That's five frames behind the MSI but 13 fps ahead of the previous-gen Alienware (94 fps) and 20 fps ahead of the Asus (87 fps) at the same resolution and settings.

Grand Theft Auto V saw the new x17 R2 deliver 129 fps. That's the poorest showing so far for Alienware as the MSI delivered 10 fps better (139 fps) at the same resolution and settings. Even the last-gen x17 R1 tied the new model with the same 129 fps.

On Far Cry New Dawn (ultra settings 1080p) the Alienware x17 R2 and its 3080 Ti made up some ground delivering a 117 fps that bested both the MSI (113 fps) and everything else here. The Asus with its AMD CPU brought up the rear with a still-smooth 90 fps on the same test and resolution.

Switching to Borderlands 3 on ""badass"" settings at 1080p the x17's score of 97 fps was again 10 fps behind the MSI (106 fps) but ahead of the last-gen systems. Again the Asus brought up last place with 87 fps.

The Alienware x17 R2 again took a loss to the MSI in our Red Dead Redemption 2 test (1080p medium) where its 78.3 fps was eclipsed by the MSI's 82 fps. Interestingly even the previous-generation Alienware x17 did better here with an 81 fps result.



On gaming notebooks we stress test the system by running the Metro Exodus benchmark on RTX settings 15 times simulating about half an hour of gameplay. The game ran at an average of 75.98 frames per second across the runs starting off at 80.41 fps before dropping into the 75 range after the first three runs.

The performance cores on the Alder Lake processor ran at an average of 2.9 GHz on the stress test while the efficiency cores hit an average of 2.25 GHz. The CPU package temperature measured an average of 81.4 degrees Celsius (178.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Interestingly while the Alienware x17 R2's CPU temperature was lower than the similarly equipped MSI on the same test (81 vs 85 degrees) the MSI laptop's Performance cores ran a full GHz higher (2.9 GHz for the Alienware vs 3.94 GHz for the MSI). And the MSI ran the game faster as well delivering an average of nearly 84 fps versus the Alienware's 76 fps. Perhaps Alienware is implementing some power limits to avoid the thermal throttling we saw on the MSI.



Oddly HWinfo which we use to measure the above data also failed to show any GPU info in our Alienware review unit. So we can't at this point post the GPU clock speed or temperatures.

Productivity Performance of the Alienware x17 R2

To get a sense of how Alienware's latest 17-incher performs compared to other laptops we put it up against MSI's GE76 Raider which shares the same Core i9-12900HK CPU and RTX 3080 Ti as our Alienware review unit. And to get a sense of how it stacks up against previous systems we also tossed performance numbers from the Alienware x17 R1 we tested in 2021 (Core i7-11800H RTX 3080) and the Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 G733 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX RTX 3080).

On Geekbench 5 a synthetic test that aims to track general performance the 12900HK-packing Alienware x17 delivered a single-core score of 1842 and a multi-core result of 13710. That's slightly ahead of the MSI's showing of 1833 (single) and 13456 (multi) but much further ahead of the previous-gen x17 with its single-core score of 1539 and all-core showing of just 9024. That's a whopping 52% increase from last year's model though we also jumped from an 11th Gen i7 to a 12th Gen i9. The Ryzen-based Asus G733 had the worst showing here managing just 1487 (single-core) and 8231 (multi-core).

The pair of Samsung 980 Pro PCIe 4.0 SSDs in the new Alienware trounced the competition in our 25GB file transfer test taking just 11.8 seconds to move the mixed collection of files for a speed of 2268 MBps. The 1774.47 MBps showing of the MSI machine was the next closest. And last year's x17 was over 1 GBps slower delivering a speed of 1227.

On our Handbrake test in which computers transcode a 4K video to 1080p the Alienware again impressed. As we'd expect its 4 minutes 45 second showing was basically even with the MSI (4:44) which has the same CPU and GPU. But the next-closest competitor was last year's x17 which was more than a minute slower (5:51).

Display on the Alienware x17

The Alienware's 1080p display delivered 107% of the sRGB color gamut and 76% of DCI-P3. That puts it just slightly ahead of the MSI and Asus displays in terms of color. But with an average brightness of 325 nits the new Alienware is a fair bit brighter.

While the panel's colors weren't as vivid as on the OLED TV I use as my main gaming monitor when I played Borderlands 3 the stylized dystopian scenery and characters looked far from dull. And thanks to the high refresh and powerful components every title I played always looked smooth.

Note though that the previous Alienware x17 R1 we tested with a 4K 120 Hz panel delivered better color and even more brightness (438 nits). If you aren't after maximum refresh rate over everything else we'd opt for the 4K panel when configuring the system from Alienware.

Keyboard and Touchpad on the Alienware x17 R2

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

If there's an upgrade I'd recommend for everyone opting for the Alienware x17 R2 it's the $50 Cherry MX mechanical keyboard. This came with our review unit and in terms of just switch feel and snapiness it's better than some of the best gaming keyboards I use in my day-to-day work and gaming life.



I can't think of the last time I used a laptop keyboard that felt this satisfying. That said if you're a true keyboard enthusiast who is annoyed by metallic case ping sounds the mechanical keyboard here has that aplenty and it varies quite a bit from key to key. Personally I think the feel of the keyboard (and its roomly layout) far outweigh any pinging sound issues but that may not be the case for everyone.

The only odd thing about the keyboard's layout is the extra column all the way to the right which houses dedicated volume mute and mic mute keys. Their non-standard positions will take some getting used to but in my case I didn't find myself hitting them accidentally. I would also have liked to see dedicated media control buttons but you can at least program the F2-F6 keys with macros.

The touchpad isn't exactly spacious at about 2.4 x 4.8 inches but it's big enough for Windows gestures at least with my mid-sized hands. Some may prefer something larger but the vast majority of gamers are going to want to use one of the best gaming mice  anyway.

Upgradeability of the Alienware x17

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Some engineer at Alienware deserves an award for just how easy the x17's internals are to access. There are eight standard Philips head screws on the bottom of the laptop. After removing all but the two that are captive (one on each side) the bottom pops off so easily that I didn't even have to think about finding a spudger or an old credit card for prying purposes.

Inside both the two SO-DIMM slots and two M.2 SSDs are accessible. All four upgradable slots were occupied in our review unit. The SSDs are housed under heat spreaders with thermal pads but they are easy to get to and remove – you just need to remove yet another small screw for each drive.

Also note the Alienware x17's 87 WHr battery in the image above: It isn't quite as beefy as the 99 WHr power box that the MSI Raider sports. As you might expect that leads to differences in unplugged run time between the two systems that sport very similar components which will see in the next section.

Also visible here is the x17's four-fan cooling system which often kicked on even when the machine was idling at the desktop. Expect fan noise to be a constant companion when gaming (and most of the rest of the time too). That said the fan noise on the x17 R2 while prominent when gaming isn't close to the loudest or highest-pitched I've heard from a high-end gaming laptop under load.

Battery Life on the Alienware x17

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

You'll want to keep the x17 R2's power brick handy whenever you're using the system. No high-end gaming laptop sports stellar battery life but the x17 R2 with its top-end components is only likely to last a few hours under the best of circumstances.

On our battery test in which laptops continuously browse the web stream video and run OpenGL graphics tests in the browser all while connected to Wi-Fi with the screen at 150 nits the x17 R2 conked out at the 3 hour and 7 minute mark. That's not awful as far as powerful gaming laptops go but the MSI lasted nearly an hour longer (4:05) last year's x17 R1 lasted almost 90 mins longer (4:31) and the AMD-powered Asus held on for 3:44.

Webcam on the Alienware x17 R2

The good news about the Alienware x17 R2's webcam is that it includes Windows Hello support. But its 720p sensor produces fuzzy images under the best conditions. And in anything much below mid-day level sunlight its colors were subdued and dull. Sure the camera here will get you through the occasional work meeting or virtual event just fine. But if you expect more than that you'll want to invest in one of the best webcams .

Audio on the Alienware x17 R2

I listened to the 20th Anniversary remastered edition of Assemblage 23's album ""Failure"" and the pair of 4-watt speakers did an OK job when I was sitting in front of the laptop. But stepping a few feet away the low-end of the audio dropped off dramatically leading to a thin muddy sound. I tried to see if software could help here. But the pre-installed Realtek Audio console only let me adjust the balance from left to right and the volume. And I did not spot an equalizer in Alienware's Command Center Software.

Still this is going to be less of an issue for gaming. During my rounds of Borderlands 3 I had no major complaints. But if you often use your laptop for music while you aren't sitting right in front of it you'll want to invest in some kind of speakers whether they be of the desktop or Bluetooth variety.

Software and Warranty on Alienware x17 R2

As with all new consumer-focused Windows laptops going forward the x17 R2 ships with Windows 11 (Pro in our model though most configurations ship with Home). Our review unit came pleasingly free of much of any extra OS cruft save for the usual Office and Xbox links.

Alienware's Command Center is the primary piece of pre-installed software. With it you can tweak fan speeds adjust audio switch between power profiles change lighting and check component usage. You can overclock the CPU here as well if that's an option with your configuration. There are also the usual programs for basic support and audio tweaking as well as Killer Intelligence Center for managing and monitoring network traffic. But overall the software bloat here is pleasingly slim to none.

Alienware sells the x17 R2 with a 1-year warranty as standard although you can bump that up as high as four years at purchase for an extra $440 (2 years is an extra $160).

Configurations of the Alienware x17 R2

As of this writing Alienware sells the x17 R2 in four configurations starting at $2449 with a Core i7-12700H an RTX 3060 a 512GB PCIe SSD and 32GB of DDR5. For $3549 you get the same CPU but twice the storage and an the same RTX 3080 Ti as our review unit. A $3849 config takes that SKU and bumps the CPU up to our Core i9 12900K. And the top-end offering at $3949 is the model we tested only ours included the $50 mechanical keyboard upgrade and an extra 2TB SSD plush Windows 11 Pro.

Oddly the Alienware x17 R2 was only available with 1080p high refresh panels when we wrote this which seems like a somewhat odd pairing with the highest-end GPU and CPU you can buy. But an Alienware representative told us that 4K panel options should be available as an option by early February. If esports is your passion the 360 Hz 1080p panel will likely be what you want. But for AAA gamers and those who like to watch movies on their laptops the 4K panel will offer both more detail as well as better color if the screen in last year's x17 R1 is any indication.

Bottom Line

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

While it's certainly expensive in our $4799 review configuration the Alienware x17 is a powerful system especially considering its sub-1-inch thickness–and shockingly it's not overly loud under load. It bested the similarly equipped MSI GE76 Raider in our CPU tests though it was often behind that competing machine (though ahead of the older competition) in our gaming benchmarks. Both those systems sport the same CPU and GPU and both are rated to a maximum of 175W graphics power. Perhaps the slightly thicker chassis of the MSI helped it here although the Alienware's gaming prowess is still better than any other gaming laptop we've tested save for MSI's latest monster.



Combine the overall excellent (although not always the best) performance with a mechanical keyboard that feels great all packed inside a stunning-looking thin chassis and there's a lot to like with the Alienware x17 R2.

Some won't like the fact that all its ports (save for the power plug and headphone jack) are in the back. But if that's an issue for you and/or you want simply the best frame rates possible from a laptop today MSI's GE76 Raider is an excellent alternative with more ports spread across three sides.

The MSI also weighs about a half pound less and has a bigger battery. To our eyes the Alienware looks nicer but the MSI has a flashy RGB light strip and turned in some higher frame rates in our tests. It's also a bit thicker so which one is best for you depends on how you use your laptop and how much you prioritize absolute gaming performance over sleek svelte looks."

Anne Hathaway kicked off press for her upcoming Apple TV+ miniseries “WeCrashed” in style this week.

More from Footwear News

The “Locked Down” star shared her first press look on Instagram featuring a dazzling purple Valentino dress. The knee-length number featured a velvety bodice with a sheer skirt and 3/4-length sleeves. The ensemble gained dramatic flair from a waist-high slit as well as long fringe cascading from its sleeves and hem. The piece was complete with sparkly sequin accents for a burst of sleek glamour.

“@appletvplus #WeCrashed press kick off!” Hathaway captioned the photo complete with purple heart emojis.

When it came to shoes Hathaway went bold in a pair of Gianvito Rossi heels. The “Ocean’s 8” star elevated her look with a set of the brand’s $612 Gianvito pointed-toe pumps which featured glossy patent leather uppers in a dynamic red hue. Hathaway’s footwear was complete with towering 4.5-inch stiletto heels giving her look a slick finish. The pumps complemented her sparkling dress with their similarly dark color while making a punchy statement all their own.

Pointed-toe pumps like Hathaway’s add a sleek twist to any outfit ranging from dresses to jeans. The style’s popularity stems from its sharp pointed-toe silhouette as well as daring stiletto heels. Newer styles by Badgley Mischka Kurt Geiger and Nina have given pairs added punch from vibrant colors glitter and crystal embellishments. In addition to Hathaway stars like Manolo Blahnik Magda Butrym and Jennifer Lopez have worn sleek pumps by Dua Lipa Rachel Brosnahan and Casadei in recent weeks. The actress is no stranger to bold heels herself; in fact she recently shared a photo in a pair of towering Giuseppe Zanotti platform boots complete with new bangs reminiscent of her iconic “The Devil Wears Prada” character Andrea Sachs.

The boots fit Hathaway’s penchant for strong shoe statements which she’s made on and off the red carpet. The Oscar-winning actress regularly wears bright pumps and sandals from brands like Tom Ford Jimmy Choo Charlotte Olympia and more. Her off-duty rotation usually veers towards clean casual footwear: Valentino and Chanel flats Nike sneakers and a variety of pointed-toe black leather loafers are regularly on rotation.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow anyone to own a stake in income-producing real estate. This means they can be great for generating passive income. Currently the average dividend yield across the REIT sector is 2.6% more than double the 1.2% yield of stocks in the S&P 500.

Three REITs that stand out for their income-generating capabilities are Crown Castle International (CCI -1.51%) Digital Realty Trust (DLR -2.20%) and SL Green Realty (SLG 2.16%). With shares of all three selling off along with the broader stock market last month they look like great buys this February.

1. Crown Castle: Connected to a powerful growth trend

Shares of Crown Castle stumbled out of the gate in 2021 declining by more than 12% in January. That sell-off helped push its dividend yield up to 3.3% in early February.

That slump comes even though the infrastructure REIT reported strong quarterly results last month. Crown Castle grew its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by 14% for the full year helping support an 11% increase in its dividend. The communications infrastructure company also slightly increased its 2022 outlook after signing a new long-term deal with T-Mobile to support its 5G rollout.

Crown Castle sees lots of 5G-driven growth ahead as mobile carriers utilize more infrastructure to support the faster network. That leads the REIT to believe it can grow its dividend at a 7% to 8% annual pace over the next few years. With shares now cheaper Crown Castle offers the potential of generating even higher total returns in the coming years for investors who buy shares in February.

2. Digital Realty: A lower price despite enhancing its growth prospects

Digital Realty's stock also took a hit last month. The data center REIT tumbled more than 15% pushing its dividend yield up to 3.1%.

The REIT's sell-off came even though it recently made another growth-enhancing acquisition. Last month it agreed to acquire a stake in Teraco Africa's largest data center operator with seven state-of-the-art facilities located in South Africa. The $3.5 billion deal established Digital Realty as a leading data center operator in Africa. Digital Realty sees significant growth ahead on that continent which is in the early stages of its digital transformation.

That deal should provide further support for Digital Realty's growing dividend. The REIT has increased its payout for 16 consecutive years and appears poised to continue growing it in the future.

3. SL Green: A towering dividend

Share of SL Green Realty tumbled more than 13% last month. A big driver was a surge in coronavirus cases in New York City where the company is the leading office landlord. That further delayed the return to the office by some of the company's tenants.

However while the ongoing pandemic has been a headwind for SL Green it sees better days ahead. The office REIT recently reported its fourth-quarter results which showed that the city's office market is getting back on its feet. SL Green signed leases covering more than 1.9 million square feet last year smashing its expectation that it would sign 1.3 million square feet of leases. That led the company to set an ambitious goal of signing more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2022.

The improvement in office leasing will help further support SL Green's monthly dividend which now yields an attractive 5% following last month's decline. It should also help drive continued growth in SL Green's dividend which it has now increased for 11 straight years.

Higher yields following last month's sell-off

In January Crown Castle Digital Realty and SL Green Realty all tumbled along with the broader market. Those sell-offs came even though each REIT reported positive news. Because of that they look like attractive buys for income investors this month since their now higher yields look even more sustainable over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGxvb2tpbmRpYS5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWwvYS1yZWFsdHktc2hvdy1uZXdzLTI3MTcwMtIBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGxvb2tpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L25hdGlvbmFsL2EtcmVhbHR5LXNob3ctbmV3cy0yNzE3MDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Realty Show,Two raps in two hearings in a month; yet the agencies seemed to drag their feet on even registering an FIR.

Share It

Hurun India Wealth Report 2020 released has identified a novel household category in India – the ‘New Middle Class’ – with an average savings of Rs 20-lakh per annum. These households the report says have major allocation towards physical assets such as primary residential property and automobiles. Hurun India pegs the total number of such cumulative households in India at 633000. According to Hurun there are 412000 dollar-millionaire households / affluent households in India with a networth of at least Rs 7 crore. Hurun Rich Listers have a wealth of Rs 1000 crore the report says and pegs the number of such cumulative households in India at 3000. At the other end of the spectrum is the ‘Indian middle class’ that has earnings of over Rs 2.5-lakh per annum and a net worth of less than Rs 7 crore. “It is estimated that around 56400000 families in India fall under this category” findings of the Hurun India Wealth Report 2020 suggest. The report classifies two broad segments of wealthy households in India – the lower part comprises households having work compensation income along with fixed deposits real estate and equity investments as their primary source of income; and the upper segment that has inherited wealth real estate possessions primary business earnings and a diverse equity investment portfolio as sources of income. And investing patterns among all these household segments differ. A business-owner – be it a billionaire international ultra-high networth individual (UHNI) UHNI or an affluent individual – for instance allocate a higher portion of their wealth towards their primary business activities. “The other major consumers of their investable wealth include cash reserves equity stocks and primary residence” the report says. Similarly the ‘Stock Market Kings’ invest actively in the stock markets since it is their primary source of revenue. “Nearly two-thirds of their wealth is devoted to stock market investments. Given the scale of these investments the upper level households in this category i.e. the international multi-millionaire households and above hire wealth management firms to look after their investment portfolios” the report said. Meanwhile the golden collar / salary-driven households – those households that have been earning an eight-digit salary per annum for at least five years – mostly prefer to invest in a house followed by cash / stocks. Region-wise the top 10 states are home to 70.3 per cent of millionaire households in the country. Maharashtra the report said has the highest number of millionaires (56000) followed by Uttar Pradesh (36000) Tamil Nadu (35000) Karnataka (33000) and Gujarat (29000). City-wise Mumbai is home to most millionaires (16933) followed by Delhi (16000) Kolkata (10000) Bengaluru (7582) and Chennai (4685).

A robotic arm controlled by the brain and computer software designed to make surgeries safer. These are the projects by two Virginia students that have made it to the finals of an elite science competition.

The Regeneron Science Talent Search is a competition described as the oldest science and math competition for high school seniors.

Benjamin Choi 17 from The Potomac School in McLean Virginia and Pravalika Putalapattu 17 from Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria Virginia are the two local seniors who made it into a group of 40 finalists chosen from more than 1800 entries.

They will both get $25000 for being finalists and will present their projects in D.C. from March 9 through 16 where they will compete for the top 10 awards that range from $40000 to $250000.

For his project Choi wanted to make upper limb neuroprosthetics more accessible. They often require open brain surgery which is risky and costs about half a million dollars or more to produce.

“I invented a bionic arm that’s controlled by your brainwaves” Choi said.

His solution only costs about $300 to make. Its installation is noninvasive using electrodes placed on the scalp to pick up electrical signals from the brain.

“I wrote this AI algorithm that essentially translates those signals into ultimately trying to figure out what your thoughts are” Choi said. “And I use those translated signals to control my bionic arm.”

Since she was a little girl Putalapattu says her mom has been taking her to check out the finalists’ projects at the Regeneron competition.

Now she gets to be a part of that elite group herself.

“That’s like always something I was looking forward to” Putalapattu said.

The goal of her project?

“To help surgeons avoid mistakes during surgeries particularly gallbladder removal procedures” Putalapattu said.

It’s a software program that uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze live surgery videos frame by frame.

“It uses a time series analysis to predict the surgical phase for the action that a surgeon is performing” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRyYWN0cGhhcm1hLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvMjAyMi0wNi0wMi9yZWdlbmVyb24tdG8tcHVyY2hhc2Utc2Fub2Zpcy1zdGFrZS1pbi1saWJ0YXlvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Regeneron To Purchase Sanofi's Stake In Libtayo,"Breaking News

The 50th edition of the Bal Polski celebrated the Polish positivist poet novelist journalist and activist for women's rights and for Polish independence Maria Konopnicka. This year marks the 180th anniversary of her birth.



The Bal Polski was held under the patronage of His Royal Highness The Duke of Kent and the Polish Embassy’s Chargé d'Affaires a.i. Agnieszka Kowalska. George Windsor The Earl of St Andrews Her Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to Ireland Anna Sochańska Her Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to Latvia Monika Michaliszyn and Her Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to Italy Anna Maria Anders participated in the Ball as special guests.



Chargé d’Affaires a.i. Agnieszka Kowalska read out a letter from His Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to the United Kingdom Piotr Wilczek who will assume his responsibilities in London in the nearest future saying that “Polish diaspora and Poles scattered all over the world have always helped their compatriots in Poland. The willingness to help another person is a particularly valuable virtue today. The [Bal Polski] is an excellent example of the continuation of this beautiful tradition that bears witness to Polish sacrifice and solidarity.”



The Polish Embassy contributed to the Bal Polski’s auction by donating a gift from Poland’s Presidential Couple – cufflinks and a nacre necklace with a handwritten dedication by the First Lady. The proceeds from this year’s gala ball will be donated to the Home for Mothers with Young Children and Pregnant Women in Łabunie near Zamość.



The 50th edition of the ball was hosted by TV presenter and BBC journalist Kasia Madera and TV and radio journalist Marzena Rogalska. The star of the evening was the famous Polish singer Natalia Kukulska. The guests of the ball were also entertained by the Mazury Dance Company.



The Bal Polski previously known as the Bal Emigracji has been taking place in London since 1970. It is a glittering prestigious social and cultural event aiming at integrating the Polish diaspora and raising funds for charitable causes.

According to a recent Korn Ferry report an estimated 85 million jobs could go unfilled by 2030 because there won't be enough skilled workers to fill them. That gap would mean unrealised annual revenues and potentially astronomical recruiting expenses.

""At the end of the day if you don't hire and cultivate great talent your recruiting expenses are going to be off the charts"" said Delores Lenzy-Jones CPA CGMA the CFO of Waterloo Greenway a concert venue and urban park system in Austin Texas. ""It makes financial sense to nurture your talent by inspiring and motivating team members so they want to stay with your organisation.""

Perhaps the best way to avoid falling victim to a potential talent shortage is to make strategic investments in recruitment and retention now. Every organisation invests some amount of money in finding and retaining employees but if you don't have unlimited funds you might need to prioritise. Here are the top five areas for talent investment in 2022 according to experts.

Recruiting tools for discovering top talent: For companies that transitioned to a remote or hybrid model during the pandemic potential talent pools expanded to include the entire world but that benefit has made it even more difficult to sort through candidates.

Lenzy-Jones recommended setting aside funds for thorough recruitment efforts perhaps investing in HR consulting services or recruitment fees for companies like Robert Half that specialise in accounting finance professionals.

""Recruiting is a full-time effort and I think those folks who are specialising in recruiting are better able to draw in those high-quality candidates"" Lenzy-Jones said.

She also suggested investing in LinkedIn Recruiter and LinkedIn Premium which offers access to more individuals than a regular LinkedIn profile and paying job search sites like Indeed to boost recruitment efforts. She added that joining organisations like your local Chamber of Commerce can provide built-in access to talent pools.

Skills and career development programmes: Talented employees typically want to learn and grow on the job and the pandemic has increased that desire.

""Investing in talent professional development would be a big win in recruiting and retaining talent in 2022"" said Orumé Agbeyegbe Hays CPA CGMA managing director of Hays CPA in New York.

Hays recommended organising in-house training programmes perhaps hiring experts in the field to onboard finance teams in working across different cloud computing and artificial intelligence platforms. She said the learning platform should be tailored to each team because while some will be comfortable with remote learning others struggle with that setting. Reimbursing tuition certifications and continuing education fees can also go a long way towards upskilling and retaining top talent.

Ken Merritt senior client partner with Korn Ferry based in Washington D.C. recommended implementing rotational programmes and cross-training to keep employees engaged and continuously growing at your organisation.

""To the extent that you implement those kinds of things I think you'll retain but you'll also get folks who will look up and say 'If I can't get a new job within my current organisation why not join this organisation who is investing more in their people?'"" Merritt said.

Tools for seamless hybrid or remote work: Remote or hybrid work is here to stay for many finance departments and organisations need to invest in digital tools to avoid frustrated teams.

""Continued investments in technology and tools to help talent who desire to continue to work remotely would go a long way towards the success of everyone"" Hays said. ""Over the course of the pandemic I noticed the finance departments who were not as flexible in accommodating this change were not as successful in retaining talent.""

Some of the necessary tools for remote work might include platforms like Microsoft Teams Slack and Zoom to maintain company culture and connect with and manage team members; a bolstered security system to keep sensitive data safe; and any software or gadgets that will make life easier for a dispersed team. Merritt recommended organisations offer to reimburse any purchases employees make related to creating a home office including desks chairs printers and computer equipment.

""You have to be willing to spend some money to arm the team with the same equipment they might have in the office"" he said.

Employee bonus programmes: Bonus programmes are a time-tested way to retain talent according to Merritt.

Bonuses could be tied to performance or company success but if possible they should be extended to everyone in the company or department he said.

Another way to align employee and organisational goals is through profit-sharing. Merritt worked with one company that he said had a profit-sharing arrangement that made members of the finance team stick around for a long time.

""I thought it was richer than most companies because a lot of companies have profit-sharing for people in the core business the leaders but they don't always have them for the support functions"" Merritt said. ""This company did a nice job of treating everybody the same.""

For employees with that company every year there was a payment towards their retirement that was above and beyond their traditional employer-based plan.

""They truly become invested in the profitability of the company"" he said.

Anything that improves organisational culture: Organisations that manage to create a great company culture tend to have an easier time attracting and retaining talent. However it can be difficult to draw a direct line from financial investments to a desirable workplace culture. Hays suggested companies consider making permanent many of the short-term perks of the pandemic including flexible work robust wellness programmes and more time off to avoid burnout.

""For example you might try instituting a four-day workweek instead of a five-day workweek"" Hays said. ""Studies have shown that this greatly increases productivity and gives people a better quality of life — a great win-win for everyone.""

Hays added that organisations can also improve company culture by investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives. And Lenzy-Jones recommended offering regular team retreats and company-wide events to facilitate bonding and improve morale. For example her organisation has scheduled a trip to a winery for the whole team and offers employees free tickets to every performance at the organisation's entertainment venue.

""In my mind culture is bringing people together so they're happy inspired and motivated at what they're doing"" Lenzy-Jones said. ""The way you can do that is give folks more opportunities to be together. During the pandemic with most team members working from home you have to be intentional about ensuring folks come together in a socially distanced way.""

LOS ANGELES – Before the newest Clippers took the court as Clippers for the first time they went to dinner with their new head coach to get know one another – and come to find out Norman Powell Robert Covington and the Clippers already have a lot in common.

“Well Chauncey ran a lot of my stuff in Portland” said Coach Tyronn Lue with a chuckle noting that his good friend and former assistant Chauncey Billups borrowed plenty from his playbook as he set out as a head coach for the first time this season.

“Me and Chauncey we run a lot of the same stuff” Lue said. “Pretty much the same system especially early offensive stuff. And so they just talked at dinner last night … ‘We understand what we’re looking for.’ The biggest thing is those guys getting comfortable and understand who they’re playing with on the floor and picking and choosing their spots.”

What’s more Lue’s familiarity with Powell – who arrived in L.A. with Covington on Saturday the day after the trade that sent point guard Eric Bledsoe forward Justise Winslow guard Keon Johnson and a 2025 second-round pick to Portland – extends past the playbook.

The coach said he got to know Powell the 28-year-old wing who starred at UCLA through Kyle Lowry – Lue’s pal and Powell’s former Toronto Raptors teammate. What’s more Lue said he and Powell both live in Las Vegas in the offseason.

MANNING THE POINT

While the Clippers’ newest additions were beginning a not-too-steep acclimation process so too was Terance Mann. Without Bledsoe on the roster the third-year wing was going to be tasked with playing backup point guard – as he had as a rookie.

Last season – Mann’s second – was a breakout campaign for the versatile 25-year-old. He earned a two-year $22 million extension with his performance throughout the season and in the postseason when his 39-point eruption in Game 6 of the Clippers’ Western Conference second-round series lifted the Clippers into their first Western Conference finals appearance in team history.

Mann said he prides himself on being able to handle a variety of roles and responsibilities offensively and defensively but Lue said last season that he thought Mann’s giant step was attributable to the fact he didn’t have to handle the point any longer.

“With Terance the biggest thing is just turning him loose just letting him be a basketball player” Lue said last March. “Not trying to make him a point guard even though he has great passing ability. I think if you go to the NBA from college never playing the position I think he did a lot of thinking on the floor just trying to play mistake-free basketball.

“Now we’ve got him off the basketball he’s able to rebound and push and attack off the second side he’s able to create and just play basketball and play free and I think that’s helped with his development as well.”

This time around Lue said the second-string point guard duties wouldn’t entirely fall on Mann that he’d share the role with Powell and Amir Coffey.

“Doc had him playing backup point guard when he was here” Lue said. “So he has some experience doing it so we’re just gonna have to help him out it’s gonna take a little time for him we understand that so we gotta be patient.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2F1Y29uc291cmNlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L3RoZS1jaGllZi1rZXB0LXRoZS1wZWFjZS1pbi1jb29wZXJzYnVyZy1mb3Itb3Zlci01MC15ZWFycy_SAWRodHRwczovL3NhdWNvbnNvdXJjZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNS90aGUtY2hpZWYta2VwdC10aGUtcGVhY2UtaW4tY29vcGVyc2J1cmctZm9yLW92ZXItNTAteWVhcnMvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘The Chief’ Kept the Peace in Coopersburg for Over 50 Years,"Known for his “letter of the law” approach to policing Robert Snyder became Coopersburg’s first police officer in 1948. “The Chief” as he was known also drove the borough’s first ambulance helped start the Little League served as crossing guard for Coopersburg School and was present at any and all public events for more than 50 years.

Robert W. Snyder. He was always simply “The Chief.”

A barrel-chested redhead with a fiery temper and swagger Bob Snyder was “Coopersburg’s Finest” for decades. When he left the U.S. Armed Forces in 1948 he wrote to the Borough Council offering to be Coopersburg’s first police officer. When they hired him it was with the understanding that he would use his own car and his own gun and even work out of his own living room. And he did! His deep voice and outspoken personality left no doubt that he was in charge. His death in 2009 brought the end of a local legend.

The Chief drove Coopersburg’s first ambulance helped start the Little League served as crossing guard for Coopersburg School and was present at any and all public events for more than 50 years. He and his wife Cindy built their ranch house on State Street just up from the police station so he could be available and on call 24 hours a day. You could rest well when the Chief was on duty.

Known for his “letter of the law” approach you didn’t want to cross him or give him grief. Yet with all his rough edges there was a sensitive heart and caring spirit within him. As the years went by the hard-nosed cigar-smoking quick-tempered ginger had a heart change. Like Peter in the Gospels Snyder didn’t lose his edge but change brought a more sensitive perspective for people in need.

That still didn’t lessen your fear when the Chief in the Coopersburg Police Car pulled up behind you on Rt. 309 lights flashing! If you were speeding he had no mercy. From his perspective “Law and Order” was more than a TV show. It was a way of life. And truth be told the folks from the little town of Coopersburg could live in peace when Chief Snyder was in charge. Like those who came after him “Coopersburg’s Finest” allowed residents of the small town to sleep comfortably let their children play safely and enjoy the security that a capable confident committed Chief and police force provide. Bob Snyder thanks for paving the way for more than 70 years of Coopersburg’s peace of mind.

Even though his persona gets covered in public not much is known about his personal life–especially when it comes to his marital life. For his part Rogan rarely talks about his family or posts about his life. However he's always been vocal in his stance about marriage. In an episode of his podcast he compared marriage to a Russian Roulette owing to the rates of divorce and implored ""I'm married I'm happy don't do it.""

How Did They Meet?

Rogan met Jessica in 2001 when the former model was working as a cocktail waitress in Los Angeles. They started dating and got married eight years after.

""I had to [tie the knot]"" Rogan admitted in a 2019 interview with the Palm Beach Post. ""Not really had to but you know she made a baby. (It's) like 'God all right I'll sign a silly legal contract.' What she did was way more of a commitment.""

The family formerly lived in Bell Canyon California. However they currently reside in Austin Texas where Rogan relocated his podcast studio in the summer of 2020. ""I just want to go somewhere in the center of the country"" he hinted on his podcast of the move. ""Somewhere it's easier to travel to both places and somewhere we have a little bit more freedom.""

Jessica and Joe share two children (Lola Rogan and Rosy Rogan) and one from Jessica's former marriage (Kayja Nichole). Jessica raised her daughter alone until her marriage to Joe in 2001 where he legally adopted her daughter.

Jessica welcomed her first child with Joe while still dating in 2008. A year after they got married they welcomed their second daughter too.

Despite being married to a celebrity Jessica has made passive and active efforts to be shielded from the public. Her Instagram account was also locked.

Who Did Rogan Date Before Jessica?

Rogan used to date ""Survivor"" star Jerri Manthey before the pair both got their big breaks. Manthey has appeared on all seasons of Survivor including ""Survivor: The Australian Outback"" ""Heroes vs. Villains"" and ""All-Stars.""

Although It's unsure how they met cheating was the glaring reason they didn't work out. While appearing on ""The Howard Stern"" Show Rogan opened up about cheating on Mathey. ""We used to have huge fights. We used to have the worst fights cause I wanted to have sex with other chicks"" he said. ""I did a bad thing. I learned my lesson; a couple of times. Look I hooked her up with one of my friends.""

He also mentioned that he would never get married claiming he was against the institution. ""Marriage is dumb"" he told The Rolling Stone.

His Secret To A Long-Lasting Marriage

Despite his previous opinions there's no doubt that the pair have managed to make their marriage last longer than the average Hollywood relationship.

According to Rogan one of the reasons for the success of their marriage was that there was freedom for him to do whatever he wanted. ""She lets me do whatever I do. That's how we get along well. She doesn't f*** with me."""

Dora Schwebel and Schwebel's Bakery

In 1906 Joseph and Dora Schwebel began baking 40 loaves of bread per day selling door to door to their neighbors. In a few short years they were serving a growing number of mom and pop stores by horse and buggy. By 1923 they opened a small bakery that baked 1000 loaves a day and had six delivery trucks on the road.

In 1928 Joseph Schwebel died. Many advised Dora to sell the business but Dora was equal to the challenge.

She guided Schwebel Baking Company through the stock market crash and the Great Depression while at the same time doubling sales and helping feed those in need.

Throughout the 1930’s and 1940’s Schwebel’s continued to flourish building a brand new bakery in 1936 and expanding again in 1938 and 1941.

Dora died in 1964.

Rose Kravitz and Kravitz Deli

Rose Kravitz’s was born in Croatia and she came to Youngstown with her family in the early 1920s.

The family settled on the North Side.

In 1939 after she married at age 20 Rose and her husband Herb Kravitz opened a delicatessen on Elm Street near Thurston Avenue. As she explains they didn’t really know what they were getting into. With the help and plenty of credit from other local businesses they were able to open the shop.

They faced difficult times keeping the store going during World War II.

A few years after the war ended they were able to purchase a building which would house the store downstairs and an apartment for the family upstairs overlooking Crandall Park. They kept the deli there through the 1960s when they began to experience trouble in the neighborhood.

In 1970 Kravitz’s moved to a strip mall in Liberty on Belmont Avenue.

Leroy and Forrest Raffel – Arby’s

The first Arby’s restaurant — named after Raffel Brothers or R.B. — opened July 23 1964 on U.S. Route 224 in Boardman.

The Raffel brothers started their restaurant with no investment.

By the next year a second location opened in Liberty Township and the company continued to grow with about 400 locations by 1976 when the company was sold to Royal Crown Cola.

Before starting their restaurant the Raffel brothers ran a food-service layout business. To add to their business they decided to start a roast-beef restaurant.

When Leroy told his wife about the new business venture she said “I wouldn’t cross the street for a roast-beef sandwich.” But their idea blossomed and they perfected the product: a Youngstown-born Schwebel bun made special for the thinly sliced roast beef and the well-known and well-loved Arby’s sauce to top it off — all for just 69 cents.

“Develop the product the people want and then price it” Raffel said. “We didn’t invent roast beef we just developed the concept.”

Love those clean mid-century lines but how about something really comfortable. And wouldn’t a luxurious home theater be nice?

With many of us spending a lot more time at home during the pandemic tastes in furnishing and decor have changed. One example: a shift back to warm tones and the soothing colors of nature. While it seemed that every house on the market for a time had the same gray walls and flooring four of the major paint manufacturers — Benjamin Moore Sherwin-Williams PPG and Behr — all chose shades of green as their colors of the year for 2022. (The Pantone Color Institute which picked gray and yellow last year went with periwinkle blue for the new year. )

We talked to three bay area designers about color and what else is in store for 2022 (although supply chain issues mean that what’s actually in the stores might still be limited.)

Suzan Decker Ross Decker Ross Interiors Clearwater

Ross has had her own design firm for 30 years but the roots go back much further. “Both my parents were in the furniture business” she said “and though I really didn’t know it at the time it was in my blood.” She studied fashion first then design and realized that the two go hand in hand. “I had an aha moment — I love design!” said Ross who has clients throughout Florida as well as in other states.

Pandemic-caused delays mean it might take 20 or 30 months to get a custom sofa instead of two or three as before. “You can’t put a room together which hurts us” Ross said “so we see a lot of repurposing and renewing. Maybe they recover something or if it’s metal paint it a different color. We’re seeing vintage coming back really big” because of the availability.

With many people continuing to work at home Ross finds a desire to bring the outdoors in. “Living walls” and kitchen herb gardens are big as are flowering plants. And green will be everywhere. At the annual furniture market in High Point N.C. last summer “There was everything from olive green to evergreen” Ross said. “It’s really wild the greens that were there.”

In bedrooms heavy comforters are being replaced by lighter-weight quilts and coverlets. And anyone who has ever found themselves in a hotel or guest bedroom wondering where to put all the extra pillows decorative and otherwise might be heartened by this design change: “We’re not using as many pillows” Ross said. “We might do three or four instead of six. Less is better on pillows.”

Other trends:

“LED lighting is huge. Now it comes in every different hue and they are nice because they last for years and the prices have come way down. Anytime we redo a home we always change all the lights to LED almost immediately. When doing design lighting can make a huge difference.”

“Light woods like oak are coming back. For many years people were so into darker floors the cherries the mahoganies. Now we’re seeing a lot more of the light wide-plank flooring. Also luxury vinyl plank flooring has really come a long way. Back in the day you could hear the clink clink on the floor when you walked now you can’t even tell.”

“Textures are big too. Your wallpaper and grass cloth embossed papers are really big right now. We’re seeing a surge in wallpaper coming back maybe in a power bath or accent wall or kitchen.”

Enrique Crespo Crespo Design Group Tampa

Even in high school Crespo knew what he wanted to do in life. “I traveled a lot around Europe with my mom and was attracted to design and art and going to museums” said the Tampa native. He attended the Savannah College of Art and Design served a six-month internship with a designer and 22 years ago opened his own firm. Today he “works all over the place” including Beverly Hills Calif. Montana and the Florida Keys.

Due to the pandemic “people have been home a really long time and they’ve decided to make their home just the way they want it” Crespo said. “They are trying to make things simpler not as fussy so there are a lot of cleaner neutral colors.” He considers mid-century “timeless” but said that clients and furniture makers are on the same page these days when it comes to comfort. Whereas “very sculptural pieces” used to be in vogue “manufacturers are moving away from that and making these very beautiful pieces that are welcoming as well to lay in and read a book” Crespo said.

In a continuing trend high-end home construction is forsaking formal dining rooms for great rooms. Among Crespo’s current projects is one for a North Florida couple that bought a condo in Tampa for when they come to see the Lightning and Bucs play. “They wanted a great room with multiple seating areas. You might have just one big room that’s a dining room game room whatever.”

Other trends:

“I really see a move towards indoor-outdoor living. Now that people are at home they really want to have this sort of seamless experience from that inside to the outside of the home. When I see colors like that (the green colors of the year) it really ties into nature.”

“There’s always a demand for home theaters. Because of the pandemic people don’t want to sit in a movie theater for two or three hours. I try to keep people away from the traditional theater chair. I really love big giant chaise lounges that are so much more comfortable than a theater chair. We try to do acoustical covering to help with the sound. Wall coverings (for home theaters) have come a long way. One company I love Elitis a French company does this great foam paper that comes in a variety of patterns. The acoustic quality is fabulous.”

“Home gyms have become more and more popular so people don’t have to go out and expose themselves to a lot of other people. We’re seeing more and more saunas in homes more and more full-on gyms.”

Leah Chorniak Spaces by Leah Tampa

While doing custom artwork for clients Chorniak often found herself mentally critiquing their design sense — or lack of it — as she hung paintings. “I would bring my art into a client’s home and think ‘If they would just move that vase over there’” she recalled. Her flair for decorating led to working with friends and then to starting her own business seven years ago.

Chorniak numbers several Tampa Bay Buccaneers among her clientele. To accommodate their size she sometimes designs furniture that is larger than what most stores sell and that has “more of a pitch” as she puts it making it easier to lean back into and sink down. “Comfort” is today’s buzzword.

“Now that people are working from home they really want to feel cozy and comfortable” Chorniak said. “I certainly hope mid-century is making a bit of an exit. It has unique lines and is interesting to look at but it’s not the everyday cozy go-to chair or sofa with a book and a cup of coffee. There’s a demand for sofa and chairs that have a deep pitch.”

Chorniak also finds that many of her clients “are feeling grayed out.”

“Things are leaning away from gray and toward your muted greens beige tones oatmeal tones in soft fabrics like velvet” she said. “Even kids’ rooms seem to be a little more neutral. Gone are the days when you had those retro colors that are stimulating for children but keep them a little more active.”

Other observations:

“Home offices used to have big bulky furniture and now that we’ve gone to a digital world people have less paper laying around and they are more interested in comfortable ergonomic seating. A great area rug modern draperies — things like that will absorb sound because kids might be in the next room and also give a beautiful aesthetic.”

“A big thing is metal color — gold silver copper. Builders typically give you brushed nicked (on fixtures) but when you look at a design magazine you’re not going to see brushed nickel you’ll see satin brass beautiful matte gold or polished nickel. Those are things that are a little more expressive for your personality.”

“The master bedroom was usually that room where you shut the door and had a dog bed on the side. Now that people are living more hours inside the house they are really having it as a sanctuary. With the master we’ve been doing a lot of ivories and off white because it’s soothing and makes it feel like the space is bigger than it is. Maybe have a coffee maker or a wine fridge — I find parents are absolutely loving that it’s convenient to have a glass of wine at night in their own little sanctuary.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC9uYW1lL3NhcmFoLWhlcnJlbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjc3MDgyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SARAH HERREN Obituary (2022) - Washington DC - The Washington Post,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/washingtonpost/name/sarah-herren-obituary?id=32770822 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy93YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC9uYW1lL3NhcmFoLWhlcnJlbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMjc3MDgyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29hc3RhbC5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvd2hhdHMtY29taW5nLWR1cmJpbi1wYXJrL9IBOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29hc3RhbC5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvd2hhdHMtY29taW5nLWR1cmJpbi1wYXJrLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Running List of What’s Coming to Durbin Park,"LAST UPDATED: February 5 2022

Those numbers were shared by President and CEO Jason Liberty on the company’s year end and fourth quarter earnings call on Friday.

“This positivity rate is still a small fraction of what it is in society at large and nearly all cases onboard were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms” Liberty said.

“Our rigorous health and safety protocols with 100% percent vaccination rate among our crew and close to 100 percent vaccination rate among our guests provide a safe environment where we can fulfill our mission of delivering amazing vacations. And our guests are responding by providing record Net Promoter Scores for us exceeding their expectations” he added.

Michael Bayley president and CEO of the Royal Caribbean International brand also said that while the Omicron variant did impact crew aboard most crew had no symptoms.

“99 percent of the crew positivity was asymptomatic and the 1 percent was extremely mild symptoms. I mean it really was remarkable in many ways. But the impact on the crew was effectively 0 except to take them out of operation for the period of their quarantine” Bayley said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAyL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1jcnVpc2UtYm9va2luZ3Mtc3VyZ2UtYmFjay10by1wcmUtb21pY3Jvbi1sZXZlbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean Cruise Bookings Surge Back to Pre-Omicron Levels,"“In fact in the last week of January bookings returned to pre-Omicron levels and we expect demand recovery to accelerate as the variant subsides” said Jason Liberty president and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group on the company’s year end and fourth quarter earnings call.

“With that in mind we have extended our sales and marketing activities for a delayed and extended wave (season)” Liberty said.

Royal Caribbean’s new CEO called 2022 a strong transitional year as the company brings the rest of its fleet into operations and approaches historical occupancy levels.

Among the highlights are two important new ships in the Wonder of the Seas for Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Beyond for Celebrity Cruises.

“This is a key pillar to support our recovery” Liberty noted. “New hardware is an important driver of quality demand extraordinary customer experience and exceptional financial performance. And just as important it improves our sustainability as these are innovative ships that are much more energy efficient.”

Michael Bayley president and CEO of the Royal Caribbean International brand said bookings were exceeding 2019 numbers.

“And as we moved into the fourth quarter of last year our bookings started to exceed 2019 levels both in volume and rate and it was clear that everybody was in a vacation mode” Bayley said.

Naftali Holtz chief financial officer added that cruise bookings were continuing to improve and the company had a blockbuster Black Friday.

“For the last several quarters we have seen new bookings improve from one quarter to the next. Bookings in the fourth quarter continued this positive trajectory culminating in our biggest-ever Black Friday and Cyber Weekend from the U.S. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up more than 75 percent compared to the third quarter” he said.

“As we restarted our brand marketing programs in Q4 we generated strong demand to support the book of business for ’22 and ’23.

“As the Omicron variant began spreading in December we experienced slower booking activity and higher near-term cancellations over the holiday period as many guests were testing positive before their cruise. But from the beginning of the year we have seen meaningful week-over-week improvement in booking activity for both the first and the second half of ’22. Second half booking activity has been recovering at a faster pace. In addition to that we have seen a rapid improvement in cancellations over the same period” Holtz said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwNDgxNzQxL1RyYWRpZS1sb2NrZWQtZml2ZS1kYXlzLWNydWlzZS10aHJlZXNvbWUtMTgteWVhci1vbGRzLWZhY2VzLTUwMC0wMDAtbGVnYWwtYmlsbC5odG1s0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTA0ODE3NDEvYW1wL1RyYWRpZS1sb2NrZWQtZml2ZS1kYXlzLWNydWlzZS10aHJlZXNvbWUtMTgteWVhci1vbGRzLWZhY2VzLTUwMC0wMDAtbGVnYWwtYmlsbC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tradie locked up for five days on cruise over threesome with 18-year-olds faces $500000 legal bill,"A Sydney tradesman who was awarded almost $100000 from a cruise ship company is now facing a $500000 legal bill after his payout was overturned.

The NSW Court of Appeal heard Daniel Rawlings was detained for five days in an Explorer of the Seas cabin after allegations he sexually assaulted an 18-year-old girl known as Ms A.

Rawlings has always denied any wrongdoing over the November 2016 incident and has never been charged by police.

Daniel Rawlings (pictured) is facing legal costs thought to amount to around $500000

In 2020 NSW District Court Judge John Hatzistergos ruled the air conditioning technician's continued detention in the cabin beyond noon on the third day was not reasonable and awarded him $97344 in damages.

Rawlings 33 was later also awarded legal costs - said to amount to around $300000 at the time - from the Miami-based Royal Caribbean the world's second largest cruise company.

But Royal Caribbean appealed and won meaning Rawlings will not get the damages he was awarded and will also have to pay the company's and his own legal costs which is likely to be at least $500000 between the initial case and the appeal.

The court heard that on the third day of his detention the ship's master Captain Rick Sullivan was contacted by the company's security department which recommended Rawlings be released on the condition he have no contact with Ms A or her family the Sunday Telegraph reported.

Justice Anthony Meagher of the NSW Court of Appeal said Captain Sullivan had decided to keep Rawlings locked up to avoid conflict after Ms A's mother threatened to throw him overboard if he was freed from the cabin.

The captain thought detaining Rawlings until the ship got back to Sydney was needed for the safety Ms A her family other passengers and Rawlings himself the court heard.

Justice Meagher also said Judge Hatzistergos' view keeping Rawlings who is from Sydney's north locked in a cabin was 'akin to solitary confinement' was not supported.

'His welfare was regularly checked both by security officers and the ship's medical staff' Justice Meagher said.

'He was given the opportunity to make twice daily visits to the crew deck where he had access to the open air and the opportunity to smoke.

Daniel Rawlings (pictured) suggested a threesome with another teenage girl

'He also had 24-hour access to food and non-alcoholic beverages as well as the opportunity to acquire necessary clothing from the ship's gift shop.'

At the initial 2020 hearing the court heard that Mr Rawlings met an 18-year-old woman on the dancefloor at the ship's Dizzy's Nightclub on November 13 2016 and they had sex in his cabin.

The next evening at the same venue Rawlings suggested they have a threesome with a second passenger Ms A also 18.

The court heard evidence that after a moment on the dancefloor they stumbled back to Rawlings' cabin.

There the trio began kissing touching and undressing each other before taking turns having sex.

The court heard it wasn't long before Rawlings' roommate Matthew Champion stormed out with a blanket and sought out a deck chair to sleep on.

'Not again' he said.

Rawlings told the court he pushed the two single beds together and the trio 'had sex for several hours which he later refined to more than an hour possibly two' Judge Hatzistergos recounted in his judgment.

But the court heard Ms A fell ill. Rawlings told the court he helped Ms A into the bathroom so she could vomit and have a shower.

Later that night ship security was called when Ms A was found naked in another guest's room after 5am.

A guard reported the young woman said: 'I don't know what happened. All I know is I am dancing in Dizzy's and am looking for a bathroom.'

Tradesman Daniel Rawlings left with his best mate Matthew Champion right prior to the cruise ship incident

In his judgment Judge Hatzistergos recalled the ship's crew members were concerned the confused young woman was too intoxicated to be able to consent to sex with one categorising the incident as 'sexual assault - rape' based upon that.

Ms A's mother was also worried her daughter may have been drugged during the episode.

An onboard drug screening test recorded a negative result.

The other woman involved in the encounter told the NSW District Court that Ms A 'knew exactly what she was doing' during a consensual sex session.

The tradesman was on board the Explorer of the Seas in November 2016 holidaying with a pal

Rawlings told the court on the fourth day of his confinement he heard Ms A's mother outside his room.

She was furious insisting Rawlings could escape and should be bound and restrained.

'He is in there. He raped my daughter' she said Rawlings told the court.

Rawlings was reduced to tears by this telling the court it left him 'destroyed' and the accusation still affected him.

He said he would be the first person to assist help and comfort a woman who he felt was being mistreated.

Police boarded the Explorer of the Seas cruise ship when it docked at Circular Quay in November 2016 and questioned Rawlings over the incident. No charges were laid

Rawlings was interviewed by NSW Police upon arrival in Sydney Harbour on November 20 2016. Officers had no jurisdiction and referred the matter to the Federal Police the court heard.

The AFP did not press charges against Rawlings for several reasons including that Ms A hadn't provided an account of what happened during three critical hours the other woman had given an account that the sex by all three members was consensual and a lack of evidence from the crime scene or Rawlings' phone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei93b3JsZC9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXRyYWRpZS1kYW5pZWwtcmF3bGluZ3MtdG8tcGF5LWJhY2stcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWNydWlzZXMtMTAwMDAwLWZvbGxvd2luZy1hcHBlYWwtb3Zlci1iZWluZy1sb2NrZWQtdXAtZm9yLWZpdmUtZGF5cy9JR05ENzNBNDNHWkRTTVVJQ1FPUFFSNlNNNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australian Tradie Daniel Rawlings to pay back Royal Caribbean Cruises $100000 following appeal over being locked ...,"Daniel Rawlings was awarded more than $100000 in damages and court costs in 2020 after he successfully sued Royal Caribbean Cruises.

A cruise line has successfully argued its ship captain was justified in detaining a Sydney tradie for several days after a young woman accused him of sexually assaulting her during a threesome in his room.

Daniel Rawlings was awarded more than $100000 in damages and court costs in 2020 after he successfully sued Royal Caribbean Cruises.

But now he has been ordered to pay the money back and foot the legal bills of the major Miami-based cruise company for both the initial court action against it and the appeal hearing.

The NSW Court of Appeal heard Rawlings was 28 when he was held in isolation for five days on the Explorer of the Seas in November 2016 following allegations made by an 18-year-old woman known as Ms A who was found confused and disoriented.

The court heard the teenager was found wandering naked through the ship in the early hours of November 15 and told security she had no memory of what had happened after she left the ship's nightclub Dizzy's about 2am.

She was captured on CCTV walking into Rawlings' room with him and another woman and was later seen leaving naked before walking into an elderly couple's room.

The other woman involved in the threesome told the District Court Ms A ""knew exactly what she was doing"" during the consensual sex session which lasted several hours.

The incident occurred five days into the 10-day voyage while the ship was in international waters and Rawlings from Sydney's northern beaches denied any wrongdoing and was never charged by police.

In the District Court Judge John Hatzistergos initially ruled the airconditioning tradesman's continued detention was not reasonable and based on ""a suspicion of a crime rather than any evidence"".

Judge Hatzistergos said holding Rawlings beyond noon on the third day was uncalled for after ship Captain Rick Sullivan was told by the cruise company's security department he be released on the condition he stay away from Ms A.

""Following a meeting between the captain senior ship's officers or crew and Ms A and her mother later that morning at which A's mother became emotional and threatened to throw the respondent overboard if he were released the captain communicated his decision at midday to keep the respondent in confinement until the ship returned to Sydney"" the appeal judgment says.

Rawlings was awarded general damages of $70000 aggravated damages of $20000 and the court ordered the cruiseliner pay the costs of the legal proceedings.

The cruise company appealed against the decision.

When the matter was brought to the NSW Court of Appeal the cruise company argued that Judge Hatzistergos did not properly consider ""the risk to order on the vessel"" given the emotionally charged environment on board.

Justice Anthony Meagher said Captain Sullivan decided to keep Rawlings in detention to avoid any potential conflict.

The court heard keeping the tradie in his room until the ship docked in Sydney was necessary to ensure everyone was kept safe including Rawlings.

Justice Meagher said the finding that the 28-year-old's detention was ""akin to solitary confinement"" had no evidence as his welfare was regularly checked by both security and medical staff.

""He was given the opportunity to make twice daily visits to the crew deck where he had access to the open air and the opportunity to smoke"" Justice Meagher said.

""He also had 24-hour access to food and non-alcoholic beverages as well as the opportunity to acquire necessary clothing from the ship's gift shop.""

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

Brady likely knew there were going to be some things said that he might not like but he seemed to want the subject of the jokes to stay with him not his former owner.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so."

Baby boomers is a term first used in America used to describe those born between 1946 and 1964. Now it is a widely used term for people of that age anywhere in the world.However on the internet  being called a boomer could mean a lot of things ⁠— mostly derisive ⁠— but being tech savvy is not one of them. To the surprise of Salesforce a cloud-based software firm more boomers in India are embracing digital skills than those in developed countries.The study titled “Digital Skills Index” surveyed 23000 employed and prospective employees across 19 countries including India the United States United Kingdom Australia South Korea Singapore and Italy.The study also found that India ranked the highest in terms of digital skills readiness.

The company has acquired 84 companies in the last 30 months. In the second half of last year it bought 20 companies taking the total count for last year to 43 shows data from corporate consultancy Hampleton Partners. The most recent ones include software and consulting firm Headspring and Tambourine a Salesforce-based e-commerce solution provider.The report said the acquisitions fall under three categories.One firms operating within an IT vendor ecosystem such as Microsoft SAP Salesforce  or AWS. Two IT consultancies focused on horizontal technologies such as cybersecurity. And three consultancies catering to specific verticals such as manufacturing and digital commerce. The IT & business services sector saw a 10% increase in the number of M&A transactions between 2020 and 2021 with 902 deals in 2021 compared to 818 in 2020.Following Accenture was global digital services firm Presidio  which made 17 acquisitions in the last 30 months. Cognizant was at No. 3 with 16 acquisitions during the same period. One of its more recent ones is Devbridge  a software consultancy and product development company headquartered in Chicago.Hampleton Partners said private equity players continue to invest and acquire accounting for 35% of all transactions in the sector in the past 30 months. Software development and cybersecurity both remain highly sought after acquisition prospects largely due to the need to continue innovating and ensure enterprise security. Miro Parizek  founder & principal partner at Hampleton Partners said “Global IT services spending is anticipated to continue strongly in 2022 after the astronomical increases seen in 2021. We are now wholly familiar with the idea that the changes in workforce behaviour towards remote and hybrid models catalysed digitalisation. The divergence from traditional pre-pandemic work environments instilled greater demand for cloud-based services to replace legacy on-site infrastructure. Firms are being forced to respond to this reorientation by increasing investment and IT budgets. This has turbo-charged M&A activity in the sector.”,,,,,,

Scana-owned PSW Technology has signed an exclusive license agreement with Cameron a Schlumberger company to carry out recertification of risers produced by Cameron under Original Equipment Manufacturer standards.

The agreement grants PSW the right to carry out everything from engineering to replacement of parts assembly welding and certification and Cameron will treat PSW’s Certificate of Compliance (COC) as OEM original.

PSW Technology is a Norwegian supplier of products systems and services to the energy and maritime industries. It is currently Norway’s largest within recertification and modification services to marine risers and has worked closely together with Cameron since 2012.

PSW Technology also has a partnership agreement with Schlumberger. While the agreement is exclusive to Norway PSW has been granted the right to undertake recertification for UK customers under a one-year firm deal. It also additionally strengthens PSW’s relationship with Cameron.

“The agreement represents an important stamp of approval and a competitive advantage for PSW. It enables our customers to reduce time spent on recertification with the potential for inspections to be carried out offshore while all repair work is done by PSW’s experts in our premises at Mongstad – a location close to the North Sea and Norway’s most important shipping base for this type of equipment” says Oddbjørn Haukøy CCO of Scana ASA

“Furthermore the agreement simplifies the recertification process by giving our customers one supplier to relate to from start to finish – instead of having several which often is the case today” he added.

“To land the license agreement the company has undergone a comprehensive revision. Everything we have of procedural work is now approved by Cameron and today we work according to their systems and routines. This is a partnership we have earned and we see the agreement as a strong recognition of the competence facilities and procedures PSW has for engineering assembly machining welding and testing” Haukøy concluded.

After system files you've got less than 700GB of free space for games and those games average around 25GB but can go past 100GB in size.

But there's good news. After a few OS updates your PS5's second internal hard drive slot which was initially deactivated when the PS5 was first released is now available for use. That means you can use a sold-separately M.2 drive (a type of solid state storage drive) to store and play both PS5 and PS4 games from.

Much like the PS5 itself or desktop graphics cards some phones and even new cars pandemic supply chain issues have made these M.2 solid state drives hard to find especially in the most popular console-ready sizes. That appears to be easing now and two of the three drives we've tested are available right now (the Corsair a new model doesn't appear to be in stock yet).

We've gathered advice on some of the best M.2 drives for your PS5 in our guide. But if your preferred model is unavailable how much of a difference does it make if you buy something else?

The Samsung 980 Pro. Joe Kaminski/CNET

To figure this out my colleagues and I tested three M.2 drives specially marketed as being PS5-ready. We tested the Seagate Firecuda 530 the Samsung 980 Pro and the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX all of which included a built-in heat sink. Prices on these jump around a good deal but the 2TB version of each currently runs between $350-$400.

Watch this: PS5 M.2 drives compared and tested 04:46

For each drive we took a game with a smaller file size and a game with a larger file size and timed how long it took for the PS5 to transfer the game files between the internal PS5 drive and the new M.2 secondary drive and also how long it took for the files to make a return trip from the M.2 drive to the internal drive. It's a casual test but works as a general guide for comparing these very similar drives.

In all three cases transferring from the internal drive to the new M.2 drive was faster than the reverse writing back to the internal drive. Note the internal drive has a read/write speed of 5500MBps while the Seagate Firecuda is listed as 7300MBps. The Samsung is listed at up to 7000MBps read/write and the Corsair at 7100MBps read and 6800MBps write.

Based on this it's fine to shop based on availability price and capacity. With it becoming glaringly obvious that today's consoles just don't ship with enough storage space you're going to need extra capacity sooner or later.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Love those clean mid-century lines but how about something really comfortable. And wouldn’t a luxurious home theater be nice?

With many of us spending a lot more time at home during the pandemic tastes in furnishing and decor have changed. One example: a shift back to warm tones and the soothing colors of nature. While it seemed that every house on the market for a time had the same gray walls and flooring four of the major paint manufacturers — Benjamin Moore Sherwin-Williams PPG and Behr — all chose shades of green as their colors of the year for 2022. (The Pantone Color Institute which picked gray and yellow last year went with periwinkle blue for the new year. )

We talked to three bay area designers about color and what else is in store for 2022 (although supply chain issues mean that what’s actually in the stores might still be limited.)

Suzan Decker Ross Decker Ross Interiors Clearwater

Ross has had her own design firm for 30 years but the roots go back much further. “Both my parents were in the furniture business” she said “and though I really didn’t know it at the time it was in my blood.” She studied fashion first then design and realized that the two go hand in hand. “I had an aha moment — I love design!” said Ross who has clients throughout Florida as well as in other states.

Pandemic-caused delays mean it might take 20 or 30 months to get a custom sofa instead of two or three as before. “You can’t put a room together which hurts us” Ross said “so we see a lot of repurposing and renewing. Maybe they recover something or if it’s metal paint it a different color. We’re seeing vintage coming back really big” because of the availability.

With many people continuing to work at home Ross finds a desire to bring the outdoors in. “Living walls” and kitchen herb gardens are big as are flowering plants. And green will be everywhere. At the annual furniture market in High Point N.C. last summer “There was everything from olive green to evergreen” Ross said. “It’s really wild the greens that were there.”

In bedrooms heavy comforters are being replaced by lighter-weight quilts and coverlets. And anyone who has ever found themselves in a hotel or guest bedroom wondering where to put all the extra pillows decorative and otherwise might be heartened by this design change: “We’re not using as many pillows” Ross said. “We might do three or four instead of six. Less is better on pillows.”

Other trends:

“LED lighting is huge. Now it comes in every different hue and they are nice because they last for years and the prices have come way down. Anytime we redo a home we always change all the lights to LED almost immediately. When doing design lighting can make a huge difference.”

“Light woods like oak are coming back. For many years people were so into darker floors the cherries the mahoganies. Now we’re seeing a lot more of the light wide-plank flooring. Also luxury vinyl plank flooring has really come a long way. Back in the day you could hear the clink clink on the floor when you walked now you can’t even tell.”

“Textures are big too. Your wallpaper and grass cloth embossed papers are really big right now. We’re seeing a surge in wallpaper coming back maybe in a power bath or accent wall or kitchen.”

Enrique Crespo Crespo Design Group Tampa

Even in high school Crespo knew what he wanted to do in life. “I traveled a lot around Europe with my mom and was attracted to design and art and going to museums” said the Tampa native. He attended the Savannah College of Art and Design served a six-month internship with a designer and 22 years ago opened his own firm. Today he “works all over the place” including Beverly Hills Calif. Montana and the Florida Keys.

Due to the pandemic “people have been home a really long time and they’ve decided to make their home just the way they want it” Crespo said. “They are trying to make things simpler not as fussy so there are a lot of cleaner neutral colors.” He considers mid-century “timeless” but said that clients and furniture makers are on the same page these days when it comes to comfort. Whereas “very sculptural pieces” used to be in vogue “manufacturers are moving away from that and making these very beautiful pieces that are welcoming as well to lay in and read a book” Crespo said.

In a continuing trend high-end home construction is forsaking formal dining rooms for great rooms. Among Crespo’s current projects is one for a North Florida couple that bought a condo in Tampa for when they come to see the Lightning and Bucs play. “They wanted a great room with multiple seating areas. You might have just one big room that’s a dining room game room whatever.”

Other trends:

“I really see a move towards indoor-outdoor living. Now that people are at home they really want to have this sort of seamless experience from that inside to the outside of the home. When I see colors like that (the green colors of the year) it really ties into nature.”

“There’s always a demand for home theaters. Because of the pandemic people don’t want to sit in a movie theater for two or three hours. I try to keep people away from the traditional theater chair. I really love big giant chaise lounges that are so much more comfortable than a theater chair. We try to do acoustical covering to help with the sound. Wall coverings (for home theaters) have come a long way. One company I love Elitis a French company does this great foam paper that comes in a variety of patterns. The acoustic quality is fabulous.”

“Home gyms have become more and more popular so people don’t have to go out and expose themselves to a lot of other people. We’re seeing more and more saunas in homes more and more full-on gyms.”

Leah Chorniak Spaces by Leah Tampa

While doing custom artwork for clients Chorniak often found herself mentally critiquing their design sense — or lack of it — as she hung paintings. “I would bring my art into a client’s home and think ‘If they would just move that vase over there’” she recalled. Her flair for decorating led to working with friends and then to starting her own business seven years ago.

Chorniak numbers several Tampa Bay Buccaneers among her clientele. To accommodate their size she sometimes designs furniture that is larger than what most stores sell and that has “more of a pitch” as she puts it making it easier to lean back into and sink down. “Comfort” is today’s buzzword.

“Now that people are working from home they really want to feel cozy and comfortable” Chorniak said. “I certainly hope mid-century is making a bit of an exit. It has unique lines and is interesting to look at but it’s not the everyday cozy go-to chair or sofa with a book and a cup of coffee. There’s a demand for sofa and chairs that have a deep pitch.”

Chorniak also finds that many of her clients “are feeling grayed out.”

“Things are leaning away from gray and toward your muted greens beige tones oatmeal tones in soft fabrics like velvet” she said. “Even kids’ rooms seem to be a little more neutral. Gone are the days when you had those retro colors that are stimulating for children but keep them a little more active.”

Other observations:

“Home offices used to have big bulky furniture and now that we’ve gone to a digital world people have less paper laying around and they are more interested in comfortable ergonomic seating. A great area rug modern draperies — things like that will absorb sound because kids might be in the next room and also give a beautiful aesthetic.”

“A big thing is metal color — gold silver copper. Builders typically give you brushed nicked (on fixtures) but when you look at a design magazine you’re not going to see brushed nickel you’ll see satin brass beautiful matte gold or polished nickel. Those are things that are a little more expressive for your personality.”

“The master bedroom was usually that room where you shut the door and had a dog bed on the side. Now that people are living more hours inside the house they are really having it as a sanctuary. With the master we’ve been doing a lot of ivories and off white because it’s soothing and makes it feel like the space is bigger than it is. Maybe have a coffee maker or a wine fridge — I find parents are absolutely loving that it’s convenient to have a glass of wine at night in their own little sanctuary.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhaXNsZXlmdW5lcmFsaG9tZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy93aWxidXItc2Nod2VuZ2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Wilbur ""Bill"" John Schwenger Obituary 2022",Wilbur “Bill” John SchwengerBill Schwenger age 80 entered into the House of his Lord February 5 2022 surrounded by his wife and children.Mr. Schwenger was born in Chicago Illinois to the late John William and Helen Wilkinson Schwenger on August 7 1941.

In one of the busiest off-seasons since the 1990s the series and its teams have been working away on developing the all-new next generation of Nascar vehicle in preparation for the new season.

Early discussions over Nascar’s Next Gen car took place all the way back in January 2019. The final product will include an updated front splitter aerodynamic vents on the bonnet and a redesigned side skirt. Additionally a rear diffuser will be introduced which will be used in Nascar for the first time.

As the Covid-19 pandemic begins to subside amid increasing vaccination rates Nascar is also more confident about running its 2022 season largely unaffected. The impact of the pandemic in 2021 meant that an event at Auto Club Speedway in California was cancelled and replaced by a race weekend on the Daytona Road Course. The series is hoping and expecting that no such changes will need to be made in 2022.

Last year Nascar revealed its next-generation car for the 2022 season

The 2022 Cup Series season also features a new event at the World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway which will take place on 5th June. It is the only venue to be added to the series’ 36 point-scoring events throughout the season.

Meanwhile Nascar's famous Clash event is set to kick off the 2022 season on 6th February only this year the event is being held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Named ‘The Clash at the Coliseum’ it will be the first time since 1979 that Nascar's preseason race has taken place at a venue other than the Daytona Speedway. To be able to host Nascar the Coliseum will be transformed into a quarter-mile asphalt short track built around the football field.

“Los Angeles is synonymous with major sports and entertainment events so we seized an innovative opportunity to showcase Nascar at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum” said Ben Kennedy Nascar’s senior vice president of strategy and innovation speaking at the time of the announcement.

“We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to take centre stage in this market as we get our 2022 season underway.

The LA Memorial Coliseum is being transformed into a Nascar circuit for ‘The Clash at the Coliseum’ preseason event

“It’ll be asphalt quarter-mile. We’ll have a few pit stalls maybe eight to ten inside but for non-competitive stuff. If someone has a loose wheel or needs to repair their car they’ll be able to come in and do that.”

With the Clash at the Coliseum set to kickstart Nascar’s Next Gen era BlackBook Motorsport presents a rundown of the series’ teams and their commercial partnerships as they gear up for the new season.

The nation’s biggest mall owner Simon Property Group has sold its share of the struggling Circle Centre Mall a development that was credited with helping spark downtown Indianapolis' revitalization in the 1990s.

Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group divested its 15% ownership of the 600000-square-foot mall at the end of 2021 by selling its shares back to Circle Centre Development Co. — a limited partnership of 17 business and corporate investors.

The deal was finalized Dec. 30 and the price was not disclosed.

The decision to have Simon relinquish its ownership stake “was in the best interest” of all involved said Adam Collins a partner at Indianapolis firm Wallack Somers & Haas and legal counsel to Circle Centre’s ownership group.

Last April Simon handed over day-to-day management of the property to commercial real estate firm JLL.

Circle Centre Mall debuted with much fanfare in 1995 but it has seen an exodus of major retailers in recent years such as Nordstrom and Carson’s department store.

The city of Indianapolis which owns the mall building and the land it sits on leases the property to Circle Centre Development Co. the partnership of companies that provided $75 million toward the mall’s $320 million original development cost.

The ownership group announced Friday that it’s soliciting ideas for ways to redevelop the property.

Something went wrong please try again later.

With Valentine's Day fast approaching many shoppers will be looking to treat themselves to a cute outfit. Whether you're celebrating with the love of your life hosting a Galentine's meal with your best friends or even spending a day showing love for yourself a fresh look could give you an extra spring in your step.

Marks and Spencer seemed to have the answer with their most recent Instagram post shared to their 1.9 million followers. They posted a range of their favourite maxi and midi dresses perfect for the occasion. However some fans were left feeling frustrated with the length of the style that seems to be in fashion at the moment.

The high street store shared the snap with the caption: ""Oh do we have a weekend treat for you! Our previous best-sellers are now available to rent through @HireStreetUK. Even better order now and you'll have it in time for Valentine's Day! Happy browsing. #MyMarks.""

In the post models are seen wearing different dresses. All are long or midi in length with long sleeves. The first snap shows a model wearing a mostly black floral dress with black boots. The second seems to be a fan-favourite in the comments - a pink v-neck style which would be ideal for a day celebrating love.

The third picture is a red tiered dress which is paired with some flat shoes for a smart-casual look. Next up there is another black floral dress to contend with. The penultimate snap is of a mustard yellow tiered dress with silver shows. Finally there is a blue pink and yellow floral number.

The post received over 1800 likes and fans took to the comments to share their thoughts.

Some shoppers loved the looks. One said: ""Gorgeous dress"" while others fixated on one outfit in particular. The pink dress went down well with fans with one writing: ""Love the pink one. So gorgeous."" Another agreed commenting: ""Love the pink dress with the boots.""

However some shoppers managed to find a problem with the outfits. According to fans there seems to be a lot of long dresses which might not work for the shorter shopper. This left one commenter frustrated. They asked: ""Do they come in the short length? I love M&S for doing short length trousers but can never find the short length of these super long dresses!""

Similarly some fans just simply did not like the looks - after all style is subjective. One wrote: ""None of them do anything for me. think M&S need to find a new designer."" Another quipped rather harshly: ""Sorry! Each and every one of the dresses are (in my opinion) just awful. No style no definition….. A two-year-old I’m sure could design better.""

Longer styles can be a perfect fit for the cooler months if you want to look fashionable while still remaining relatively warm in the seasonal transition. However fans have found that maxi and mid dresses prove difficult for shorter shoppers.

In the photo young Vogue is posing beside her sister Amber who she recently enjoyed a holiday in the Maldives with.

Taking to her Instagram story Vogue shared a video of the sweet snap which was in a white frame.

The two girls posed side by side as they showed off their outfits.

Vogue wore a Mickey Mouse top a red jacket a black hat and a pair of brown heeled boots with some sunglasses.

Amber who had her hand on her hip in the snap wore a similar outfit.

She sported a black hat blue and yellow sunglasses a green jacket Bosco's pyjamas and a pair of dark brown boots.

Vogue told her followers how stylish they were and said she would still wear the look.

Vogue said: ""Amber and I have always been stylin'. I remember I was so jealous of her Bosco pyjamas.

""I would wear that look now"".

Vogue recently revealed that a ""furious taxi driver did an anger s**t on"" the doorstep outside her home.

The disgusted Dublin native also revealed how she got into the car a few minutes later - but had no idea what he'd done.

DUMPING HORROR

The grim news was revealed by Amber after the driver was captured taking the poo on her building's CCTV.

Vogue told how the horror unfolded after she had a row with the cab driver over what time the booking was for.

Vogue said: ""Amber rang me and Amber was like 'Did you know what that driver did this morning?'

""And I was like 'What? He was really pissed off at me. He really had a go at me he was so f****d off.'

""We have a concierge that sits and he walked in the door and there was a full human s**t with tissue on my doorstep.

""So he couldn't get through the pedestrian gate without getting s**t on your feet so my poor concierge said 'I have to clean up this s**t but I also want to know who did the s**t because there's CCTV'.""

FURIOUS DRIVER

She added: ""So anyway he looks at the CCTV the driver is seen pacing up and down furiously.

""And he's pacing up and down furiously looking up and down the road comes back does a half-standing half squatting s**t wipes his a*** gets into the car no joke. I got into the car less than a minute later.

""My concierge was like 'Did you shake his hand?' And I was like 'He was raging at me.'

""He did an anger s**t on my doorstep and then I get into the car and explain the situation and he's probably sitting there thinking 'I've just s**t on her doorstep and she didn't even do anything to me'."""

AUSTIN – Passenger and heavy truck traffic along the southern section of Texas State Highway 130 skyrocketed 62% year-over-year to reach an all-time high in 2021 according to a new report released by officials at SH 130 Concession Company which operates and maintains the section of the state-owned highway.

Fueled by a combination of the gradual recovery from the pandemic population growth and increased development along the corridor the company recorded more than 9.7 million transactions on SH 130 between Austin and San Antonio last year alone a 3.7 million increase from 2020.

Despite the increase in traffic the number of accidents decreased to only 34 accidents per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) – the best safety report on SH 130 since 2018. Altogether the SH 130 corridor safety incidents remain lower than comparable rural interstate and state-owned highways in Texas.

“More drivers are choosing SH 130 than ever before because it provides the only high-speed alternative to I-35 between two of the nation’s fastest growing metro areas — and it’s safe predictable and enjoyable to drive” said Doug Wilson CEO of SH 130 Concession Company. “At the same time the SH 130 Corridor has quickly grown to become the epicenter of development in Central Texas attracting more local heavy truck and passenger traffic. With Tesla recently opening its manufacturing facility on the corridor and a massive new Samsung facility on the horizon we expect these development and traffic trends along this corridor to continue” Wilson added.

Dozens of startups are already working on medical cannabis in Israel where new legislation is expected to lead to further market growth in the fast-expanding sector.

Some believe that cannabis could help Yeruham tackle unemployment among its 12000 residents with initial efforts being led by a firm called CanNegev.

The company is known as an incubator helping foster the growth of infant firms. CanNegev shelters four startups and is Israel’s first medical cannabis technology incubator.

“We have decided to make medical cannabis the heart of our activity here in Yeruham one of the most peripheral towns in Israel — a forgotten city” said CanNegev founder Zvi Bet Or.

He discovered a receptive audience in Tal Ohana elected in 2018 to be Yeruham’s first female mayor.

“My dream is to make Yeruham the capital of medical cannabis in Israel” Ohana told AFP.

“It’s not every day that a new market is born” in the country added Ohana 37. “I told myself I have to do everything to be at the avant-garde of science and technology in this field.”

CanNegev’s modern building facing the desert sands stands out almost like a mirage a symbol of the hoped-for future in the town whose stuccoed blocks of social housing were built in the 1950s for newly arrived immigrants.

But Yeruham is part of an economic priority zone that offers concessions to firms willing to set up there.

Ohana said the cannabis tech sector could transform the image of her town and help bring down its persistently higher-than-average unemployment which is around eight percent.

“My goal is to create quality jobs” and to offer high incomes to attract a new population of workers she said.

World’s leading importer

Recreational use of cannabis is illegal though tolerated in Israel. However authorities have encouraged its therapeutic use for the past decade to treat severe medical conditions and post-traumatic stress in former soldiers as well as others.

In October Israel’s parliament advanced a bill aimed at making medical cannabis more available.

It would expand a market that has already drawn scores of entrepreneurs including two former prime ministers: Ehud Olmert is a business adviser to UNIVO Pharmaceuticals and Ehud Barak chairs the board of InterCure.

About 100 startups are working on cannabis said Dana Gourevich Chief Technology Officer at the Israel Innovation Authority adding that a quarter of those companies were founded in a single year 2019.

“The medical cannabis ecosystem has received $60 million in investments in recent years” said Gourevich.

She said a key factor in developing Israel’s homegrown cannabis industry was imports from overseas especially Canada where recreational use is legal.

According to health ministry data Israel imported 22 tons of medical cannabis in 2021 compared to just over 14 tons a year before making it the world’s largest importer the Israeli Cannabis Magazine noted.

By contrast exporting cannabis is legal in theory but faces significant hurdles complying with international standards Gourevich said.

CBD for all

The health ministry recently indicated it was examining the possibility of removing cannabidiol (CBD) from the list of dangerous drugs. The measure could open a new arena for companies to market CBD products at scale.

In southern Israel near the city of Ashdod BOL Pharma grows 400000 cannabis plants annually on 3.5 hectares (8.6 acres) exclusively for therapeutic use.

“About 110000 patients have (medical cannabis) licenses today in Israel but when CBD becomes available to everyone millions of people families will be able to use it in cosmetics and everyday products” said Dvir Taler 50 director of agriculture at BOL Pharma.

The company currently the largest in the field of medical cannabis in Israel partnered with the CanNegev incubator and supplies it with cannabis flowers for scientific experiments.

Taler said the incubator is developing a robot capable of autonomously harvesting flowers.

In its drive to become Israel’s hub for green gold the municipality of Yeruham has also allocated 50 hectares for the cultivation of medical cannabis arguing that the desert climate is ideal for the crop’s cultivation.

The user of that plot has not yet been determined.

Agreements have also been reached for two factories manufacturing non-medical cannabis products — “self-care” goods such as oils used for cosmetics — to be set up in Yeruham in the coming years Ohana the mayor said.

Resident Avraham Elbaz 67 a retiree said that “of course” he was in favor of these factories which would help create jobs — though he had not tried cannabis before.

“I have never smoked” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVhdHNoZWV0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3NvdXRoZXJuLWNoYXJtLWthdGhyeW4tZGVubmlzLXNoYXJlcy1pbnNpZ2h0LWNvLXBhcmVudGluZy10aG9tYXMtcmF2ZW5lbC1ob2xpZGF5cy5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Southern Charm': Kathryn Dennis Shares Insight Into Co-Parenting With Thomas Ravenel On Holidays,"Kathryn Dennis shares with 'Southern Charm' fans how she manages to celebrate holidays as she co-parents with Thomas Ravenel.

Kathryn Dennis is one of the stars of Southern Charm who has shared her life in front of the cameras. The Bravo personality documented her pregnancies and the rollercoaster of a relationship she had with Tomas Ravenel. Dennis and Ravenel separate for good and now co-parent their two children together. The fashionista recently shared how she manages to celebrate holidays with her kids in this particular situation.

How does Kathryn Dennis celebrate holidays with her kids?

Dennis could be controversial on Southern Charm but there is one thing that everyone can agree on — she loves her kids. The red-head icon had two kids with Ravenel — Kensington and Saint. Unfortunately Dennis and Ravenel were not able to make it as a couple but they continue to work together so their children are able to spend time with each of their parents. This situation can be a little problematic when it comes to holidays but Dennis just shared how she makes it work as Valentine’s Day is approaching.

“Co-parenting means having to spend some holidays without my children..so we just celebrate early!” Dennis posted on Instagram on Feb. 6. “Today was *our* Valentine’s Day. These 2 are the best of my heart the pulse in my veins the place where I am most connected to my truest self and life purpose. Whenever you feel lonely and need a little loving from home just press your hand to your cheek and think ‘Mommy loves you!'”

Dennis went on to share a slide show of photos of herself and her two children smiling and enjoying their time together as a family.

Fans react to the adorable photos of Kathryn Dennis and her kids

After Dennis shared the beautiful photos of herself and her kids fans couldn’t resist to share their thoughts on the happy family.

“Adorable and love the outfits. Good to pass on that great Fashion sense to the littles” a fan replied.

“I’m so impressed that you both can coparent. I wish I had that situation. It’s never easy no matter what. But I look up to u. Great job momma!” a follower added.

“I promise you that your kids will be with you on ALL the holidays one day Soon!!! Promise” an Instagram user mentioned.

“They’re so big now!! I hope yall had a great day together. Happy Valentine’s Day!” another fan said.

“That’s being a great mom putting the kids first. Loving Kathryn’s red hair back again she looks so beautiful. Somehow she looks happier more relaxed with the red” another follower commented.

“Exactly! Celebrate on your time. Who cares if it’s a little early or a little late as long as you’re together” another Instagram user mentioned.

Landon Clements made shocking claims

“[Kathryn] hasn’t really created any sort of life for herself outside of the show and when your whole life is wrapped up in that then you have to always bring the drama and bring all of this even if it means like destroying other people” Clements also said.

Screenshot by ZDNet

Southwest Airlines has always been out on its own.

Or at least that's the impression it's wanted to project.

The others charge for bags? Southwest doesn't. The others have assigned seating? Ah that takes too long to sort out. So Southwest lets passengers on thirty at a time and allows them to pick the best available seat for them.

Oddly this means planes should turn around more quickly too a highly profitable maneuver.

Still it's a fine successful and rather loved airline.

Oh there's one more very Southwest thing. With the likes of American United and Delta you'll find their offerings on comparison sites like Expedia Orbitz and Kayak.

Southwest insists you go to Southwest.com and buy your tickets there.

When I asked about this last year the airline's reasoning went like so: ""By utilizing Southwest.com and our call centers customers can rest at ease knowing that when they go to book with Southwest they're getting the lowest fare without any strings that online travel agencies might try to sneak in there such as fees and restrictions. This is especially important as a low-cost low-fare high-quality airline.""

Southwest in fact is really really suspicious of any third parties at all.

Also: Delta says it wants the very best customers (then it treats them like this)

It says: ""Allowing a third-party access to our consumer fares and flights adds a new dimension that would erode our promise to our customers of offering friendly reliable and low-cost air travel. We prefer to build a relationship with the customer on their journey from booking to destination and OTAs [online travel agencies] would change the experience our customers expect from us.""

Third parties aren't friendly you see. Apparently.

I want to get away. Bigly.



Last week I was looking to get away. A long way away to a place over the ocean where Southwest doesn't fly. This happens to me at regular intervals.

My lazy instinct is to go to Kayak and compare fares. However immediately on loading the page I was assaulted by a big black box in the top right-hand corner. And it was big. The box told me it was big.

It read in large letters: ""This is big. Southwest is here.""

""What?"" I thought. ""Has Southwest abandoned one of its core principles and leapt into the comparative pool of the populist and unwashed?""

The big black box had a smaller line: ""Kayak for Business travelers can now book Southwest Airlines. Sign up. It's free.""

This is big indeed. Screenshot by ZDNet

Goodness me. But I thought Kayak was precisely one of those unfriendly comparison third parties that Southwest steadfastly avoids. What was happening here?

Or rather what's not happening?

Business travel isn't coming back in remotely the way airlines thought it would. Outgoing Southwest CEO Gary Kelly admitted during the company's last earnings call that he previously thought 2022 would look very different from the truths it offers now.

Also: An extraordinary incredible example of customer service (yes from an airline)

""We have to be more heavily dependent on consumer travel than we were before"" he said.

But here's the problem: airlines are desperate for business travelers because that's where the greater profits lie. Yet they're all offering dismal projections for its return.

A new business model?



Few can surely deny that the rapid development of Zoom and Microsoft Teams has contributed to companies feeling less need to send their executives into COVID-infested air. CFOs have been delighted with the results.

So here is Southwest appearing to abandon -- no compromise -- its distinct principles in order to grab as much corporate business as it can.

Kayak for Business you see is a free booking platform with one condition: you have to have a corporate business email address. Any other kind and you get shoved onto a waiting list.

It's an attempt to get small and medium-sized businesses to sign up to a corporate service -- now teased with the large glory of being able to compare Southwest's offerings directly.

Southwest does already expose its fares to global distribution systems so that travel agents can take a peek. It also has deals with travel management companies and certain corporate booking tools.

But this is Kayak. This is large exposure. This is large exposure of a possibly uncomfortable kind. One has to believe that when Kayak trumpets this is big; it means it's big. Huge even.

Naturally I asked Southwest whether this apparently new relationship indicated a change of mood at the airline. I'll update should I hear. Oddly I couldn't find a Southwest press release announcing the Kayak foray.

Comparisons are comparatively rare.



I also looked at the Kayak menu in an especially optimistic mood to see whether everyone could now see Southwest's fares compared on a single screen with those of rivals.

Sadly not. Although there is a ""get info"" link on the left-hand Kayak menu of airlines. Yes it goes straight to the Southwest.com site.

The pandemic has changed many things for airlines. Thanks to taxpayer money they stayed alive something Southwest acknowledges.

Still if you're a regular flyer without a Kayak for Business account it must be jarring to see that big black box telling you Southwest gives special favors to businesspeople. It's the people's airline after all.

The message appears evident: If you've got a business we'll let you compare our fares. If you don't we won't.

Money always spoils things doesn't it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vNmFiYy5jb20vc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWFsY29ob2wtcG9saWN5LWZsaWdodHMvMTE1NDAxODMv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly82YWJjLmNvbS9hbXAvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWFsY29ob2wtcG9saWN5LWZsaWdodHMvMTE1NDAxODMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines alcohol policy returns on flights after sales suspended due to unruly passengers,"American Airlines is the only one of the four largest US carriers that has not resumed alcohol sales

Southwest Airlines is bringing back alcoholic beverages on flights this month after suspending their sale in March 2020.

Beer wine and hard liquor will be offered again starting on February 16 the airline said in a news release.

American Airlines is the only one of the four largest US carriers that has not resumed alcohol sales.

On Southwest non-alcoholic beverage service will also be expanded on February 16 to include options such as tonic water Coke Zero and hot chocolate.

The beverage service is available on flights of 176 miles or more.

""Customers have expressed a desire for more beverage options so we're delighted to restore additional on-board offerings as a part of the Southwest hospitality that our customers know and love"" said Tony Roach vice president of Southwest customer experience and customer relations in the news release.

The union representing Southwest Airlines flight attendants says resuming alcohol service is ""unsafe and irresponsible.""

RELATED: 'My job is not to manage you': Flight attendants nearing breaking point with unruly passengers

Lyn Montgomery of TWU Local 556 says that the union fought Southwest on the move saying that it makes it hard to enforce the federal mask mandate on board flights as puts flight attendants risk.

""We have adamantly and unequivocally informed management that resuming sales of alcohol while the mask mandate is in place has the great potential to increase customer non-compliance and misconduct issues"" Montgomery said in a statement.

Other airlines have resumed serving alcohol

United Airlines resumed sales of hard liquor in November.

Delta Air Lines resumed serving beer and wine to First Class and Delta Comfort+ customers on domestic flights in July 2020 and then added alcohol sales back to the Main Cabin offerings on some domestic flights in April 2021.

American Airlines the last big holdout on alcohol service told CNN Friday that it hasn't set a date for the return of alcohol in its main cabins.

""We will continue to evaluate the situation and work closely with the union that represents our flight attendants the Association of Professional Flight Attendants and medical experts on this process to determine when we will return to full service in the main cabin"" the airline said in a statement.

Incidents involving alcohol have been among the more serious cases of unruly passenger behavior during the pandemic.

In November the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a total of $161823 in fines against passengers involved in alcohol-related incidents.

Last year was the worst on record for unruly passenger behavior. Early in 2021 the FAA announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy for unruly passenger behavior that skips warnings or counseling and goes directly to penalties which can include heavy fines and jail time.

If you really want to hedge your bet so your travel plans won’t be delayed or disrupted that means you need to book tickets on an airline with a high on-time percentage.

The good news is that annual research from the Official Airline Guide (OAG) which provides data and insight about travel can help make your travel planning easier. What’s even better is that OAG just released its annual Punctuality League report noting which airlines and airports have the best record for being well punctual.

“In 2020 airlines and airports faced major upheaval from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” John Grant senior analyst at OAG says in the report. “As a result their operations either ceased or were severely challenged as airlines cut their networks reduced fleet sizes furloughed staff and navigated through coping with the emergence of COVID-19 variants.”

While conducting its research OAG collects data “from every journey every booking every takeoff and landing departure and delay” it explains. The result is a tabulation of overall on-time performance rather than simply looking at arrivals or departures.

Interestingly despite the challenges of operating while the pandemic continues some airlines were able to maintain high on-time performance levels. In fact six U.S. airlines were able to achieve on-time performance levels of 80 percent or higher.

Let’s get right to it. Here are those six U.S. airlines which had 80 percent or higher on-time performance levels in 2021.

1. Hawaiian Airlines

The U.S. airline with the highest on-time performance level in 2021 was Hawaiian Airlines. In fact the airline logged an 89.9 percent on-time performance level according to OAG’s research.

That news isn’t too surprising given the airline’s history. As Hawaiian Airlines notes “We’ve remained the nation’s most punctual carrier according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s data since 2004.”

Hawaiian Airlines which began operations in 1929 offers 180 flights each day to the Hawaiian Islands 16 U.S. mainland cities and 10 destinations throughout Asia and the Pacific.

2. Delta Airlines

Delta which is headquartered in Atlanta is the second-largest airline in the U.S. because it offered 185.8 million seats for sale in 2021 according to data from Simple Flying.

OAG’s research found that Delta is also the second most-punctual U.S. airline. In 2021 the airline had an 88.4 percent on-time performance level OAG reports.

3. American Airlines

American Airlines which was founded in 1930 is the largest U.S. airline. That’s because in 2021 it offered 216.6 million seats for sale Simple Flying reports. The airline with its regional partner American Eagle offers 6700 flights each day to 350 destinations in 50 countries.

Despite that scope of operations American was still the third most-punctual U.S. airline in 2021. OAG notes that in 2021 American had an 85.1 percent on-time performance level.

4. United Airlines

United Airlines was the fourth most-punctual U.S. airline last year. As OAG points out the airline posted an 83.5 percent on-time performance level in 2021.

Coincidentally United was also the fourth-largest airline in the U.S. in 2021 — offering 140.6 million seats for sale Simple Flying notes.

United which is based in Chicago operates 3118 flights each day to 252 U.S. cities as well as 80 international locations. Much of that traffic departs its hubs in Chicago Denver Houston Los Angeles Newark San Francisco and Washington D.C.

5. Alaska Airlines

Working with its regional partners Alaska Airlines serves more than 120 destinations across the U.S. as well as Canada Mexico and Costa Rica. The airline which is based in Seattle announced last year that it will soon begin offering daily nonstop flights from Seattle-Tacoma to Miami which means Alaska Airlines will serve 100 destinations with nonstop flights.

In 2021 Alaska Airlines recorded an 82.6 percent on-time performance level OAG reports.

6. Southwest Airlines

Southwest which offered 168.9 million seats for sale in 2021 is the third-largest U.S. airline Simple Flying points out. The airline which is based in Dallas operated more than 4000 weekday departures among 121 airports and across 11 countries in 2021.

Southwest is also the final U.S. airline with an on-time performance level greater than 80 percent in 2021. Indeed last year its on-time performance level was 81.2 percent OAG’s research determined.

The company had paused its full menu of on-board beverages since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.

“Customers have expressed a desire for more beverage options so we’re delighted to restore additional on-board offerings as a part of the Southwest Hospitality that our Customers know and love” said Tony Roach Vice President Customer Experience and Customer Relations.

On flights of more than 176 miles or more — meaning that will include most of its Caribbean flights — Southwest will be offering its full menu of soft drinks and it will be restoring alcoholic beverages.

That means everything from sparkling wine and Cabernet Sauvignon to Jack Daniels and Bacardi among others.

The changes will take effect Feb. 16 2022 according to a statement from Southwest Airlines."

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion

The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024 growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing drives operational excellence consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network and reduces complexity of the product portfolio.

These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses.

The Global Cost Reduction Program generated incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in first quarter 2024 of $145 million. Since inception of the program in mid-2022 the Company has generated approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by $1.9 billion.

2024 Outlook

Patrick D. Hallinan Executive Vice President and CFO commented ""The actions we are taking to advance our strategic transformation are progressing successfully and despite the tepid market backdrop so far in 2024 our profitability remains on an upward trajectory. We will continue our disciplined approach to cost management as we drive toward our target of 35%+ adjusted gross margins* while funding additional organic revenue growth* investments. The organization is focused on delivering margin expansion cash generation and balance sheet strength while working together to position the Company for long-term growth and value creation.""

Management is reiterating 2024 guidance and expects EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $2.85 on a GAAP basis adjusted EPS* between $3.50 to $4.50 and free cash flow* to approximate $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion.

The difference between 2024 GAAP and adjusted EPS* guidance is approximately $1.65 to $1.90 consisting primarily of charges related to the supply chain transformation under the Global Cost Reduction Program.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Starbucks executives explained an aggressive growth strategy in an earnings call.

The coffee chain opened nearly 1200 net new locations in 2021.

The chain is adding new stores faster than Subway and McDonald's.

Starbucks keeps growing its store count and it's outpacing the only chains larger than the coffee giant: McDonald's and Subway.

As of January 2 2022 Starbucks had 34317 open stores across the world just under 17000 in the US. The number looks poised to keep increasing after years of steady growth from Starbucks. It added 484 net new stores the first quarter of 2022 and 538 the previous quarter. It added 1173 net new stores in the fiscal 2021 year and 1404 in the 2020 fiscal year according to end-of-year data provided by Starbucks.

There's no real end in sight for Starbucks' potential growth. The chain plans to open 2000 net new stores in fiscal 2022 Starbucks said at the end of 2021. In a February earnings call President and CEO Kevin Johnson addressed the question of opening new stores.

""As long as we keep delivering best-in-class profitability return on investment we're going to continue to lean in on building new stores and play the long game"" he told investors in the first-quarter earnings call. Outside of the US the growth is even starker. Starbucks added 1200 new stores in China over the past two years making up a fifth of the total in the country CEO of Starbucks China Leo Tsoi said in the call.

""We are really in the early stages of these markets. And as we go wide go deep and go smarter actually our opening is actually helping us to build our success for the long term"" Tsoi said about plans to continue adding to the chain's numbers.

McDonald's which has over 38000 worldwide locations added nearly 1000 new locations in 2020 CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in his year-end letter to share holders and 650 restaurants in 2021 executives said in the 2021 Q4 earnings call. In the same call the chain announced plans to open 1800 new restaurants in 2022.

Sandwich chain Subway has long held the title of fast-food chain with the most locations. It has nearly 40000 locations across the world but that number is slowly shrinking. Subway closed over 1000 locations in 2019 and reportedly closed over 2000 in 2021. The chain has disputed the exact number of closures without providing specifics.

Declining sales and closing stores put Starbucks in striking distance of surpassing the giant chain.

Staff Writer

From Jan. 31 to Feb. 2 students held protests and demonstrations outside of Strozier and Dirac Library protesting the on-campus Starbucks for their treatment of student staff and low wages. These protests were geared towards giving a voice to students who feel oppressed by their employers.

Approximately over 100 students were in attendance at the protest with others joining as students marched.

Students shared stories from their time employed at the dining facilities during the protest and chanted in unity. Some of the chants included ""show me what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like” “boycott Starbucks” “15 an hour” and “this ain't right."" Students marched during the protest between Strozier and Dirac library.

Students protested student dining services and other restaurant locations on campus for several reasons. However according to speeches and testimonies from students speaking at the rally their primary focus is around Aramark. This corporation owns many student restaurants on campus including a share in the Starbucks on the FSU campus.

Aramark is a food facilities and uniform provider for restaurants and other dining facilities. According to Aramark's corporate website Aramark is contracted by higher education institutions to provide meals to students and faculty.

Aramark also hires students to work in these dining facilities and restaurants. However many students feel that the company does not pay their student employees enough and that staff are also mistreated every day.

Hope Evans a history major at FSU spoke at the protest on the steps of Strozier about the experiences of these student employees. Several students contacted Evans asking her to speak at the rally on their behalf she said.

One student Evans spoke for said they were a Steak 'n Shake student employee who was not granted their pay raise after being promoted and given more responsibility. After her speech Evans shared why she herself was at the event and the overall goals of the protest.

""We are hoping to get the word out that Aramark is treating their student employees poorly"" said Evans. ""We want to let the student employees know that we stand with them for students to think about their consumption or join the boycott and for the company to know that we the students are watching them.”

Opinion: Aramark Corporation and its profits over people policy

After speeches from students and more chanting students regrouped and unified to march from the Starbucks at Strozier to the other Starbucks on campus located at Dirac. Once at Dirac students shared their personal feelings and thoughts about Aramark's treatment of their employees and how student workers need assistance and pay raises more than most groups on campus.

During the protest students going into the Dirac Starbucks in front of the protestors were cursed out by some of the protestors in the crowd. However many students at the protest agreed with the action stating that more need to join the boycott for it to be effective.

After the protest the organizer and main speaker Marco Lafasso a freshman at FSU majoring in political science shared his insight on why he organized the rally and boycott. Lafasso also stated his goals and intentions for the future and desired actions against student dining facilities and Aramark.

""I was inspired by reading the stories of student workers on Instagram…. Aramark is stringent on employees for what you can and cannot do and you risk termination if you speak out"" Lafasso said. ""That is why we as students wanted to hold this protest: to show the student employees that they have the backs and support of the student body for fair pay and equal treatment.""

The issues of a higher pay and better treatment of workers at Starbucks and other Aramark industries on campus are still being protested. Many students are still fighting to have Aramark FSU student employees paid $15 per hour and receive better treatment from management.

Evans gave her perspective on the change the protest will offer as well as the importance of student involvement.

“Change starts small” Evans stated. “The financial losses from our boycott may not be a lot for a billion dollar company but we hope to inspire change. Change has to start somewhere and we are hoping to give the student employees of these businesses the courage to speak up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXBvcGthdm9pY2UuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYXBvcGthLWNpdHktY2VudGVyLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWJyZXctdGhlb3J5LDEzMjM50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apopka City Center breaks ground on Starbucks Brew Theory,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://theapopkavoice.com/stories/apopka-city-center-breaks-ground-on-starbucks-brew-theory,13239 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXBvcGthdm9pY2UuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYXBvcGthLWNpdHktY2VudGVyLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWJyZXctdGhlb3J5LDEzMjM50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdWxyOC5jb20vc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWxvb2tzLXRvLW1vdmUtdG8tbGl2aW5nc3Rvbi1sb2NhbHMtbm90LWhhcHB5LWFib3V0LWl0L2FydGljbGVfNGM2ODVkNTgtODZjYi0xMWVjLThiZmMtMGJmYjJiOTg4MTNkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks looks to move to Livingston locals not happy about it,"Weather Alert

Carson St.

The new store will sit in the former home of Filipino breakfast and brunch spot DJ Bibingkahan. The 3600 square-foot restaurant has been demolished to make room for the new 2000 square-foot Starbucks with a drive-thru. This will be the fifth Starbucks in Carson alone joining countless other locations in Los Angeles County. There is no opening date for the new location but it’s expected to open in Spring or Summer 2022.

The new Starbucks on the corner of Carson and Bonita will become the primary coffee spot in the Carson Bonita Plaza which is undergoing several tenant changes. Other eateries within the plaza include JBJ’s Bakery Fiesta BBQ & Bibinka and Subway. There have been at least five available plots in the area all in the corner of the strip mall.

Although this is great news for coffee-lovers many customers are upset to learn the company has additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year. Starbucks was forced to increase prices in October and last month but that didn’t stop customers. CEO Kevin Johnson actually said during an analyst call the company “saw incredibly strong demand through the holiday season.” Johnson says these price increases “play an important role to mitigate cost pressures including inflation.”"

He’ll get plenty of that after the Stillwater Golf Course opens in late spring.

The first new golf course to be built on the First Coast since 2002 is targeted for a May opening at the Stillwater community north of State Road 210 in St. Johns about 3 miles west of I-95. Stillwater is nearly equidistant between the two largest cities on the First Coast 30 miles from downtown Jacksonville and 23 from downtown St. Augustine.

The Lennar development which has already sold out of the first of four residential phases is an “Active Adult Community” for those 55 and over and eventually will have 550 home sites.

Home prices range from $350000-to-$600000.

Public play on the course will be allowed until enough homeowners move in at which point Stillwater will become private. Hampton Golf the management company for the Palencia Club the last new design to be built on the First Coast will manage Stillwater.

Weed who designed area courses such as the TPC Sawgrass Dye's Valley the Slammer & Squire and Amelia Links plus renovations on Timuquana and the Ponte Vedra Inn and Club led a media tour of the first seven holes of the course on Saturday.

Making minimal use of space and resources and combining old-school and modern design principles Stillwater winds through an area of native wetlands and cypress pine and oak trees but has only 70 acres of irrigated turf is using reclaimed effluent water as its main source of irrigation and has drastically cut down on the maintenance and cost for its bunkers by using repurposed artificial sod from British soccer fields for the front walls.

“It’s a sensitive piece of property and we respected that” Weed said of the 148 acres that contain the par-72 course which will measure nearly 6800 yards from the back tees. “It’s very linear with a lot of wetlands and the overall site was a challenge. But we think it looks like it just settled into the property. It looks like it belongs here.”

The clientele dictated many of the design principles. Built for a retirement community Stillwater isn’t overly long doesn’t have many forced carries over water or other hazards and has drought-tolerant “Tiftuf” Bermuda grass fairways that melt into Tifeagle Bermuda greens enabling players to utilize run-up shots and use their putter often from off the green.

The fairways are generous depending on how risky or conservative a golfer wants to play. There are few sharp doglegs but there are subtle movements and the greens are moderately sized (between 5000-to-6000 square feet) that Weed described as “more strategic than penal.”

However numerous moguls mounds waste areas and small “pot” bunkers offer most of the challenges and more important to Weed increase the options of how to play a hole.

“I’ve never been a fan of a golf course that you can play one or two times and think you’ve got it figured out” he said. “Here we have options. Options create interest.”

And while the course is short with driveable par-4 holes at Nos. 3 (333 yards from the back) and 12 (395) and reachable par-5s (the longest is the 572-yard 11th) Weed said there is no hole that takes the driver out of play for skilled golfers.

There are holes where the fairways narrow and the hazards come more into play for the big hitters.

“You can hit driver on every hole if you want” he said. “You just have to take the risk.”

While the design and natural look of Stillwater may be old-school there are some design innovations that are new to the First Coast:

• The “Eco-bunkers” are built by putting layers and layers of artificial sod for the front face. While they look steeper Weed said they’re angled at about 55 or 60 degrees. The advantage is that the bunkers don’t need nearly as much maintenance as traditional bunkers which is good for a course’s bottom line and good for the environment.

• The bunkers are filled with “G-Angle” sand. The particles are angled which cuts down on drifting under windy conditions and also tends to result in fewer plugged or “fried egg” lies.

• Weed a Pete Dye disciple has departed from his mentor in one way. Rather than use old railroad ties that are installed vertically as bulkheads for water hazards Wood simply uses planks of treated lumber that angle from the playing area to the water called “laydown walls.”

• Further cutting maintenance costs are crushed-shell cart paths. More visual contrast from the fairways and greens will be native areas planted with Centipede grass which has a red tinge. The banks of water hazards will be planted with Bahia grass.

• The course has been designed in “loops” to give players options other than the traditional 18- or 9-hole round. The “Red” course is Nos. 1-3 the “Blue” course is Nos. 1-6 the “Yellow” course is Nos. 7-15 and the “Orange” course is Nos. 7-18.

“The one thing golfers talk about is disposable time” Weed said. “They can now come home and play three or six holes before dinner or go out after dinner in the summer and play three or six holes.

The 16-acre practice facility includes a huge “Himalayas” putting green and Toptracer technology in the hitting areas where players can get immediate readouts on their distance and swing data especially important when they receive instruction from the professional staff under general manager Michael Monahan a former Palencia assistant.

The range will be lighted. The clubhouse will offer beverages and a full menu.

Golf initiation and membership fees will be included in the purchase price of homes and the Stillwater HOA fees will include green fees. The public price point will be in the $120 range which can be lower or higher depending on the day of the week and season.

Other activities at Stillwater once the clubhouse and fitness center are completed include tennis pickleball bocce and a 24-hour fitness center. Hampton Golf will also manage those facilities.

The album came out on May 19th and was Elton's first of seven consecutive number one albums on the US charts.

Just four days earlier on the 15th Sir Elton John was in St. Cloud Minnesota.

St. Cloud State University archives state that Elton was performing as part of a May Daze event on campus:

As part of campus May Daze activities Elton John headlined a concert May 15 1972 at Halenbeck Hall. Tickets cost $1.50 for students and $3 for the general public.

Just $3 to see Elton John in concert days before the album with ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" was in the hands of the world. The archives go on to say he opened the concert with ""Tiny Dancer"". St. Cloud could have been one of the first times Elton played ""Rocket Man"" live. How crazy is that?!

Elton wasn't the only famous person to grace SCSU with their presence during the decade. It was a busy decade for the school. Take a look at some of the most famous people to visit St. Cloud State in the 1970's:

Jason Elmore | 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division became the first ground combat force in the U.S. Army to fire a FGM-148 Javelin using the Common Remote Weapon Station-Javelin system from a Stryker making it the most lethal formation in the U.S. Army April 28 at Fort Carson Colo. The CROWS-J is a stabilized mount that contains a sensor suite and fire control software allowing on-the-move target reference points programmable target reference points programmable sector surveillance scanning automatic target racking and programmable no-fire zones.

FORT CARSON Colo. - Leaders of 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division gathered at the installation’s ranges on April 28 to witness the culmination and validation of the brigade’s year-long journey to become the U.S. Army’s most modern and lethal ground fighting force with the addition of the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin.



The CROWS-J allows Soldiers to fire the FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile from within the vehicle allowing for on-the-move target acquisition and engagement.



“(The Javelins) are a very capable missile” said Capt. Jacob Poag operations officer with Headquarters and Headquarters Company 2nd SBCT 4th Inf. Div. “We are taking the opportunity to fire 12 Javelins today which will get six crews across the brigade to fire.”



Firing the FGM-148 using the CROWS-J had not been done previously by any Brigade Combat Team in the U.S. Army outside of testing providing Soldiers an opportunity to do so outside of simulated virtual training.



“There are portions of training you can’t get in a simulation that you can only get by firing a live missile” Poag said. “It’s incredibly important for the brigade to make us a lot more lethal by firing today.”



Before installing the CROWS-J onto Strykers the FGM-148 Javelin was designed to be shoulder-fired by a dismounted Soldier.



“We have the ability to fire about 100 dismounted Javelins during any kind of training mission or (if we are) to be deployed” Poag said. “The addition of the CROWS-J gives us double that making us very lethal in the anti-tank realm.”



“We are now the most lethal force there is” said Spc. Jerett Vermeis with 3rd Squadron 61st Cavalry Regiment 2nd SBCT 4th Inf. Div. “We are ready for whatever the nation needs us for.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20uYXUvUGVyc29uL0dyYWhhbS1NY0xlYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Graham McLean,"Access to our data for Graham McLean is only available to paid subscribers with Data & Insights access.

Last week we took a look at the PhoenixNAP Bare Metal Cloud offering. Essentially PhoenixNAP has dedicated bare metal servers (the ones we tried were all Supermicro and Intel Xeon based) that it has set up for a cloud experience. More specifically one can take advantage of hourly billing for on-demand servers or step up to monthly or 1-3 year commitments for lower reserved pricing. In doing that piece we realized that we actually set up a 5-node Proxmox VE cluster in about 20 minutes. With that let us get to the setup.

Building a 5-node Proxmox VE Cluster in 20 Minutes for $1

A quick note here we double-checked and our screen capture was 22:07 with a pause for taking a phone call in the middle. As part of that 22-minute screen capture we had even downloaded templates set up VMs LXC containers migrated workloads on the cluster and started setting up high-availability groups. We are using five PhoenixNAP BMC instances with a total cost of $1 per hour using hourly on-demand pricing. That means one can build the cluster and still have 40+ minutes to test out a feature or multiple features for only $1.

Here is the video we posted this week on the cluster effort:

As always we suggest watching this one on YouTube in a browser tab or app for the best experience.

Here are the basic steps:

Prerequisites Sign up for a PhoenixNAP BMC account Setup API keys (optional but this will make the process easier to repeat) Setup SSH keys for the instances (optional as it can be done for each instance but it is easier to just have this in place for all of them)

Launching instances Launch the following quantity and number of instances: 1x s0.d1.small @ $0.10/hr 2x s0.d1.medium @ $0.12/hr 2x s2.c2.large @ $0.33/hr For each select the same location Select Proxmox VE as the operating system On the next page set the hostname Set a description (optional) Select a /29 IP address allocation Set IP access either to whitelist IP ranges or public so anyone can access the machine (public is faster when it comes to the IP address ranges open for clustering) Select SSH keys Launch instance Copy randomly generated strong password for use later to access the Proxmox VE web UI Copy IP address for use later to access the Proxmox VE web UI Wait for instances to launch While waiting ensure you have URLs for ISOs you may want to download and use for VMs or other resources you will want to immediately start adding to the clusters



Creating Proxmox VE cluster Use the URL and root password combinations to log into each node On the first s0.d1.small node start loading templates Launch the console and type “pveam update” to update the container template repository with Turnkey templates Go to the local storage for the node click on the ISO Images and download ISOs needed for VM installation (Ubuntu used in the demo) On the first s0.d1.small node click Datacenter -> Cluster -> Create Cluster and assign IP addresses for links Use join information from the first node to copy/ paste into other nodes under Datacenter -> Cluster -> Join cluster Reload web management on all nodes as necessary



All of that should take 1-15 minutes to do. From there one can start to use the cluster for a lab. While one will get ~45 minutes of work time for a dollar in that first hour one can also extend longer for $1/ hour. There are also options to bring this into production with more locations larger (and smaller) server types and longer-term pricing.

Final Words

Sometimes you just want to test a feature. For example what happens if a node fails in a high-availability Proxmox VE cluster. Having this option to set up a cluster with automated OS installs and be up and running within minutes is awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From your kids to your grandparents everyone needs a way to stay connected on the go. Buying a prepaid phone plan can be a great way to save money and still get access to great coverage. Most companies let you pay ahead which means you don’t have to worry about your monthly bill changing each cycle. But with so many phone plans out there how do you choose the right one? That’s where we come in. In this article we’ll go over some of the things you want to look for in a prepaid phone plan as well as discuss some of the best prepaid phone plans out there.

Before we dive into the good stuff let’s talk about what you want to look for in a prepaid phone plan. First you’re going to want to look into the coverage that they offer. A lot of prepaid phone options utilize the coverage of postpaid phone companies like AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile. While these providers offer some great phone plans to keep in mind not all coverage areas are created equal. You’ll also want to look for a plan that fits what you need. If you use a lot of data each month or don’t have ready access to wi-fi try going for something with a higher or unlimited data cap. It’s also important to keep your phone’s connection type in mind. Does your phone support 5G or is it only a 4G device? Additionally it’s always important to find something that fits your price range.

Now that we’ve discussed some of the important things to look out for though it’s time to really dig in. Here’s a quick look at some of the best prepaid phone plans available in 2022.

Best prepaid phone plan overall: Mint 10GB

Image source: Mint Mobile

Pros: Affordable and easy to set up 5G and other perks

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

Cons: Best prices come from buying months in bulk price increase after first three months

It’s impossible not to include Mint on our list and for good reason. Even without all the great celebrity-filled ads Mint Mobile offers some fantastic options for prepaid users looking to group a great plan with their smartphone. While not the cheapest plan out there or the one with the highest data cap the Mint 10GB plan comes in at a moderate $20 a month for new users.

That price does go up after the first initial three months but Mint gives you access to 5G and 4G LTE data as well as unlimited talk and text. If you’re rocking an iPhone 13 or one of the best Android phones 5G access lets you take advantage of faster speeds. That $20 a month goes up to $35 a month after the first three months but you can subscribe for longer periods of time (up to 12 months) to receive a lower monthly price.

Mint also throws in free mobile hotspot access as well as wi-fi calling and texting so you can more easily send and make calls on your phone when it’s connected to your home internet. While this plan touts a 10GB data cap it’s important to note that you’ll still have access to data after you hit your cap. However it will slow down exponentially so this isn’t the greatest plan if you use a lot of data each month.

Best prepaid phone plan with unlimited data: Visible

Pros: No 5G cap unlimited hotspot usage and tons of ways to bring your bill cost down

Cons: Not the cheapest unlimited data plan out there

Visible is less of its own provider and more of a service offered by one of the most well-known carriers Verizon. Because it’s owned by Verizon it makes use of the telecom giant’s network giving it an exceptional amount of coverage across the United States. Visible only offers one plan — unlimited — and you can get it for a starting price of $40 a month. That might seem a little expensive for a prepaid phone plan but it gives you all the hotspot that you can use as well as no cap on 5G data.

On top of offering great coverage and perks Visible also comes with a lot of ways to get your monthly bill down. You can team up with other friends on the service using “Party Pay”. This works essentially like a family plan but you can team up with at least four other people to bring your monthly payment down to $25 a month. There are also special plans for wearables like the Apple Watch and you can bring your own phone too.

Visible isn’t the cheapest plan out there if you’re going in solo. But if you can get a couple of friends together you’ll get great coverage for a great price.

Best prepaid phone plan for low-data users: Mint 4GB

Pros: Lots of extra perks 5G access for super cheap

Cons: Best prices come from buying months in bulk

You really shouldn’t be surprised to see Mint back on here. After all the company offers some great plans for users looking for prepaid service. Much like the 10GB offering the Mint 4GB plan come with all the usual perks like 5G and mobile hotspot usage. You’ll also get free international calls to Mexico and Canada too.

Of course like the 10GB plan Mint’s cheaper option requires you to pay months in advance for the best prices. When you first start out though you can get three months of service for just $15 a month. This price goes up to $25 a month after the first 90 days but you can bring it back down by subscribing for 12 months at a time. If you don’t plan on using a lot of 5G data each month this can be a great option. While not the cheapest low-data plan out there Mint continues to deliver fantastic coverage especially as 5G continues to roll out to more areas. If you’re looking for a solid prepaid phone plan and don’t mind dropping the $180 upfront to pay for 12 months this can be a great low-data plan to pick up on any smartphone that supports the network.

Best budget prepaid phone plan: US Mobile 5GB

Pros: Uses T-Mobile and Verizon coverage easy to customize and mix plan options

Cons: Low data cap

Where Mint is probably a name that many expect to see on a list like this US Mobile might not be. Don’t let not knowing about this company fool you though. It has some amazing options for users that want a budget-friendly prepaid phone plan. In fact its 5GB data plan is perfect for people who want to spend less on their cellphone bill without losing access to unlimited talk text and solid data speeds.

US Mobile uses a combination of T-Mobile and Verizon towers to provide coverage. This means you should be able to get coverage in a lot more areas than some other services out there. The initial plan is also only $15 a line. That makes it one of the cheapest out there for what it offers. Of course being a prepaid phone plan designed for budget users you’re not going to get a lot of perks to show off here. If you’ve got more than one line you can expect to see some savings when you bundle them all together.

US Mobile also makes it very easy to combine different elements of some of its plans together to create a plan that feels right for you. There are also other options out there like the 12GB plan for $20 or even the 18GB plan for $25. They aren’t as cheap as the 5GB plan. If you don’t mind paying a little extra for a few more data access you’ll find it useful.

Best family prepaid phone plan: Boost Unlimited

Pros: Lots of flexibility for adding new lines can mix and match different plans into one custom plan

Cons: Best prices only available after six months of service

When it comes to family-oriented prepaid phone plans Boost offers some of the best options. A family of three can join up and grab a Boost plan for just $30 per line. This gives them access to unlimited data talk and text. There’s also a lot of flexibility for how you mix and match the different options. This comes in handy when adding a new line.

Boost currently works off T-Mobile’s coverage but the company is in the process of moving over to AT&T towers. That means you should have solid coverage across the states including 5G and 4G LTE. The company currently offers two “unlimited” plans one for $50 and one for $60. The only difference here is how much data you’ll get on your hotspot as the cheaper plan only offers 12GB of hotspot data. The more expensive offer comes with 30GB of mobile hotspot data. Another nice features bout Boost is that the price will drop after six months of service.

Where it succeeds in family offerings Boost isn’t that great for solo users so we definitely recommend steering clear if you don’t have multiple lines to bring to the service.

As reported by Droid Life (via Android Police) Verizon appears to have gotten rid of its 24- and 30-month contracts for all devices — including phones hot spots and smartwatches — and has instead extended it to 36 months.

Unless you can pay off the entire device you’re locked into the three-year plan

Verizon’s payment program FAQ page explains that there isn’t any interest attached to the 36-month plan and you can choose to pay off the phone in full whenever you want. What you can’t do however is pay more than your set monthly installment — so unless you can pay off the entire device you’re locked into the three-year plan. If you’ve agreed to a 24- or 30-month plan before February 3rd 2022 Verizon says you won’t be affected by this change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xkZW4ta25pZ2h0cy9waG90b3MtMjAyMi1uaGwtYWxsLXN0YXItZ2FtZS1hdC10LW1vYmlsZS1hcmVuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PICS: 2022 NHL All-Star Game at T-Mobile Arena,"Share Facebook

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow anyone to own a stake in income-producing real estate. This means they can be great for generating passive income. Currently the average dividend yield across the REIT sector is 2.6% more than double the 1.2% yield of stocks in the S&P 500.

Three REITs that stand out for their income-generating capabilities are Crown Castle International (CCI -1.51%) Digital Realty Trust (DLR -2.20%) and SL Green Realty (SLG 2.16%). With shares of all three selling off along with the broader stock market last month they look like great buys this February.

1. Crown Castle: Connected to a powerful growth trend

Shares of Crown Castle stumbled out of the gate in 2021 declining by more than 12% in January. That sell-off helped push its dividend yield up to 3.3% in early February.

That slump comes even though the infrastructure REIT reported strong quarterly results last month. Crown Castle grew its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by 14% for the full year helping support an 11% increase in its dividend. The communications infrastructure company also slightly increased its 2022 outlook after signing a new long-term deal with T-Mobile to support its 5G rollout.

Crown Castle sees lots of 5G-driven growth ahead as mobile carriers utilize more infrastructure to support the faster network. That leads the REIT to believe it can grow its dividend at a 7% to 8% annual pace over the next few years. With shares now cheaper Crown Castle offers the potential of generating even higher total returns in the coming years for investors who buy shares in February.

2. Digital Realty: A lower price despite enhancing its growth prospects

Digital Realty's stock also took a hit last month. The data center REIT tumbled more than 15% pushing its dividend yield up to 3.1%.

The REIT's sell-off came even though it recently made another growth-enhancing acquisition. Last month it agreed to acquire a stake in Teraco Africa's largest data center operator with seven state-of-the-art facilities located in South Africa. The $3.5 billion deal established Digital Realty as a leading data center operator in Africa. Digital Realty sees significant growth ahead on that continent which is in the early stages of its digital transformation.

That deal should provide further support for Digital Realty's growing dividend. The REIT has increased its payout for 16 consecutive years and appears poised to continue growing it in the future.

3. SL Green: A towering dividend

Share of SL Green Realty tumbled more than 13% last month. A big driver was a surge in coronavirus cases in New York City where the company is the leading office landlord. That further delayed the return to the office by some of the company's tenants.

However while the ongoing pandemic has been a headwind for SL Green it sees better days ahead. The office REIT recently reported its fourth-quarter results which showed that the city's office market is getting back on its feet. SL Green signed leases covering more than 1.9 million square feet last year smashing its expectation that it would sign 1.3 million square feet of leases. That led the company to set an ambitious goal of signing more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2022.

The improvement in office leasing will help further support SL Green's monthly dividend which now yields an attractive 5% following last month's decline. It should also help drive continued growth in SL Green's dividend which it has now increased for 11 straight years.

Higher yields following last month's sell-off

In January Crown Castle Digital Realty and SL Green Realty all tumbled along with the broader market. Those sell-offs came even though each REIT reported positive news. Because of that they look like attractive buys for income investors this month since their now higher yields look even more sustainable over the long term."

Sam Jenkins* 68 from London is in the second camp. Having liquidated his self-invested personal pension – which was all invested in star manager Terry Smith’s Fundsmith Equity – in May 2019 following a tip from a friend he now has £241000 in cash. But he is anxious about where to invest ­having made poor decisions in the past.

“If I had stayed invested my portfolio would have risen 39pc and be worth £335000 today” said Mr Jenkins a retired university lecturer.

Mr Jenkins has a heart condition and estimates he has about five years to live. His Sipp will therefore pass to his wife 57 who is healthy and then possibly on to their children.

“The portfolio should be invested for growth over the next 10 to 15 years for my wife to inherit. She will be able to live off a property portfolio so the Sipp is not needed to generate an income” he said. “I am worried about how expensive American shares are and think the UK market looks good value.

The maker of the notorious ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game franchise announced Friday that a new edition is under development confirming long-bubbling speculation.

New York-based Rockstar Games did not say when ""Grand Theft Auto 6"" will hit the street or how it will be different from the previous edition of the game released in 2013 to blockbuster sales.

""We're pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the series is underway"" the studio's subsidiary Take Two Interactive said in an online post.

More than 230 million copies of ""Grand Theft Auto"" referred to as ""GTA"" have been sold overall.

An online multi-player version of the game boasts a large and devoted community of fans some of whom took to Twitter to express delight at the news along with jibes that Rockstar might not deliver the new game for years.

One fan of the game tweeted a photo of three elderly men hunched over a video game controller joking it would be him and friends when GTA 6 is finally available.

A tweet from the account @robertyoushock focused on Rockstar saying the new game is well underway.

""This same language was used in June 2012 in regards to GTA V"" the tweet read noting it took 14 more months for the game to launch.

The GTA franchise in which players take on the role of a criminal has been criticized for glorifying law-breaking violence and abuse of women.

""This could be the GTA to end all GTAs!"" read a tweeted reply to Rockstar from the account of self-described esports commentator and game streamer @nathanias.

In a tweet by the developer Hazelight Studios it has been announced that the compulsory co-op game about two people struggling in their marriage has now surpassed 5million sales across all platforms.

5… that’s FIVE million copies of #ItTakesTwo ￼sold! 😳💥🥳 Our team is absolutely stunned just thinking about how many players have now enjoyed our game! 😍 — Hazelight Studios (@HazelightGames) February 4 2022

The last time Hazelight announced figures on how well its game was selling was back in October when it reached 3million games sold. This shows that it has continued to sell well despite almost a year after its original launch.

One of the unique selling points of It Takes Two is the inbuilt Friend Pass meaning that you only required one copy of the game in order to play with someone online. So the number of players is likely somewhere closer to 10million.

It hasn’t all been smooth sailing for the development team lead by Josef Fares. Major publisher Take-Two Interactive challenged the trademark on the game’s name as being similar to its own. As such Hazelight Studios had to abandon creating a trademark for its game.

In our four star review Tom Regan praised the game’s co-op mechanics and intriguing platforming:

“Its ‘heartfelt’ rom-com story may elicit more shrugs than tears but if video games are primarily a tool for facilitating fun and laughter then It Takes Two is nothing short of a triumph. With each copy coming with a ‘friend pass’ that allows you to gift it to another player whether you’re playing with someone you live with or a friend on the other side of the planet – It Takes Two is exactly the kind of carefree social experience that the world needs right now.”

Dan Houser who co-founded Rockstar Games which developed the Grand Theft Auto video game series will officially leave the company in March.

Houser who was vice president of its creative division started the company with his brother Sam in 1998 and the pair have created some of the most popular video games in the world.

No reason has been given for his sudden departure but Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive says it is 'extremely grateful for his contributions.'

He has already been on an extended leave of absence since the spring.

Rockstar Games reached its commercial apex two years ago when its Wild West-set Red Dead Redemption 2 game experienced the fastest weekend sales in the history of entertainment games.

Rockstar earned $725million in revenue in just three days and sold more copies than its predecessor Red Dead Redemption in 17 days.

The game follows Van der Linde gang members Arthur Morgan and John Marston and involve shootouts horseback riding heists and honour ratings which are assessed based on a character's moral choices.

But it was Grand Theft Auto (GTA) that launched Rockstar into the video gaming mainstream. Grand Theft Auto 3 was the best-selling video game in 2001 while its Vice City and San Andreas games were also best-sellers.

Five games in the GTA franchise are among the top-50 selling video games of all time with Grand Theft Auto V being third overall.

GTA V generated revenue of over $800million in the first 24 hours after it was launched and was the fastest selling game in UK history. It has gone on to sell around 115 million copies.

Grand Theft Auto V is the third-best selling video game in history

GTA was the subject of a legal battle that was dramatised in The Gamechangers a docudrama starring Daniel Radcliffe as Dan Houser's brother Sam.

Socially conservative American attorney Jack Thompson tries to sue Rockstar over GTA over its supposedly corrosive influence on American youths.

Oxford-educated Houser was born in London but is based in New York where Rockstar's headquarters are located. The company also has offices in Edinburgh where its Rockstar North affiliate is located.

He has described his company's vision as to 'make games that we wouldn't be embarrassed to be caught playing ourselves...Games were ghettoised as being for children and we were one of the companies that helped to or are helping still to change that perception.'

Rockstar North which developed Red Dead Redemption 2 is based in Edinburgh

Rockstar has faced significant criticism in recent years for the way it allegedly treats its employees. Dan Houser stated in a 2018 interview that the team were working 100-hour weeks in the run-up to the release of Red Dead Redemption 2.

He later clarified his remarks in a statement saying that he was only speaking about the senior writing team which consists of four people including him and that the 100-hours per week period lasted only three weeks.

'Crunch culture' has been a common complaint among former and current games workers at video gaming firms.

Game makers have said they are often forced to work punishing hours including unpaid overtime in order to meet strict targets.

Further controversy came about when the Rockstar's Vice President of Development Jeronimo Barrera was accused of groping an employee. Barrera completely denies the allegations.

The grant came from the Bills the NFL Foundation and Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC).

Grassroots grants are issued once established funding thresholds are reached for each project.

To date the NFL Foundation Grassroots Program – a partnership between the NFL Foundation and LISC the nation’s leading community development organization – has done wonders for communities throughout the US by supporting the construction or renovation of 416 football fields nationwide since 1998 (to a tune of $58 million – $6 million this year alone). The renovations include irrigation systems lights bleachers scoreboards goal posts and turf.

Tapestry Charter School’s new Community Athletic Complex will service Tapestry’s 1100 students as well as youth from across the city. The facilities will be made available for youth fitness and sports activities such as football flag football lacrosse soccer and track and field events.

This facility will be the central hub for PlayBuffalo.

To that end Tapestry has developed PlayBuffalo – a collaborative organization made up of public private and charter schools which brings the schools together to create fuller teams and clinics that are able to better utilize the field and its supplemental amenities.

“This is a very special moment in Tapestry’s 20-year history and I couldn’t be more excited for our school and the wider community across the City of Buffalo” said Eric Klapper Executive Director Tapestry Charter School. “Our work is all about expanding access and opportunity to the students and families we serve and thanks to the Buffalo Bills the NFL Foundation and LISC the Buffalo community will have greater more equitable access to facilities for youth sports and thus all the benefits of health wellness and social and emotional well-being that comes with it.”

Bills owner and President Kim Pegula states “Supporting the development of safe and accessible places for children in Buffalo to participate in sports and be physically active is an important part of our community outreach. Thank you to the NFL Foundation and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation for your partnership on this grant opportunity. We are excited about the positive impact the facility at Tapestry Charter School will have on our community and look forward to the opening of the facility.”

LISC not only partnered with Tapestry Charter School to access the funding for the project it also helps to provide technical assistance. The joint agencies oversee the construction maintenance and programming of the fields.

“COVID has revealed just how critical schools and recreation spaces are to community health and the economy” said Julie Barrett O’Neill Executive Director of LISC Western New York. “This exciting Tapestry project is in an area of the city with limited recreation and parks space. Tapestry has worked hard to get their site ready for this investment. We are excited that this facility will be opened up to City of Buffalo children attending charter schools as well as other community organizations looking for field space.”

A new synthetic turf field will be built at Tapestry’s Community Track and Multi-Sport Athletic Complex in North Buffalo. See recent school developments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Olay the skin care company is unveiling the new statue of Ross on Monday (Feb. 7) ahead of it going on public display on Feb. 23 at the First Americans Museum in Ross' home state of Oklahoma. The monument was designed with advice from the staff at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum to ensure that it was historically accurate.



""Knowing young girls need to see themselves in these roles before they can dream of pursuing them Mary's story will now inspire generations of women of all backgrounds to #FaceAnything and explore STEM careers"" Olay wrote in a press release adding that the statue was part of its annual $1 million donation for the second year of its ten-year effort to close the gender gap in science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.



""Olay is committed to #FaceTheSTEMGap by helping to double the number of women in STEM and triple the number of women of color in STEM by 2030"" the company said.



Monday's unveiling which was timed to precede the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on Feb. 11 reflects Ross' own work to inspire others.



""Mary encouraged everyone to seek education because no one can ever take that from you. She pushed people to continuously better themselves and create their own opportunities through hard work and perseverance"" Ross' family said in a statement released by Olay and the Mary Golda Ross Trust. ""This statue will remind the public of what is possible when they believe in themselves and push to break through glass ceilings.""



As a member of the Cherokee Nation Ross was the first-known Native American woman to become an aerospace engineer and first female engineer to be hired by the Lockheed Corporation (today Lockheed Martin) where she was one of the 40 founding members of the storied and highly-secretive Skunk Works project.



""Although much of her work remains classified she is recognized as an important contributor to the 20th-century aerospace technologies and interplanetary exploration"" the plaque at the base of her new statue reads. ""In Ross' words 'We were taking the theoretical and making it real.'""



Among Ross' known work is the development of Agena rocket an upper stage that was used to launch Corona reconnaissance satellites and more than 30 NASA payloads. During the Gemini program the precursor program to the Apollo moon landings NASA chose the Agena to serve as a target vehicle for astronauts to practice the critical skills of rendezvous and docking.



The Agena was also used to send three Mariner probes to Venus and the two to Mars. In 1963 Ross was one of the authors of NASA's Planetary Flight Handbook which covered space travel to Venus and Mars.



The life-size statue of Ross depicts her in a skirt suit similar to how she appeared in a circa 1950 Lockheed promotional photo complete with a large flower brooch on her lapel. She was sculpted holding a model of an Atlas-Agena rocket and a slide rule wrapped in a scroll engraved with the equation that describes the energy needed for a spacecraft to depart Earth and reach the orbit of another planet.



The First Americans Museum located in Oklahoma City shares the cultural diversity history and contributions of the 39 distinct tribal nations in Oklahoma. The museum also displays a painting of Ross whose great-great grandfather was Cherokee Chief John Ross.



The statue donated by Olay is the latest honor for Ross who died in 2008 at the age of 99. She was earlier recognized with a Google ""Doodle"" in 2018 and with her depiction on the U.S. Mint's 2019 Native American $1 coin which celebrated the roles of Native Americans in space exploration.



""Olay hopes Mary Golda Ross' story will continue to inspire many generations of woman from all backgrounds to face anything and explore STEM careers to one day achieve greater equity in STEM"" the company inscribed on the statue's base.

The St. Pete EDC celebrated its five years of accomplishments and the region’s success at its fifth annual meeting Thursday at the Don CeSar.

“The EDC was created to market St. Pete as a great business location with the goal of bringing companies here. But marketing alone cannot always be enough there has to be a coordinated effort by a team of folks to show the company we are working with that St. Pete could be a great fit for them and continue to assist them long after the relocation is made” St. Pete EDC President J.P. DuBuque said.

In 2021 alone 94 new companies were added to the city’s pipeline and 630 target industry jobs were created according to the EDC’s data. Target industries identified in St. Pete include data analytics financial services manufacturing and marine and life sciences.

The EDC highlighted companies that have made St. Pete its home in 2021 or announced plans to relocate to the city in the near future.

The most recent case is Spontivly a Canadian-based company known for its community management platform. It announced it would move its HQ from Canada to St. Pete this year.

“Honestly St. Pete and the Tampa Bay region were not on our radar. We were looking at cities like Atlanta Los Angeles and Seattle” co-founder Anthony Nagendraraj said during the event.

The company was introduced to the region through its participation in the Tampa Bay Wave’s TechDiversity cohort in 2021. Spontivly was also a semifinalist in the Startup of the Year Summit. “The growing tech scene really made us want to be in this community” Nagendraraj said.

In late January Spontivly closed its six-figure pre-seed round and said it will be raising another round.

The company plans to hire 65 people over the next three years.

Other companies in attendance and recognized included tech startup Shamrck which made the announcement last month it was relocating to St. Pete from Mississippi. Shamrck is an artificial intelligence-powered career exploration platform that helps schools create better career and technical education programs by connecting students to employers.

CitrusAd a global e-commerce media firm was also recognized. It opened its U.S. HQ in St. Pete and hired 50 team members and is still hiring.

The list continued with mentions of cybersecurity firm Code-X that opened its global headquarters in St. Pete as well as CodeBoxx another Canadian-founded tech company providing coding education courses; CodeBoxx also moved its HQ to St. Pete.

“When we decided to look at the Tampa Bay region we spent a couple of days over on the other side and then we ultimately came over to this side. The difference in terms of the energy could not be any more different” CodeBoxx co-founder Meg Charles said.

“It was about the community. This is such an eclectic group of people. We love the art scene here. I was frankly surprised by the food culture – I’m from New York” she chuckled.

One dayshe met with DuBuque for lunch during a rainstorm. Nonetheless it didn’t damper DuBuque’s plans of taking her on a site-scouting tour from the Carillon area to downtown. DuBuque also connected Charles with former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and introduced CodeBoxx to Seedfunders which provides funding and mentoring for pre-revenue technology concepts.

During the annual event the EDC spotlighted the progress of other projects and significant announcements in the region one of which was the Maritime and Defense Technology Hub and its main and largest tenant Pole Star.

The Maritime and Defense Technology Hub is at 450 8th Ave. Southeast formerly used as the SRI International building. It is the first-ever hub of its kind in Tampa Bay. The facility adjacent to the Coast Guard station was created to have spaces for companies seeking a waterfront location to deploy vessels and have a hyper-secured site for highly-classified operations.

The tenant Pole Star is a London-based marine company that collects real-time data on everything from active vessels on the water and issues including piracy collisions and predicting weather patterns. The company works closely with the U.S. Coast Guard and marine officials. “We had to identify a high-security location that would allow us to have 24/7 operations and support the Coast Guard” Ben Minichino President of Pole Star said during the event.

Minichino said he was living in Barcelona Spain at the time when the company started site searching. “We found the Ceridian campus and that became our temporary home. We began to work with [Innovation District Director] Alison Barlow the mayor’s office and the city council about [moving to] the SRI building. It was purpose-built for us” Minichino said. “As we moved into the Maritime and Defense and Technology Hub we are really excited to not only be here in St. Pete but we are working with some amazing tech companies with the same [industry] barriers and we are all figuring it out together.”

Additionally he said the company has identified “amazing talent” in St. Pete.

Another major win that put St. Pete in the national headlines was the announcement of business mogul Cathie Wood relocating her ARK Invest firm from New York to St. Pete.

In October Wood said she’d inked a lease for 10000 square feet of office space in downtown St. Pete at the 200 Central building. She also bought naming rights for the Tampa Bay Innovation Center which will be the first in Pinellas County purposely constructed to focus on entrepreneurs.

She and her team believe the city has the potential of becoming “the next Austin.”

Following the EDC’s relocation and expansion success stories the organization outlined several initiatives for the new year including conducting a perception study that will determine how out-of-market company executives and site selection consultants view St. Petersburg.

The perception study findings will be released this year.

The EDC is also in the process of updating its strategic planning and investing in new technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvY2FsZHdlbGwtc2F5cy1mb3JtZXItY2l0eS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtZGlkbnQtYnJlYWstbGF3LWluLWtlYWxvaGEtc2NhbmRhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caldwell believes former city officials are innocent,"Former Mayor Kirk Caldwell believes his one-time corporation counsel managing director and chair of the police commission did not break the law while arranging a $250000 retirement settlement for former police Chief Louis Kealoha that bypassed City Council review.

The three past city officials Donna Leong Roy Amemiya and Max Sword were indicted Dec. 16 and accused of conspiring to defraud the government in 2017 by diverting federal funds and money from the Honolulu Police Department’s payroll account to fund the Kealoha payout. They were arrested by the FBI Jan. 12 entered pleas of not guilty and are free on $50000 bond ahead of their trial June 13.

The accusations outlined by the U.S. Department of Justice are the latest charges to come from a long-running investigation into Honolulu government operations elected officials and the private business people who support them through campaign donations.

Caldwell has not received a target letter in connection with the probe nor has he been contacted by investigators since Leong Amemiya and Sword were indicted.

The press and “others” asked Caldwell to comment on the Kealoha severance matter according to a statement released by his attorney Lex R. Smith.

“I have great confidence in the integrity of Ms. Leong Mr. Amemiya and Mr. Sword. I am confident they did not commit a crime and they will be acquitted when they get their day in court” said Caldwell. “As I understand it this somehow involves the process that was used for the Kealoha severance agreement. I am confident that Donna Leong used and would always use the process she believed was right and legal. These are people of impeccable integrity and honor. I cannot fathom the hurt they and their families must feel. I can only say that I am confident of their innocence and ask that everyone consider the facts and not rush to judgement.”

Caldwell did not respond to questions about what if any impact the accusations have on his campaign to be Hawaii’s next governor. In his statement Caldwell said he will not comment further citing ongoing litigation.

Lynn Panagakos Leong’s attorney Lyle S. Hosoda Amemiya’s counsel and William C. McCorriston Sword’s attorney did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Caldwell’s statement of support for their clients.

The DOJ team of prosecutors who are running the ongoing investigation and prosecuting the case — Michael Wheat Joseph Orabona Janaki Chopra Colin McDonald and Andrew Chiang — did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Wheat and a spokesperson.

The defense is attempting to depose Nelson Koyanagi the former director of the city Department of Budget and Fiscal Services who is fighting cancer and may be unable to testify.

Panagakos filed a motion in federal court Jan. 27 asking a judge to compel Koyanagi to review evidence turned over during discovery and take questions. Koyanagi knows that the 2017 Kealoha settlement did not require City Council approval and was structured like settlements paid to other city department heads the motion asserts.

Panagakos Hosoda and McCorriston all wished Koyanagi and his family well during a hearing Friday. Judge Leslie E. Kobayashi gave the defense and DOJ until Monday to establish a process for sharing evidence and questions with Koyanagi’s attorneys Howard Luke and Richard Sing who will try to determine if he is willing to answer them.

Doctors treating Koyanagi must confirm he is physically able to handle questioning by attorneys Kobayashi told the attorneys Friday.

DOJ’s probe that stretches to at least 2016 resulted in the 2019 conviction of Kealoha and his estranged wife former Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katherine Kealoha.

Kealoha was sentenced to seven years in prison and Katherine Kealoha received 13 years in December 2020 after being convicted of conspiracy fraud and obstruction of justice in a probe that started with a report that the Kealohas’ mailbox was stolen.

In 2018 former city Prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro and two of his deputies received letters notifying them they were the target of Wheat’s investigation. None of them have been charged.

On January 20 at least five people including two former elected officials testified as witnesses before a federal grand jury about donations from Honolulu engineering executive Dennis Mitsunaga his employees and family members between 2008 and 2020."

Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images

Teenager Jack Sweeney has gained fame for his Twitter account that tracks Elon Musk's private jet.

Sweeney previously suggested to Musk he'd delete the account in exchange for a free Tesla.

But on Friday Sweeney turned down an offer of a free Tesla Model 3 for three years.

A 19-year-old famous for his Twitter account that tracks Elon Musk's private jet was on Friday offered a free Tesla to delete it – but rejected the offer.

Jack Sweeney had said previously that he'd take a free Tesla from Musk in exchange for deleting the account having rejected an offer of $5000 from the Tesla CEO.

On Twitter Friday Scott Painter CEO of Autonomy a car-hire company offered Sweeney a subscription to a Tesla Model 3 if he deleted the Musk jet-tracking account. The Wall Street Journal reported that the offer was for a three-year subscription.

Sweeney responded: ""I told you I'm not interested in a subscription besides there are numerous facts that suggest this is in conjunction with Elon.""

In an interview with The Journal on Friday Sweeney explained why he came to his decision. ""I want my own car. I don't want to have to give it back in three years"" he said. ""If I got an actual Tesla then I would take it down.""

Sweeney did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

His jet-tracking account uses bots that monitor publicly-available air-traffic data.

After turning down $5000 from Musk to delete the account Sweeney told Insider he refused the offer because it wasn't enough to replace the satisfaction he gets from running the account.

In his initial conversation with Musk which occurred via Twitter direct messages in fall 2021 and was first reported by Protocol Musk said: ""Can you take this down? It is a security risk.""

Sweeney replied: ""Yes I can but it'll cost you a Model 3 only joking unless?""

Musk responded: ""How about $5k for this account and generally helping make it harder for crazy people to track me?""

Sweeney said: ""Sounds doable account and all my help. Any chance to up that to $50K?"" He cited college funding and told the billionaire the money could go toward buying a Tesla Model 3.

Four years ago not long after the Model 3 first came to market you'd better bet many people had concerns about whether or not the electric car was built well enough to endure the test of time not to mention fears over the longevity of its battery pack.

Fast forward to the present and Slye is still driving his early single-motor rear-wheel-drive Model 3. He points out that even though it's the ""slowest"" Tesla it's still peppier than almost any other car he's encountered while driving.

Slye shared some of his favorite features of the Model 3 such as the car's incredible safety as well as its one-pedal driving. He notes that one-pedal driving not only makes driving easier but also reduces wear and tear of the car's friction brakes all while improving range.

Slye also calls Tesla Autopilot invaluable though the Supercharger network is one of the main reasons he bought a Tesla. He loves over-the-air software updates though he admits that at times they put him at the mercy of Tesla's engineers who may decide to push out a feature or change that he doesn't necessarily need want or like.

As far as battery degradation is concerned Slye says the Model 3 has lost about 2.2% of its estimated range after four years and 100000 miles which is impressive. He goes on to provide a detailed look at what it might cost you to own a Model 3. He calculates that he's spent just over $2000 to charge the car over 100000 miles.

Slye says you can pick up a Model 3 today for around $50000 which is about what he paid for the car four years ago. However while the current base Model 3 starts at around $45000 you can get the Long Range version – with dual-motor all-wheel drive and more range – for $51000.

He provides the following topics and timestamps to go along with the video above. Check it out and then let us know what you think by starting a conversation in the comment section below.

After his wife tried to pick up their kids at school on October 8 2021 the car simply stopped working. Tesla then told Campbell he would have to spend HK$171000 ($21956 at the current exchange rate) to replace the battery pack which is still under warranty. The reason was that the “car was flooded.” The issue is that it never was.

EV

Campbell told the South China Morning Post that neither he nor his wife ever drove the car through flooded areas. When the vehicle failed heavy rains were hitting Hong Kong but none of the places in which Campbell’s wife went were flooded. He believes that Tesla is simply trying to dodge responsibility for a battery pack defect it would otherwise have to replace for free.Campbell asked the Tesla Service Center to present him the investigation report. He wanted to understand how a sealed battery pack could be full of water by just facing heavy afternoon rain. The South China Morning Post asked the help of an experienced mechanical engineer to understand the issue. Lo Kok-keung said the battery case could have been damaged. If that were true Tesla would have shown Campbell the report and the damage. The company refused to let him see the investigation report.That led the Tesla customer to assume Tesla just wanted to avoid replacing his battery pack . After complaining for three months about the repair bill themaker said it would charge only HK$91000 ($11684) out of “goodwill.” If Campbell were really to blame it makes no sense that Tesla cut the price by almost half. If the battery pack presented damages the EV maker should just have shown them to the customer to justify voiding the warranty and charging him to replace it. Tesla limited its defense to sending Campbell two pictures of the battery pack by email stating that it found “substantial volumes of water” there. The EV maker told him there were no similar cases in other countries. It may be the case that we just have not heard about them.Campbell knows that the battery was full of water. What the Tesla client wants to know is how a sealed battery pack can be flooded. Had Tesla presented him the damages right from the beginning he would not have been wondering about what went wrong. The company just accused him of driving in flooded areas which he denies.If you have ever heard about similar cases let us know about them. Perhaps Model S battery packs had sealing issues at some point. Without knowing about them other customers may have been charged for them just like Campbell even when their battery packs were still under warranty. This Hong Kong case may sure be an isolated one. However in our experience they never are.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzE0MzM1L2pheS1sZW5vLW1vZGVsLXMtcGxhaWTSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy50b3JxdWVuZXdzLmNvbS8xNDMzNS9qYXktbGVuby1tb2RlbC1zLXBsYWlkL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jay Leno on the Tesla Model S Plaid,"Follow us today...

Jay Leno Talk About the Tesla Model S Plaid

In an interview with Cars and Culture with Jason Stein Jay Leno talked about the Tesla Model S Plaid of which he owns one. He says:

""I’m stunned how good it is. I love that it’s built in America American labor American tech. I’m talking to the Tesla guys about their new carbon rotors and I felt like my Mother when she‘d come in the garage and guys are talking about cam timing.""

Jay has also talked about other vehicles including Bugatti and Ferrari's that sell for $1 million and even more. He's impressed with the Tesla Model S Plaid and how it compares to the worlds most expensive and fast cars.

Jay's Tesla Model S Plaid is one of his favorite cars. He says it's unbelievable. He went to a drag strip to race it - and with the air conditioner on. Jay Leno also broke the quarter mile time record with a 9.247 second quarter mile. This was done in a four door family sedan - the Tesla Model S Plaid.

Jay has a lot of steam automobiles from the last century. He says that internal combustion engines need to build up to the energy they get and to accelerate. A car that runs on steam or electricity has that power available right now to power the car and make it accelerate quickly. He sees electric vehicles as being the dominant form of transportation in the future.

Jay likes that electric vehicles have little to no maintenance because there just aren't many working parts. The main maintenance is general cleaning wiper fluid replacing a wiper blade keeping air in your tires and rotating your tires. That seems to be about it. ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles have much more maintenance.

Jay has known Elon ever since the original Tesla Roadster. Elon told Jay at that time he was going to build charging stations around the country and Jay doubted him at the time. But Elon did just that. Charging stations are now becoming common throughout the U.S. today.

Future of the Tesla Model S Plaid

I've seen used Tesla Model S Plaids with FSD (full self-driving) selling for as much as $156000 online. That's almost $30000 higher than the base price that Tesla sells them for.

We recently saw a video of a drag race between a Tesla Model S Plaid and a Lucid Air Dream Edition vehicle. The Tesla Model S Plaid one most of the races and the one it lost was close and didn't involve the Plaid using its launch mode feature.

I think the future of the Tesla Model S Plaid is bright for those who have the money to spend on it. It's an extremely fast and highly performant vehicle which gets a lot of range as well. I can see why Jay Leno owns one. I'd like to own one some day but presently it's out of my price range.

Will Tesla be able to make a car faster than the Tesla Model S Plaid? I think there will be incremental updates to the Plaid and we'll see specs across the board get marginally better. But it won't be until we see the Tesla Roadster and especially the Roadster with a SpaceX rocket booster that we see a Tesla vehicle easily surpass the Tesla Model S Plaid.

However after that when it comes to driving on the road we're reaching the laws of physics and what physically can be done while driving. The main thing I'd like to see is a competing EV (electric vehicle) actually come close to or beat the Tesla Model S Plaid and be able to match it on price. I don't see this happening any time soon.

What do you think of the Tesla Model S Plaid? Is it the best family sedan vehicle in the world today? Will another vehicle be able to top it?

When rumors of the Tesla Model S Plaid started emerging many were excited to see the company’s new flagship sedan. It takes something special after all to dethrone the Model S “Raven” Performance a vehicle that is already capable of humbling supercars on the quarter-mile. But while the specs of the Plaid definitely did not disappoint one could not deny that the car’s exterior left much to be desired.

The Tesla Model S Plaid to put it bluntly looks very similar to the Model S “Raven” Performance. Save for a slightly wider stance and some updated accents here and there the car looks nearly identical to its predecessor. This was something that Tesla critics immediately pounced on and it was something that could have been avoided. The Model S Plaid after all is a revolutionary car in its own right. Its ongoing teardown continues to prove it.

A “Packaging Symphony”

Auto veteran Sandy Munro of Munro & Associates is currently in the process of tearing down and analyzing every aspect of the Model S Plaid and so far the expert has been impressed with the vehicle. A recent video posted on the Munro Live YouTube channel showcased the Model S Plaid’s rear motor assembly and as per one of the team’s experts the vehicle’s rear cradle and electric drive module are nothing short of a “packaging symphony.”

The Munro team’s thoughts on the Model S Plaid were unsurprising considering that the vehicle is filled to the brim with new innovation. The team even concluded in its rear cradle review that compared to its predecessors the Model S Plaid is really a new generation vehicle. And in a lot of ways the car does show it. Its specs are on a completely different level compared to the numbers achieved by the Model S “Raven” Performance and the Plaid’s interior is fully revamped as well.

Considering that the Model S Plaid is also a completely different car beneath the hood one could find it unfortunate that Tesla opted to package all this innovation in a body that while now iconic is getting a little bit long in the tooth. This is not to say that the Model S’ look is no longer attractive of course. The Model S is still a beautiful car and its lines are now timeless but it’s hard to shake the idea that for a vehicle like the Plaid it would have been better if Tesla implemented just as much updates in the vehicle’s exterior as it did with the car’s interior.

Missed Opportunities

This is especially strange since in the months leading up to the Model S Plaid’s official release the internet was abuzz with fan renders of what the updated vehicle could look like. Some were radical but most were subtle enough that they would not look out of place in Tesla’s lineup. Very few could have predicted the vehicle’s actual design however as the Plaid was pretty much identical to the Model S “Raven” Performance.

There is no doubt that the sheer engineering involved in the Model S Plaid’s creation is absolutely insane. Every square inch of the car’s interior and everything behind the hood of the vehicle proves this. It’s just a bit surprising — if not a tad bit disappointing — that Tesla opted to simply maintain the status quo with the vehicle’s exterior which is something that the company rarely does. Tesla made a name for itself as an automaker that does what it thinks is best after all regardless of what the rest of the auto sector thinks. The Cybertruck’s brutalist XY design is an example of that.

Even in a company like Tesla with a mission as important as those outlined by CEO Elon Musk it does not hurt to put extra effort in packaging the company’s most formidable vehicles in a body that looks the part. Tesla already did that with the next-generation Roadster and there is no reason why the company could not do that for its flagship sedan and SUV. The Model S and Model X Plaid would likely be successful in their respective segments — their specs and performance are just that good — but just imagine how much more successful the vehicles could be if their exteriors were redone as much as their interior and tech.

Textron Aviation [NYSE:TXT] announced the rollout of the P1 unit on Friday for the super-size twin-engine utility turboprop. Launch customer FedEx Express [NYSE:FDX] has been eagerly awaiting the first of its upgraded fleet flagship—initially proposed for delivery at the end of 2021—and it has played an integral part in the clean-sheet design’s envisioning and development.

“Today is a rewarding day for our employees who have worked to design and build what I believe will become a legendary airplane for our company” said Ron Draper president and CEO of Textron Aviation.

“The SkyCourier brings an impressive combination of cabin flexibility payload capability performance and low operating costs to the twin engine utility segment. We look forward to this highly versatile aircraft entering the market very soon.”

Update on Flight Test

The first SkyCourier (with a CE-408 model designation) took flight in May 2020 and it has now accumulated more than 2100 hours in flight test on three test articles.

The first production-conforming unit marks the last stage of that program. After certification—now planned for the first half of this year—FedEx will accept the first of its new fleet. The company has committed to 100 units with 50 aircraft in the cargo configuration on the initial order and 50 more on option.

The Model 408

The SkyCourier will come in both the cargo version and a passenger model that can flex to carry up to 19 people. The passenger version has both crew and passenger doors to facilitate entry and exit to the cabin compartment.

The Model 408 features:

Two Pratt & Whitney PT6A-65SC engines

McCauley C779 four-blade 110-inch propellers

Garmin G1000 NXi integrated flight deck

Flat-floor cabin capable of holding 3 LD3 shipping containers

Projected speed and range? A maximum of 200 ktas and a 900-nm range at its maximum endurance profile. The SkyCourier will lift up to 6000 pounds of payload.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L2Nlc3NuYS1yb2xscy1vdXQtZmlyc3Qtc2t5Y291cmllci1zbGF0ZWQtZm9yLWRlbGl2ZXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cessna Rolls Out First Skycourier Slated for Delivery,"[ Aircraft Orders and Deliveries ] By Ian McMurtry

Cessna continues to push forward with the unveiling of the SkyCourier its newest twin-engine aircraft that is expected to start service soon. This week the airline officially rolled out the first production SkyCourier which will take delivery once testing is complete.

The manufacturer was quick to thank Federal Aviation Administration and customers for their feedback in the design noting that the clean slate has allowed Cessna to create a fresh design to maximize the current aviation scene and help customers with issues that current competing aircraft plague their operations with.

Textron Aviation CEO Ron Draper commented on the event saying “today is a rewarding day for our employees who have worked to design and build what I believe will become a legendary airplane for our company. The SkyCourier brings an impressive combination of cabin flexibility payload capability performance and low operating costs to the twin-engine utility segment. We look forward to this highly versatile aircraft entering the market very soon.”

The Cessna SkyCourier takes into account multiple new machining and designing techniques to take Textron into the next generation of aircraft including monolithic machining. Monolithic machining is the milling of parts on a single piece of material instead of assembling smaller parts cutting down on tolerances and relying less on cutting parts out of many different pieces of material. The aircraft is also equipped to come with quick-change seats and the ability for maintenance to access the aircraft from many additional points than previous Cessna designs.

Built-in Wichita Kansas the SkyCourier is a 900-mile radius twin-engine turboprop driven aircraft that is focused on replacing existing Cessna 208s and Beechcraft 1900s. The self-named 408 has a capacity of 19 passengers and a max payload of 6000 pounds at a speed of 200 knots. The aircraft is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65SC turboprops delivering roughly 1100 horsepower each.

The aircraft took flight in May 2020 following a rollout a few weeks prior to the first airborne operation. Since then two more SkyCouriers have joined the initial aircraft in the skies accumulating over 2100 hours of testing and finishing the final stages of testing now before the first delivery can be made.

Deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of 2022 with the launch airline FedEx Express expected to see their first aircraft soon thereafter. The express logistics carrier has a firm order for 50 aircraft placed with Cessna and an additional 50 on offer for options. This aircraft will go to work replacing the FedEx Feeder fleet of Cessna 208s which service smaller markets throughout the United States and Canada.

Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better…it’s not… – The Lorax

“That has been my motto since I accepted this position in 2013” said Ayers. “This job wasn’t what I aspired to do but when the previous economic director resigned she approached me and suggested I apply. She felt I would be a good candidate as I had been periodically advising her on what she would could and should do.”

At the time Ayers was a journalist for the Verde Independent newspaper. “Rather than a resume I wrote a 20-page paper stating how the Town of Camp Verde should move off the dime. It stirred the interest of the town manager and he eventually hired me.”

Since his appointment Ayers has moved forward bringing into the Town of Camp Verde a huge RV facility with 400 units totaling $20 million. “This is a big revenue generator” he said. “Additionally a developer has recently broken ground on a 192-unit apartment complex.”

Other new projects include a hotel a manufactured home community and other retail projects including a Tractor Supply store.

Also on Ayers’ plate is progress on the Camp Verde Sports Complex which was initiated in 1986. “The Town of Camp Verde purchased this property when it came up for sale 110 acres for $2.3 million. The first phase consists of two baseball fields two soccer fields concession stands restrooms and maintenance facilities.” Eventually mountain bike trails will be incorporated.

Stating that the sports complex will be irrigated with reclaimed water from the wastewater treatment plant Ayers made note of the fact that the water is A-Plus Water. “In order to use this water on the sports fields it must be A-Plus as determined by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). This means you can technically drink it.”

Since retired Psychiatric Technician Judy Stevenson moved to Camp Verde from California she has come to the Camp Verde Sports Complex twice a week to walk with her dog Hank. “The trails are awesome and my dog loves it. I’m so excited about this Sports Complex because I have grandchildren and when they get older and start playing youth sports it will be so much fun.”

Balancing growth with no-growth Ayers’ impetus is to invest on both sides of the scale. “The answer is not to not have growth the answer is to have smart growth and be responsible to the things that you came here for. The work that comes out of our office is simply committed to doing what I call the right thing. The right thing is not always what gives you the most money or the most jobs or lands the most people here it’s doing the things that balance out everybody’s needs.”

Calling his proposal “Sense of Place Development” investing in parks the Verde River and hiking and cycling trails are the tasks that Ayers took on in 2016. “We received funding from the Walton Family Foundation [a philanthropic organization begun by Walmart founders] and we conducted a River Recreation Master Plan to solicit feedback priorities concerns of community members about recreational opportunities and challenges along the 17-mile stretch of the Verde River that runs through Camp Verde.”

“He’s got the right spirit” said Beaver Creek Trails Coalition President Stan Mish. “He’s doing fabulous work and great things for the community. In terms of my particular interest he’s getting trails built and he keeps issues on the table and keeps us updated.”

“We had no hiking trails when I first started here but we have received funds for construction of trails and parks” said Ayers. “My department has brought in over $8 million in grants and outside funding. Though these may not sound like economic development initiatives they are Sense of Place and they build and create a livable community.”

Ayers says Camp Verde has been discussing the importance of protecting the Verde River and enhancing the outdoor lifestyle of the Western rural community since the town incorporated in 1986.

Ayers is credited with reinstating the town’s designation as a Qualified Opportunity Zone with the U.S. Treasury. “Basically what this means is tax incentives for businesses.”

Born in Tucson Ayers grew up traveling the world because his father served in the military. After a career in the automotive industry Ayers went back to college and to complete his degree in professional writing. “I graduated on my 49th birthday.”

As past president of the Camp Verde Historical Society Ayers was asked to write a book for the group’s fundraiser. He donated his time to write “Images of America Camp Verde.”

Ayers and his wife enjoy hiking and have one grown daughter.

LAST AMAZING MEAL

My wife and I have tradition of making a seafood feast for Christmas Eve and this year because of the price of king crab lobster and our usual mainstays we tried something new. We made Maryland-style crabcakes and coconut shrimp both of which served with the appropriate dipping sauces turned out heavenly. My wife who is also my best friend was my dinner partner.

BEST ADVICE I’VE RECEIVED

ACTOR WHO SHOULD PLAY ME

GUILTY PLEASURE

Belgian beer – the incredibly delicious and relatively expensive stuff made by the Trappist breweries.

ROLE MODELS

I’ve had many: My parents for genuinely caring enough to share their lives with me the handful of bosses I have worked for who never put me on a leash and my best friend Chip who is the very definition of what the Yiddish language refers to as a “mensch.” The term is commonly translated as “a person of integrity and honor.” But the sportswriter Joe Posnanski wrote the best definition I ever read (I paraphrase): “He’s the guy who stands up for you when you aren’t around the guy who gives you the aisle seat so you can sit with your friend the guy who leaves a note on your windshield when he dents your car the guy who brings the hostess a gift knows your birthday knows your kid’s name your dogs’ names and never forgets to pass along the promised book or recipe or recommendation.” FBN

By V. Ronnie Tierney FBN",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvYWdyaS5jby56YS9ibGFjay1tYXNzZXktc29tZXRoaW5nLXNwZWNpYWwtZm9yLWEtaGlnaC1ob3JzZXBvd2VyLXRyYWN0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Massey – Something special for a high horsepower tractor,"Dieter Schroder owner of DT Farming Trust in Winterton along with son-in-law Ross Braithwaite were looking for something a little more special when they were in the market for a new tractor for their newly acquired 3t fertiliser spreader.

Hence they turned to their long-term equipment supplier Drakensberg Agricultural Services (DAS) for expert advice and guidance.

DAS a long-time MF dealer in the Bergville and Winterton area assisted Dieter and Ross with their expert experience as an equipment supplier and farmer itself. DAS Co-Director Sven Rohrs along with his father Leon Rohrs used AGCO’s unique ASK system (AGCO Sales Configurator) to help their customer find that “something special” they were looking for in their quest for a new high horsepower tractor.

Dieter established the farm Noodhulp in Winterton in 1989. “Back then I was leasing the land mainly for grazing for beef farming and a bit of cropping. Our needs were growing and thus our need for mechanisation grew to a healthy size. A few years ago the ongoing drought had forced me to look at irrigation farming and thus our needs changed and so our equipment needs changed along with it. The land that we cultivate now currently under irrigation is about 1100ha a year” comments Dieter.

Ross explains that DT Farming Trust which has always had competitor machines in its fleet recently had an urgent need for another tractor. When their regular dealer was unable to meet their unique requirements and quick acquisition of a machine and at the same time supply a tractor that suited their pocket specifications low cost of ownership and with very economical fuel consumption they turned to DAS instead. DAS uses the AGCO ASK system to design tractors that meet specifications including hydraulics PTO and dual crop row tyres among other things.

While researching the new MF 7720 S series on the comprehensive Massey Ferguson website and YouTube videos Ross recalls how chuffed his seven-year-old son Carter was when he told him he was about to purchase a new brand of tractor for the farm. Carter who also wanted to throw his own spin into the mix when asked what colour the tractor should be he chose black! AGCO’s ASK dealer tool is an easy-to-use configurator to customise a tractor according to specific needs even down to the level of the colour of the tractor as requested by Carter.

After a special consultation between dealer and customer to spec their new high horsepower tractor the order button was clicked to automatically book a build slot at the Beauvais factory in France. The customer and dealer subsequently received weekly updates on the build process. The result was that the striking black MF 7720 S arrived in Durban harbour a mere 12 weeks later. Upon arrival on the farm Carter nicknamed the tractor the ‘Black Beast’.

DEALER AND OEM

Sven ascribes the flexibility of DAS as a MF dealer in being able to meet specific requirements like those for DT Farming Trust to specialised tools like the AGCO ASK system which places the farmer’s needs first and foremost. It also demonstrates AGCO Africa’s ability to better serve dealers and customers.

AGCO changed from a three-tier distribution model to a direct to dealer distribution model for South Africa in late 2020. “There are less middle-men and a direct interface with AGCO Africa and our own customers. When a customer is prepared to invest a good amount of money for a new piece of equipment it is critical to specify it from the outset in terms of the application and the customer’s preferences. This new business model has allowed us to get closer to the customer and OEM” says Sven.

DT Farming Trust is no stranger to the MF brand and DAS having bought implements like slashers spreaders and planters from DAS in the past. For Noodhulp this is the farm’s first MF tractor. What tipped the scales in the dealer’s favour was the unique customisation feedback and superlative aftermarket support it has always offered DT Farming Trust.

“I can phone them any time of the night or day” adds Ross. Recently when planting season began in anticipation of rain a problem developed at the local dam where water is sourced by means of a feeder side pump. Leon came out on a Sunday and had the water pump operational again within 20 minutes meaning the irrigation system was up and running again in no time. “DAS goes out of its way to assist with anything from tractors to implements and even water pumps” says Ross.

CONFIGURING THE BLACK MF 7720 S WITH AGCO’S ASK SYSTEM

Sven highlights that the AGCO ASK system used to specify the high horsepower high-spec MF 7700 S series enables a dealer like DAS to be fully responsive to specific customer requirements from tyre sizing to hydraulic oil flow and different guidance options for precision farming. The specific model acquired by DT Farming Trust features the trusty AGCO Power 6.6 litre six-cylinder engine which has come a long way since the MF 6400 series with a Sisu engine and in particular the single row shutoff used on both maize and soya planters.

“More and more farmers are moving to precision farming” notes Sven. For example Noodhulp has single-row shutoff on its soya crop. DT Farming Trust’s major requirement when approaching DAS was for a six-cylinder tractor powerful enough to pull its 3t spreader. Another differentiator for MF is its high hydraulic flow and pick-up capacity on the rear linkage which makes for smooth handling over any contours.

MF has made major changes to the guidance and precision farming systems of the S series one of the most technologically advanced tractor ranges on the market today. It features a Fieldstar 5 terminal with a Trimble 382 receiver and full RTK unlock for an accuracy of 3.2 to 3.8 cm. Full guidance ISOBUS allows for intuitive section and rate control. “The spreader was plug-and-play installable within minutes and worked like a dream” says Sven.

The cab layout features a terminal for precision-control functions on one side and the tractor itself on another to assist the driver in distinguishing between the two operational aspects. Another novel feature is the multi-pad multifunctional joystick. The multipad lever controls the rear linkage PTO headland management spool valves and cruise control as well as operating the transmission. All operations are easily at hand for greater comfort.

“While the black colour no doubt stands out most what makes this tractor unique and speaks to the power of the AGCO ASK system is that every little detail can be changed and modified for the customer’s specific needs. We can sit with a client like DT Farming Trust and literally build a tractor from the ground up and customise it to their level of functionality and comfort” says Leon.

CONCLUSION: MASSEY FERGUSON REDUCES OWNERSHIP COSTS AND SAVES MONEY

Apart from the technology that goes into the S series Dieter says the biggest benefit for him is the total cost of ownership due to the highly competitive price and class-beating performance. While the tractor has barely clocked three hundred hours it has already been put through its paces on Noodhulp with everyone eager to drive the ‘Black Beast’.

This year Massey Ferguson a worldwide brand of AGCO (NYSE:AGCO) is excited to announce a fresh look for its iconic Triple Triangle logo and its new ‘Born to Farm’ brand identity in celebration of its 175th anniversary. MF has offered farmers around the world straightforward and dependable machines since its inception. Few global brands can claim such a lasting impact in the agricultural industry.

In support of the farming community Massey Ferguson has an extensive network of over 35 dealers covering the whole of South Africa catering for parts service aftersales and new sales.

But it wasn’t for wrecks or construction.

It was because Tyson Foods was doing a food giveaway at West Jackson Baptist Church.

After drivers spent a few minutes waiting to turn off Oil Well Road their cars weaved through a planned route throughout the church’s parking lot to allow vehicles to get off the road somewhat sooner while they continued to wait their turn for the free food.

This was the latest in a series of similar giveaways Tyson has done in recent weeks but this was the first one done in Jackson.

And food wasn’t the only thing available. Anyone who wanted to apply for a job at Tyson was able to park their car and go inside the church and go inside where human resources representatives were set up with a temporary hiring center in one of the church’s Sunday School rooms.

Tyson employees weren’t the only people giving out food.

Players coaches and a few parents of the Liberty Tech football program were there to help in the giveaway.

“This is a good opportunity to get our guys out in the community and give back and help someone else” said Crusaders head coach Scott Akin.

According to a statement from Tyson Foods corporate communications more than 45000 pounds of food which is enough for 180000 meals was given away throughout the morning. The product boxes included various combinations of Tyson products including lemon pepper rotisserie chicken tenderloin chicken thighs chicken fritters an eight-piece chicken set and young whole chickens.

According to the plant HR director Vanessa Presson 1547 cars were given a box of food during the event.

Presson said the plant is up to 1000 employees with the need for 600 more employees in the next few months as the plant expands to its full planned capacity after starting its operations in April of 2021.

""This was a community product donation and hiring event"" Presson said. ""We literally feed the world so we want to make sure to feed those in our own backyard and we are just getting started.""

(U.S. Department of Agriculture Public Domain)

OMAHA Neb. (AP) — Meatpacking giant JBS has agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a beef price-fixing lawsuit that some say supports their concerns about how the lack of competition in the industry affects prices.

Colorado-based JBS didn’t admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement and company spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said JBS will continue to defend itself against other plaintiffs in the case but she said JBS decided the settlement was “in the best interest of the company.”

A federal judge reviewed the settlement at a hearing Thursday and will rule later whether to approve it. The plaintiffs’ attorney Dan Gustafson said the deal could serve as an “icebreaker” in the case that could lead to additional settlements in the case that also involves Tyson Foods Cargill and National Beef. Those three companies along with JBS control more than 80% of the U.S. beef market.

Similar settlements and lawsuits have previously been announced in the pork and chicken processing businesses.

The beef lawsuit filed by grocery stores and wholesalers accused the companies of working together to suppress the number of cattle being slaughtered starting in 2015 to help drive up the price of beef.

The giant beef processors have argued that supply and demand factors not anticompetitive behavior drive the price of beef and the amount ranchers receive for cattle but the industry’s practices have been questioned by the White House and Congress.

The Biden administration has focused on finding ways to increase competition in the meat processing industry to help reduce food prices and the USDA plans to invest $1 billion to help independent slaughterhouses expand. The Justice Department has been investigating potential price fixing in the industry at least since 2020 but it hasn’t provided any updates on its findings.

On Thursday the USDA and DOJ launched a new website to make it easier for farmers and ranchers to report any concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the industry.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley who has proposed requiring beef processors to disclose more about the prices they pay ranchers to bolster competition said the settlement validates the concerns he hears from ranchers even though it represents just a “spit in the ocean compared to JBS’ record profit throughout the pandemic.”

“If there were any doubt about the shenanigans big packers play to line their pockets at the expense of consumers and independent producers look no further than JBS’ $52.5 million settlement in price-fixing litigation” said Grassley the Iowa Republican.

The head of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association trade group CEO Colin Woodall said the settlement reinforces the need for the Justice Department to wrap up its investigation.

“Cattle producers do not have years to wait for the government to determine whether there has been wrongdoing — we demand answers now” Woodall said.

The answer has wide implications not just for easing the suffering of more than 35 million Afghans but also for international efforts to get the militant group to moderate policies seen by many as harsh even brutal.



""It is an almost impossible needle to thread"" said Jordan Strauss a managing director at risk consulting firm Kroll who worked as a Justice Department official in Afghanistan from 2014 to 2015.



When the Taliban seized Kabul wide-ranging sanctions dating back to their first rule followed them. To deny them access to funds the Biden administration then froze more than $7 billion in Afghan government reserves held in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.



The asset freeze exacerbated a simmering economic crisis.



“The absence of a functioning banking sector and risk of economic collapse continue to pose obstacles to mounting the scale of response needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis” Bernice G. Romero executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) told VOA.



Under pressure from aid groups the Biden administration issued sanctions exemptions in September and December.



This has allowed nonprofit organizations to deliver food and other assistance into Afghanistan. But many aid groups NGOs and banks remain wary of violating U.S. sanctions according to NGO officials.

To reassure them they won't be penalized for doing humanitarian work Treasury officials have met with representatives of non-profit organizations in recent months.



Last week Under Secretary of Treasury Brian Nelson spoke with NGO leaders to highlight a new list of Frequently Asked Questions ""designed to provide clarity and further facilitate humanitarian aid and commercial activity in Afghanistan""

Here is a look at current U.S. sanctions and exemptions:



What sanctions are currently in place against the Taliban?



U.S. economic sanctions against the Taliban date back to their first time in power in the 1990s. The curbs were tightened after the attacks of September 11 2001 which prompted the U.S. to invade Afghanistan.



Under an executive order issued just days after the attack by then-President George W. Bush both the Taliban and the Haqqani Network were labeled Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).

The designations allowed U.S. authorities to block and seize the assets of the two militant groups while making it a crime to do business with them.



With the Taliban now the de facto government of Afghanistan it remains unclear whether the 20-year-old restrictions apply to their current regime or only to individual officials previously named under U.S. sanctions.



""It needs to be clarified"" Strauss said.



Asked whether the sanctions apply to the Taliban government or individual Taliban officials a Treasury Department spokesperson noted that both the Taliban and the Haqqani Network are Specially Designated Global Terrorists adding that the Haqqani Group also is designated ad a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

She did not elaborate.

What exemptions have been issued by the Treasury Department?

Concerned the sanctions were impeding the flow of aid into Afghanistan the Treasury Department has carved out broad exemptions for NGOs and other organizations working in Afghanistan.



Since September the Treasury Department has issued six ""general licenses"" — essentially permits to carry out activities otherwise prohibited under U.S. sanctions.



These licenses allow international organizations to deliver food and agricultural produce support public hospitals and pay the salaries of teachers and healthcare workers. They also authorize banks to process transactions related to these activities without being punished.



For example a U.S. company can ship food to Afghanistan and a U.S.-based bank can carry out financial transactions to facilitate the shipment. Neither would face any penalties according to the Treasury Department website.



The latest Treasury Department license issued on December 19 goes further allowing NGOs to conduct a broad range of activities that fall outside traditional humanitarian work such as supporting human rights access to information and government transparency.



Even as some Taliban and Haqqani Network officials remain subject to U.S. sanctions NGOs and other organizations are now allowed to work with them an inevitable consequence of the change in government in Kabul.



For example a nonprofit may enter into a memorandum of understanding with Taliban officials to coordinate the delivery of aid provide descriptions of their projects and share office space according to the Treasury website.



NGOs are also permitted to pay taxes dues and import duties to the Taliban the Haqqani Network and entities they control as long as the payments are related to the authorized activities.



What the licenses don't allow



While allowing NGOs and others to work with the Taliban and Haqqani Network the Treasury Department licenses prohibit the transfer of funds to officials who remain under U.S. sanctions.



Despite Treasury's assurances some commercial players are not taking their chances.



Crowdfunding giant GoFundMe recently reportedly suspended an Afghan journalist's campaign to raise funds for his struggling news site.



The Treasury Department spokesperson said crowdfunding platforms can allow individual fundraisers ""so long as transactions or activities do not involve sanctioned individuals entities or property in which sanctioned individuals and entities have an interest.""



GoFundMe did not respond to a request for comment.

With roots dating back to the mid-1800s credit unions have become a pillar of America’s financial landscape but their popularity could be waning. According to a new survey by GOBankingRates Gen Z and millennials are less likely to bank with credit unions than they are with national and/or online banks.

The survey found that 26% of people ages 18 to 24 use credit unions while 36% of people in this age group opt for national banks such as Chase Bank of America U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. People between the ages of 25 and 34 are even less likely to use a credit union with only 14% being members of one. They too prefer to do business with a national bank (28%) but are even more likely to use an online bank with 31% saying they bank with these institutions. People ages 35 to 44 also drastically favor online banks (36%) while only 19% of this cohort banks with a credit union.

Meanwhile older generations show far more loyalty to credit unions; 35% of people ages 45 to 54 use credit unions as do 54% of people between the ages of 55 and 64. Of those surveyed who are 65 and older 60% are members of a credit union. So what does all these mean for credit unions now?

Credit Unions Need To Do a Better Job Appealing To Younger People

One key reason that credit unions are lagging behind national and online banks lies in their own shortcoming: a failure to make themselves known as an option.

“In general young people have less exposure to and understanding of credit unions than previous generations” said Matthew DiGangi a MassMutual executive in the strategic distribution division and a Bank Insurance and Securities Association leadership advisory board member.

Consumers should not be expected to stumble upon credit unions or to innately understand their offerings and perks (or inherit recognition from their parents); rather credit unions should be expected to reach out and connect with young people who may be in the dark about their values.

“What is truly the issue for credit unions trying to serve the younger generations is educating them on what a credit union is and how their relationship works as an owner” said Brian Abner economist and senior market strategist at Market Research Group LLC.

Gen Z Does Appear More Interested In Credit Unions Than Millennials

Though GOBankingRates’ survey shows that older millennials are favoring online and national banks over credit unions the research also shows an uptick in popularity with Gen Z. This suggests that credit unions could be course-correcting and doing more to appeal to young consumers.

“Credit unions are making strides to better educate millennials and Gen Z by adding products and services to add relevance with their young members” Abner said.

Credit Unions Need To Seize the Digital Day

Still credit unions need to grow their digital presence and capabilities in order to generate interest among a generation that is unwaveringly devoted to online and mobile convenience.

“[This] is an opportunity for credit [unions] to reposition themselves embracing digital” said Matthew Williamson VP of global financial services at Mobiquity. “It could in fact trigger growth opportunities for them servicing existing clients more efficiently while attracting a new generation who won’t need to find another provider if they move states and that credit union is no longer available to them. Technology has also leveled the playing field — cloud services platforms and open APIs provide cost-effective access to building engaging customer experiences.”

In-Person Banking Is Shrinking but Not Disappearing

That so many young consumers prefer online banking over credit unions implies that the days of brick-and-mortar banking are coming to an end — which would be terrible news for credit unions who live by the “people helping people” philosophy. In-person banking will shrink — it already has — but to leap to the conclusion that in-person banking will die out leaving the credit unions that so crucially rely on it in the lurch is hasty and shortsighted.

“In-person banking is still a key component of building a relationship with a customer and the more consultative discussions such as college planning retirement planning insurance needs investment advice etc.” DiGangi said.

Ultimately what credit unions need to do is strike a balance between in-person services — which are still highly important for those making major financial decisions — and digital fluency. And they need to focus their digital advancements on attracting new customers as well as on highlighting their strong points such as the fact they are not for profit unlike banks. That fact in itself could go a long way in winning over more Gen Zers who tend to be wary of if not strongly opposed to blatantly capitalist motives.

There’s a Place for Everyone

“The big picture is there is a place for both banks and credit unions when serving communities” Abner said.

Moreover we must consider the bizarre and tragic times we are living in. With the pandemic raging on as furiously as ever the world of banking — and what consumers want out of financial institutions — is in flux.

“From a financial sector perspective the last 24 months have created a shift in how services are provided to consumers” Abner said. “Technology relevant financial products and services and point of sale will be different.”

Going forward consumers will likely want a taste of both: the personal unbiased service of a credit union along with the flashy convenience touted by a national or online bank.

“The future will see a hybrid type of exchange between institution and customer as more mundane interaction will use varied high-tech systems while more sophisticated transactions such as loans and wealth services will be more customized one-on-one interaction” Abner said. “The result should be more confidence and ease of transaction for consumers and their choice in a financial partner whether a bank or credit union. Each holds merit.”

Daily Mail Australia can reveal how ride share drivers have been exploiting services like Uber to make a quick buck out of passengers - in some cases making $50 per stick.

Images taken from inside vehicles in Sydney and Brisbane show ads for e-cigarettes openly displayed in the back of vehicles next to Covid QR codes with drivers opening glove boxes to show dozens of vapes of all different strengths flavours and puff counts.

Instagram and TikTok accounts have also been set up calling themselves 'UberVapes' offering customers 'free delivery' for the purchase of illegal devices.

A black market for vapes and e-cigarettes took off after the federal government announced in October it was banning the importation and sale of nicotine-based vapes over concerns about the chemicals used in the products.

Since October 1 a prescription from a GP has been required to legally import and purchase e-cigarettes.

The decision was widely scrutinised at the time with experts suggesting it will do little to stop the extensive use of vapes in Australia.

Theo Foukkare the CEO of the Australian Association of Convenience Stores (AACC) said the government policy had become a 'laughing stock' with the banned items now easily available for sale in Ubers and online.

A TikTok account advertises for free delivery of illegal vapes throughout Sydney

An Uber user revealed he recently got into a ride share where the driver immediately offered him a range of nicotine-based vapes.

'He had a light on saying vapes available here they just store them in the glove box' the man who wished to remain anonymous told Daily Mail Australia.

'He opened it up - it's happened to me a few times in Ubers - and they've got 30 odd vapes or so.'

An Uber passenger who took photos of two separate drivers selling vapes said one produced fraudulent documentation while promising the e-cigarettes were nicotine-based.

'Some carry a customs important letter from whoever they get it from which says they don't contain nicotine' the passenger said.

'But the driver tells you they absolutely do. They're just covering themselves.'

Black market vendors are also harnessing the power of social media to connect with customers with Instagram Facebook Marketplace and TikTok the platforms of choice.

Daily Mail Australia has seen dozens of pages that offer free delivery around Australia's capital cities of illegal vapes.

One page called UberVapes has ripped off the ride share company's logo showing smoke coming out of a truck with similar font and colouring.

TikTok videos show hundreds of vapes available for free delivery with warning labels clearly displayed on the products.

Foukkare said the illegal sale of nicotine-based vapes is a 'catastrophic failure by the government'.

'The federal government may think it's being tough on vaping but just looking around on the streets and on the internet the government's policy is a laughing stock' Mr Foukkare said.

'This is a catastrophic failure of regulation. Dodgy retailers are selling vapes all over the place including places where it's easy for kids to buy them. You can go online and find a whole universe of vaping products on offer many of them containing nicotine and clearly marketed at young people.

'And now Uber drivers are selling them on the side. I've seen a lot of things in my retailing career but seeing a cab driver advertising vapes with a neon sign on the dashboard is taking things to a new level of chaos.'

The AACC chairman said vapes are being sold in everything from fruit shops to butchers with vendors looking to fill the void left by the new laws.

'These are the people selling to kids. Uber is just another example of the accessibility which we feel shouldn't be happening' Mr Foukkare said.

'You can't buy cigarettes on Uber Eats so you shouldn't be able to buy a nicotine vape when you're driving in the car.'

The AACC are calling on the government to provide a heavily regulated model to allow for nicotine-based vapes to be sold legally in Australia

There are about 700000 vapers in Australia making it one of the most lucrative markets for manufacturers and distributors in the world.

Mr Foukkare is calling on the federal government to allow the products to be sold legally under a 'heavily regulated model' that will ensure black market vendors are unable to distribute the products to teenagers.

'It is our strong view that this is a result of the federal government's heavy-handed prescription-only regime for buying nicotine vaping products. Excessive regulation drives things underground' he said.

'The black market is exploding as a result of the prescription policy. And a thriving black market makes it easy for kids to access the products – the suppliers are clever marketers and they sell them in lots of different ways including now it seems in Ubers.

He said convenience store owners are constantly telling him they have customers entering looking for the nicotine-based vapes saying they are easily available via black market means.

'Responsible retailers around Australia are ready to play their part in this. Kids should not be vaping. But adults want to often instead of smoking cigarettes' the AACC chairman told Daily Mail Australia.'

'The black market genie is out of the bottle. It's too big to police already. If you want to get rid of it you need to make nicotine vaping products available for sale in normal shops and people should need to show ID. That way any selling of nicotine vaping products will be clearly illegal.

The two partners signed a strategic collaboration agreement on Sunday at Joby’s manufacturing facility in Marina California.

To provide better integration between land and air travel the air taxi service will leverage the T Map Mobility platform — an SKT-spinoff that provides subscription-based mobility-as-a-service consisting of rental cars parking ride-hailing and other transportation-related services — and the UT ride-hailing service a joint venture formed between T Map and Uber last year eight years after the Silicon Valley-based ride-hailing giant first attempted to enter the Korean market.

Joby and Uber’s history goes back to 2019 when the two joined forces to boost Uber’s plans to launch an urban air taxi service. In 2020 Uber invest $50 million in Joby’s Series C plus an additional $75 million in a transaction that included the acquisition of Uber Elevate Uber’s aerial ride-sharing unit by Joby and an expansion of their partnership. As a result of these partnerships Joby’s ride-sharing services will be offered to passengers through either the Joby or the Uber app when it launches in U.S. markets — Joby has said it plans to launch a commercial service in the U.S. by 2024. It is therefore likely that South Korean users will see a similar app integration with UT.

While SKT and Joby are currently seeking certification from the South Korean government according to an SKT spokesperson they do not yet have plans for when or where they plan to launch the air taxi service. However a statement released by the companies expresses support of the South Korean Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport’s Korean Urban Air Mobility (K-UAM) Roadmap which sets a goal of commercializing limited UAM services by 2025 in order to reduce traffic congestion in major cities. The plan is to begin with one or two routes in the Seoul metropolitan area and get up to 10 air taxi terminals by the end of the decade all of which would connect to local buses subways and other forms of mobility.

SKT is a member of “UAM Team Korea” a government-led consortium of private sector stakeholders like Hyundai Korean Air and Incheon International Airport Corporation to push for the early stabilization of domestic UAM.

“With more than 42 million people living in urban areas South Korea offers a remarkable opportunity for Joby to make air travel a part of daily life helping people to save time while reducing their carbon footprint” said JoeBen Bevirt CEO of Joby in a statement.

Even as Joby makes moves in South Korea the company is targeting opportunities at home. Just last week TechCrunch reported that Joby is seeking permission from the FCC for a series of air taxi flights over San Francisco Bay to test its second-gen pre-production prototype the S4 which has a max range of 150 miles and a top speed of 200 miles per hour. The company also claims it has a low noise profile that would allow it to access built-up areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmV0dGVyaGVscC10YWxrc3BhY2UtYXBwcy11YmVyLW9mLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtdGV4dC10aGVyYXB5LTIwMjItMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BetterHelp Talkspace Therapy Apps Are the Ubers of Mental Health,"After a crowd stampede killed 10 people at Travis Scott's AstroWorld performance last November in Houston the rapper announced he'd be partnering with BetterHelp an app-based mental health company to offer concert attendees one free month of therapy.

The announcement sparked immediate backlash: Scott was accused of profiting off the tragedy through his partnership with the company (something the company denied) and many people rightfully pointed out that a free month of therapy was a drop in the bucket of what was needed for people to heal after the disastrous event.

Though no monetary partnership between Scott and BetterHelp existed it was nonetheless part of a PR strategy employed by BetterHelp and its therapy-app competitors like Talkspace to promote their services through partnerships with influencers celebrities and groups as far flung as the NYPD and a lingerie company.

Therapy apps have proliferated in recent years promising to democratize mental healthcare by offering a more convenient and affordable alternative to traditional talk therapy. These promises come at a crucial time. Since the beginning of the pandemic rates of depression and anxiety have skyrocketed and so has the use of therapy apps — which makes sense given that people have struggled to find a traditional therapist as demand outpaces supply. But the service offered by these apps is very different from the traditional concept of therapy: Much of the communication between users and therapists is done over text or in live chats instead of face-to-face meetings. The therapy-app companies also don't hire their own therapists but rely on overworked contracted therapists.

Talk therapy is just the latest industry to be disrupted by the Silicon Valley playbook. For years tech companies have taken advantage of the lack of anti-monopoly regulation in the US and a lack of government support for public infrastructure in order to take over industries and drive wages down in an attempt to reap massive profits (often unsuccessfully). From Grubhub to Uber to Amazon Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have presented themselves as innovators modernizing stale industries and filling gaps in ineffective systems.

But in reality these companies rely more on monopolization than true innovation. These tech companies frequently operate at a loss while they pressure enough people into their ecosystem at which point they can jack up prices and cut costs.

We can see the same thing happening now with therapy apps: BetterHelp Talkspace and other therapy apps not only aim to take advantage of a dearth of public-health infrastructure to grow their products they aim to fundamentally change the economics of mental healthcare so that they can siphon money not only from patients but therapists as well. What these apps innovated was not therapy mediated by technology but therapy stripped down to a bare-bones version of itself with less quality less overhead and less pay for its practitioners.

The Uber model

Since the outset Uber Lyft and other ride-hailing apps presented themselves as radical technological breakthroughs. But beneath the shiny technological veneer is a much darker reality. Uber and its competitors did not simply innovate their way to dominance they broke down traditional labor forces skirted laws and lobbied lawmakers so that they became nearly the only game in town. Uber now controls 70% of the rideshare market and ride-hailing apps now account for over 80% of the taxi market in New York City.

On the road to dominance these apps also caused chaos for the workers on which they depend. In New York City taxi drivers' earnings fell 44% between 2013 and 2019 and many Uber and Lyft drivers can barely afford housing food and other basic necessities.

Once Uber destroyed the old labor market and created a new one with lower pay and worse working conditions it monopolized the market giving people fewer options for getting around by eating into public-transit budgets and then forcing people to pay more for the only options left.

This destruction-to-monopolization system employed by Uber and countless other tech companies is now standard practice in the tech industry.

The Ubers of mental health

BetterHelp Talkspace and its competitors are using the same playbook to break down the current mental health system. The apps present themselves as technological innovations — never before could people so easily access a therapist! But of course this isn't true. As the University of California Berkeley professor Hannah Zeavin writes in her book ""The Distance Cure: A History of Teletherapy"" therapy has been done by phone mail and other forms of not-in-person correspondence since Sigmund Freud's time. What's different about these therapy apps is that their goal is to make a profit. Their priority isn't helping people get better but constantly roping in new customers with a stripped-down version of therapy.

Just as Uber and Lyft have raised prices while they continue to underpay their workers therapy apps charge high fees to give substandard service and wages. BetterHelp can cost up to $360 a month which may be cheaper than some therapists but is more expensive than therapy covered by the government or private insurance — which can be free on some insurance plans or partially reimbursed. And despite the fees the apps pay contracted mental healthcare workers less per hour than traditional therapy models. The companies have attempted to maintain as much opacity around their pay structure as possible but therapists told New York Magazine that they were making somewhere between $20 and $30 an hour far below the rates of traditional therapists (the average salary for therapists and psychologists in 2020 was just over $89000 a year according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics).

The apps charge this much and pay this little only to offer substandard service — therapists told New York Magazine that the hybrid structure of talk and text that can take place at any time not during a defined weekly session does not benefit patients and goes against most of their therapeutic training. Other users have reported mediocre care like therapists offering one-word responses. Research on the effectiveness of app-based therapy is still limited but even BetterHelp says in its own FAQ that it might not be a good replacement for traditional therapy. As one psychologist put it ""There is simply no replacement for sitting in the same room as someone and having your pain witnessed and validated.""

What then is the purpose of these apps if not to provide better care or easier access? They simply exist to make money and will do so by any means necessary. Many therapy apps have been accused of using questionable data-sharing practices which is particularly worrying since the apps deal with sensitive mental health information; and similar to how Uber and Lyft skirted some laws in order to operate Talkspace has offered to cover legal expenses for therapists who operate in states in which they aren't licensed.

An innovative dead end

Talkspace BetterHelp Uber and other tech companies exist partially because there is a need for disruption in the fields in which they operate.

Uber has been so successful not only because of its business strategy but because it filled a vacuum in the United States and other countries where public transportation is severely lacking. Many people do not have a choice except to use Uber in places where subway and bus systems don't exist or have been systemically underfunded for decades.

The mental healthcare system is also in need of change — it's expensive bureaucratic fragmented confusing and exclusionary. Many people cannot afford therapy and insurance often is not required to cover it. Wait lists for psychologists or psychiatrists can be months long.

While Silicon Valley companies aim to fill the gaps in these problematic systems they are often unsuccessful.

In the case of Uber recent studies suggest it increases traffic congestion. And workers begin to realize that their tenuous employment (which is not legally employment at all) is not worth it and protest or simply quit. Meanwhile it's unclear whether ride-sharing companies are even profitable despite their raised prices and market monopolization. And while Uber attempts to fill in where public transit fails it remains unaffordable for many.

We can see the same thing happening with the therapy apps: By using the gig-economy approach to labor these apps take advantage of working therapists trying to earn extra money or help more patients in their spare time by paying them far less than they are worth. Like Uber it's a stopgap solution for workers who aren't paid enough at their day jobs — and the lack of public services like transportation and healthcare in the US — and lets the companies off the hook from providing their workers the security of full-time employment with benefits. And like Uber it's already not going well: Talkspace went public last year and its stock has already plummeted to nearly a tenth of its original value; it's now facing a shareholder lawsuit.

If the companies are barely profitable with labor laws bent in their favor and while underpaying their workers and giving customers substandard service it's unclear how they can be sustainable if forced to pay fair wages and provide adequate services to their customers.

This is the darker side of the Silicon Valley model: Companies disrupt industries but often do not create a sustainable alternative in their place. And even as these businesses struggle they cause massive change in the industries in which they operate hurting customers and providers in the process.

It's too early to tell how disruptive apps like BetterHelp and Talkspace will be in the mental health industry but if the history of other Silicon Valley tech companies is any guide then many people — workers and patients — could get hurt along the way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvY2FtYnJpZGdlLXRheGktZHJpdmVyLXdlLWQtYmUtYmV0dGVyLW9mZi13aXRoLXViZXItdGhhbi1saS05MjM4NzI4L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWJyaWRnZWluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYW1wL2NhbWJyaWRnZS10YXhpLWRyaXZlci13ZS1kLWJlLWJldHRlci1vZmYtd2l0aC11YmVyLXRoYW4tbGktOTIzODcyOC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cambridge taxi driver: ‘We’d be better off with Uber than licensed through city council’,"A Cambridge taxi driver has suggested cabbies would “probably be better off working” for Uber than licensed through the city council.

He said the costs and regulations for a Hackney carriage licence made it harder to continue.

Speaking at the licensing committee on Monday (January 31) he pointed out that while more than 300 drivers were licensed by the council “thousands” of drivers were coming into the city through services such as Uber and Bolt.

A man in a taxi

He said: “Everything you are doing to us is putting onerous costs on us which is making it non-viable to be Hackney carriage vehicle drivers. I don’t understand why there is not a broader brush you must have some sway over who operates in Cambridge – you’re Cambridge City Council.”

The council’s environmental manager said the council could not stop drivers licensed elsewhere coming into the city due to national laws but that the authority is lobbying the government to change this.

The taxi driver added: “It seems like we are the ones paying and paying and jumping through higher and higher hoops just to keep a Hackney carriage vehicle licence.

“It’s getting to the stage soon where we might as well get a petrol or diesel car and log it on Uber or Bolt and run that and we would probably be better off.”

Ahmed Karaahmed the chairman of Cambridge City Licensed Taxis urged the council not to increase the number of Hackney carriage licences it makes available and to cut the licence fees.

He said: “At the start of the Covid outbreak in March 2020 our trade collapsed. The taxi trade has been hit hard with no or very little income for the last three years. It has been so bad that many drivers left the trade for good others were effectively put out of business for over a year.

“Things have now recovered a little bit but not to the former levels with footfall still very low. There is also a point that a large number of taxis are operating in Cambridge with an electronic hail system.

“The majority of those are not licensed by Cambridge City Council and therefore are not required to comply with the city’s very high standards of health and safety for taxi customers.

“The more expensive and difficult the city council makes it for its own licenced vehicles the more that taxi drivers will move to [be licensed] with other authorities and conduct their Hackney trade through an electronic hail system but using resident parking to wait instead of taxi ranks.

“These are not regulated by the city and would make the council’s policies self-defeating resulting in more taxis being hired in Cambridge that the city cannot control at all.”

Councillors told the drivers they agreed with their concerns and said they “are on the side of the city’s taxi drivers”.

They agreed to freeze the current licensing fees charged to taxi drivers and said they would write to Cambridge’s Labour MP Daniel Zeichner to highlight the issues.

Cllr Jocelynne Scutt (Lab West Chesterton) said: “We do actually care about taxis in Cambridge. They are central to the needs of many people. Taxis are also absolutely essential to the safety of women as well and are vital to this community.”

Special to The Dispatch

The Lane Avenue Shopping Center in Upper Arlington now known as the Shops on Lane Avenue was at one time the largest retail destination in Columbus outside of Downtown. It later became the premier place for upscale luxurious and gourmet gifts. (Think Valentine’s Day-caliber gifts: Diamonds chocolate champagne fountain pens cigars luggage and furs.)

And if you wanted a place to have a memorable dinner you would go there to The Blind Monk Peasant on the Lane or China Dynasty. Columbus wasn’t a global cuisine mecca but Lane Avenue had Delikatesa with Eastern European and Slavic fare served in a tearoom setting.

When the first phase opened in 1949 on what had been the Salzgaber Truck Gardens farm it was a strip center. In the 1980s it was renovated into an enclosed mall but is now back to its original strip design. While it operates more as a neighborhood mall instead of a regional one it is still focused on fashion.

Some early tenants were a Big Bear grocery The Union department store Isaly’s dairy Nicklaus Drugs the Lane Theatre and Lombards Furniture. Henry Feldman’s Cut-Up Poultry marketed to housewives by selling only the pieces and parts they really wanted.

The Market a food court with an atrium debuted in 1981. After renovations that included enclosing the mall with a walkway adding kiosks for specialty retailers and increasing the number of tenants from 61 to 100 another grand opening celebration was held in 1986. Popular stores included Little Professor Book Center The Mole Hole gift shop The Cookstore Larson’s Toys and Games Carnado Wine & Cheese and Woodhouse Lynch Clothiers.

Severe weather in the winter of 1994 damaged the center's roof and forced many businesses to close for weeks while repairs were made.

The mall became “open-air” again about 20 years ago and today's tenants include Whole Foods Market Bed Bath and Beyond Ulta Beauty and the Rusty Bucket Tavern.

There are 34 current tenants. Barclay Pipe & Tobacco which opened in 1980 has the longest tenure.

“I love the moisture. Having dry skin my whole life I’m biased to that category” Washington a Neutrogena ambassador recently told People. In case you didn’t know hyaluronic acid can hold up to a thousand times its weight in water making it a mega hydrator which explains why the Scandal star keeps her house stocked with it at all times.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

When the first images of Lily James as Pamela Anderson in Pam & Tommy dropped at the start of 2021 the fervent reaction matched the drama of the makeover itself. The British actress who got her big break in Downton Abbey no longer resembled the quintessential English Rose; she was suddenly indistinguishable from the blonde bombshell.

Like American Crime Story before it Pam & Tommy sought to shed light on a real-life ’90s news story that plugged a traumatic event into a lazy punchline for late-night hosts. While the very idea of Anderson and Tommy Lee Bass’s stolen sex tape titillated tabloids Anderson’s bodacious persona was the only argument needed for the tape to be released.

In a story so driven by objectification it was essential that James look the part for the series . “I think all of us equally wanted to celebrate Pam but also tell her story in the most accurate way we could” costume designer Kameron Lennox recently told ELLE.com when asked about the careful tap-dance between hair makeup and costume teams. Added hair department head Barry Lee Moe “My biggest thing was to bring humanity and life to a woman that is so iconic and to not make it a caricature of who she was.”

Painting a full picture of Anderson—from her public perception to her intimate whirlwind romance with Lee Bass—was intrinsic to making Pam & Tommy more than a suffix to its sleazy predecessors. Brought in for the job were recent Emmy winner Moe makeup department head David Williams special makeup effects designer Jason Collins and costume designer Lennox who each broke down for ELLE.com the four-hour process James undertook before stepping foot on set.

Below you'll find a transformation play-by-play—as well as an assortment of products the team used and recommend including hair and makeup must-haves and convincing dupes for the Lennox-sourced vintage pieces James sports throughout the series.

Curating a ’90s Wardrobe

When it came to assembling James’ costume closet Lennox stresses that every pick was meant to honor Anderson not satirize her. “We didn’t want to ever make fun of Pam” she says. “She did inspire a lot of fashion.” In fact whenever the team would shorten a skirt or alter a dress for James they devised a clever moniker: “We ‘Pammed’ it.”

The majority of the pieces Lennox sourced from vintage buyers and costume-house rentals though a few garments—including a sea-green suit James wears during a deposition scene—were stitched from scratch by Lennox’s cutter and fitter Lydia Jakubowski. Because the costume team didn’t have access to Anderson's archives Lennox was forced to lean hard on trend research from the era. Take for example episode 4 when an incognito Pam dons a pair of Hard Tail terry cloth sweats—a key detail considering this was pre-Juicy Couture era.

Still Lennox wanted to maintain some sense of timelessness about Anderson’s style given the superstar’s lasting impact on the cultural consciousness. Many of the brands James wears in the show are either long-term stalwarts of the runway or making modern comebacks: Jean Paul Gaultier Christian Dior and body con dresses by Mark Wong Nark (including one in bubblegum pink) reside in Pam’s closet beside Moschino and Chanel purses YSL platforms and Pleaser stilettos. “There are some golden eggs in there that are the real deal” Lennox says.

Go Big Go Blonde

Originally James considered dyeing her hair to match Anderson’s famous platinum blonde ’do but Moe says “We moved away from it quickly because it was going to be a lot of stress and maintenance.” Instead he tapped Los Angeles-based Wigmaker Associates to design four lace-front wigs to alternate throughout the production. “I was able to always have a rotation going to keep the hair healthy but also to prep things ahead of time because our shooting schedule was so fast-paced” Moe explains.

To ensure the wigs never looked like well wigs Moe sifted through a library of images to slowly style some of the looks though he admits he was aided by James’ commitment to the part. Referring to her as a “great hair actress” Moe adds “It was important to Lily to get her hands in there and play with her hair. That helped sell the piece as well because the hair is constantly moving.” Using vintage velcro rollers to set her waves Moe was able to give James the mountainous volume Anderson was known for.

Because James’ hairline was closer to her brows than the real-life Anderson's special makeup effects designer Collins and his company Autonomous FX  designed prosthetics to hide James's very 21st-century brows. Such a cover-up made room to add Anderson's own pencil-thin brows made of lace. Next Collins and his team developed an acrylic set of dentures to push out James's lip. “Lily wanted to keep them in all day” he says. “As a British actress she’s already battling an American accent. I think those teeth helped keep her in character and remind her about the accent.”

A Strong Foundation

“As I often say ‘A little paint will make you what you ain't” makeup artist Williams says while describing the four different rounds of makeup application James undertook each day. First came prosthetic makeup then corrective makeup using highlight and shadow next character makeup and finally “beauty makeup.” To poke fun at the time-consuming venture Williams gave each crew member a compact that featured a famous Anderson quote which speaks to the length of the process: “Natural beauty takes at least two hours in front of a mirror.""

The team fondly recalled how James used this daily routine to perfect her portrayal of the Baywatch star. “Every second she was practicing—even in the chair” Collins says. “Every second she was looking at interviews every second she was looking at the way Pam moved; all of those things are the only things that make a makeup and hair character successful.”

While since-discontinued makeup lines meant Williams didn’t have troves of ’90s cosmetics to choose from he was able to source a few staples including the MAC Cosmetics lip pencil in “Spice” as well as “Rose” and “Beige” lipsticks from the original Bobbi Brown 10. “Bobbi Brown set the trend of makeup in the early ’90s taking the war paint of the ’80s off and going for a very natural look for women” Williams says. His team also made use of contemporary products including Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk and Hermes lipsticks. To create Anderon’s perfect “peaches and cream” complexion Williams used Stila cream blushes in “Peony” and “Petunia.”



Recreating Baywatch



Giving James the same silhouette as Anderson required a prosthetic breastplate. “We did two or three different tests with three sculpts in order for it to look right at all angles and all perspectives” Collins says. Perhaps where this mattered most of all was when James slipped into Anderson's classic Baywatch swimsuit which notably has a visible sideboob: “It’s not one that gives us any room for error” Williams joked. Pressures were high as Lennox and her team worked to create the perfect scarlet one-piece. Little did they know quite how intense the spotlight would become when production launched.

On one life-imitates-art occasion the crew’s beach shooting location was surrounded by paparazzi hoping to get a shot of James in the red suit. Lennox spotted a photographer up a tree while Williams recalled another “on the hill up above Highway One the PCH highway and Malibu.” Perhaps the most extreme example was a cameraman who seemed to be cradling a baby while standing waist-deep in the ocean. “As soon as they called ‘action’ that man pulled that baby up and it was a long-lens camera” Moe says.

Erica Parise James in Anderson’s iconic Baywatch swimsuit.

While that shooting day was the most “nerve-wracking” for Williams Collins says there was still something gratifying about the feverish attention. Seeing the press’s reaction to James’ look confirmed that the costume hair and makeup teams were on the right path.

Lennox had started work on Pam & Tommy at the same time she was finishing Apple TV+’s ’80s aerobics dramedy Physical so she was already deep in a Norma Kamali-inspired sartorial headspace by the time she sat down to create Anderson’s one-piece. While watching re-runs of Baywatch she noticed each of the actresses wore a different design to complement their figures. For Anderson as C.J. the high French-cut sides and low bust were elements Lennox wanted to emulate. “The color red was a big thing too because it’s a very specific Baywatch red” she says. “We did source who made their original bathing suits and used that as a template for the correct red.”

An Uncanny Resemblance

The hair makeup and costuming teams first knew they succeeded while watching James film the opening scene of episode 1. Pam & Tommy’s opener begins with Anderson’s 1996 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and if audiences didn’t know better they might mistake the scene for archival footage. James as Anderson sports an over-the-top updo and vintage 1993 Versace stitched into a maternity fit for the sake of Pam & Tommy's (slightly) alternate timeline. Williams himself had worked on The Tonight Show during Leno’s tenure so it was essential to make Anderson’s appearance look as authentic as possible. “To be standing on that stage and feel like I was at the NBC studio watching Jay interview Pam” he says “it was truly one of my favorite moments. My worlds collided that day.”

And if you’re asking his co-collaborators—or hell anyone watching the series now—his efforts didn’t go unnoticed. “I feel like that was one of those days where that was Pam Anderson sitting in front of us and we ten-thousand-percent nailed it” Moe says. “The monitor shots we were taking that day even looking back at them now—it's uncanny.”

The ideal anti-aging skincare routine as experts note requires a good facial cleanser ample moisture afterwards and oils and acids to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

One mistake you might not realize you’re making with your skincare routine has to do with cleansing or toning. We spoke with holistic skin therapist Aryanna Denise and board-certified dermatologist Dr. Elyse Love MD FAAD for skincare advice and more information about a common mistake you might not realize can lead to premature aging.

How Over-Exfoliation Affects Aging Skin

""The biggest skincare mistake [in an anti-aging routine] is over-exfoliation"" says Denise. ""It is extremely easy to overdue this treatment."" For healthy skin she says that exfoliating once every 2 weeks is ""plenty.""

Over-exfoliation can come in the form of coarse or fine scrubs charcoal-rich textured cleansers rotating brushes etc. ""This leads to inflammation and skin texture changes which may lead to discomfort and even pain"" says Denise. The reason behind this reaction is because the epidermal barrier is being compromised.

""Skin cells are prematurely being worn off the surface"" Denise continues ""when the skin cell cycle should be between four and six weeks."" Harsh scrubbing and frequently drying out one's skin can lead to premature aging more apparent wrinkles and dull skin.

Facial cleansers Denise adds should be gentle and perfume-free applied with soft cotton and rinsed with warm or cool water. ""Exfoliate seldomly as needed to unclog pores not often"" says Denise.

Don't Over-Exfoliate With Toner

While it is possible that you are over-exfoliating your skin through the cleansing step you could also be using the wrong toner for your skin type. This is another mistake according to Love that could lead to premature aging. ""Toners can hydrate or exfoliate depending on which ingredients are used"" Love explains.

Dry skin types she says will prefer a hydrating toner and those with oilier skin may prefer an exfoliating toner ""if they're not exfoliating"" in another step of the routine. ""It’s important to not over-exfoliate by including exfoliating ingredients in multiple steps in the routine"" Love says pointing out how this is easy to do with toner.

For dry skin she recommends a toner like the Murad Hydrating Toner and for oily skin she suggests a toner like the Good Molecules Glycolic Exfoliating Toner (both can be found at Ulta Beauty stores).

Love notes that people with combination skin will likely prefer a hydrating toner but they may choose to use an exfoliating toner only on the t-zone area. ""It’s an easy way to control oil production on the t-zone without irritating the drier cheeks especially this time of year with cold weather temperatures"" says Love.

As both skincare experts explain it's important not to over-exfoliate your skin in your daily routine (whether through cleansing or toning) since doing so can lead to premature aging and more noticeable wrinkles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYXBwaS5jb20vY29udGVudHMvdmlld19icmVha2luZy1uZXdzLzIwMjItMDUtMDIvdG9uaS1icmF4dG9ucy1udWRlLXN1Z2FyLXZlZ2FuLXNraW5jYXJlLXBpY2tzLXBhcnRuZXItZm9yLW9taW5pY2hhbm5lbC1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toni Braxton's Nude Sugar Vegan Skincare Picks Partner for Omnichannel Expansion,"Grammy Award-winning singer actress and beauty entrepreneur Toni Braxton has partnered with Accelerate360 to support the growth of TMB Beauty her beauty business which includes Nude Sugar  a vegan skincare line specifically for the body and Breathe fragrance Accelerate360 provides brands and retailers omnichannel fulfillment and third-party logistics (3PL) solutions along with marketing and content opportunities through its media group A360 Media the parent company of Us Weekly and the UsNow.com Shop which opened in April.Accelerate360 will manage TMB Beauty's Ulta distribution and offer 3PL and retail fulfillment services with other national and regional chains.

Founded in 1862 Union Pacific Railroad is one of the largest as well as the longest-tenured railroad operator in the entire North America. This freight-hauling railroad currently operates 8300 locomotives over 32200 miles of routes in nearly two dozen states of Western US.

Eager to reduce its carbon footprint the American railroad operator published its first Climate Action Plan in December last year. In the Climate Action Plan the company outlined its efforts to trim down carbon emissions throughout its operations by switching from conventional locomotives to electric locomotives. As part of its Climate action plan the railroad aims to reduce carbon footprint by 26 per cent by the end of current decade and achieve totally zero emissions by 2050.

The purchase of 10 FLXDrive electric locomotives from manufacturer and freight company Wabtec Corporation and another 10 from Progress Rail (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.) is part of those efforts. Releasing the news of the second purchase of electric locomotives Union Pacific also outlined its huge investment in battery freight technology to gradually achieve a zero-emissions future.

Once all the ordered electric locomotives are delivered Union Pacific will likely have the world’s largest carrier-owned battery-electric locomotive fleet. Lance Fritz Chairman and CEO of Union Pacific said the huge investment showed the company’s commitment to reduce its environmental footprint.

Speaking on the topic Fritz said “We’re committed to actions that reduce Union Pacific’s environmental footprint as we work toward our ultimate goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. These investments will contribute to further developing this important technology and providing industry-wide benefits.”

Progress Rail’s EMD Joule is a 118.1 ton electric locomotive switcher with an available battery capacity between 1.9-2.4 MWh. It boasts a nominal power of up to 3000 hp and a run time of up to 24 hours on a single charge. The Wabtec FLXDrive is quite similar in capacity. Both electric locomotives will be manufactured in the U.S.

Wabtec is expected to start delivering the FLXDrives electric locomotives to Union Pacific in late 2023 while Progress Rail will do the same sometime in 2024. All the twenty electric locomotives will be used in rail yards in California and Nebraska.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Leeds man has been left angry after a postman pushed his fragile parcel over his gate.

Michael Hamill who lives in Harehills Leeds was 'disgusted' by the actions of the delivery man and believes it chipped the 'irreplaceable' ashtray inside.

Michael and his wife Sara Shepherd caught the delivery man on camera shoving the parcel over the high gate.

Michael told LeedsLive: ""He could have left a card in the letterbox. It said fragile huge on the package.

""I was livid that they just pushed it over a gate. He only waited a couple of seconds after knocking to do it. I was so excited about getting them and it was heartbreaking to open the package and them be ruined.

""We're disappointed at Royal Mail's response when we sent them all the evidence and they said 'we don't know how this has happened'.""

The footage shows the postman coming up to the gate of Michael's house on January 7 this year.

Just a few second's after arriving and knocking the postman pushes the parcel over the gate where it falls to the floor on the other side.

It contained two antique ashtrays Michael had bought off eBay which he said are worth around £100 worth in good condition.

He is a collector of antique ashtrays from the 1940s and 50s but now the most recent one is chipped.

Michael sent a complaint to Royal Mail about how the parcel was handled and said he included the footage and photos in the complaint.

(Image: Michael Hamill)

Royal Mail responded to Michael and said it was sorry to hear about the damage to the item.

Royal Mail wrote: ""My investigations into your enquiry have included checking all available service information and I cannot identify any reason why this problem occurred.

""Due to the millions of pieces of mail that pass through our massive postal pipeline each day I am sorry that I cannot say where when or how the item was damaged.

""Mechanical handling and the weight of other mail can sometimes cause damage but we do everything possible to prevent mail arriving in poor condition.""

As compensation Michael was sent six first class stamps.

Royal Mail said that to compensate the value of the item they would need images of the original inner packaging as well as proof of the item's value and the service used.

The package had been marked fragile and was packed with bubble-wrap to help protect it against ordinary knocks during transit.

Sara tweeted that she was ""disgusted at the response"" to Michael's complaint prompting a further response on Twitter from Royal Mail who Sara said then just directed Michael to the same complaints portal as before.

Michael has a letterbox next to his gate that attempted parcel delivery notifications can be pushed through.

A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “Royal Mail expects the highest standards of behaviour from our people while out on deliveries and collections at all times.

""We regularly remind our postmen and postwomen of the important role they play in their local communities.

""We would like to apologise to the customer concerned and will be getting in touch with them directly to discuss the matter further.”

Lake Tahoe straddles the border of California and Nevada which divides it from east to west but it’s also divided from north to south. North Lake Tahoe offers a laidback relaxed vibe while South Lake is all about the nightlife and casinos.

What they have in common is the glittering blue waters of the 25000-year-old lake for which the area is named. Renowned for its crystal-clear waters Lake Tahoe boasts some of the purest waters in North America. It is one of the largest Alpine lakes in the country and the second deepest behind Oregon’s Crater Lake. High in the Sierra Nevadas the mesmerizing lake is surrounded by a panoramic backdrop of snow-capped mountains and sugar pines.

This picturesque playground makes for the perfect place for watersports fishing boating and other summertime activities. Of course Lake Tahoe is also known as a winter retreat thanks to several area ski resorts. If you do visit during ski season we recommend driving an all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive vehicle with good snow tires. High elevations mean steep inclines and roads can get extremely icy and slippery.

From lakefront lodges to cozy cabins Vrbo offers some stellar mountain retreats. We’ve done all the work for you so now you can just sit back and scroll through these top-rated Lake Tahoe vacation rentals.

The house and location right on the water were AMAZING. We couldnt believe how beautiful Lake Tahoe is. The house was large and extremely well stocked. The one thing that was unpleasant about the house was how hot it could get at certain times of the day. Fans helped but had i know i would have brought small portable AC units for certain rooms at night. My daughters room was a sweltering 85 degrees one night despite all efforts. One other concern was that there was not a safe way to get down to the beach for my elderly parents. A sturdy set of steps with a railing would have been much appreciated not just a pile of loose rocks with a chain for a handrail. For the cost of staying here i feel like these issues could be easily addressed and would make for a better experience overall. The house was stunning and absolutely perfect for our family of 12. Would highly recommend this home to anyone! Property was clean and beautiful in an excellent location. Great place to stay. Amazing lake house. From the several outdoor sitting areas to just hanging out on the dock this property is just perfect. 3 families gathered where we bque sat on dock watching sunset sunrise and moonrise rented a boat and even woke up and did yoga on the beautiful deck. Couldn’t have imagined a better gathering place. Thank you Susan! Beautiful home in an ideal location right on the water. And there was enough room for all 4 families. Also many supplies in the kitchen that we did not need to purchase at the store so that helped.

We booked this property for a 50th wedding anniversary celebration six months in advance and the whole family was looking forward to it with great anticipation. Not only did it not disappoint it exceeded our expectations! Check in and check out were easy the hosts were friendly the view and lake access were incomparable the beds were comfortable the kitchen was well appointed and everywhere you look you see attention to detail and the love of its owners shining through. A joy and a delight! Would return in a heartbeat. Beautiful property with wonderful lake access. Incredibly well-stocked kitchen made it easy to cook fantastic meals that we enjoyed on the deck overlooking the lake. Kind hosts responded immediately when the barbecue needed additional propane. Plentiful towels and great to be able to use kayaks and paddle boards. We loved our trip overall. The only drawback for us was being right next door to a boatyard/marina. We heard heavy equipment lifting boats off racks as early as 6am most days. Then the equipment and boat traffic was present all day when reading on the dock.

And superficially at least it’s easy to see why. Critics of the current model for one thing do tend to envision a larger role for the state in the provision of health care. The decades-long campaign against a universal and public model meanwhile has regularly framed the question as one of personal liberty: pitching the market as an institution better suited to protect patient choice and save taxpayers from having to fund more cumbersome government bureaucracy.

“Personal freedom vs. costly government bureaucracy” it should be said is a rhetorically effective framing — among the many reasons that America’s sprawling private health insurance racket has been able to beat back so many attempts at reform. Spend any real time investigating what the landscape of American health care looks like however and you’ll quickly see that it’s bunk: the market model is in fact a complicated and at times totally inscrutable morass of profit-seeking underwritten no less by the very public dollars its proponents claim to be saving.

It’s a point made forcefully by author and reform advocate Wendell Potter in a series of recent posts on his Substack detailing the profit breakdowns of insurance giants like UnitedHealth and Anthem. Potter himself a former executive at Cigna turned whistleblower notes that UnitedHealth boasted more profits last year than any health insurer has ever made for its shareholders — citing a chirpy company release that also boasted of 10.5 million new “members” using its health plans since 2011.

Beneath these profits and this growth however Potter reveals an altogether murkier and less sunny picture of how UnitedHealth’s business model actually works. The company it turns out is actually insuring over a million fewer people through its commercial risk division (through which it is itself the direct provider) than it did in 2011. The number of plans it now administers on behalf of employers and other groups however has surged over the past decade. As Potter explains:

United and its competitors do not insure people enrolled in these group plans. They make money by charging their employer (and in some cases union) customers (who are the actual insurers) a hefty fee to administer their workers’ health plan benefits.

The kicker is that 94 percent of the company’s total membership growth since 2011 has actually come through government programs. The upshot?

When you do just a little more math you’ll discover that 72 percent of the $222.9 billion in revenue United’s health plan division took in last year came from you and me through the taxes we fork over to our Uncle Sam and the additional premiums many Medicare beneficiaries pay the company to cover their out-of-pocket expenses. Considering all of that it’s neither accurate nor appropriate to refer to United and its peers as insurers or for that matter as “payers” (except in the sense that they use our employers’ and our Uncle Sam’s money to pay doctors and hospitals for treating us).

In short ordinary Americans are underwriting the health insurance industry’s growing profits all while paying far more for their plans than they used to. It’s yet another reminder that what is generally called America’s “health care system” is in practice a series of elaborate mechanisms for transferring money upward to shareholders — and for ensuring that a basic human need remains subordinate to private profit.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But for children and young people who have been in care the situation is even more dire.

Looked-after children are already at significantly higher risk of experiencing poor mental health than their peers. Despite there only being 67 children in care for every 10000 these individuals make up 24% of the prison population and 25% of the homeless population in the UK. What’s more as stated in a recent report by the children’s rights campaign Hope Instead of Handcuffs young people who have spent time in care are significantly more likely than their peers to find themselves classified as not in education employment or training.

We have yet to see fully how these statistics will be impacted by the pandemic. But for “care-experienced” children who often don’t have the same support networks as their peers the months of isolation are likely to have exacted a heavy toll. Any policies to improve mental health among young people must provide specific provision for those in care. We cannot keep allowing them to slip through the cracks and have poorer life outcomes just because they have spent time in care.

Your report highlights the worrying effects of the Covid lockdowns. But it is also a symptom of 12 years of underfunding of child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) which have been overwhelmed for many years. This leads to crisis management for life-threatening situations and leaves many children with worsening symptoms without support.

Domestic violence and parental mental illness play a big part in causing children to suffer emotionally. These factors will only increase as the cost-of-living crisis cuts to universal credit and higher energy bills pile more pressure on struggling vulnerable families. The government must provide more financial and social support to families if it is serious about protecting children and young people.

Está a punto de comenzar a fabricar uno de los coches más espectaculares que ha creado en los últimos años el Daytona SP3. Además también está terminando el desarrollo del Purosangue que podríamos llegar a conocer por fin este mismo 2022 y en 2021 ha batido todos los récords de ventas anteriores registrando su mejor año hasta el momento.

El año pasado Ferrari vendió nada menos que 11.155 coches un 101% más que en 2019 y 2.032 coches más que en 2020. Esto supuso que Ferrari ganara 833 millones de euros un aumento importante frente a 2020 que registró unos ingresos de 534 millones de euros con un EBITDA (Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. En castellano beneficio antes de intereses impuestos depreciación y amortización) de 4.300 millones 800 más que en 2020.

China un mercado en constante crecimiento

Uno de los motivos para este crecimiento de Ferrari tiene que ver con los buenos resultado de venta en China donde casi se duplican las ventas al aumentar un 97% com 899 vehículos. No obstante la región de Europa Oriente Medio y África que sigue siendo su principal mercado aumentó sus ventas en un 14% respecto a 2020 con 5.492 entregas y América copó 2.831 coches un 22% más.

“Nuestros resultados financieros récord de 2021 demuestran una vez más la fortaleza de nuestro modelo de negocio” dijo Benedetto Vigna CEO de Ferrari. ""Gestionamos cuidadosamente una entrada de pedidos impresionante en línea con nuestra estrategia para buscar un crecimiento controlado y preservar la exclusividad de la marca. Registramos un crecimiento de dos dígitos en todos los principales indicadores financieros que superan nuestra guía"".

Los modelos V8 los más populares

Ferrari

Si miramos las cifras por modelos veremos que las ventas de los modelos con motor V8 como los Ferrari F8 Tributo o Ferrari Roma aumentaron sus ventas en un 346% mientras que los grandes V12 experimentaron una caída del 16%. Ferrari lo achaca al “reducido volumen” del Ferrari 812 Superfast el cual ya no está a la venta.

Por otro lado la marca también comenta que se esperaban que las entregas de los Monza SP1 y SP2 fueran a más en comparación con 2020 (ambos también han dejado de fabricarse ya) aunque los nuevos SF90 y Portofino M experimentaron un aumento de las entregas con una producción en pleno apogeo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yLmVzL25vdGljaWFzL3ZlbnRhcy1jb2NoZXMtMjAyMS1lc3RhZG9zLXVuaWRvcy0yMDIyODQ3MjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ventas coches - Estados Unidos - 2021: Toyota destrona a GM,"El mercado automovilístico estadounidense ha sido capaz de cerrar en positivo el convulso 2021.

Las ventas de coches en Estados Unidos acumularon un total de 15.060.287 unidades un 33% más que en 2020.

Más allá de la solvencia del mercado estadounidense para lidiar y capear la crisis por falta de semiconductores en 2021 se ha producido un hecho que podemos definir de histórico. Y es que Toyota ha terminado con el reinado de General Motors. Un reinado de 90 años que ha terminado gracias al crecimiento del 104% de Toyota Motor Group mientras que General Motors vio caer sus cifras de ventas un 131% respectivamente.

Ford y más concretamente su Serie F lidera con puño de hierro la categoría. Sin embargo sus cifras de ventas han caído a un nivel no visto desde 2012.

El gobierno cubano inició la venta a plazos de artículos electrodomésticos en La Habana con precios superiores a los 2500 pesos informó la prensa oficial.

De acuerdo con un reporte del diario Granma en las dos tiendas habilitadas para este tipo de ventas se ofertan también camas muebles colchones y bicicletas.

El Ministerio de Comercio Interior (MINCIN) dijo que hasta el momento solo hay dos establecimientos que suscriben esta forma de venta: uno ubicado en la Avenida de Diez de Octubre entre Dolores y Concepción y el otro en el capitalino municipio del Cotorro en la esquina a 101 y 20.

La ministra del sector Betsy Díaz Velázquez afirmó que se trata de ""una modalidad comercial pensada para el beneficio de la población con menos posibilidades económicas que puede adquirir el artículo con pagos a plazo"".

Esta cobró fuerza luego de las protestas antigubernamentales del 11 de julio en la isla con el objetivo de apaciguar a la desencantada población cubana.

La Resolución 98/2021 firmada el 20 de julio de 2021 una semana después de las manifestaciones establece como beneficiarios de estas prestaciones a los ciudadanos cubano con domicilio permanentemente en el país; mayores de 18 años y con capacidad legal y de pago para concertar obligaciones.

Sin embargo estos locales han recibido decenas de críticas de la población por sus altos precios y la mala calidad de los productos en su mayoría fabricados por trabajadores por cuenta propia cooperativas no agropecuarias Mipymes el Fondo de Bienes Culturales y otras empresas pertenecientes al MINCIN.

El rotativo señala que el pago de los artículos puede realizarse tanto en dinero en efectivo como por vía electrónica a través de las aplicaciones Transfermóvil y EnZona.

Pero los precios superan los 2.500 pesos cubanos cifra superior al salario mínimo de Cuba que es de 2.100 pesos y algunos artículos han llegado a costar más de 34.000 pesos.

Los interesados en algún producto deben poseer ingresos demostrables fijos y regulares avalados señala la publicación.

En octubre del pasado año cubanos residentes en la provincia de Pinar del Río criticaron los altos precios de los artículos en el nuevo departamento de comercialización de pagos a plazos inaugurado en la tienda Sensación.

El actor y director teatral Nelson Álvarez Guerra posteó en su muro de Facebook imágenes de los productos a la venta con desorbitados precios que superan el salario mínimo de 2100 pesos.

""Algo no anda bien"" dijo y se preguntó si ""el trabajo de una persona en Cuba es tan subvalorado cuando su salario es inferior o similar al precio de productos de dudosa calidad y gusto estético"".

En provincias como Ciego de Ávila algunos precios superaron los 34.000 pesos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmFubWEuY3UvY3ViYS8yMDIyLTAyLTA1L2VzdGFibGVjZW4tcGFnby1kZWwtaW1wdWVzdG8tc29icmUtbGFzLXZlbnRhcy1wb3ItbGEtY29tZXJjaWFsaXphY2lvbi1taW5vcmlzdGEtZGUtcHJvZHVjdG9zLWFncm9wZWN1YXJpb3MtMDUtMDItMjAyMi0wOS0wMi0yOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Establecen pago del Impuesto sobre las Ventas por la comercialización minorista de productos agropecuarios,"La aplicación de un impuesto sobre las ventas minoristas con un tipo impositivo a las personas naturales y jurídicas que comercialicen productos agropecuarios de forma minorista fue aprobado y hecho público a través de la Resolución 16/2022 del Ministerio de Finanzas y Precios includida en la Gaceta Oficial de la República.

El Gobierno cubano aprobó impuestos que van del 10% a un 1% a las ventas minoristas de productos agrícolas y que compete tanto a las personas naturales como jurídicas comercializadoras en distintos espacios diseñados para el comercio en el país.

Dicha fuente subraya que se “exime del pago del Impuesto sobre las Ventas la comercialización minorista de los productos agropecuarios normados con destino a dietas médicas cuyos precios se establecen por este Ministerio”.

La legislación se aprueba en el momento de mayor inflación en la Isla tras la aplicación de la llamada tarea ordenamiento. Luego de la entrada en vigor de este proceso económico se han incrementado considerablemente los precios de los alimentos en el país y del costo de vida y se ha devaluado a niveles históricos el valor del peso cubano frente al dólar y el euro entre otras divisas.

El ministro de Economía Alejandro Gil consideró que la inflación responde a factores externos como la pandemia en el mundo y el recrudecimiento del bloqueo de Estados Unidos contra la Isla desde que Donald Trump llegó al poder y que su sucesor Joe Biden no ha modificado indicó la agencia española Efe."

International condemnation quickly follows but the junta remains in power.

West Africa's new wave of coups kicked off in Mali in 2020 followed by another in Guinea the next year and then Burkina Faso late last month. Just a week later gunmen also tried to overthrow the president of Guinea-Bissau in a machine-gun attack that lasted hours but failed.

Military power grabs are nothing new in the region: There have been nearly 100 in West Africa since 1946 but they dropped off over the past decade. Now the Economic Community of West African States a regional body known as ECOWAS is grappling with how to bring about a return to democracy in three of its 15 member states where juntas have seized power in the last 18 months.

""It looks increasingly hard to argue against the idea of coup contagion — that coups in one place inspire them in another — following the chain of events in the past year"" said Eric Humphery-Smith Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft a global risk consulting firm based in England.

The new spike in power grabs comes as the Sahel the vast region south of the Sahara Desert faces growing violence from Islamist extremists which in turn has caused people to turn against elected governments in both Mali and Burkina Faso. Neighbouring Niger hard-hit by Islamic insurgents has also been vulnerable — with security forces stopping a coup attempt there last year.

WATCH | Mali coup prompts concerns about regional stability: Mali’s military coup prompts concern about regional stability international condemnation Duration 2:06 A military coup has left the West African nation of Mali teetering on the brink of chaos. Canada has joined a chorus of international condemnation and there is grave concern about stability in the region.

""Coups in West Africa have been making a comeback for various reasons which bleed into one another"" said Rukmini Sanyal research analyst for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Regional political volatility is becoming entrenched causing a slow erosion of democratic gains she said adding there's often widespread support for the government overthrows within the countries because people hope it will bring about new elections.

Some coups welcomed

After last week's coup in Burkina Faso people across the country lauded the military takeover saying it was overdue. In Mali thousands of protesters took to the streets in support of the ruling military after ECOWAS imposed sanctions over delayed elections.

Guinea's junta has also benefited from the fact that ousted president Alpha Condé had become deeply unpopular because he sought to circumvent term limits and won a third term.

Governance and rule of law institutions are weak in many countries in the region said Corinne Dufka West Africa director at Human Rights Watch.

Armed soldiers move on the main artery of Bissau the capital of Guinea-Bissau after heavy gunfire occurred around the presidential palace on Tuesday. (Reuters)

""And when societies are tested by insecurity and profound brutality against civilians it may make some people more willing to accept less democratic military rule"" Dufka said.

Some blame the rise in coups on the fact that the juntas know they'll face little more than strongly worded statements. In Mali Col. Assimi Goita got West African mediators to accept an 18-month transition instead of the year-long one they requested.

Since then he's carried out a second coup by getting rid of the original civilian leaders in his transitional government and made himself president instead. He's since pushed back new elections four more years. While ECOWAS has imposed tough economic sanctions Goita shows few signs of leaving power any time soon.

'Devastates the whole region'

Ghana's president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo the current chair of ECOWAS called Thursday on his fellow leaders to address the problem of coups ""collectively and decisively before it devastates the whole region.""

Critics though say the regional body needs to do more than issue statements.

""ECOWAS is a reflection of the countries so it means that as far as governance is concerned they have to improve it in each country and in all the regional or global organizations"" said Ablassé Ouedraogo a former foreign affairs minister in Burkina Faso and president of the political party Faso Differently.

Civil society groups say leaders are struggling to meet basic security and governance expectations of their populations creating a breeding ground for coups and that regional bodies like ECOWAS and the African Union are quickly losing credibility.

""These institutions act more on the consequences than on the causes of the sociopolitical crises that lead to coups"" said Chrysogone Zougmoré president of the Burkina Faso Movement for Human Rights.

Meanwhile aid groups responding to the dire humanitarian needs across the region say pulling people out of crisis will take time no matter who's in power. Hassane Hamadou director of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Burkina Faso said new dismal records are being broken every month.

""Violence has claimed the lives of around 3000 civilians forced thousands of schools to shut down and driven 1.6 million people into displacement a jaw-dropping 18-fold increase over the past three years"" Hamadou said. ""In this context there can be no quick fix nor easy answer.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Verizon’s payment program FAQ page explains that there isn’t any interest attached to the 36-month plan and you can choose to pay off the phone in full whenever you want.

Considerable amenities are being planned for the new building according to the project proposal. The project will feature ample at-grade courtyard space along with a highline connecting the building to a garage.

Roku a streaming titan is a tenant in several buildings in Coleman Highline. Roku has leased about 800000 square feet. Roku has moved some employees into the space it leased. Yahoo through a deal struck by its former owner Verizon is a tenant in multiple buildings that total roughly 658000 square feet. Verizon is attempting to sublease some of that space although Yahoo has begun to move some employees into the building.

The office building will sprout just west of the city’s international airport on a 4.5-acre site. The developers plan to begin construction in summer 2022.

WASHINGTON — A die-hard Capitals fan is being recognized for her effort to help her favorite team that was caught on video.

Back in December a video made the rounds on social media showing Capitals All-Star right wing Tom Wilson getting his stick stuck in a slim space between the glass boards. A fan jumps into action and is seen using her phone to try to hammer the stick free. Maybe not the best move. She smashed her screen in the effort before Wilson skated free.

The original video posted by Caroline McCain received more than 1200 likes. Now months later she's being recognized for her sacrifice.

The Capitals said Caroline got the hookup from Verizon for a new phone and she was also gifted a signed Tom Wilson stick and a custom Capitals Jersey.

""Your All-Star effort did not go unnoticed Caroline!"" the team tweeted.

As a Humanitarian he continued to advocate for a fair justice system through civic and political engagement.

As a Renowned Entrepreneur Bro. Ike was a tailor wood carver hat maker and jewelry designer. Most recently Bro. Ike was call “the Copper Man” as he traveled throughout the U.S. vending at various festivals. Of all the gifts that Isaac was blessed with his family was his greatest blessing and love. To connect with them by phone face time and visits was one of his greatest joys. The love of his life Alfreda gave him years of consistent love and compassion; they were inseparable. Together Bro. Ike and Sis. Alfreda bought awareness to social justice issues throughout Hampton Roads. Bro. Ike loved History and shared it with anyone who would listen; often quoting the Honorable Marcus Garvey “ A People without the knowledge of their past history origin and culture is like a tree without roots.” He loved gathering with the Drummers where he would often play the Shakere in the Drum Circle.

He was 65.

Ransom was heading north on Interstate 880 in Oakland when his car crashed into the guardrail Friday night just after 5 p.m. prompting an investigation.

By Saturday morning a San Francisco man was in custody for Ransom’s killing.

Juan Angel Garcia 25 was arrested around 10 a.m. the California Highway Patrol said. The motive for the shooting is under investigation ABC7’s Bay Area affiliate reported.

The 5-foot-9 Ransom scored at least 30 points in a game multiple times for the Golden Bears led the team in assists during his three seasons there and once in 1977 played 63.5 minutes and scored 36 points in a five-overtime win over Oregon according to Sports Illustrated.

“He did things at his size that other guys couldn’t do” former teammate Ruppert Jones told SI. “He was able to compete with players much larger than him because had the ability to create space. He was a great ballhandler he could shoot and he was fearless.”

Ransom’s death is one of several freeway shootings plaguing the area: last month a sheriff’s recruit was shot and killed driving home from the police academy and in November two people including a toddler were killed while traveling on the freeway KPIX reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL2V0aGVsLW1jbmVpbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzA0MjgyNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethel McNeil Obituary (2022) - Norfolk VA - The Virginian-Pilot,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/ethel-mcneil-obituary?id=33042825 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxvdG9ubGluZS9uYW1lL2V0aGVsLW1jbmVpbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzA0MjgyNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvMjAyMi8wMi8wNi9veGZvcmQtaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtc2hvb3RpbmctYm95cy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWdhbWUvNjY3NjU4OTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oxford High School boys basketball's first home game since shooting brings smiles back,"Your subscription supports:

Founded in 1862 Union Pacific Railroad is one of the largest as well as the longest-tenured railroad operator in the entire North America. This freight-hauling railroad currently operates 8300 locomotives over 32200 miles of routes in nearly two dozen states of Western US.

Eager to reduce its carbon footprint the American railroad operator published its first Climate Action Plan in December last year. In the Climate Action Plan the company outlined its efforts to trim down carbon emissions throughout its operations by switching from conventional locomotives to electric locomotives. As part of its Climate action plan the railroad aims to reduce carbon footprint by 26 per cent by the end of current decade and achieve totally zero emissions by 2050.

The purchase of 10 FLXDrive electric locomotives from manufacturer and freight company Wabtec Corporation and another 10 from Progress Rail (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.) is part of those efforts. Releasing the news of the second purchase of electric locomotives Union Pacific also outlined its huge investment in battery freight technology to gradually achieve a zero-emissions future.

Once all the ordered electric locomotives are delivered Union Pacific will likely have the world’s largest carrier-owned battery-electric locomotive fleet. Lance Fritz Chairman and CEO of Union Pacific said the huge investment showed the company’s commitment to reduce its environmental footprint.

Speaking on the topic Fritz said “We’re committed to actions that reduce Union Pacific’s environmental footprint as we work toward our ultimate goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. These investments will contribute to further developing this important technology and providing industry-wide benefits.”

Progress Rail’s EMD Joule is a 118.1 ton electric locomotive switcher with an available battery capacity between 1.9-2.4 MWh. It boasts a nominal power of up to 3000 hp and a run time of up to 24 hours on a single charge. The Wabtec FLXDrive is quite similar in capacity. Both electric locomotives will be manufactured in the U.S.

Wabtec is expected to start delivering the FLXDrives electric locomotives to Union Pacific in late 2023 while Progress Rail will do the same sometime in 2024. All the twenty electric locomotives will be used in rail yards in California and Nebraska.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Photo courtesy of Cost Plus Drug Company. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has launched a new online pharmacy that offers more than 100 generic medications.

Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company offers the products at what company officials say is a fraction of costs that consumers currently pay.

The online pharmacy does not accept insurance so it’s a cash-payment venture.

A consumer advocate points out however that the new online pharmacy so far has no limited options and doesn’t offer brand name drugs. Mark Cuban is feeling disruptive. Again. This time he’s got his sights set on the cost of prescription drugs. Cuban the billionaire investor owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and panelist on the television show “Shark Tank” has launched an online pharmacy for generic medications. The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company will give consumers substantial discounts on various medicines according to the company’s website. “Not everyone sets the goal of being the lowest cost producer and provider” Cuban told Axios. “My goal” Cuban added “is to make a profit while maximizing impact.”

How it will work Cuban says Cost Plus Drug which will compete with such pharmacy giants as Rite Aid Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp. is organized to eliminate pharmacy benefit managers from the equation. Those are the people who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of large employers health insurers and others. These middle managers are considered the quiet lesser-known partner in the pharmaceutical model. They’ve been criticized for what critics say is a lack of transparency about the rebates they receive and for keeping a large portion of cost savings from consumers. Cuban’s company’s refusal to pay spread prices to third-party pharmacy benefit managers prohibits it from processing insurance claims. So the online pharmacy is a cash-payment venture. Consumers will have access to more than 100 generic medications at prices Cost Plus Drug officials say are often less than what insurance plans’ deductible and copay requirements would total. Cuban says he wants to bring transparency to the generic drug pricing process and pass on a greater percentage of the savings to the customers. The company will buy directly from third-party suppliers and soon manufacture its own products. An $11 million 22000-square-foot factory in Dallas is expected to be ready to roll by the end of the year. The company will sell at a discount with a 15 percent markup plus a $3 pharmacist fee.

A consumer advocate responds Lucia Mueller is vice president of operations and communications at PharmacyChecker a company that helps people find the lowest prices on prescription medication among licensed U.S. and international pharmacies. They describe themselves as the only independent company monitoring and verifying the credentials of international online pharmacies and comparing prices of the prescription drugs available from these licensed pharmacies. Mueller works to promote online access to safe and affordable medications and educate and warn consumers about the risks of rogue online pharmacy websites. “Cuban’s supposed aim to cut out middlemen and lower medication costs is a worthy pursuit given the very dire consequences of high healthcare costs in this country” Mueller told Healthline. “People are completely forgoing their drug therapies due to high costs. “Unfortunately” she added “Cuban’s new venture currently only gives price relief for certain generic drugs so patients are still locked outside in the cold when it comes to brand drugs.” Mueller noted that users of the PharmacyChecker website are mainly scrambling to find affordable brand name medicines that do not yet have a generic counterpart available in the United States. “The price differential of Januvia 100 milligrams ordered internationally versus bought in the U.S. is striking” she said. “The highly popular GoodRx coupon will get you 30 tablets for around $530. And the U.S. coupon will get you the same for around $496” Mueller explained. “But the price for the same amount from Turkey is just $40.70 from Canada $150” she noted. “Brand drugs that are the highest burden on patient’s finances like Januvia and Eliquis are nowhere to be found on Cuban’s site.”

How Cost Plus Drug got started Cost Plus Drug represents the evolution of Osh Affordable Pharmaceuticals founded by Dr. Alex Oshmyansky a radiologist who told Cuban about his concept. “I met Mark in a cold email that I sent to him on a whim” Oshmyanksy told Healthline. “He is a genuinely good dude who likes people.” Oshmyansky started that first company as a nonprofit to help people who could not afford their prescription drugs. “I had seen enough patients have bad health outcomes and could not afford their medicines” he said. Cuban was impressed with Oshmyanksy’s pitch and agreed to support him. He changed the company name and hired Oshmyanski as the CEO. Share on Pinterest Dr. Alex Oshmyansky CEO of the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company Cost Plus Drug as a public benefit corporation is required to produce one or more public benefits and to operate responsibly and sustainably. “We will do whatever it takes to get affordable pharmaceuticals to patients” Oshmyansky said in a press statement. “The markup on potentially lifesaving drugs that people depend on is a problem that can’t be ignored. It is imperative that we take action and help expand access to these medications for those who need them most” he added.

Up and running Cost Plus Drug is already in business as an online pharmacy selling more than 100 medications including for asthma heart failure and Parkinson’s disease to mental health allergies and cancer. Although insurance is not accepted Oshmyanksy says the price of the drugs is still less than what people pay even with insurance. For example the company sells imatinib the generic cancer drug for Gleevec for $17.10. The consumer saves $2485.40 Oshmyansky says. Cuban is also bringing the digital healthcare company Truepill on board to make the process seamless and assure a secure e-commerce experience as customers navigate the pharmacy’s website. Since Cost Plus Drug deals only with generic drugs that could limit its influence to some degree. In the United States 9 out of 10 prescriptions filled are for generic drugs according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However a generic drug can be marketed only after the brand-name drug’s patent has expired taking up to 20 years after the patent holder’s drug is first filed with the FDA.",,,,,,,,,,,,
WMT,Walmart,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlubWFyaWNvcGEuY29tL3Byb3Bvc2VkLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LW5lYXItd2FsbWFydC1jaGFuZ2VzLWNvdXJzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Proposed development near Walmart changes course,"A 23-acre development near Walmart originally planned as an age-targeted community of patio homes is changing course according to its land use consultant.

“The 4EVR age-targeted patio homes project that was originally planned for that site is on the shelf” said Greg Davis the president of land use planning firm iPlan Consulting. “El Dorado Holdings (the developer of the property) is working with Shelter Corporation on the asset management portion now and they’re working to determine the path forward. Right now they are looking at market rate multi-family for that site.”

That area at and around the intersection of Porter Road and Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway is a hub for development especially multi-family projects. Much of it – more than 1000 units not including the El Dorado Holdings project – is planned as multi-family housing.

City leaders have repeatedly said that they city needs to develop an inventory of apartments and other multi-family projects if it is to attract more businesses and jobs.

If the El Dorado project goes forward it would join the 414-unit Sterling at Stonegate; 309-unit Copa Flats; 289-unit Roers Apartments; and the 194 units of REV @ Porter in the area. Those projects total 1202 units which would provide housing for about 3125 people.

Apartments typically have a density of about 20 units per acre for two story communities and about 25 per acre if the buildings are three stories. With about 17 of the 23 acres of the El Dorado project preliminarily slated for multi-family residential that could yield a community with 340-425 units. Those units would be home to between 884 and 1105 residents.

In addition to housing there also are six acres on the site currently zoned as commercial/industrial. Davis said the developers are proposing a mixed-use component as part of the project and are in the preliminary planning process with the city planning department.

“We’ll have an initial meeting with the planning department to talk about our early ideas then we’ll spend the next three or four weeks working on a formal proposal. Then we’ll submit our pre-application narrative to the city to get their input. Once we do that we’ll have unit counts and preliminary site plans.”

Davis said the area around Walmart is hot right now.

“There is a lot happening around there” Davis said. “It’s developing as one of those ‘nodes’ in the city where it’s going to be a hub of activity. The transportation is good there with access to Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway and the East-West Parkway coming about a half mile south of there.

“There will be a lot of businesses that will look at that area and decide they want a second Maricopa location there or see it as a way to get into Maricopa in a great

situation where there is lots of population right there. There are three or four multi-family projects right there brining density commercial and retail so it’s really moving right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2FtYXpvbi1wcmltZS1wcmljZS1pbmNyZWFzZS13YWxtYXJ0LXBsdXMtY29zdGNvLWJldHRlci1kZWFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Prime Price Increase: Is Walmart Plus or Costco a Better Deal?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amazon-prime-price-increase-walmart-plus-costco-better-deal on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2FtYXpvbi1wcmltZS1wcmljZS1pbmNyZWFzZS13YWxtYXJ0LXBsdXMtY29zdGNvLWJldHRlci1kZWFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2FsMTAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMi8wMi8wNi9ib2R5LWZvdW5kLWluLXBhcmtpbmctbG90LW9mLW1hcmdhdGUtd2FsbWFydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Body found in parking lot of Margate Walmart,"MARGATE Fla. – A body was discovered outside a Walmart in Margate on Sunday afternoon.

A large police presence responded and blocked off much of the parking lot with crime scene tape.

At one point detectives and crime scene technicians surrounded a black car. They eventually opened it and took some photos.

A product display redesign being tested at Walmart Inc.'s Springdale incubator store features layouts and interactive digital displays meant to create ""a destination where customers want to spend their time.""

The Bentonville-based retailer debuted the changes on Jan. 27 at Store 4108 as the second phase of a redesign effort it began in September 2020. Walmart uses the store as a testing ground for new ideas that may later be implemented more widely across its more than 4700 stores in the United States.

Part one of the redesign entailed prominent signage marking the store's sections and a new layout with navigation enhanced through Walmart's app.

With ""overwhelmingly positive"" feedback from customers nearly 1000 stores have been renovated under Phase 1 the company said.

While Phase 1 was still in the incubator stage it earned Walmart a spot among 25 finalists -- out of 62 submissions -- in the Retail Design Institute's 50th International Design Competition in October.

This second phase which Walmart is calling ""Time Well Spent"" aims to make Walmart ""a destination where customers want to spend their time"" said Alvis Washington Walmart's vice president of marketing in store design innovation and experience.

""We're amplifying the physical human and digital design elements in our stores to inspire customers and elevate the experience"" Washington said.

The physical changes include improved lighting and a layout that creates more space in stores Washington said. Other changes include corner displays and brand shops he said.

""Our visual merchandising experts have highlighted exciting brands and created engaging experiences that bring to life the human element"" Washington said.

A short video on Walmart's news website shows GAP brand bedding on a made-up bed complete with throw pillows. The video also shows Reebok products displayed in a large area under their own label almost like a store within a store.

Washington said that concept will be carried over into other departments such as the baby department where strollers and car seats are taken out of boxes to allow for ""test drives."" And new parents ""will be greeted by elevated displays showcasing all the items needed to create a dream nursery"" he said.

Apparel will be arranged to highlight national and Walmart-owned brands Washington said and beauty ""will also showcase exciting shops where new and trending items are given a home.""

Technological innovations such as QR codes and digital displays run throughout the redesigned store helping to integrate the in-store and online shopping experience.

As an example Washington said ""in our pets area a customer may scan the QR code to find additional dog bed options learn about Walmart's pet insurance service options or have a 20-pound bag of kibble delivered to their door.""

Washington said early customer feedback has been positive. ""We'll continue to test learn and make changes based on what our customers tell us"" he said.

Critics have compared some of the redesign elements with the merchandising approach employed by rival Target and used for years by department stores.

Sanford Stein founder of LinkedIn platform Retail Speak told Retail Dive that the strategies that big-box discounters like Walmart and Target are using are what he calls ""the vocabulary of the department store.""

""I refer to it as solution-based rather than product-based marketing"" he told the industry news outlet. ""It's something that a good department store of the past did well and it's increasingly important as sales continue to shift more online.""

Carol Spieckerman a retail consultant and president of Spieckerman Retail said many of the test store's upgrades such as improved apparel displays enhanced navigation and traffic flows ""should resonate with Walmart shoppers.""

""Some of the ideas may not be novel compared to other retailers yet they will stand out in the Walmart environment"" Spieckerman said.

There's a chance the store's heavy use of technology will intimidate some less tech-savvy customers. But Spieckerman said that even if the tests fall flat with traditional shoppers ""they may resonate with the younger shoppers who are critical to Walmart's long-term success.""

""Either way"" she said ""Walmart is no doubt learning a lot from the tests both visible and behind-the-scenes that are being incubated in the store. Elements that take hold can be extracted and implemented in other locations.""

""All in all"" Spieckerman said ""Walmart is striking a nice touch between high tech and high touch in Springdale.""

Here is a list of the Walt Disney World attractions unavailable due to refurbishment for March 2022.

Walt Disney World Railroad

The Walt Disney World Railroad gives Guests the grand circle tour of Magic Kingdom. The unfortunate news is that it has been closed since December 2018 and therefore has not given a grand circle tour in nearly three years. This had to be done in order for Disney World to begin construction and make way for the upcoming TRON attraction which will be located in Tomorrowland once complete.

At this time Disney World still has not announced a reopening date for the Walt Disney World Railroad but thanks to the Walt Disney World refurbishment calendar we can confirm the refurbishment is officially extended and it will be closed for the entire month of March.

If you’ve never had the chance to ride the grand circle tour around Magic Kingdom check out the official Disney description here:

Listen to the clamor of the engine the chug of the wheels and the call of the whistle aboard the Walt Disney World Railroad. Ride 1 of 4 meticulously restored vintage narrow-gauge steam trains—originally built between 1916 and 1928—and enjoy a relaxing 20-minute 1.5-mile scenic round-trip tour. It’s a convenient—and nostalgic—way to get around Magic Kingdom park!! Find a Station You can board or disembark at any of 3 stations:

Near the entrance to the park on Main Street U.S.A.

The Frontierland station

The Fantasyland station

Expedition Everest

According to the Walt Disney World refurbishment calendar Expedition Everest will be closed for a lengthy refurbishment from January 4 2022 to mid-April. At this time we unfortunately do not have a set reopening date for Expedition Everest nor do we know exactly what the refurbishment will entail; however many are hoping to see the iconic yeti animatronic get fixed.

If you aren’t familiar when the popular coaster Expedition Everest first opened in 2006 the massive yeti animatronic would roar and reach down to grab Guests as they raced underneath him making for a unique experience. Unfortunately though shortly after the Animal Kingdom attraction opened to Guests the yeti animatronic broke down and has remained in its same “lifeless” state ever since. Though many are hoping for the yeti to get fixed during this multi-month closure reports have recently come in that this refurbishment will focus on the ride control system and not with improvements of show or the yeti. As always Inside the Magic will update you as we get information. The Walt Disney World website describes Expedition Everest as: Wander into a Tibetan village at the base of Mount Everest and board a train to the “top of the world.” Beware: Some say a legendary snow monster lives deep in the mountain. After a steep ascent your train picks up speed and races into the darkness. Without warning a broken and twisted track appears in front of you. Brace yourself as you plummet backward into total darkness. Inside the cavern the mythical tale comes true as you see the shadow of a massive growling beast! Race to escape the cursed mountain—before the Yeti claims another expedition.

Souk-al-Magreb

Many Guests love visiting the Souk-al-Magreb gift shop in World Showcase at EPCOT. Unfortunately if you had plans to visit in March the shop will remain closed.

According to the Walt Disney World refurbishment calendar on My Disney Experience Souk-al-Magreb at EPCOT will be closed for the entire month of March.

Disney’s Blizzard Beach

According to the Walt Disney World refurbishment calendar Disney’s Blizzard Beach water park will remain closed for its regular refurbishment through March 12 2022. However we want to note that Park hours remain unavailable for the entire month of March.

The backstory of Blizzard Beach is that a one-time ski resort melted away into a watery wonderland — now it is known as Blizzard Beach! You and your family can discover frosty fun while visiting this ice-filled water park located at Walt Disney World. Disney’s Blizzard Beach is filled with one-of-a-kind and unique attractions fun for all ages. From the relaxing lazy river — Cross Country Creek — to the iconic Summit Plummet there are a wide variety of experiences for everyone.

For more information on Disney’s Blizzard Beach visit our website here.

You can use buses boats the Monorail the Skyliner or walking paths but not all of these options are available at each park. This guide will show you all the options for Disney transportation to get between the parks. So if you’re planning on park hopping during your next Disney World trip read on to find out how to get where you need to go!

We’ll break this guide down by park to see all the options you have for getting to each of the other Disney World parks via Walt Disney World Transportation. Of course you could also drive your own vehicle.

From EPCOT

EPCOT has some of the most diverse transportation options including stops on the Monorail Skyliner Boats and Buses.

One of the fastest ways to get from EPCOT to Disney’s Hollywood Studios is on the Disney Skyliner. This is the system that takes guests through the air in brightly colored gondolas.

You’ll head to the International Gateway entrance of EPCOT (between the France and UK pavilions in World Showcase) to find the Skyliner stop. Board the Skyliner and ride it past the Riviera stop to the Caribbean Beach stop.

Disembark at Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort and head to the Hollywood Studios line (which is located in the same station). You’ll be on your way to see the stars in no time!

Another option is to use a boat. The boat docks in EPCOT are also located at the International Gateway entrance between France and UK in World Showcase.

You can board the Hollywood Studios boat and the ride takes approximately 30 minutes since it stops a few times along the way.

The third option is to use a Disney bus. The bus stops in EPCOT are at the main entrance (the one by Spaceship Earth).

You’ll exit the park and turn left where you’ll find several numbered pavilions. There’s a large board near the walkway with all the information you’ll need to find the correct bus.

The final option for getting between these parks is to use the walking paths. There’s a path that goes from EPCOT’s International Gateway to the front entrance of Disney’s Hollywood Studios.

This walk will probably take about 30 – 40 minutes so it might not be the best option if you’re traveling with small kids who could get tired. The distance (according to Google Maps) is about 1.25 miles.

Of course if you drove your car or a rental vehicle you can always drive as well!

to Magic Kingdom

The fastest option to get to Magic Kingdom from EPCOT is usually the Monorail.

This highway in the sky has a couple of lines including one between EPCOT and Magic Kingdom and another between Magic Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom Resort Hotels. The EPCOT Monorail station is located just outside the front entrance to the park.

The Monorail ride from EPCOT takes about 15 minutes and it will actually drop you off at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC). From there you can hop on the Express Monorail to Magic Kingdom which usually takes less than 10 minutes.

If you’d prefer you can also take a Disney bus to Magic Kingdom from EPCOT.

Remember that the bus stop in EPCOT is located to the left of the main entrance if you’re exiting the park.

The only option to get to Disney’s Animal Kingdom from EPCOT on Disney transportation is to use a Disney bus.

Head out EPCOT’s main entrance and take a left to find the bus stops. You can refer to the large sign near the bus stops to find out which numbered stop you need.

to EPCOT

Probably the quickest option for getting to EPCOT from Hollywood Studios is the Disney Skyliner.

The Hollywood Studios Skyliner station is located just outside the entrance to the left (if you’re exiting the park). You can board a Skyliner gondola and ride it to the Caribbean Beach station where you’ll disembark.

From there find the EPCOT Skyliner route (in the same station) and hop on another gondola. You’ll sail past Disney’s Riviera Resort and be at EPCOT’s International Gateway in no time.

Another option is to use a boat. The boat docks in Hollywood Studios are located down by the water to the left if you’re exiting the park.

The boats will take you to EPCOT’s International Gateway on a ride that lasts about 30 minutes.

Another option is to use a Disney bus. To get to the bus stop in Hollywood Studios you’ll exit the park and walk straight past the Skyliner station. The numbered bus stops are to the left just after that.

The final option for getting between these parks is to use the walking paths. There’s a path that goes from the front entrance of Disney’s Hollywood Studios to EPCOT’s International Gateway.

This walking path is about 1.25 miles and takes about 30 – 40 minutes to walk depending on your speed.

to Magic Kingdom

The most direct route to Magic Kingdom from Disney’s Hollywood Studios is on a Disney bus. Remember that the Hollywood Studios bus stops are located outside the main entrance to the left (if you’re exiting).

If you don’t want to wait for a bus you can hop on the Skyliner instead and travel to EPCOT by disembarking at the Caribbean Beach station and getting on the EPCOT Skyliner route.

From EPCOT you can take the Monorail to the TTC and then take the Monorail route to Magic Kingdom.

Keep in mind that the Skyliner station in EPCOT is located at International Gateway whereas the Monorail station is at the main entrance. So you’ll need to walk through the park in order to take this route.

It might take a little longer to go this way (depending on the bus schedules) but you’ll get to travel on two iconic forms of Disney transportation so maybe it’s worth it!

The only option to get to Disney’s Animal Kingdom from Disney’s Hollywood Studios on Disney transportation is to use a Disney bus.

Head out the main entrance and walk straight and you’ll see the bus stops on your soon. Consult the board to see which numbered stop you need.

to Any Other Disney World Park

The only option for getting from Animal Kingdom to EPCOT Hollywood Studios or Magic Kingdom is to use a Disney bus.

Animal Kingdom is a little further out from the rest of the parks so it’s not connected to the others via the Monorail Skyliner or boats.

The bus stop in Animal Kingdom is located outside the main entrance to the right (if you’re exiting the park).

From Magic Kingdom

to EPCOT

You can use the Monorail to get to EPCOT from Magic Kingdom.

First take the Monorail Express route back to the TTC and from there you can board another Monorail to EPCOT. The EPCOT Monorail stop is just outside the park’s main entrance.

The ride to the TTC from Magic Kingdom takes less than 10 minutes usually and the trip from the TTC to EPCOT takes about 15 minutes.

If you’d prefer you can also take a Disney bus to EPCOT from Magic Kingdom.

Remember that the bus stop in Magic Kingdom is located to the left of the main entrance if you’re exiting the park.

The most direct route to Disney’s Hollywood Studios from Magic Kingdom is on a Disney bus. Remember that the Magic Kingdom bus stops are located to the left of the main entrance if you’re exiting the park.

If you don’t want to wait for a bus you can use the Monorail and Skyliner via EPCOT. Take the Monorail Express route to the TTC and board another Monorail to EPCOT from there.

Once you’re at EPCOT you can head through the park and out the International Gateway entrance (located in World Showcase between the UK and France pavilions) to find the Skyliner station.

Hop on a Skyliner gondola and travel to the Caribbean Beach station where you’ll find another Skyliner route to Hollywood Studios.

Keep in mind that the Monorail station in EPCOT is located at the front entrance whereas the Skyliner station is at International Gateway. So you’ll have to walk through that park if you want to take this route.

The only option for getting to Animal Kingdom from Magic Kingdom via Disney Transportation is on a Disney bus.

Head out the Magic Kingdom main entrance and to your left to find the Magic Kingdom bus stops. You’ll board a bus there which will take you to the stops just outside Animal Kingdom’s main entrance.

Car

If you have a car in Disney World (your own or a rental) you can also drive between the parks. For Magic Kingdom you’ll drive to the TTC and then take a bus Monorail or Ferryboat to the park itself. For the other three parks you’ll park outside the entrance and then walk (or take a tram) to the front.

If you don’t have a car in Disney World and need to get somewhere fast you can also use rideshare services like Uber and Lyft. The rideshare stops are usually out front of the parks’ main entrances. Prices for these services vary depending on the time of day time of year and availability.

Kiosks Carts and Quick-Service Locations

All Walt Disney World Parks

We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention the classic Disney snack—Mickey pretzels—which can be found at kiosks carts and quick-service locations throughout Walt Disney World parks.

Ski jumping captivates viewers every four years when they fearlessly fly the length of an American football field plus the end zones.

Casual fans though probably have no clue about the scoring system or skills and techniques necessary to win gold even though the sport has been a part of the Winter Olympics since the first one in 1924.

In the US most people can’t probably name a ski jumper other than “Eddie the Eagle” from the 2016 film about Eddie Edwards’ unlikely bid to become a British Olympian.

The Associated Press is here to help. Here’s a look at what to watch starting Saturday when the women go for gold from the moment ski jumpers sit on a bar about as high as a 40-story building until they glide over machine-made snow and wait to see how far they flew and how the judges scored their performance.

The bar is very high

Ski jumpers sit on a bar calming their nerves with deep breaths and wait for a green light to go. If there’s too much of a gust they have to slide back off the bar and onto a step to wait for wind to calm down. A focused mind which ignores fears is key.

Fun on the in-run

With skis wider and longer than those in other disciplines jumpers go down a steep incline referred to as the in-run. They try to avoid making contact with the sides of ice-filled channels go as fast as 100 kph (62 mph) to help them fly farther.

Jumpers lead with their helmet throw their hands back and crouch low into a tuck with a flat back for aerodynamics. Balance and flexibility are critical.

Cleared for takeoff

Near the end of the in-run men and women make an explosive jump without moving their upper body to create lift for flight. The timing and technique in the take-off is perhaps the most important part of the 15-second process from sitting on the bar to sliding to a stop in the snow.

Come fly with me

Jumpers lean forward with hands near hips hovering their torso over skis that are in a “V” shape in a technique used since Swedish ski jumper Jan Bokloev started doing it in 1985 after they previously had them parallel.

Coming in for a landing

When skis hit the snow judges want one slightly ahead of the other and for the jumpers to gracefully glide on what’s known as the outrun.

Advertisement

Style points matter

Jumpers are aiming for the K-point of the hill where it starts to flatten out to earn 60 points and those who fly past it earn more points while points are deducted from coming up short. Five judges award scores of up to 20 points for style from start to finish looking for jumpers who look keep their torso and limbs still while floating through the air and land gracefully among other things.

Size matters

There’s a dirty little secret in the sport which is plagued by eating disorders. Fat don’t fly is a phrase heard at least in the U.S. because physics prevent a heavier jumper from flying farther than a lighter one. Norway’s Maren Lundby decided not to defend her Olympic gold because she put on weight and chose to put her physical and mental health first leading to her skipping the season.

Impress your friends

If you’re looking for a winner maybe don’t pick an American. The U.S. has won only one Olympic medal and that happened nearly a century ago in what was quite a tale. Anders Haugen left the first Winter Olympics in 1924 without any hardware but 50 years later was awarded a bronze medal after a scoring error was confirmed.

Norway Austria and Germany are traditional powers. Poland and Japan are pretty good too. Japanese jumper Ryoyu Kobayashi and Germany’s Karl Geiger are relatively safe bets to earn a spot on the podium.

On the women’s side with Lundby taking time off and top-ranked Marita Kramer of Austria out after testing positive for COVID-19 Germany’s Katharina Althaus and Sara Takanashi of Japan are the favorites.

This is a major boost to India’s cargo movement infrastructure with rice shipment from the IWAI terminal at Phulwari Shariff in Patna moving on two of the world’s largest rivers—Ganga and Brahmaputra—sailing on international waters through the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) route.

The Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade between India and Bangladesh allows use of their waterways for the movement of goods between the two countries by vessels of both countries. National Waterway- 1 on Ganga is connected to National Waterway-2 on Brahmaputra and National Waterway-16 on Barak through the IBP routes.

Wendy Williams – Bank Freezes Her Assets Where She Has Several Million Dollars + Wells Fargo Suspects She Has Dementia Locking Talk Show Out Her Account [EXCLUSIVE DOCUMENTS]

New details have been revealed concerning Wendy Williams. theJasmineBRAND has obtained court documents in which Wendy Williams is demanding a bank give her access to her finances. Specifically the 57-year-old Talk Show host has filed legal documents trying reportedly get Wells Fargo to unfreeze her accounts as the bank suspects

‘financial exploitation dementia or undue influence.’

According to reports she has been unable to access her account for more than two weeks.

Wendy is reportedly asking the court for an emergency order claiming that the bank is in

“possession of several million dollars’ worth of funds”.

So why has Wendy allegedly been locked out of her own bank account? According to court documents and her attorney Wendy’s former financial advisor advised the bank that Wendy “was of unsound mind” among other things.

Meanwhile the petition claims that Wells Fargo has justified its decision to keep her from her accounts by referencing it’s authority under various client agreements to

“‘pause or reject instructions for a proposed transaction’ pending judicial or administrative remedies should they suspect financial exploitation dementia or undue influence”.

Her legal team’s defense is reportedly that the talk show host hasn’t done anything to give Wells Fargo the discretion to pause or reject access to the accounts.

The court docs state that Wendy is suffering

“imminent and irreparable financial damage.”

They want to regain her account while this dispute is resolved in arbitration and they’re asking for this to be done within 48 hours. See the court docs below:

Wendy nor her team have yet to provide an update on her condition. She has yet to return to her talk show since the beginning of the season in September. Guest hosts are filling in during her absence.

Advertisers including drugmakers are increasingly carving out bigger chunks of their advertising budgets for connected TV (CTV) spending $14.4 billion on the medium in 2021 a nearly 60% jump over 2020.

But are the bigger investments paying off? Marketing tech company DeepIntent says the answer is yes.

“Television works. We know it works. But connected TV just works harder and smarter” Marcella Milliet Sciorra the company’s senior vice president of marketing said in an interview.

The company used a combination of industrywide statistics and data from campaigns run on its own artificial-intelligence-driven platform to analyze the effectiveness and return on investment for pharma clients investing in CTV.

Sciorra said the findings reinforced what the company had already suspected: Not only is CTV 53% less expensive than advertising on cable TV but it's better than linear TV display advertising and online video at reaching pharma’s brand-specific targeted audiences.

“It really validated all the assumptions that we had around CTV” she said.

The company used ACR (automated content recognition) data which is information collected using technology that is built into smart TVs to measure the reach and ""audience quality"" of recent pharma campaigns.

It found that CTV delivered an 82% higher percentage of ad impressions to people identified as ""clinically relevant"" to the advertised product. Audience quality—the percentage of the audience identified as ""clinically relevant"" to the brand—was also 50% higher for CTV than it was for linear TV. CTV also hit the target audience better than display ads and online video ads with audience quality 12% and 10% higher than each of those media respectively.

When it came to return on investment the company looked at the cost per verified patient (cost to reach a clinically relevant individual as defined by claims codes) and found that depending on the campaign CTV’s ROI was between 10% and 50% higher that it was for linear TV.

For DeepIntent’s part connected TV is now the biggest growth area for the healthcare marketing company which specializes in HCP and patient audience targeting and works with nine of the top 10 pharma companies in the U.S. The company launched a pharma-specific connected TV marketplace in 2020 in response to “incredible demand” Sciorra said although linear TV still makes up the lion’s share of TV ad spending.

“If I look at all of the different marketing campaigns I'm doing with clients … we’re betting on exponential growth” said Sciorra. “We’re bullish that CTV is here to stay.”

The latest forecast from eMarketer makes a similar prediction forecasting connected TV ad spending in the U.S. will more than double to $34.49 billion by 2025.

But that doesn’t mean traditional TV advertising is dead Sciorra said.

“While TV provides an unparalleled reach connected TV provides unprecedented precision” she said. “It is really the combination of connected plus linear TV that makes a great media plan.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Performance will be in between the fastest PCIe3 drives and the fastest PCIe4 drives.

4 Reviews

Digital storage manufacturer Western Digital has just made available its Black SN770 series to succeed the last generation SN750 series of NVMe SSDs. The newer series utilizes the PCIe4 x4 interface for maximum read and write rates of 5150 MB/s and 4850 MB/s respectively compared to ""only"" ~3500 MB/s on the fastest PCIe3 x4 drives.

Faster PCIe4 x4 drives like the Acer Predator GM7000 or ADATA Gammix S70 are available with transfer rates approaching 7000+ MB/s each to be noticeably faster than what the new SN770 series can offer. However such drives are also more expensive at $150 and $145 USD for the 1 TB ADATA and 1 TB Acer respectively compared to just $130 for the 1 TB WD SN770.

Current SN770 SKUs range from 250 GB up to 2 TB with the following prices:

250 GB: $60 USD

500 GB: $80 USD

1 TB: $130 USD

2 TB: $270 USD

It's worth noting that although the WD SN770 drives are PCIe4 compatible they are not officially designed for the Playstation 5. The manufacturer does not guarantee compatibility with the Sony console which recommends faster transfer rates than what the SN770 series can provide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNpdHl3b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tL3Bvc3QucGhwP3N0b3J5PTIwMjIwMjAyMTIzNjEwODkx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Higher education's unique storage and data requirements,"GLOBAL Higher education’s unique storage and data requirements Tweet



COVID-19 has also brought with it a fresh set of data challenges driven by the need for remote working and learning and the sheer amount of e-learning video data generated as a result. Across the board the ongoing pandemic has forced a whole reappraisal of institutional data storage needs within the education sector.



Old architectures and processes suddenly no longer fit the current educational environment. These factors bring storage considerations to ‘life’ prompting discussions about how to manage diverse data types data needs and architectures.



COVID response



In the early stages of the pandemic IT practices were largely reactive due to the lack of ‘coping’ methods such as policies for long-term remote working e-learning and data access within pre-existing IT strategies. And although things have settled IT leaders may be dealing with the aftershock of this for some time – creating yet more complexity in their roles.



Universities and research institutes alike have unique signifiers and sensitivities that define their approach to data management. These attributes explored in



• Research data volume. As opposed to the lighter touch approach of agile business organisations universities often find themselves contending with vast quantities of data related to research.



From enrolment to graduation these rich learning environments are exponentially generating unpredictable amounts of different data types – smart video video conferences courses tests results research images lectures and unstructured data to name but a few – that need to be properly protected and stored. As a result of this individual file sizes like video can be enormous.



This places additional strain on the data storage infrastructure within which they are managed. Naturally this impacts the storage solutions IT leaders choose to work with and the capabilities these technologies are required to provide in terms of security performance sharing and compliance.



• Organisational diversity. Universities are distinct from general business organisations because they perform a myriad of additional functions in addition to core research and operational management.



Educational organisations process personal and sensitive information about their staff and students such as financial data medical and personal records and so on.



All that information can be subject to specific local compliance requirements most notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that all European institutions need to abide by. Therefore having storage solutions that can comply with the proper encryption is crucial.



• Committee decision-making. Unlike the hierarchical management structure of large businesses educational institutions are decentralised and flatter. Any decision-making on the types of data storage solutions to use tends to be made on a committee basis as opposed to purely by senior management.



This type of decision-making challenges conventional ways where the divide between ownership and stewardship of data is more distinct.



While IT may not always know where the value resides in the data and academics and faculty may also not understand the intricacies of data storage and management in universities there is an effort to make decisions with an understanding of each other’s perspective.



• Collaboration culture. The traditionally open ethos of universities and their culture of collaboration and sharing of data and research is again distinct from the commonplace strategies pursued in businesses which adopt a more secretive approach to data in order to maintain a market advantage over their competitors.



Data sharing is a fundamental requirement in academia and so can drive the requirements in choosing more bespoke IT solutions.



The transactional process of sharing data between universities is particular to each institution. While most universities take full advantage in the exchange of data across their departments the way they share it externally differs.



For instance a representative of a public university in northern Italy spoke of using shared cloud storage whereas their IT counterpart at a public university in Scotland instead relies on the platforms of other universities.



Cloud storage and data governance



Some IT leaders give a lot of autonomy to ‘super users’ of data storage such as researchers within universities as their work drives the value of the educational institution.



A university in London spoke of modelling their data storage architecture according to the needs of their ‘super user’ researchers. Their sophisticated use of the IT infrastructure means that this data-literate cohort needs to have a key role in infrastructure decision-making.



Universities are taking advantage of cloud technology to a degree. However given the data attributes that education IT leaders work with and their storage priorities on-premises solutions are still used.



According to the report currently under a third of data in total is stored in the cloud – even less sometimes for research institutes.



One research institute in Germany stored 15 times more data on-premises as compared to the cloud. And while some are looking to move the dial in favour of the cloud both scale and the sensitivity of data are hampering greater cloud storage adoption.



Naturally this varies between the types of institutes and the data attributes. For example the research found that cloud use is more heavily favoured in cases where there is much data sharing and in smaller universities.



In addition to the four categories detailed above there is another distinct challenge facing the education sector’s data governance. Most universities surveyed have some element of data governance in place. However policies vary in complexity and frequently ‘tier’ data types according to sensitivity and value.



These policies often also determine whether data can be stored in the cloud or on-premises which can be linked to GDPR a notable concern for European universities.



For example operational data (financial data) and student data would likely be placed in the GDPR-sensitive tier whereas archival data that is not often used would likely fall into the low priority camp.



Data storage is complex and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution and both cloud and on-premises have a place. According to the survey cloud is generally viewed as the future among most IT leaders surveyed but on-premises solutions are still widely used.



Regardless of the solution it must demonstrate value scale easily and be an enabler of the future priorities and plans of the university. It must also balance levels of security and compliance as well as smooth workflows and capacity requirements for students academia and faculty.



Davide Villa is director of business development for Europe Middle East Africa and India at Western Digital. Data storage is a key requirement for any organisation. However the needs of the higher education sector are wholly distinct compared to traditionally defined commercial business entities. Those needs include vast volumes of research data and multiple departments requiring access to data as well as sensitive personal information on students and faculty.COVID-19 has also brought with it a fresh set of data challenges driven by the need for remote working and learning and the sheer amount of e-learning video data generated as a result.

Therefore having storage solutions that can comply with the proper encryption is crucial.Unlike the hierarchical management structure of large businesses educational institutions are decentralised and flatter. Any decision-making on the types of data storage solutions to use tends to be made on a committee basis as opposed to purely by senior management.This type of decision-making challenges conventional ways where the divide between ownership and stewardship of data is more distinct.While IT may not always know where the value resides in the data and academics and faculty may also not understand the intricacies of data storage and management in universities there is an effort to make decisions with an understanding of each other’s perspective.The traditionally open ethos of universities and their culture of collaboration and sharing of data and research is again distinct from the commonplace strategies pursued in businesses which adopt a more secretive approach to data in order to maintain a market advantage over their competitors.Data sharing is a fundamental requirement in academia and so can drive the requirements in choosing more bespoke IT solutions.The transactional process of sharing data between universities is particular to each institution. While most universities take full advantage in the exchange of data across their departments the way they share it externally differs.For instance a representative of a public university in northern Italy spoke of using shared cloud storage whereas their IT counterpart at a public university in Scotland instead relies on the platforms of other universities.Some IT leaders give a lot of autonomy to ‘super users’ of data storage such as researchers within universities as their work drives the value of the educational institution.A university in London spoke of modelling their data storage architecture according to the needs of their ‘super user’ researchers. Their sophisticated use of the IT infrastructure means that this data-literate cohort needs to have a key role in infrastructure decision-making.Universities are taking advantage of cloud technology to a degree. However given the data attributes that education IT leaders work with and their storage priorities on-premises solutions are still used.According to the report currently under a third of data in total is stored in the cloud – even less sometimes for research institutes.One research institute in Germany stored 15 times more data on-premises as compared to the cloud. And while some are looking to move the dial in favour of the cloud both scale and the sensitivity of data are hampering greater cloud storage adoption.Naturally this varies between the types of institutes and the data attributes. For example the research found that cloud use is more heavily favoured in cases where there is much data sharing and in smaller universities.In addition to the four categories detailed above there is another distinct challenge facing the education sector’s data governance. Most universities surveyed have some element of data governance in place. However policies vary in complexity and frequently ‘tier’ data types according to sensitivity and value.These policies often also determine whether data can be stored in the cloud or on-premises which can be linked to GDPR a notable concern for European universities.For example operational data (financial data) and student data would likely be placed in the GDPR-sensitive tier whereas archival data that is not often used would likely fall into the low priority camp.Data storage is complex and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution and both cloud and on-premises have a place. According to the survey cloud is generally viewed as the future among most IT leaders surveyed but on-premises solutions are still widely used.Regardless of the solution it must demonstrate value scale easily and be an enabler of the future priorities and plans of the university. It must also balance levels of security and compliance as well as smooth workflows and capacity requirements for students academia and faculty.

The musician and fashion mogul took to Instagram on Saturday evening where he shared a screenshot that appears to be from his Netflix documentary ""Jeen-yuhs"" that shows him looking a bit sad while his mother Donda tries to comfort him.

""You need an angel to watch over you"" the screenshot’s caption reads.

In the post West questions the fairness of his and Kardashian’s co-parenting relationship with their kids North Chicago Saint and Psalm. He alleges that his ex is directly responsible for blocking him from taking their kids on a trip. He did not specify if the trip was previously planned or not.

KANYE WEST KIM KARDASHIAN DIVORCE: WHAT'S AT STAKE?

""I WANT TO BRING MY KIDS TO MY HOME TOWN OF CHICAGO TO SEE MY BASKETBALL TEAM PLAY FOR 7 THOUSAND PEOPLE AND KIM IS STOPPING THAT HOW IS THIS JOINT CUSTODY?"" West wrote.

Representatives for Kim Kardashian did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

This is the latest move in a very public spat the former couple is having that started after West took to social media to share his displeasure that his ex-wife is letting their 8-year-old daughter North have a TikTok account.

""SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST DIVORCE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING PUT ON TIK TOK AGAINST MY WILL ?"" the 44-year-old wrote in a different post.

A spokesperson for Kim previously gave Fox News Digital the following response statement from the star:

""Kanye's constant attacks on me in interviews and on social media is actually more hurtful than any TikTok North might create"" she wrote. ""As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity in the medium that she wishes with adult supervision - because it brings her happiness.

KIM KARDASHIAN DENIES KANYE WEST’S CLAIMS HE STOPPED ALLEGED SECOND SEX TAPE WITH RAY J FROM LEAKING

""Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye's obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all"" she continued. ""From the beginning I have wanted nothing but a healthy and supportive co-parenting relationship because it is what is best for our children and it saddens me that Kanye continues to make it impossible every step of the way.""

""I wish to handle all matters regarding our children privately and hopefully he can finally respond to the third attorney he has had in the last year to resolve any issues amicably"" she concluded her statement.

West responded in another Instagram post in which he questioned some of what the reality star was saying about their situation.

""What do you mean by main provider?"" West asked referring to Kardashian's claim she is their children's primary caregiver.

Kanye added ""America saw you try to kid nap [sic] my daughter on her birthday by not providing the address You put security on me inside of the house to play with my son then accused me of stealing I had to take a drug test after [daughter] Chicago’s party cause you accused me of being on drugs [Kardashian's chief marketing officer] Tracy Romulus stop manipulating Kim to be this way …""

West had publicly claimed Kardashian and her family had refused to give him the address to Chicago's birthday party in a video shared by TMZ . However West did show up to the party according to photos from social media. The address of the party was given to the rapper as soon as he asked for it Fox News Digital learned.

The 41-year-old filed for divorce from West after nearly eight years of marriage court records showed in February 2021. The move brings an impending end to one of the most followed celebrity unions of the 21st century.

Kardashian is seeking joint custody of the children and her filing states the couple have a prenuptial agreement that will determine how their assets will be divided. It cites irreconcilable differences for their breakup and does not list a separation date.

The couple began dating in 2012 and had their first child in 2013. West proposed later that year using the giant screen at the empty waterfront ballpark of the San Francisco Giants and the two married May 24 2014 in a ceremony at a Renaissance fortress in Florence Italy.

launches on February 18th for PS4 and PS5. The sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most anticipated games of the year and it’s sure to sell millions of copies. But before you buy a copy of the sequel there is an interesting quirk regarding the two versions of Horizon Forbidden West you should know about. As long as you buy Horizon Forbidden West on PS4 you can save yourself $10 even if you want the PS5 version.

Horizon Forbidden West’s free PS4 to PS5 upgrade

Last September Sony confirmed that Horizon Forbidden West would be available on February 18th. The company also revealed there would not be a free upgrade from the PS4 version to the PS5 version. This unsurprisingly didn’t go over well with PlayStation fans.

In fact it went over so poorly that the company almost immediately backtracked.

“Last year we made a commitment to deliver free upgrades for our cross-gen launch titles which included Horizon Forbidden West” wrote Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan. “While the pandemic’s profound impact pushed Forbidden West out of the launch window we initially envisioned we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.”

Horizon Forbidden West will be the final first-party cross-gen game to include a free upgrade. Upcoming games like God of War Ragnarök and Gran Turismo 7 will get a $10 digital upgrade option. Otherwise if you buy a first-party PS5 game the retail price at launch will be $69.99. That brings us back to Horizon Forbidden West which is coming out on PS4 and PS5.

How to save $10 on Horizon Forbidden West

The standard edition of Horizon Forbidden West will cost $59.99 on PS4 and $69.99 on PS5. As noted above if you buy the PS4 version of the game you can upgrade to the PS5 version for free. Therefore there’s no reason that anyone should buy the PS5 version. The only reason would be if you are collecting physical copies of every PS5 game.

If you buy a physical copy on PS4 put the disc in your PS5 to receive the free upgrade. If you buy a digital copy you’ll get the upgrade automatically.

One last warning: If you search for Horizon Forbidden West on the PlayStation Store on a PS5 you will only find the PS5 version of the game. If you want to preorder or purchase the game digitally be sure to visit this page on the PlayStation Store from your browser.

It’s not especially surprising that Sony is doing everything it can to push consumers to buy the PS5 version but it’s a waste of $10. Whether you own a PS4 a PS5 or both consoles you should by the PS4 version of Horizon Forbidden West. You’ll save $10 and you can upgrade to the PS5 version for free as soon as you get a PS5.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndodWZjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VwZGF0ZS1zdXBwb3J0ZXItYWNjZXNzLWxvbmRvbi1zdGFkaXVt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Update on supporter access to London Stadium | West Ham United F.C.,"West Ham United can provide an update to supporters on their access to London Stadium for the remainder of the 2021/22 season following the Government’s easing of COVID-19 Autumn and Winter Plan B restrictions.

Digital ticketing – 2021/22 – Maintaining familiarity and flexibility

In August the Club updated supporters that we are working towards the implementation of a digital ticket solution and in due course all Season Ticket Holders will be able to download a seasonal digital pass to their smartphone in order to gain access to London Stadium on matchdays

We would like to thank supporters for their patience and understanding over the first half of the season as we made the required move to digital ticketing as a result of COVID-19

With the vast majority of our match attending supporters now familiar with the current digital ticketing system we will continue to issue tickets in the same way until the end of the 2021/22 campaign – and a full guide can be found here

Near Field Communication (NFC) technology has been installed at all turnstiles in preparation for the 2022/23 season with the Club having trialled the technology at the Brighton & Hove Albion game in December and incrementally at matches from now until the end of the 2021/22 campaign. We will continue to monitor turnstile entry at all matches ensuring supporters are able to enter the stadium as quickly and easily as possible

Special arrangements remain in place for any supporters who are not able to utilise one of these methods. Simply contact the Ticket Office on 0333 030 1966 select ‘Option 2’ and the Club will personally ensure that your individual needs are met

The Club will continue to monitor all of our policies and procedures in order to remain flexible to any possible changes in COVID protocols from the authorities

Digital ticketing – 2022/23 – Brand new digital ticketing system and stadium access protocols

During the close season the Club will use the feedback we receive from across all of our channels including your calls emails letters survey responses Tweets and the discussions we have with supporters’ groups to communicate information FAQs and guides for supporters to ensure all fans are fully prepared with everything they need ahead of the new entry process at London Stadium in time for the 2022/23 season.

A seasonal digital pass will only need to be downloaded once for the 2022/23 campaign and will replace existing Season Ticket access cards and paper tickets for all home fixtures including all cup ties. An email will be sent to all Season Ticket Holders during the close season that includes all the information they need to download their seasonal digital pass

The Club is also conscious that a small number of Season Ticket Holders may not have access to a smartphone and we will continue to be inclusive and make sure we do everything we can to support all of our fans. Those Season Ticket Holders who do not have access to a smartphone will be able to request a physical Stadium access card with their photograph on ahead of the 2022/23 season. More information on how to request this will be sent directly to Season Ticket Holders via email during the close season

We will continue to keep our Season Ticket holders and members updated through personal email communication and across the Club’s channels.

Thank you for your support and continued co-operation in helping to keep each other safe on matchday at London Stadium."

Sorokin was eventually arrested in California and tried — Williams actually helped the police find her and testified against her in court. The fake heiress was found guilty on four counts of theft of services three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny. While the jury didn't find her guilty of stealing from Williams Williams's credit card company did forgive a bulk of her debt.

According to Williams's portfolio she's been working as a writer and photographer after being laid off from ""Vanity Fair"" in 2019. The same year she published ""My Friend Anna: The True Story of a Fake Heiress."" As you may have already guessed the book follows Sorokin's story and Williams's firsthand account as her former best friend. In addition to her book Williams also struck a deal with HBO for a project about Delvey's life but the project was still in the development stage as of February 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpheXNraS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNS9qb3NoLXdpbGxpYW1zLWJyaW5naW5nLWhvc3Qtb2Ytc3BvbnNvcnMtdG8tYmotbWNsZW9kLW1vdG9yc3BvcnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Josh Williams Bringing Host of Sponsors to BJ McLeod Motorsports,"Josh Williams might not be the name you hear repeatedly when watching NASCAR’s Xfinity Series on TV however after years of consistency his name is one that is being mentioned more and more as someone to watch and pay attention too.

The 28-year-old veteran old school grassroots driver is one not only respected by his fellow drivers but everyone you pass in the garage on any given day.

His partners who will all follow him to BJ McLeod Motorsports as he takes the seat of the No. 78 Chevrolet feel the same way.

“We remember getting the call from a connection saying there’s this kid from southwest Florida who has a shot to race Daytona in July and he needs this much to do it” recalls Star Brite VP of Sales & Marketing Greg Dornau. “We had never sponsored NASCAR before but after meeting Josh we knew we had the opportunity to be a part of something special. As his first Xfinity series sponsor and rolling into our sixth season our employees customers additional pro staff and everyone who represents the Star Brite & Star Tron brands consider him part of our family and we thank you all for welcoming us into yours. The loyal NASCAR fan base is one every brand desires as customers and we have been able to grow and expand our partnership with Josh year after year.”

Over the last two seasons and heading into their 3rd Alloy Employer Services saw the same thing in Williams and have become his anchor partner taking their #StrongerByDesign company moto and culture to strengthen William’s opportunity for success while flying the Alloy Blue.

“Alloy Employer Services is as excited to see the debut of Josh Williams driving the No. 78 car in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at Daytona as we were the first day he drove for us at Indianapolis. The potential of Josh driving full-time for BJ McCleod Motorsports is incredible” said Alloy CMO Chris Estey. “BJMM runs an amazing operation. This is a terrific partnership which can only mean great opportunities in 2022 and an exciting and competitive season for our favorite driver”

With additional long-term partners Sleep Well Inc. CoolRay General Formulations as well as associate partners Musselman’s Applesauce (Williams first national partner in 2015) Silverton Casino Hotel Verve Required Team Gear and more will be announced later.

Josh Williams seems to have earned the respect of the corporate partners as well and with aspirations for Sunday racing that is not a bad endorsement to have.

Williams understands the difficulties of finding long term partners and is thankful for each one he has.

“Keeping partners in this sport is extremely hard but I have built a great relationship with all of my partners and we both continue to grow together. We have built a family and we aren’t stopping until we make it to the top”

When asked about Sundays Williams had this to say “It has never been a matter of if just a matter of when. If you go to my Twitter profile and look at my quote it is how I approach my day-to-day life. “When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe then you will be successful.”

But then mass-market decadence usually is. Premiering on Netflix next week Shonda Rhimes’s Inventing Anna is a lavishly produced nine-episode limited series starring Julia Garner as Anna Sorokin the convicted fraudster who lived large on borrowed credit cards before doing prison time for a host of felonies most notably grand larceny.

Sorokin is also a former friend of mine. We first met in 2016 about six years into my job as a photo producer at Vanity Fair while out in New York one evening with friends who introduced us.

It wasn’t until she left me $60000 in debt after a now infamous trip to Morocco that I began to see her true colors. Later I worked with the police to organize the sting operation that put her behind bars and the world got to see her true colors too—at least for a time.

The author with Sorokin on the lavish Morocco trip that Sorokin promised she’d pay her back for—and never did.

I was not involved in the making of Inventing Anna in which Scandal veteran Katie Lowes plays me. Netflix describes my character as “a natural-born follower” whose “blind worship of Anna almost destroys her job her credit and her life.”

Hyperbole aside Anna does have a remarkable ability to influence anyone she may deem useful to her. Garner’s own public reflections after visiting her in prison: “When you meet Anna you realize she’s actually kind of a genius and she’s incredibly charming and really hilarious” the actress told one outlet. And to another: “She was really really sweet … very gentle … and very smart.... She did all these [terrible things] but people liked her obviously. And when I met her I understand why.”

Garner said this after spending only a short period of time with Anna. Imagine how I felt after a months-long friendship with someone who—unbeknownst to me—literally made it her livelihood to deceive people.

It wasn’t until Anna left me $60000 in debt after a now infamous trip to Morocco that I began to see her true colors.

Yet despite my potential objections I can understand the series’s appeal. After all during the course of my friendship with Anna I too was amused and absorbed by her charismatic ability to shock confound charm and entertain.

Inventing Anna traces the con woman’s trajectory from fake heiress to real-life inmate.

And it’s these very same qualities combined with misrepresentations of her either as a “downtown Robin Hood-like figure who was stealing from the rich and giving to the poor” as Russian critic Anna Khachiyan put it to The New York Observer or as a high-fashion huckster who had to “fake it until she could make it” in her bid to achieve the American Dream (a courtroom contrivance used by her lawyer Todd Spodek) that ultimately catapulted her into the realm of cult celebrity. From there fascination and even admiration for the so-called socialite scammer gave rise to veritable Internet fandom.

“She’s an interesting character” Garner said in an interview. “And whether you love her or hate her you listen to what she’s going to say because she’s like a star.”

Indeed people are listening in part because they are charmed by Anna the same way I was (and Garner was and Jessica Pressler whose New York magazine story about Anna was adapted for the Netflix series was).

“I don’t care what you think of me” Anna told a reporter during an interview following her release from prison. (She served less than 4 years of her 4-to-12-year sentence after being found guilty in a New York courtroom in 2019.) She continued her tone dismissive “I don’t need your approval. I don’t need to impress you.”

She may not need the media’s approval but she does need its attention. And she knows statements like these will generate clicks. That they also reveal an appalling if unsurprising absence of remorse and an aversion to self-reflection is something she knows most people won’t dwell on too closely.

But there’s a bigger reason people are listening to Anna Sorokin: Netflix. The streaming company got in early initiating talks with Anna about a series following her arraignment and officially securing her life rights nearly a year before her court case even began.

Now it is poised to do what it does best: disseminate her splashy alter ego across the screens of its hundreds of millions of subscribers.

“Whether you love her or hate her you listen to what she’s going to say because she’s like a star” Garner said in an interview.

For Anna and Netflix alike attention is stock-in-trade. Consider that whatever scruples audiences may have with Inventing Anna whether they celebrate or scrutinize its dubious depictions any controversy that ensues is sure to attract an even wider audience.

If controversy is good for ratings why not re-cast the villain as the victor a stick-it-to-the-man feminist icon? Why not glow-up the felon gloss over the gaslighting and go for a story line as teased in Inventing Anna’s trailer that’s “completely true … except for the parts that are totally made up”?

We all want to be entertained. After the past two years who doesn’t crave an escape an all-expenses-paid adventure that takes us from frigid Manhattan to sun-drenched Marrakech? The invitation’s allure is hard to deny.

Take it from someone who knows: This is the art of the con a shell game that proffers irresistible thrills for low stakes while a sleight of hand carries out the high-roller business unseen. Netflix isn’t just putting out a fictional story. It’s effectively running a con woman’s P.R.—and putting money in her pocket.

Money Talks

People have never loved grift stories as much as they do today and media companies are competing to give viewers what they want. In the case of Anna Sorokin Netflix moved so quickly that their involvement influenced the nature of the very story they intended to dramatize.

Sorokin strikes a pose in New York City in spring 2021 between arrests.

Sorokin’s lawyer Todd Spodek who represented his client in both her criminal and entertainment proceedings was financed by Netflix money—the company paid Anna $30000 pre-trial which went toward Spodek’s fees plus an additional sum after her conviction that the state required her to use in part to cover the balance. (Spodek will also be featured as a character in the TV series.)

In addition to funding her criminal defense Netflix provided Anna with so much cash that even after some victims recouped their losses (thanks to a judge’s invocation of the “Son of Sam” law) she finished her prison sentence with capital leftover—seemingly enough to burn on Balenciaga and then some. (In 2019 a judge found Anna not guilty for failing to pay me back for the Morocco trip.)

Whether Anna’s own self-stylings would have been sufficient to re-invent her brand is something we’ll never know because a juggernaut of Netflix marketing pros took the reins the minute she was released from prison in early 2021 repositioning the character of “Anna Delvey” from fraudster to front-row.

Take it from someone who knows: This is the art of the con.



Even now that Anna is back behind bars this time for overstaying her visa (she is German by nationality) her voice is being given a pedestal. Just this week Insider released an essay written by Anna from prison in New Jersey.

In case anyone had any doubts Anna is characteristically unapologetic in her piece titled “Erasing Anna.” Instead she asks for our pity—“Did I mention I’m the only woman in ICE custody in this whole jail?”—while appealing to the social-media set who will inevitably help her story go viral: “Tell me I’m special without telling me I’m special.”

When true stories are cycled and recycled—in everything from documentaries and dramatizations to magazine stories and memes—the “continuous looping and reformatting … results in the blurring of fact and fiction” writes Ray Surette a professor of criminal justice who studies the meeting of modern media and the criminal-justice system. “People come to believe that fictional events are real that real events didn’t happen and that hybrid—part real part fiction—events are common.”

Because of Netflix Anna emerged from behind bars financially net positive with legions of followers and a level of notoriety from which she’ll presumably continue to profit. (Full disclosure: I wrote a book about my experiences with Anna in 2019. My goal in sharing the story was to give a firsthand account of the truth—and a good thing too considering the way the actual events have been warped into a sensationalized narrative that’s holding on to reality by a thread at best. Also I was $60000 in debt.)

Relishing her post-prison fame in conversation with 60 Minutes Australia she took a moment to reflect on her past. “It turned out pretty well.... I feel like I just did all—like I just had all these amazing experiences and I’m going to write a book about it so I don’t regret it personally.”

The con-as-content model seems well on its way to becoming an aspirational career path.

On Friday it was confirmed that Zak had joined our Driver Academy here at Grove and tonight on his 17th birthday he has now claimed this prestigious accolade.

The youngster earned his initial nomination thanks to a stellar performance in his debut GB3 season which saw him coast to the title with a 164-point margin from his nearest challenger.

After impressing at the two-day test at Silverstone along with in fitness assessments and in the simulator prior to the track action the panel decided that Zak would join the acclaimed list of previous winners.

Shortly after being presented with his trophy we caught up with the understandably thrilled racer.

“I was happy enough with the nomination so to win is pretty awesome” Zak said.

“I really enjoyed the experience back in October but to go home with the prize is the icing on the cake.

“It’s massive for a young driver like myself who is still developing their career; so many past Formula One drivers have won the award. It's surreal and I’m so proud to be on that list.

Young

State House News Service

BOSTON — Encore Boston Harbor and its parent company Wynn Resorts will be ready this week to brief the Massachusetts Gaming Commission on its scaled-back plan to develop land across Broadway in Everett to include an entertainment venue restaurants and parking garage a commission official said.

Three weeks ago the Gaming Commission's chief of community affairs was prepared to brief commissioners on the plan that was set to include an 1800-seat entertainment venue about 20000 square feet of restaurant space and a garage with about 2200 spaces. But he said he heard from casino officials early in January that they had ""decided to pause the permitting process for this development so that they can do some reevaluation on whether the development as proposed is the best use for the site.""

Joe Delaney the community affairs chief said he got a call recently from Jacqui Krum Encore Boston Harbor's senior vice president and general counsel saying the casino company was now ""ready to go.""

""She had indicated to me that they had reduced the size of the theater the entertainment venue to under 1000 seats — whether that's 900 950 999 I don't know we'll be finding that out very shortly — with that they said they intend to keep the pedestrian crossing across Broadway and so on and the exact location of that will depend on whether or not the venue is considered part of the gaming establishment. So we'll talk about all of those things.""

The Gaming Commission was planning to take up that question of whether a development across the street from the casino would be considered part of Encore's technical ""gaming establishment"" footprint and therefore subject to the commission's regulatory oversight and the provisions of the state's expanded gaming law when Encore officials opted to hit the pause button last month.

The presentation at the commission's meeting on Thursday will be followed by a commission staff report on the issues at play and a question-and-answer period for commissioners. A public hearing to allow community members or others to present verbal testimony on the development is being planned for later this month and a commission decision is expected in March.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbGxhaGFzc2VlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3RhZDA2Mzk5M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thaxton Deon Wynn Obituary,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

Kathy Hochul wants to end that moratorium this year allowing up to three casinos to open downstate. And already nine gambling giants are eager to bid on the contracts and are likely to offer grandiose plans for casinos hotels and entertainment venues to boost their proposals.

Some are even making the pitch that a new gaming hall could help the nation’s most populous city repair its pandemic-scarred economy.

“I believe in New York City. I think we are going to come back. Gaming has a proven potential to be an anchor in that recovery” Soo Kim chair of the Bally’s Corp. who grew up in Queens said in an interview.

The operators submitted preliminary details in December to the state Gaming Commission on their plans for New York City-area casinos.

They include the Resorts World New York City in Queens owned by Malaysian conglomerate Genting Group and the MGM-owned Empire City Casino in Yonkers just north of the Bronx. Both are horse racetracks with video-lottery terminals and are already among the largest gaming operations in the nation; now they want to become full-scale casinos with table games and slot machines and win two of the three licenses.

“We are ready to deliver thousands of new jobs for Westchester and the Bronx while generating $1 billion in new economic activity with a full gaming license” MGM said in a statement. “Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts is ready to roar.”

A Manhattan casino? Maybe

A New York City casino is considered a crown jewel of the U.S. gambling sector — the largest untapped market in the largest metropolitan area in the nation with a population of 20 million people and a steady stream of tourists.

For decades New York has watched its residents travel to Atlantic City N.J. or to Native American casinos in eastern Connecticut to gamble losing out on the tax revenue that would come from gamblers staying closer to home.

But that may soon change — and labor unions real-estate firms and casino giants are eager to go all-in on building out the city’s gambling potential.

“With a responsible approach to pursuing new casino licenses downstate we have a unique and timely opportunity to put unemployed hospitality workers back to work while also giving our economy a much needed boost” said Rich Maroko president of the New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council a politically influential labor union that’s backing a proposal to turn Resorts World at Aqueduct Racetrack into a full-fledged casino.

In 2013 New York voters approved a referendum to allow seven private casino licenses and a year later the state Legislature passed a law that ultimately allowed four upstate casinos in the Finger Lakes Catskills Albany area and the state’s Southern Tier along its border with Pennsylvania. Those casinos were given a five-year exclusivity in New York. The facilities have all struggled since opening partially due to their limited draw and now due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

But state lawmakers seem receptive to opening up the bids for downstate casinos this year — rather than wait until 2023 — as a way to bolster the state’s coffers. They would need to overturn the 2014 law.

Each new license would likely include a $500 million initiation fee plus the promise of major construction projects that would mean thousands of new jobs as the economy tries to recover from the pandemic.

“It’s going to happen soon enough anyway. If we’re ready to do it and all the infrastructure is in place and the regulatory structure is in place why not do it sooner?” said state Sen. Mike Gianaris the chamber’s deputy leader and a Queens Democrat.

Where would a casino go?

In addition to Resorts World in Queens which is owned by the Malaysia-based Genting Group and MGM in Yonkers there are a number of other suitors.

UE Resorts International Inc.; Las Vegas Sands Corp.; Wynn Resorts; Rush Street Gaming; Hard Rock International; Bally’s Corporation and the Water Club in Manhattan also submitted proposals. All the details were redacted by the state Gaming Commission.

The companies are all surveying the city for potential locations for Las Vegas-style casino resorts.

Hard Rock Hotel New York is set to open in Times Square in April and may be interested in a casino in the heart of the tourist district or another part of the city. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

And the new Hudson Yards development west of Penn Station — the largest private real estate project in American history — could also be a potential target for a posh new casino resort.

While a casino in Manhattan would appear to be a top draw for developers it would come with intense scrutiny regulatory hurdles and likely community opposition industry officials and lawmakers said.

“My concern representing Manhattan and Times Square is the neighborhoods which would be adjacent to any proposed casino and the impact. Casinos can have negative externalities to put it mildly” said state Sen. Brad Hoylman a Democrat.

“I oppose them strongly and generally have done so in the Legislature. When it is in my Senate district it is even a greater concern.”

Kim the Bally’s chair also noted issues with a Manhattan casino saying it would be hard to access for many visitors despite the tourists that flock there.

And a Manhattan casino could expedite previously failed efforts to put a casino in northern New Jersey.

Hard Rock for example has expressed interest in a New York City casino and one at northern New Jersey’s Meadowlands Racetrack near Metlife Stadium home to the Giants and Jets NFL teams. New Jersey voters would need to approve such a move.

So some bidders are expected to look to the outer boroughs for a casino where it would be more accessible by car and could face potentially fewer political obstacles than in heavily congested Manhattan.

Sands has reportedly been eyeing land near Citi Field in Queens home to the New York Mets in conjunction with the team owner Steven Cohen a billionaire hedge fund manager.

Adjacent Willets Point an industrial neighborhood long sought for redevelopment might also be a consideration for bidders as well as state-owned land at Belmont Park on Long Island just outside the city borders.

What happens next?

A decision to allow New York City-area casinos would likely would be part of state budget negotiations for the fiscal year that starts April 1.

If approved the state Gaming Commission would then set up a bidding process for casino hopefuls to submit their proposals and the selections would be made by a task force — similar to the process in 2014 when the upstate casinos were picked.

Empire City in Yonkers and Resorts World in Queens would appear to be frontrunners to win two of the contracts because of political support their existing massive footprints and so-called speed to market meaning they would easily be able to switch to full-scale casinos. A new casino could take as much as three years to build and open some officials estimated.

The state could also decide to look elsewhere.

“The state is going to look to maximize net new revenues and net new job growth in making the decision on where to locate them” said Clyde Barrow a professor of political science at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley who specializes in gaming policy.

Barrow warned about the state and casino developers viewing New York City casinos as a sure bet with huge jackpots awaiting. Unlike many casinos that have limited competition for consumers’ entertainment dollar the city has more choices than anywhere in the country.

“When you put a casino in the middle of nowhere or in a small city there are limited alternative entertainment venues competing against it” Barrow said.

“But when you put a casino in Manhattan or in Queens you are competing against every other entertainment amusement and recreation facility in that city so it is a vastly more competitive market in which people have lots of other alternatives on how to spend their entertainment dollars.”

And he cautioned: “It will generate hundreds of millions of dollars but it won’t be anywhere near the revenue generation forecasts.”

Karn generating station on the shore of Saginaw Bay.

But shutting down the 544-megawatt plant doesn’t eliminate almost $700 million in unrecovered investments in Karn — costs that will fall to the utility’s 1.8 million customers even after the plant is no longer generating electricity.

A recent decision by the Michigan Public Service Commission aims to help. Regulators voted last month to allow Consumers Energy to refinance the unrecovered investments with low-interest ratepayer-backed bonds — a move expected to save customers $126 million over the next eight years and at least indirectly ease the shift away from coal.

It is the second time the PSC has approved such a refinancing to reduce costs related to unrecovered investments in shuttered coal plants.

The refinancing known as securitization is allowed in Michigan under a law adopted in 2000 as the state’s utility industry was undergoing a transition to deregulation. Today the financial tool is being used to help out with a different industry shift as utilities seek to replace older fossil plants with carbon-free energy.

And like a 1990s fad that’s suddenly cool again securitization is a hot topic in statehouses across the country.

Twenty-five states plus Washington and Puerto Rico have securitization laws in place. The list includes Colorado New Mexico and Montana all of which passed legislation in recent years to allow for the refinancing of unrecovered coal plant investments.

Securitization legislation was pre-filed in Missouri last month and bills are expected in Kansas and Minnesota in the coming weeks. The idea is also getting a close look in Indiana.

In each case the policy is getting traction among consumer groups utilities and environmental advocates alike all of which see potential benefits.

""We need to address this issue of legacy investments and how to make the transition and do it in a way that creates a win for both investors and customers"" said Ashok Gupta a senior energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Gupta became familiar with securitization working in New York 25 years ago when the state was restructuring its retail electric market and grappling with how to handle so-called stranded costs — utility power plant investments that might go unrecovered in a competitive market.

Now in the Midwest he’s advocating for adoption of the policy tool in Missouri and Kansas states where the big utilities still own more than 10 gigawatts of coal-fired generation.

While NRDC’s primary interest is addressing climate change Gupta stresses that securitization isn’t about shutting down coal plants. Rather it’s a financial tool to more broadly manage costs and deal with industry transitions.

And in deep-red states saving consumers money and improving the business climate is a better selling point than cutting carbon.

""This is near-term savings that you can create. You can get real benefits for consumers right now"" Gupta said. ""I’m willing to be the co-benefit.""

A ‘deal breaker’

Securitization has been used for years to help manage a variety of challenges in the utility industry.

In Florida it was used to help blunt the rate impact when the grid was rebuilt following hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 and again years later to mitigate the effect of the early retirement of a Duke Energy Corp. nuclear reactor. The California Legislature more recently passed a bill to let utilities securitize costs related to COVID-19.

Securitization was also recently approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to lower the costs associated with $100 million of unrecovered investments in We Energies’ Pleasant Prairie coal plant which shut down in 2018.

While the topic of securitization has seized the attention of policymakers supporters acknowledge it’s a complex issue.

It also is reemerging as legislators grapple with more pressing issues such as the pandemic. Also getting utilities and consumer interests to sign off on details of securitization legislation is akin to threading a needle. A policy that too heavily favors one side or the other can be a deal breaker.

St. Louis-based Ameren Missouri and Evergy headquartered in Kansas City Mo. have previously opposed securitization bills in Missouri and in Kansas. But at least one of the utilities has since changed its stance.

""We believe there is a desire for this important tool and will be supporting securitization legislation this year in both states"" Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said in an emailed statement.

The utilities have proposed billions of dollars in renewable energy investments and are thought to be more receptive to the idea since accelerating retirements of older fossil units would create room for new capacity.

Warren Wood a vice president for Ameren Missouri who oversees legislative and regulatory policy development said the utility doesn’t need securitization to green its power mix over the next two decades. But he said it could be a ""useful tool."" If done right ""all of the parties can come out ahead"" he said. ""This is achievable.""

It’s not just utilities that have warmed to the idea. Kansas’ top utility regulator has also weighed in to support securitization legislation saying the policy had benefits for all utilities and consumers alike.

""Hopefully everybody will sharpen their pencils and get serious about it"" Kansas Corporation Commission Chair Susan Duffy said during an energy conference presentation last month.

A key for utilities generally is that they be allowed to share in the benefits by reinvesting at least some portion of the amount of rate base that’s wiped out — investments on which their shareholders can profit.

It’s a practice referred to as ""capital recycling"" and is a key consideration for utility shareholders.

Consumer groups too see potential benefits in securitization but also pitfalls.

State Rep. Jamie Long (D). | Minnesota House of Representatives

David Woodsmall a lobbyist for the Midwest Energy Consumers Group whose members include some of the state’s largest commercial and industrial energy users said utilities should be allowed to recover investments in power plants that are shut down ahead of schedule.

But allowing utilities to earn any kind of return on amounts that are securitized is a ""deal breaker"" he said.

In Minnesota state Rep. Jamie Long (D) the incoming chair of the Energy and Climate Finance and Policy Division Committee has been interested in the topic for a couple of years. He introduced legislation in the House last year. But a COVID-19-shortened session kept the bill from being heard.

Long plans to introduce a bill in the coming weeks to allow securitization which he said can benefit consumers and also local communities that are home to older retiring coal-fired plants and the associated workers who will lose their jobs.

""I think that’s a key piece of the clean energy transition"" he said in an interview. ""I’m definitely interested in reintroducing the bill and moving forward with a full hearing.""

Which coal plants might retire?

Minnesota has been a leader among Midwestern states in reducing its dependence on coal-fired generation. The state today has just four coal plants still running and one of them — the 150 MW Hoot Lake plant — is set to shut down this year.

Two Xcel Energy Inc. coal plants totaling more than 2700 MW are set to be retired between 2023 and 2028 and some of the existing units are operated seasonally as of last year.

Only one Minnesota coal plant doesn’t have an early retirement date: the last two units at Minnesota Power’s 823 MW Boswell plant. Two older units shut down in 2018.

But that could change. Minnesota Power is due to file its 15-year integrated resource plan with the state Public Utilities Commission on Feb. 1. The Duluth Minn.-based utility a unit of Allete Inc. became the first utility in the state to reach 50% renewable energy last month and is planning further steps to slash carbon emissions.

Along with it Minnesota Power is required to file a study evaluating the potential for retiring Boswell early as well as the second phase of a study being conducted with the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) on the possible use of securitization if there’s a decision to shut down the plant. The first phase was filed in October.

Julie Pierce the utility’s vice president of strategy and planning said there are myriad considerations when looking at the plant’s future not the least of which is reliability of the grid in the Upper Plains. Ratepayer impact is also key she said.

As of last fall there was $780 million left to be paid off on the Boswell plant from investments in pollution controls that were made as recently as 2015. Those unrecovered investments are just one of the challenges in retiring the plant ahead of schedule. Another: the impact to tiny Cohasset Minn. and the surrounding area.

The Boswell plant represents about 70% of the city’s tax base and a significant source of revenue for the county and local school district.

Another challenge is the makeup of Minnesota Power’s customer base and the volatility of its revenue. A handful of taconite production plants and paper and pulp mills make up the bulk of its electricity sales and several of those plants were idled during the pandemic.

""When you have a customer profile that ebbs and flows in big ways and has big swings that makes it more difficult to manage a tool like securitization"" Pierce said.

It’s not that securitization can’t work but that it must be tailored specifically to the state and utilities involved according to Pierce.

""It is not a one-size-fits-all type of tool"" she said. ""That’s why we really wanted to partner with RMI to look at it in the Minnesota context with our regulations our statutes our ratemaking.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcHVja3NhbmRwaXRjaGZvcmtzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzA1L25ldy1qZXJzZXktZGV2aWxzLTUtYmVzdC1hbGwtc3Rhci1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZXMtZnJhbmNoaXNlLWhpc3Rvcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Jersey Devils: 5 Best All-Star Performances In Franchise History,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9uaGwvbWVldC10aGUtcGFyZW50cy1raXJpbGwta2Fwcml6b3ZzLW1vbS1hbmQtZGFkLWZpbmFsbHktc2VlLWhpbS1pbi13aWxkLXN3ZWF0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the parents: Kirill Kaprizov's mom and dad finally see him in Wild sweater,"As effortless as Kirill Kaprizov has made the transition to the NHL look over the past couple of seasons make no mistake it hasn’t always been easy for the 24-year-old Russian star.

He moved halfway across the world by himself and while the Wild locker room has provided a good support system there’s been an obvious void in Kaprizov’s life with parents Oleg and Natasha back in his native Russia.

While their son was making a name for himself on the ice here in America winning the Calder Trophy last season as the NHL’s top rookie Oleg and Natasha were battling the time change so they could watch him in real time. They hadn’t seen him play in person until last week when they attended a game between the Wild and New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden.

“It was tough not having them come to America” Kaprizov said through a Russian translator. “You kind of get used to it. But of course it’s much better when they are around.”

The past couple of years have taught Kaprizov a lot about himself. Not only has he navigated the language barrier largely on his own he has found ways to stay busy away from the rink with the pandemic still limiting interactions off the ice.

Asked about some of his favorite things Kaprizov hilariously switched from Russian to English to express his affinity for video games. He also enjoys Russian television shows from time to time still searching for an American television show that piques his interest.

As challenging as the past couple of years have been at times for Kaprizov the past week or so has been an absolute joy.

After his parents got to see him play at Madison Square Garden they met some of his teammates at the team hotel in New York City. A couple of nights later they got to watch the Wild take on the New York Islanders at UBS Arena and fittingly Kaprizov scored a goal in that game.

“It feels amazing” Kaprizov said of having his parents around for a couple of weeks. “I think every player can relate to having his mother and father there.”

The jet lag slowly started to catch up with Oleg and Natasha upon arriving in the Twin Cities earlier this week. They hung out at Kaprizov’s apartment in Minneapolis getting to see their son’s home and stayed there while the Wild traveled to Chicago for a game against the Blackhawks.

Asked if his mom made him borscht or any of his other favorite Russian dishes Kaprizov replied “Not yet. She’s a little tired.” He paused before delivering the punchline adding “When I get back from the road trip it’ll all be ready for me.”

It might have to wait though because Kaprizov is now in Las Vegas with his parents for NHL All Star Weekend. It will be another special moment for Oleg and Natasha as they watch Kaprizov compete in the skills competition on Friday night and the game on Saturday afternoon.

“The whole experience is going to be amazing” Kaprizov said. “It’s going to be very fun and exciting to play. I’m just excited about the whole experience. Everything is going to be pretty awesome.”

As much as Kaprizov will miss his parents when they return to Russia he’s grateful for the time they’ve been able to spend together. He’s also getting more comfortable with his new life in America with each day.

“It’s definitely gotten a lot easier” he said. “You meet new people. I get to go to some cool places and people start recognizing me. You make friends. It’s been a great experience.”

Wrestling remained the winter king and coach Scot Davishad assembled a lineup so strong that it was ready to go headgear-to-headgear with the Apple Valley dynasty.

Owatonna had defeated Apple Valley 40-24 early in the regular season ending the Eagles' 199-match winning streak against Minnesota teams. And now on late Friday afternoon Feb. 25 they were set to meet again in the Class 3A semifinals at Xcel Energy Center.

""Usually the fans for the wrestlers that are done for the afternoon … they leave'' said Davis then Owatonna's coach. ""Not that time. Everyone stayed. There had to be more than 10000 fans. It was nuts in there.''

Apple Valley had won six titles in a row entering that showdown with its longtime oft-beaten Owatonna rivals. Apple Valley would win 12 more titles in a row including a co-championship with St. Michael-Albertville in 2013.

But on that day in St. Paul …

""The match was tied [24-24] going into the heavyweights'' Davis said. ""Apple Valley had an outstanding heavyweight big strong kid and we had Schweisthal … a 198-pound sophomore.

""Kyle got a takedown in the last minute and won the match for us. Kyle Schweisthal and that takedown live on in Owatonna athletics.''

Owatonna rolled over Simley on Saturday night to win the 3A title. There were these notations of dual meet records in the Star Tribune coverage: Owatonna 60-1 and Simley 23-7.

Which takes us 17 winters into the future to Thursday evening at Maple Grove High School where the St. Cloud Crush — a wrestling cooperative of Cathedral Apollo Tech and Granite City Baptist high schools — was set to take on Osseo and Maple Grove as part of a triangular meet.

This put Davis in his first St. Cloud season on the cusp of 1200 dual wins according to his meticulous records from quick stops at three high schools before his tremendous 25 seasons at Owatonna and stops at seven high schools in five states since the winter of 2012-13.

The big round 1200th came decisively with the Crush defeating Osseo 57-18 in the first match. A few minutes later there was a public address announcement of Davis' historic victory the small crowd stood and applauded and then out came a large congratulatory banner for the wrestlers to display along with their coach.

This was followed by a 49-28 win over host Maple Grove No. 1201 and then the bus ride back to St. Cloud followed by Davis' 35-mile drive to Upsala where he stays with a long-ago coaching buddy during the week rather than commute from home in Owatonna.

Sorry Scot: As enjoyable as it was to see the happiness of family members including wife Mary and granddaughter Taylan on Thursday it's now time to address those less-than-huge controversies at Owatonna.

There was the one-year suspension based on Minnesota State High School League rules for alleged ""recruiting'' that wound up ending Davis' career at Owatonna after the 2009-10 season.

This was caused by the arrival in Owatonna of a wrestler from California. It does seem likely the MSHSL's dispute with Davis' arithmetic on the piling up of wins caused the league to be skeptical of his explanations.

That math problem was triggered by Davis' wonderful job building up Owatonna wrestling to the point he had as many as 70 worthy upperclassmen in the varsity room.

""Everyone wants to wrestle varsity'' Davis said this week. ""If they don't get to you're going to lose some of them and knowing what wrestling does for these young people … you don't want to see that.''

According to Davis it said right there in the MSHSL guidelines that unlimited team matches were permitted along with 36 bouts per wrestler.

Davis took advantage of the ""unlimited"" by sending out a couple of different varsity teams to different locations on occasion.

Thus 2005: Owatonna 61 duals finals foe Simley 30.

It came to be that Dave Stead the MSHSL's executive director would not sign off when Davis submitted paperwork for his win tabulations to be recognized by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).

The league's bottom line is this: A school can only have one varsity team not two or more.

Davis is the first high school coach to reach 1200 wins in duals. I saw that with my own eyes Thursday night. Sadly the NFHS is sticking with Rex Peckinpaugh the retired coach at New Castle Ind. as the record-holder at 1001.

Yet onward goes Scot Davis invigorating programs adding wins. A coaching career that started at Bellecourt N.D. on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in 1976 has put him in seven high schools in five states since the winter of 2012-13 and now he's teamed with Bob Boeck trying to put some life back into St. Cloud's once-dynamic high school wrestling scene.

""We only have 30-some wrestlers grades seven through 12'' Davis said. ""We had that many in the ninth grade at one time in Owatonna. But wrestlers still want to compete want to get better want to win.

""They were 9-12 here last winter. We're 18-4 now.''",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDYvZ2FsZXN2aWxsZS1idXNpbmVzcy1uZWFyLXRvdGFsLWxvc3MtYWZ0ZXItc3VuZGF5LW1vcm5pbmctZmlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galesville business 'a near total loss' after Sunday morning fire,"GALESVILLE Wis.

Corporate lobbying is often criticised for allowing powerful companies undue influence over the democratic process. But if it works small investors will now at least be able to grab their share of the spoils.

New York-based Strategas Asset Management has unveiled an exchange traded fund designed to tap into companies’ efforts to increase their profitability by lobbying the US federal government.

Dan Clifton head of policy research and lead portfolio manager for the Strategas Global Policy Opportunities ETF (SAGP) said the launch aimed to capitalise on the US experiencing “the most politically volatile period since the end of the Civil War with the party in power having changed in seven of the last eight election cycles.

“One year it is tax cuts or healthcare reform then it gets taken away. Companies are now saying they have a greater risk to their business from Washington than from other risks” Clifton added.

“They understand that they need to be at the table as part of the process in Washington. We believe these companies have an earnings advantage over other companies.”

The ETF will build on Strategas’ existing policy opportunities portfolio which is only available to institutional investors via separate accounts.

However while that strategy is focused purely on large and mid-cap US stocks SAGP also encompasses small caps and non-US companies.

Clifton argued that smaller companies may get more bang from their lobbying buck than large ones which might have to spend on lobbying every year as a form of “maintenance” around issues such as workers’ rights and healthcare.

“Small companies see this as a R&D expense. They say ‘we are going to get a return on this’. Small and mid-cap have had a tremendous performance in backtesting. It’s the first time we are incorporating that style” Clifton said.

Annual lobbying spending in the US has averaged $3.5bn in recent years according to Statista with the pharmaceuticals electronics and insurance sectors having the largest outlay.

However rather than total spending SAGP weights companies based on their “lobbying intensity” taking into account their size.

“If [the weightings] were just calculated on the basis of lobbying spend we would have Amazon Google and AT&T. None of these companies are in the basket. We need to find companies where the earnings benefits [from successful lobbying] would be the greatest” Clifton said.

The initial portfolio is heavy with drug and biotech companies such as Japan’s Astellas Pharma Germany’s Fresenius Medical Care and Biogen of the US. But it also includes drinks companies Brown-Forman and Diageo; tobacco giants Altria Group and Philip Morris International; and purveyors of fast-food such as Domino’s Pizza and Yum Brands.

Defence stocks such as Lockheed Martin General Dynamics and BAE Systems are also well represented.

Clifton cited the successful efforts of biotech companies to help water down proposals to lower prescription drug prices as an example of SAGP’s investment thesis.

The pre-existing policy opportunities portfolio has had a disappointing performance in recent years undershooting the S&P 500 every year since 2018.

Clifton attributed this partly to its sectoral tilts namely its low exposure to technology stocks and overweighting of pharma and defence which have not been helpful in recent years.

He also cited the geopolitical hurdles that frustrated lobbyists’ efforts to limit the impact of then-president Donald Trump’s trade tariffs in 2018.

The ETF’s thesis may raise eyebrows however. “If corporate lobbying spend can be tracked to excess profits I think that does raise some questions for that particular company or industry” said Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar.

Nevertheless Lamont said it was “not the only ETF that has strayed into a moral or an ethical grey area” citing the BAD ETF which invests in gambling alcohol and drugs as another example.

Todd Rosenbluth head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research said despite the belief held by some that “government policy should be done on behalf of the people without corporate interest” he did not think most investors or Americans at large viewed the practice as unethical.

Rosenbluth drew allusions to the Democratic Large-Cap Core Fund (DEMZ) and the Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF (MAGA) which invest in companies supportive of Democrat and Republican candidates respectively but added that SAGP was at least “playing on both sides of the aisle so you don’t have to be politically affiliated to one or the other to invest in it”. Moreover it offered a portfolio “you are not going to find elsewhere”.

Still Nathan Geraci president of the ETF Store a Kansas-based financial adviser said SAGP’s challenge “will be overcoming any perception of partisanship or political tie-ins.

“Corporate lobbying inevitably becomes intertwined with politics and thus can become emotionally charged at times. Most advisers prefer not mixing politics with portfolios for just that reason.”

Geraci also noted that the EventShares US Legislative Opportunities ETF (PLCY) which focused on stocks its managers believed would gain from changes in government policy and regulation closed down in August 2020 with assets of just $23mn.

“Ultimately the success of this ETF will hinge on performance and marketing itself as entirely politically neutral” he added.

Clifton said he could “understand that people would say this is bad it feels dirty” but defended both corporate lobbying and his fund.

“The beauty of the American system is that everybody is involved. NGOs labour unions . . . I would argue there might be more power on that side than on the corporate side” he said.

“We believe in lobbying. It helps avoid mistakes. If you are not at the table you are going to be on the menu.”

As for SAGP “we don’t make the rules” Clifton said “we just figured out there was alpha there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L2NoZXF1YW4tbGV3aXMtcGl6emEtaHV0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pizza Hut's new COO on making restaurants easier to operate while elevating the experience: 'We'll be able to win ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2022/02/06/chequan-lewis-pizza-hut.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAyLzA2L2NoZXF1YW4tbGV3aXMtcGl6emEtaHV0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNDgxODU2L3RoaXMtZW1wbG95ZWUtdmlkZW8tc2hvd3MtaG93LWtmYy1wb3QtcGllcy1hcmUtcmVhbGx5LW1hZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Employee Video Shows How KFC Pot Pies Are Really Made,"This Employee Video Shows How KFC Pot Pies Are Really Made

Kentucky Fried Chicken may have been known for its buckets of fried chicken ever since opening its first franchise location in 1952. But since it began selling pot pies in 1995 (via the Los Angeles Times) they have arguably become just as much of a staple on the menu. Originally introduced as a limited edition item in a select part of the country KFC's pot pies didn't sound destined to take off all that significantly (via Fast Food Menu Prices). However the fast food chain decided to officially add them to its regular menu. In 2012 HuffPost reported that pot pies were made available in all the KFC locations across the U.S. Since then they have become one of KFC's most popular items.

Fast Food Menu Prices reports that marketing the pot pie as nostalgic comfort food played a major role in its long-term success. By continuing to use retro themes imagery and music in their commercials KFC managed to turn an old-fashioned favorite into a trendy throwback (via YouTube). If you count yourself among the pot pies' fans you may have wondered what makes them so good and perhaps more importantly what goes into making them at all. A video by a KFC employee apparently revealed how they're made.",,,

Two UTSA Roadrunners proudly wearing the ""210"" decaled helmets as Tariq Woolen and Spencer Burford join Marcus Davenport (2018) as the only UTSA players to represent the program at the annual All-Star game.

""One we are very proud of them"" UTSA head coach Jeff Traylor said. ""Two I'm very proud of how they're representing us down there. I have not coached them up on what to say or the 210 on the helmet. That is truly authentic. I'm mad at myself that I didn't think to use that for a recruiting tool.""

Burford and Woolen stayed busy at practice sessions this week meeting with several NFL teams ahead of Saturday's game. Next up will be the NFL Scouting Combine followed by their Pro Day at UTSA.



Woolen a cornerback saw his stock rise in Mobile. The tallest at his position of all the participants. He is eager to continue to showcase his attributes.

""Just a combination of my length and speed but just using it in press coverage too and not allowing guys to run by me"" he said.

His speed was a major talking point. Woolen clocked a blazing 22.45 miles per hour on the field fastest since Zebra Technology began providing that data at the Senior Bowl.

Woolen is not from San Antonio but the Ft. Worth native does consider it his second home. Burford an offensive lineman is from the Alamo City graduating from Wagner High School and was the first four star signee in UTSA program history. He started at left tackle for the America squad. He took the week to soak up as much knowledge as possible.



""Just focusing on getting more control"" he said. ""Focusing on the little things on and off the field being more disciplined in my routine and I feel like if I do that it will take care of itself.

Only two Roadrunners have heard their name called to date in the NFL Draft. David Morgan to the Vikings in the sixth round back in 2016 and Marcus Davenport went in the first round to the Saints in 2018. This year they have a chance to double that and more as running back Sincere McCormick will also participate in the Combine.

""They're really proud of UTSA and they really are committed to putting this place on the map"" head coach Jeff Traylor added.

As the program continues to rise UTSA will continue to produce NFL talent. Burford and Woolen were key pieces on a Conference USA championship campaign that also came with a national ranking for much of the year.



""Sky is the limit. Hopefully if everybody keeps taking the right steps and buys into the system and the culture that we established at UTSA wad the fist up and pound the fist then the sky is the limit for that program"" Burford said. ""If they keep taking the right steps I want it to be a powerhouse hopefully keep all of San Antonio local and just keep building off of that.""",,,,,,,,,

양산부산대병원은 지난 1월 18일 짐머바이오멧(Zimmer–Biomet) 사의 슬관절 인공관절 전치환술 로봇 ‘ROSA’를 도입했다.

로봇을 이용한 인공관절 전치환술은 퇴행성 무릎 관절염을 개선할 수 있도록 도와주는 치료로 숙련된 의사의 수술 기술에 로봇의 정확함이 더해져 수술 완성도를 높인다. 양산부산대병원 또한 이번 로봇 도입을 통해 수술 환자들에게 보다 안전하고 정확한 치료를 제공하는 것에 주안점을 두고 있다.

로봇‘ROSA’는 독자 개발한 이미징 프로토콜을 이용해 개인 맞춤적인 시술을 가능케 한다. 수술을 계획할 때부터 X선 스캔으로 환자에게 가장 적합한 인공관절 치환물의 크기 삽입 위치 등을 확인한다. 수술 중에도 실시간 센서로 환자의 무릎 정렬 및 움직임과 연부 조직의 긴장도를 매핑해주어 절단의 정확도와 임플란트의 정렬 그리고 관절 연조직의 균형 개선을 지원한다.

인공관절팀 관계자는 ""이번에 도입된 로봇 프로그램을 활용하면 가상시뮬레이션 뿐만 아니라 기존의 1° 1㎜ 보다 더욱 미세한 단위로 각도와 간격을 조정할 수 있어 수술 정확도를 개선시킨다”며 “기존 수술과 비교해 인공관절의 수명 향상과 합병증 위험 감소를 기대한다”고 말했다.

양산부산대병원은 향후 수술 로봇 교육 센터를 설립해 국내·외 정형외과 의사들의 로봇 술기 교육에 나서는 한편 고관절 및 견관절 등 수술 범위를 넓혀 보다 많은 환자에게 첨단 혜택을 제공할 것으로 기대된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,
