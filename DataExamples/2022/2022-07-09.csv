The chemicals have been added to nonstick cookware water-repellent clothing stain-resistant fabrics and carpets cosmetics firefighting foams food packaging and other products that resist grease oil and water.

PFAS persist in the environment and accumulate in people animals and aquatic life. These “forever chemicals” are in the blood of nearly every American including newborn babies.

Industry records show 3M and DuPont the chief manufacturers of PFAS hid what they knew about the dangers for decades. Beginning in the mid-2000s independent studies linked exposure to very small concentrations of certain PFAS to cancer birth defects reproductive and immune system harm high cholesterol and obesity.

Yet PFAS still aren’t regulated by the federal government.

The sun sets behind the control tower of the former Loring Air Force Base on July 18 2020 in Limestone Maine. The Air Force planned to test multiple sites at the former Loring Air Force Base for contamination by forever chemicals. Officials were concerned about PFAS contamination from firefighting foam used on Loring’s runway.

1938: A DuPont scientist inadvertently discovers polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE. Eight years later the company begins selling commercial products with PFTE under the Teflon brand.

1960: Food and Drug Administration approves Teflon nonstick cookware.

1961: DuPont confirms PFOA is toxic in animals and causes observable changes in organ functions.

1966: Working with 3M the U.S. Navy secures a patent for aqueous firefighting foam a PFAS-containing product. 3M sells it to fire departments in 5-gallon buckets.

1967: Food and Drug Administration approves Zonyl a PFAS coating DuPont sells for food packaging.

1970: A company that purchased 3M’s firefighting foam finds it kills fish prompting the abrupt halt of a pilot study.

1973: DuPont study documents liver damage from exposure to PFAS in food packaging.

1975: University of Florida researcher asks 3M whether Scotchgard and Teflon products are source of fluorinated chemicals detected in samples from New York and Texas blood banks. 3M executives “plead ignorance” but secretly confirm the findings.

1978: 3M concludes PFOA and PFOS “should be regarded as toxic.” DuPont worries PFOA might be causing ”toxic effects” among employees at its Teflon plant in West Virginia but does not share the information outside the company.

1980s: DuPont and 3M reassign female workers after children of Teflon plant employees are born with facial disfigurations and other birth defects. DuPont discovers high levels of the chemical in drinking water outside the Teflon plant. None of this is shared outside the company.

Early to mid-1990s: DuPont discovers increased rates of cancer among PFAS workers three years after 3M found a similar pattern among its workers.

1998: 3M scientist Richard Purdy tells his bosses PFOS moves throughout the food chain. The company warns the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the first time that PFOS accumulates in human blood.

1999: Purdy quits 3M in protest calling PFOS more damaging than banned PCBs.

2000: U.S. EPA pressures 3M to phase out the Scotchgard and Teflon chemicals PFOS and PFOA five months before DuPont settles a lawsuit that began unraveling the secret history of PFAS.

2002: U.S. EPA concludes that cancerous tumors in rats exposed to PFOA “are relevant to humans.”

2012: Landmark study of 70000 people living near DuPont’s Teflon plant links PFOA exposure to six diseases: testicular and kidney cancer high cholesterol ulcerative colitis thyroid disease and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

2013-14: During a nationwide study of select water systems U.S. EPA finds high levels of PFOA and PFOS in the drinking water of Freeport a small industrial city west of Rockford. Neither federal nor state officials look for the chemicals throughout the rest of Illinois.

A new water well will replace PFAS-contaminated wells near the old water treatment plant in Freeport Illinois Aug. 24 2021. Freeport is one of the Illinois cities where PFAS chemicals were tested for and detected in drinking water.

2016: U.S. EPA issues a more stringent health advisory for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water: 70 parts per trillion. President Barack Obama’s administration does not regulate the chemicals though.

The North Carolina State University researcher who found the chemical estimates at least 250000 people are at risk.

2018: 3M agrees to pay $850 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota after high levels of PFAS are detected in drinking water near one of the company’s manufacturing plants in Cottage Grove a Minneapolis suburb.

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson speaks during an interview at the State Capitol in St. Paul Minnesota on March 12 2018. Swanson said she’s particularly proud of the $850 million settlement she reached with 3M last month in a lawsuit alleging the manufacturer’s chemicals contaminated groundwater in the eastern Twin Cities metro area. It’s the largest environmental settlement in Minnesota history and the third-largest natural resource damage settlement in U.S. history.

2019: PFAS contaminate drinking water or groundwater at nearly 400 military bases that used firefighting foam the nonprofit Environmental Working Group finds. The number of bases with confirmed PFAS contamination jumps to 679 by July 2021.

2022: U.S. EPA issues new exponentially more stringent health advisories for PFOA and PFOS concluding after a review of the latest research that there is essentially no safe level of exposure in drinking water. The agency also issues its first health advisories for Gen X and PFBS chemicals that replaced PFOA and PFOS in many products. None of the advisories are enforceable but the Biden administration promises to announce legal standards later in 2022.

Ford created a GoFundMe fundraiser for the 54-year-old cook and cashier with the goal of $270 000 (R4.5 million) but the current amount has exceeded her expectations.

This all started when a video showing Ford proudly displaying the contents of the bag he was given by the fast food company for his loyalty went viral. The bag contained a movie ticket sweets a Starbucks cup two pens and other items. Social media users were not happy with Burger King saying the multinational company did not care nor appreciate the sacrifices Ford had made to achieve this feat.

DEREK FERGUSON insists son Lewis is ready for a life-changing move to Bologna.

The Serie A side are set to beat Lecce to a £3million deal for the Aberdeen midfielder.

1 Ferguson looks set to move to Italian side Bologna

Proud dad Derek says Ferguson junior won't be fazed by relocating to Italy for next season.

He said: ""Lewis just wants to become a better player.

""If it does come to fruition and it all goes smoothly he could be playing in Italy next season.

""He had a brilliant chance at Hamilton who were great for him and then Derek McInnes put him straight in the Aberdeen team.

""Lewis has had a great education at the club but I think it is time for him to move.

""He's not fazed by anything. He's really focused.

""Financially it will be a better move but I don't think that is what drives Lewis on.

""He's already met a target of getting in the Scotland squad and moving to Italy might enhance his chances of getting in the team.

""Lewis is going to go out with his girlfriend they are expecting a baby and it might be an Italian welcomed into the family!""

Ferguson senior who played for Rangers and Hearts admits he would have loved to play abroad.

And he believes following Aaron Hickey to Bologna could also lead to an English Premier League switch for his son down the line.

He said: ""I am excited. The one regret I have is not going to another country to play.

""I had the chance to go to Korea but I did my cruciate and that fell through.

""I applaud the guys who do it. Look at Aaron Hickey going over there.

""They took their time with him but once he got in that Bologna side he just flourished and he's got a brilliant move to Brentford now.

""That's one thing with Lewis he will be playing in Serie A but I know he wants to play in the Premier League too.

Transport Scotland awarded a £3 million contract to Arup for 'technical advisory services'.

The private consultants are being brought in at taxpayers' expense despite the ScotRail board earning an average of £165000 a year.

READ MORE: SNP ministers accused of 'secrecy' surrounding controversial ScotRail contracts

The contract states that the help 'is required to carry out contingency planning work' as the 'train operating company' is moved 'into the public sector'.

It comes as ScotRail has faced significant problems since it was nationalised on April 1.

Train services in recent weeks have been majorly disrupted due to actions by unions Aslef and RMT over pay and conditions for staff.

ScotRail slashed 700 daily services in May on a new temporary timetable while on three days last week only 10 per cent of services ran due to strike action.

Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson told the Scottish Mail on Sunday: “This is yet more evidence that the SNP Government had no idea what it was doing when it nationalised ScotRail.

“What was the point of taking it into public ownership if the next step was just to hand a private company millions of pounds of taxpayers' money in order to tell it how to run the service?

“The SNP clearly had no plan for how to actually provide let alone improve a rail service as we can see from the chaos that ensued.”

Transport Secretary Michael Matheson brought ScotRail into public ownership after declaring the old system of rail franchising was not 'fit for purpose'.

ScotRail said it had no comment over the consultancy contract whilst a Transport Scotland spokesman said: “This contract is for the provision of rail technical consultancy services.

“Specialist technical support is required to carry out planning work due diligence and/or shadow mobilisations of train operating companies.”

The Abbott formula plant in Sturgis Michigan resumed production of EleCare formula on July 1 after a three-week shutdown caused by flooding from severe storms a company spokesperson said on Saturday.

A previous months-long closure of the plant had helped to drive a nationwide baby formula shortage. At the time of the recent closure Abbott said it had stopped production of its EleCare in order to “assess damage caused by the storm and clean and re-sanitize the plant.”

The US Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the “agency expects the measures and steps it is taking and the resumption of production at the Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis Mich. facility will mean more and more supply is on the way or on store shelves moving forward.”

Abbott had said it would restart EleCare production followed by specialty and metabolic formulas after it reopened.

The plant had previously been shut down for months after an FDA inspection that found Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria which can be deadly to infants in several areas. Similac Alimentum and EleCare powdered infant formulas made at the plant were recalled and the closure exacerbated shortages caused by supply chain disruptions. Families across the United States have struggled for months to find formula for infants and for people with specific nutrition needs.

Production had been underway for less than two weeks before the closure from the storm.

More than 20% of formula products – powder ready-to-drink and liquid – have been out of stock for the past month according to data through July 3 from market research firm Information Resources Incorporated (IRI).

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Before the nationwide infant formula recall by Abbott Nutrition in February about 10% of infant formula products were typically out of stock.

The Biden administration has delivered millions of pounds of powdered formula through Operation Fly Formula but stock rates for powder formula specifically are even worse.

More than 30% of powder formula products were out of stock during the week ending July 3 up slightly from 29% the prior week and 27% the week before that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yZXN1bWVzLWF0LXRyb3VibGVkLWFiYm90dC1iYWJ5LWZvcm11bGEtZmFjdG9yeS5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yZXN1bWVzLWF0LXRyb3VibGVkLWFiYm90dC1iYWJ5LWZvcm11bGEtZmFjdG9yeS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Production resumes at troubled Abbott baby formula factory,"The Abbott manufacturing facility in Sturgis Michigan on May 13 2022.

Production of baby formula has resumed at the Abbott Nutrition factory in Michigan whose February shutdown over contamination contributed to a national shortage a company spokesman said.

Damage from severe thunderstorms including flooding had forced the Sturgis plant to halt operations in mid-June just two weeks after restarting production with additional sanitizing and safety protocols.

Production of EleCare a specialty formula for infants with severe food allergies and digestive problems was restored at Sturgis following a July 1 reboot said Abbott spokesman John Koval.

""We are working to restart Similac production as soon as we can. We'll provide more information when we have it"" he said via email.

Abbott recalled several leading brands of formula in February including Similac. That squeezed supplies had already been strained by supply chain disruptions and stockpiling during Covid-19 shutdowns.

The shortage was most dire for children with allergies digestive problems and metabolic disorders who rely on specialty formulas.

President Joe Biden's administration has since eased import rules for foreign manufacturers airlifted formula from Europe and invoked federal emergency rules to prioritize U.S. production.

Abbott is one of just four companies that produce about 90% of U.S. formula. Koval declined to say how much of Abbot's overall U.S. supply of infant formula is produced at the Sturgis plant.

The plant was closed in February after the Food and Drug Administration began investigating four bacterial infections among infants who consumed powdered formula from the plant. Two of the babies died. The company says its products have not been directly linked to infections which involved different bacterial strains.

FDA inspectors eventually uncovered a host of violations at the plant including bacterial contamination a leaky roof and lax safety protocols.

On Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to help overseas makers of infant formula that have sent supplies under emergency approval to address the shortfall secure long-term authorization to market their formula in the U.S. The plan is to provide American consumers with more choices and make supplies more resilient against current or future shortages.

FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and Susan Mayne the director of the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition said in a statement that the Sturgis plant shutdown ""compounded by unforeseen natural weather events has shown just how vulnerable the supply chain has become.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd2Fsa2VybWVtb3JpYWxzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyeS9nYXJ5LW5lbHNvbi1hYmJvdHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gary Nelson Abbott,"Gary Nelson Abbott successfully completed his mission on earth and returned to his Father in Heaven on July 3 2022 in Payson Utah. He was born to Stephen Nelson Abbott and Florence Elizabeth Durrant on April 16 1949 in Provo Utah. He was one of seven siblings whom he loved dearly.

After graduating from Springville High School in 1967 he served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Southeast Mexico Mission from 1968-1970. It was during this time that he developed a deep and abiding love for his hispanic brothers and sisters their culture and language. He carried his love of the people and even maintained fluency of the Spanish language throughout his life by using it every chance he had.

On November 10 1972 Gary married his sweetheart Linda Behling in the Provo Utah Temple. Gary was an attentive husband who loved and served his sweet wife Linda fiercely. They made a great team and together they raised 4 amazing sons and 2 wonderful daughters. Gary was an incredible father who instilled in his children a strong work-ethic and a great love for the Lord. As a young father Gary enjoyed the outdoors and was wood badge trained with the Boy Scouts of America.

He was a dedicated employee of Contractors Heating and Cooling Supply for many years. During his time there his filing cabinet became a make-shift candy and snack shop and his fellow employees were his loyal customers. He passed this salesmanship quality on to his children as well as the love of a great deal.

Gary was a missionary all his life. One way he served others was through his love of baking. He was constantly baking bread and cookies and took joy in sharing his creations with family friends and neighbors. Many people’s fondest memories of Gary are accompanied by the sweet smell of fresh baked bread. Another of Gary’s unique and favorite ways of offering service was through special occasion cards that he would design himself on his computer and sign with his trademark nickname Brerabbott. Always the dynamic duo Linda would hand write a note to go with it. These cards became a hallmark of Gary and Linda’s. Together they sent out hundreds of personalized cards as a way to show their love to friends and family.

Hand in hand with Linda Gary enjoyed serving in the temple and doing family history work. He served faithfully in bishopric and high council callings as well as as a Bishop of a BYU student ward. In 2016 he and Linda served as full-time missionaries in the Lansing Michigan Mission. It was a very special time in his life to be able to serve as a missionary again this time with his eternal companion by his side. Serving the Lord and attending to his priesthood duties were of the utmost importance to Gary all his life. Even on his last day on earth Gary was ready to participate in church services and worship the God he loved. He leaves behind a legacy of service compassion kindness love dedication and above all JOY!

He is survived by his dedicated wife Linda; children Nelson (Heather) Abbott of Elk Ridge Utah Nathan (DeLinda) Abbott of American Fork Utah Emily (Kasey) Crawford of Lehi Utah Solinda (Nathan) Niles of 29 Palms California Tiffini (Kenneth deceased) Abbott of Payson Utah and Jared (Shannon) Abbott of Spring Lake Utah; 22 grandchildren; one great grandchild; and two brothers and a sister.

For the game show’s Season 8 premiere the team of Hacks threw down with the teachers from Abbott Elementary tackling epic subjects including plumber’s crack men in ill-fitting superhero suits and smelly boyfriends. Truly any of these topics sound like an episode of either one of the TV comedies waiting to happen.

Sure crazier things have happened on Celebrity Family Feud—Kathy Lee Gifford’s son-in-law showed off his uh private parts; Kendall Jenner mocked Donald Trump in front of Kanye West—but seeing Sheryl Lee Ralph’s competitive side sure made me giggle. And getting a glimpse of the off-screen friendship between Jean Smart and Poppy Liu put a big grin on my face.

Hacks and Abbott Elementary are two of my very favorite comedy series airing right now and I know I’m not alone here. If you’re in desperate need of a smile this week—again I know I’m not alone here—look no further than the most recent Celebrity Family Feud match. You deserve 22 minutes of pure joy.

While Family Feud secured most of the biggest cast members for each team a few familiar faces were missing—namely Hannah Einbinder of Hacks and Janelle James from Abbott. Still the teams were stacked: Jean Smart Poppy Liu Christopher McDonald Mark Indelicato and Rose Abdoo held down the Hacks side while Quinta Brunson Tyler James Williams Lisa Ann Walter and Sheryl Lee Ralph took care of Abbott’s hand.

The most delightful surprise was a special guest on Abbott’s side: Ms. Joyce Abbott the teacher who inspired Brunson to craft the beloved ABC sitcom. I felt a lump in my throat when I saw Brunson’s own dear teacher appear determined to win a hefty donation to DonorsChoose a non-profit that specializes in donations to public school classroom projects. I would give anything to play Family Feud with my elementary school teachers!

This episode of Celebrity Family Feud is worth watching for the first head-to-head alone. Two comedy icons battle each other at the podium: We’re talking Quinta Brunson and Jean Smart here folks. While either could surely launch the perfect punchline about a magical plumber’s crack—the first prompt given in the game—the stakes were high and the Hacks crew walked away with the win in the first round. The team had Smart to thank too as the actress was able to nab the top answer: A plumber pulls a plunger out of his crack for a magic trick. Duh.

Ultimately (and GoldDerby should be taking notes here) while Abbott Elementary had a hefty lead throughout the entire show Hacks ran away with the win thanks to one sweep near the end of the competition. Could this mean Hacks is going to steal all of the Emmys from Abbott Elementary? If I were a betting woman I’d be putting my money on Hacks based on this Family Feud performance.

What makes for an even stronger case is the performance the Hacks team puts up for Fast Money—they’re unstoppable. Jean Smart and Christopher McDonald who play fabulous lovers/enemies in Hacks go up to the plate for Feeding America. And boy do they deliver going past the 200-points mark needed to secure the $25000 cash prize for their charity.

Really the prize of it all was watching Jean Smart lay down her life on Fast Money. Sure our beloved Abbott teachers lost but we all won something perfect in the process. Perhaps the best part of the night was Smart flopping on her answer for “a way you cook potatoes.” While the top answers were “mashed” and “baked” obviously Smart opted to guess “scalloped.” With some cheese? Those are the best.

The Red Cross has launched a new program aimed at upskilling 200 refugees that recently arrived on Australia’s shores. Working together with partner Accenture the program will help the refugees build their skills and then introduce them to employment opportunities with employers.

Around 60000 refugees arrived in Australia last year but longer term statistics show that their financial outlook is mostly dire. Only 17% of refugees are in paid work 18 months after arrival and on top of that the median income for refugees after five years hovers around $31000 compared to the national average of $60000.

In a bid to help fresh refugees be more effective in finding employment the ‘Connect Match Support Program’ provides pro-bono skills development support across a range of digital proficiency and interpersonal capabilities.

“Meaningful economic participation is one of the most important aspects of a successful settlement journey for refugees asylum seekers and migrants. People with this kind of lived experience have an incredible amount to offer employers. They are resilient industrious and keen to give back to the communities they now call home. We look forward to working with the Accenture team to assist our clients develop employment and training skills” said Shzan Plandowski from the Red Cross.

The Connect Match Support Program focuses on a number of areas including digital skills (which leverage Accenture’s e-learning platform) growing English language fluency interview preparation and career mentoring to address barriers to employment and enable active participation in the Australian economy and society.

Upon completion of the program refugees will be introduced to companies seeking new talent with companies in hospitality agriculture logistics and mining affiliated to the program.

“Accenture is pleased to be able to partner with Australian Red Cross to support refugees starting their new life in Australia. Setting up a new life in a foreign country and finding work can be difficult especially with barriers like language and a lack of local work experience or references” said Scott Hahn senior managing director and Technology lead for Accenture in Australia.

“We hope that this program will empower each person to enter the workforce successfully and make settling into Australian life easier while also helping to solve the skills shortage crisis that a number of industries currently face.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMi9wZXQtc2hvcHMtcmVqb2ljZS1uZXctcmVzZWFyY2gtc2hvd3MtZXhwcmVzc2l2ZS1kb2dzLWRyaXZlLXNhbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pet Shops Rejoice as New Research Shows Expressive Dogs Drive Sales,"Dog days of summer got you down? Try looking at your puppy. When they look back so does 33000 years of evolution that’s taught them how to work the levers of human emotion.

We believe this has commercial applications. In fact it’s working already.

Skeptical? Indulge us.

In a fascinating bit of lab work that explains much researchers at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh recently published findings that dogs’ facial muscles have developed in unique ways in the millennia since the Middle Paleolithic when someone first befriended a wild wolf.

Some people would use a time machine to have dinner with Henry VIII. We’d like to go back 33000 years just to see how disastrously comical the first attempts at petting wolves were. Then at some point they advanced. Like a dystopian Netflix show about artificial intelligence (AI) but with dogs.

In “Evolution of Facial Muscle Anatomy in Dogs” published last month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) a journal of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) the authors zero in on special adaptations that made terrifying canines into cuddly frisbee-catchers.

For example there’s the anguli oculi medialis “a muscle responsible for raising the inner eyebrow intensely” found in all dogs but not in wolves. There’s a reason.

According to the research using that muscle “resembles an expression that humans produce when sad so its production in dogs may trigger a nurturing response in humans. We hypothesize that dogs with expressive eyebrows had a selection advantage and that ‘puppy dog eyes’ are the result of selection based on humans’ preferences.”

We at PYMNTS hypothesize that roughly 93% of executives from the pet supply industry will read that activating their own eyebrow-lifting muscles as they think: “How do we monetize it?”

Silly. We’ve been doing it all along without knowing. Such is the power of doggy Darwinism.

Money Mutts and Mimicry

Looking for a connection between the expressions on a dog’s face and stock market performance isn’t weird. Presidents and monarchs take advice from astrologers.

That said we’ve all watched as pet eCommerce platform Chewy came from a trailing position last year to beat expectations in its latest filing. Our theory: Dogs are manipulating the market.

Not directly but through their humans. You’re browsing thinking “$50 for a doggy swimming pool? No way.” Then you look down. Giving you “that look” is 50 pounds of puppy love. You click “buy” almost as if under some form a mind control. And that’s exactly what it is.

Now scale it across an estimated 79 million dogs in the U.S. and do the math.

If just 1% of dog owners got “that look” and bought the $50 doggie pool we’re talking roughly $39 million worth of product. Staggering potential. Good thing cats don’t like swimming.

Think consumers won’t do it? That’s what they said when laws went into effect ordering dog owners to pick up droppings in little bags. Now it’s routine expected unremarkable.

For all we know that started with some commissioner’s dog moving its anguli oculi medialis.

“Dogs are more skillful in using human communicative cues like pointing gestures or gaze direction even than human’s closest living relative chimpanzees and also than their own closest living relatives wolves or other domesticated species” the study found.

Additionally it said “recent research suggests that eye contact between humans and dogs is crucial for dog-human social interaction. Dogs but not wolves establish eye contact with humans when they cannot solve a problem on their own.”

A problem say like: “How do I get a human to buy me a pool on an eCommerce site?”

This all may seem mildly amusing and of course we’re happy when eCommerce does well but some people are bound to take it too far — and they are.

A jokey July 8 Op-Ed in Court House News titled “Let dogs vote” showed how dogs and their operatives won’t stop at moving markets.

“Giving dogs the right to vote and hold political office would be the simplest way to restore integrity to our state and federal governments” it said.

Jon Lewis looks pained as he describes the mess Capita was in when he joined five years ago.

Branded the 'Turnaround King' Lewis was parachuted in to clean up the bloated Government contractor which he says spent too long indiscriminately buying other firms and racking up debt while continuing to pay handsome dividends to shareholders.

He was most shocked by the toll that years of neglect and underinvestment had taken.

'We didn't even have cyber security on some of our PCs' says Lewis 60 wincing at the memory of its creaking infrastructure.

The public may wince too: Capita's work includes everything from collecting the BBC licence fee and London's congestion charge to running Army recruitment.

Many in both the City and Whitehall were at the time convinced Capita was a lost cause – as rival Carillion would later become. Lewis back then embarking on his fourth turnaround and arriving after a series of profit warnings says he had not fully realised the scale of the task.

He is far more chipper now in his first interview since the 'very very challenging' restructuring finished last year. His sense of relief is palpable after admitting the outcome 'could have been very different'.

'Let's remember this is a business that is integral to the fabric of the UK' the Welshman says. 'That may sound like a grandiose statement but we engage with 50 per cent of the population of this country in some way or form virtually every week.

'We collectively as a board and as a leadership team have saved the company so that we can continue to do that and do it better than we've ever done it before.'

Since arriving in late 2017 he has sold off large chunks of the business and strived to position Capita as a high-tech firm. Away from staples like traditional call centres and into artificial intelligence and running chatbots for the likes of firms such as O2.

A recent Royal Navy contract handed Capita the task of modernising whole training systems that included simulation technology.

In the process he has slashed Capita's own staff numbers from 73000 to 52000 and reduced debt to more manageable levels.

But it's the change in culture at the group that for him is the real transformation. Part of this stems from setting up a consulting division – which he now compares to businesses such as Accenture.

He has also overhauled the way Capita deals with clients. He says: 'In the past we would decide which [contracts we wanted to work on] then bid for them.'

The group would 'then deliver the contract and not one iota more'.

'We didn't manage relationships with our clients in the way that other businesses or Big Four professional services firms might there were no partners that would own that relationship.' He insists things have moved on and is mystified why Capita is still compared with the likes of Serco and Mitie rather than a rival to Deloitte Digital Accenture and Infosys.

The reality seems to be that its reputation – and an unfortunately crude nickname 'Crapita' – may take more time to shift.

Did they think about renaming and rebranding the group? Yes he says. But this was quickly dismissed when their research found that clients didn't have a problem with it.

'When we started this transformation five years ago if you'd done a Google search on 'Crapita' you'd get quite a few hits. You get far fewer hits today' he offers.

if you'd done a Google search on 'Crapita' you'd get quite a few hits. You get far fewer hits today

But he adds: 'The way to addressing that is not through some superficial change of company name. That's just putting lipstick on it.'

For all Lewis's enthusiasm how ever the share price has remained stubbornly low – at 25p. The group is worth around £430million – a fraction of its former value and significantly less than the 97p at the time of 2018's £700million emergency rights issue that Lewis launched to help stem losses.

He responds simply that it has been a 'very challenging' time for investors.

But he rattles off a list of things he still wants to do – growing the group's business divisions at the rate of the markets they each serve and erasing Capita's debt. 'At that point one may pause and say 'Is it time to go off and do something else?' But we are not there yet.'

When do you think you will be? 'Well I can't give a timeframe on all that.'

He is optimistic that its stock will hit the pre-rights issue price in the next year or two. Whether the market will be convinced is another matter.

Lewis – perhaps not surprisingly for someone rejuvenating the business as a consultancy – has a habit of speaking in the jargony language used by many bosses.

He uses the word 'transformation' on repeat and admits he's most likely to be found saying the phrase 'Are we delighting that customer?' around the office.

That and his fathomless enthusiasm is perhaps partly explained by the 20 years he spent working in America.

A geologist by training he spent two decades at US oil services behemoth Halliburton. His time there came to a bruising end when he was passed over for the top job – a career low point he says. 'I was on the succession plan there for many years' he says.

'There were six of us then five then three and then two. I got to the two I didn't get to the one and had devoted years of my life to the belief that at some stage I would be CEO of that company.

'When that kind of prospect is dangled in front of you you pretty much give your life to that company.'

Now he seems to have found peace at home as well as – relatively speaking at least – at work.

Raised in South Wales Lewis went to a local comprehensive where he met his wife of 37 years. He arrived at Capita via a short stint at another oil services group Amec Foster Wheeler.

His family now live in a vicarage in the same village that he grew up in and where he is devoting much of his spare time to redoing the garden.

'I bump into people I was in infant school with I bump into people from my comprehensive school and it's nice to have those connections still – they don't know what the hell I do. It's kind of grounding actually.

'I've come home really and I love it.'",,,

Flash forward to today and they have entered everyday conversation not just as popular gifts for the holidays but as an alternative mode of transport for last mile logistics.

Last mile need for speed

As e-commerce continues its march towards becoming the preferred shopping method across the globe it's become clear online consumers demand faster cheaper more flexible and more sustainable deliveries. Retailers providing such deliveries can realize competitive advantages - such is the case with Amazon’s meteoric rise in recent years a pioneer of low-cost 2-day and same-day delivery.

The key to a good delivery experience lies in the last mile the costliest and most complex leg of the entire supply chain which by some estimates makes up 53% of the total cost of delivery. With traffic congestion costing billions in productivity and gumming up delivery routes driver shortages across the globe and growing concern among consumers for eco-friendly deliveries the last mile has become even more arduous.

Enter the drone. Drones can zip over traffic don’t require drivers and emit zero fossil fuels. Moreover drones can deliver parcels 20 times faster than ground-based transportation according to Vikram Singh CEO of TechEagle.

Household names like Walmart Amazon and Google among others have made it known they’re working towards making drone delivery a reality with the help of partners rolling out drone testing programs across the world.

But will drone delivery enter the mainstream market or is this all just hype?

Where are the drones?

Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he introduced drone delivery back in 2013 and it has been the “next big thing” in delivery management for almost 9 years now. Understandably people wonder when it will reach scale and apply to the general public. There are a few reasons for its slow roll out:

Investment

Drone delivery requires a substantial capital-intensive investment in order to establish a successful program. It needs everything from regulation compliance to drone maintenance investment. It's easier for larger companies to invest in these areas though it's much harder for smaller enterprises to establish a delivery program and achieve scale. Companies can more easily reduce shipping times by a day or two with route optimization or warehouse management making drone delivery an added bonus to speed up delivery but not a necessity. If a company has limited resources to invest in R&D or new technology they’ll go with what they can control now.

But even large companies with the capital means to invest in drone delivery have had to call it quits. Amazon closed its Prime Air office in the UK in 2021 and DHL abandoned its parcel-copter program the same year.

Delivery Cost

In addition to the initial investment drone delivery requires operating costs are not cheap. Amazon estimates it costs roughly $63 per package to be delivered by drone. Compare that to the retailer-turned-logistics company’s cost of delivering goods through third-party logistics (3PL) companies at around $5 per package. Delivering through its own logistics network costs $3.47 per package. For a lean logistics-focused company this cost is huge indicating drone delivery may be best suited for affluent consumers and high-value or time-critical products. Zipline a drone delivery company was able to deliver life-saving medical supplies to rural areas of Rwanda and Ghana reducing delivery times from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Deliveries like these justify the cost.

For companies focused on reducing shipping costs for consumer retail items in the last mile drones may not be the answer just yet.

Urban airspace

Urban areas dense with consumers may seem like a perfect environment for drone delivery to take off but that isn’t really the case. Drone deliveries in dense cities like London or Tokyo may prove challenging as safe consumer-owned landing zones such as a backyard are limited. Coupled with tall buildings complicating low-level flight with government regulated airspace around cities and large airports urban drone delivery becomes a bit more challenging. Washington D.C one of America’s densest urban areas has some of the strictest airspace in the world. Until these navigational and regulatory hurdles can be overcome drone delivery in consumer-rich environments may be off the table.

Large item delivery

Delivering small lightweight items via drone is rather feasible. Delivering large or heavy items like a new flat-screen TV or leather couch is not. Aerodynamics aside in the U.S. drone operators are limited by the FAA to carrying cargo weighing under 55 pounds. This limits the use of drones and inhibits drones from stacking orders and making multiple deliveries in one run.

On the other hand TwinswHeel of France created a drone capable of carrying up to 300kg but it doesn’t yet have the ability to deliver a sofa to a consumer’s home.

Safety

Drones as with all modes of delivery transport pose safety risks to those around them. But because drones are new and driverless they are getting extra attention. The Swiss Post suspended drone delivery service after a drone crashed near a group of school children following a short circuit interrupting the drone’s GPS power supply. Threats to drone safety range from mechanical malfunctions adverse weather conditions birds or perhaps an unsuspecting dog - they’ve always had a rocky relationship with the mailman.

As with any new technology safety and public trust take time to prove.

Drones Today

Consumers see remarkably little of the planning and research logistics firms do behind the scenes and drone delivery is currently happening just not in the way consumers think. Right now drones are not being used to deliver apparel in lucrative urban consumer markets but in B2B segments and for emergency and time-sensitive deliveries in more rural areas. For consumer retail companies seeking efficiencies in the last mile their dollars may be better spent elsewhere in 2022.

It’s worth noting however that less than a third of last year’s automated deliveries worldwide were made by air. Until drones gain widespread adoption it may be more likely for mainstream autonomous deliveries to come from below rather than above.

Widespread adoption

It is reasonable to predict drone technology will reach widespread consumer scale in 3-5 years as initial technology investments are refined government regulations rewritten and operation costs come down.

The key to getting all of these accomplished is to build further upon where drones are today.

Current drone technology must be made more accessible incentivizing drone delivery usage and investment in its development. Companies operating drones today will find the profitability sweet spot of the products best suited for drone delivery based on size demand and timeliness. As the technology reaches scale and delivery costs become reasonable expect drone usage and the product assortments they carry to expand - from standard pharmaceutical deliveries to food deliveries and online retail deliveries. Large item deliveries however may be a ways away.

Drones will have the greatest impact in geographies where it’s difficult for delivery trucks to navigate and troublesome to decipher specific addresses a common environment found across many parts of Asia.

Captain America has the shield; Wolverine has claws; Thor has Mjolnir; Iron Man has his suit and so on. They use these gadgets to fight evil and protect the universe. Our supply chain and logistics partners are the world’s modern day superheroes because they have been delivering essential rations despite global crises. They fight through supply chain disruptions caused by pandemics natural disasters cyberattacks and everything else to deliver the goods that the world depends upon. Over the last two years during the pandemic the shortcomings of the global supply chain have been evident as we have suffered shortages of goods from computer chips to toilet paper. It impacts enterprises and households 94% of Fortune 1000 companies faced supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic. We need to equip our logistics superheroes with powerful gadgets that they can use to manage chaos and save the universe. The good news is that the technology is already here with 5G the Fifth Generation for broadband cellular networks and IoT the Internet of Things. Both are possible weapons that the Batmans and Robins of the logistics industry can use to save the day.

Digitization of the supply chain for streamlining operations is not new. A Deloitte report states that companies must improve end-to-end supply chain visibility through digitization. The combination of 5G and IoT bring benefits and capabilities that surpass what was previously possible. Just as no single gadget can fight all villains no technology or solution can fix all supply chain issues. We have all admired James Bond for his savvy use of different devices in different situations to beat his foes. Similarly we need to look at the dynamic duo of 5G and IoT.

5G is a wireless connection technology that can deliver multi-gigabit speeds at lower latencies. It can handle many connections per cell tower making it the ideal solution for connecting IoT devices. These IoT devices can relay information pinpoint their location take proactive measures and respond to remote commands depending upon their capabilities. 5G and IoT can combine to perform complex tasks in the supply chain and unlock new efficiencies and enable smarter business decision making.

The ability to track and trace every shipment is essential. Historically supply chains have relied on stale and manual methods of tracking. With 5G and low-cost IoT sensors the entire logistics process can be transformed by bringing near real-time visibility to the state of goods their location conditions and estimated arrival times. This valuable information can help manufacturers prepare efficiently stores can anticipate stocking needs and hand-offs in transportation can occur seamlessly. In the United States around 30-40 percent of the food is wasted due to spoilage from production to delivery. 5G and IoT can trace the risk of spoilage while in transit due to overstocking or equipment malfunction. Temperature and ambient light sensors can indicate if a product has been damaged or exposed to sunlight. This food can be rerouted to a closer destination or the equipment can be repaired saving the products to feed people in need.

5G and IoT can significantly enhance warehouses ports shop floors and factories. They can enable smart inventory tracking autonomous operations and inspections within a location. Automation reduces losses due to missing parts counterfeiting and theft. Crewless vehicles and drones operated via remote control or autonomous vehicles can optimize loading and unloading operations connected via 5G by keeping vehicles in lanes and avoiding collisions. Advanced sensors and high throughput low latency 5G connections can enable autonomous inspection of products by connecting mobile and fixed cameras to AI applications at the edge.

Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) over 5G networks with IoT sensors can provide remote assistance when required. They can allow for visualizing stocking options in warehouses so that businesses can utilize their space efficiently. Mixed (MR) reality can help spot issues before implementation. 5G and IoT-enabled virtual reality can be used for simulations and training so that routes and processes are fully optimized before products are sent.

Manual processes result in bottlenecks and blind spots in the supply chain. Our logistics superheroes need to focus their energy on creative pursuits and reimagining business models to improve efficiency reduce costs and enhance accuracy. Digitization with 5G and IoT will ultimately benefit the consumer. The dynamic duo of 5G and IoT are the perfect gadgets to digitize the supply chain. A McKinsey survey states that nearly 90 percent of supply chain executives said they expect to overhaul their IT within the next five years. Companies must adopt 5G and IoT as gadgets to empower our logistics superheroes to deliver the goods and make the world safer smarter and more sustainable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvcmtzaGlyZWV2ZW5pbmdwb3N0LmNvLnVrL3JlYWQtdGhpcy9nb2luZy1ncmVlbi1ob3ctdG8tbWFrZS15b3VyLWdhcmRlbi1mdXJuaXR1cmUtbW9yZS1lY28tZnJpZW5kbHktMzc2MjQwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Going Green - How to make your garden furniture more eco-friendly,"Try eco-friendly garden furniture (photo: Adobe)

Q: How do I choose eco-friendly garden furniture?

A: Garden furniture is designed so you can enjoy the great outdoors in comfort. But if it’s not made sustainably then it can negatively impact on nature. Here are my tips for making an environmentally-sound choice:

Make it a long-term investment

In summer we spend more time outdoors so investing in good quality sustainable garden furniture is a bright idea. Cheap and lightweight plastic furniture frequently needs replacing causing unnecessary environmental harm. Buying better quality hard-wearing items is a long-term investment. The longer it lasts the better it is for the planet. And if you can still use your old furniture set but fancy a change then perhaps buy new cushions instead?

Go for sustainable materials

Garden furniture is often made of problematic materials. Rattan seats are extremely popular at the moment but tend to be made of plastic and can’t be recycled. This means they’ll end up in landfill. Metal furniture such as tables and chairs made from aluminium uses a huge amount of energy to produce. So what is the solution?

Wood is the best choice. It’s renewable and can be easily repurposed or recycled. There is a wide range of products made from both softwoods such as pine and hardwoods such as oak so this choice mainly comes down to your budget. Look out for furniture with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo which means it’s made from responsibly-managed woodlands. Also consider where the wood comes from. Buy European if you can.

That being said bamboo – largely grown in Asia sub-Saharan Africa Australia and the Americas – is also a sustainable choice. It needs less water to grow than conventional timber and also grows very fast – sometimes nearly a metre a day!

Care for your furniture

Rain can lead to mould and rust while heavy winds can blow furniture over and cause breakages. Without proper care garden furniture will need to be replaced more frequently. To make it last take good care of your furniture – oiling wood fixing breaks and covering it when it rains.

Shop ethically

If it’s time to replace your garden furniture you could shop second-hand. You can find real bargains! The websites Preloved Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree are good places to start. If you can’t find anything suitable and decide to shop for something new you could look online at Sustainable Furniture Iron Fire and Chunky Reclaimed Furniture. On the high street you can buy FSC accredited garden furniture in Aldi Asda John Lewis and Robert Dyas.

Yet the truth is that flying is the most environmentally destructive mode of travel. And what with all the airport disruptions there are alternatives that are definitely worth exploring.

Here are some ideas you may like to consider ...

Staycations in the UK

The UK has it all: there are some beautiful beaches there are some gorgeous coastal towns there is some stunning countryside there are vibrant cities and there are also some world-famous historic sights.

For example have you seen the dramatic landscapes of the Isle of Skye or the picture postcard villages of the Cotswolds or even the jaw-dropping views of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast?

Also have you experienced the amazing food and drink scenes of Glasgow’s quirky West End and Brighton’s buzzing Lanes?

There are so many options for fantastic UK-based holidays why not give one a go?

Rail travel to Europe

We really are on Europe’s doorstep. Thanks to Eurostar you can travel by train from London to Paris in under three hours.

The journey to Brussels takes under two hours while Amsterdam is less than four hours away.

From all of these cities you can then take sleeper trains across the continent.

For example you can travel overnight from Paris to Milan or from Brussels to Vienna or from Amsterdam to Innsbruck.

You could treat yourself to the luxury of a sleeper cabin.

A more affordable way to get some kip is to book a bunk called a ‘couchette’.

Even better you can book your entire journey on the Trainline website.

Beach lovers fear not! From Paris you go by rail to Marseilles on France’s south coast in just over three hours.

You also take a high-speed train to Barcelona in around seven hours.

From there it’s a hop to Spain’s Costa Brava or Costa Dorada.

Go by boat

Another more eco-friendly option than flying is to go by sea.

Brittany Ferries runs services across the Bay of Biscay from Portsmouth and Plymouth to Bilbao and Santander on Spain’s northern Atlantic coast.

Look out for the whales and dolphins!

Travel company Trailfinders offers a range of no-fly holidays some of which are boat-based.

You could experience the grandeur of the Norwegian Fjords or enjoy a package holiday in Brittany western France.

The key to slow travel is to embrace the journey as part of your trip.

Spend some time in places you pass through. See it as an adventure.

Fact or fiction!

We need to keep drilling for oil and gas.

False!

Last year International Energy Agency demanded that all new oil and gas exploration stop if we’re to meet our climate targets.

We have enough reserves. The United Nations backs this.

AMD RDNA 3 Navi 31 Navi 32 Navi 33 To Feature DCN 3.2 RDNA 3 APU Gets DCN 3.1.4 Support

So far a total of four AMD RDNA 3 GPUs have been listed in various Linux patches and the LLVN open-source repository. These include the Navi 31 'GFX1100' Navi 32 'GFX1102' Navi 33 'GFX1101' and the GFX1103 which shows up as an APU so probably the version used within the upcoming Phoenix Point APU lineup. The details were gathered coelacanth-dream and it looks like we have new information regarding the DCN or Display Core Next versions that each chip will support on launch.

For the discrete RDNA 3 GPU lineup which includes the AMD Navi 31 Navi 32 and Navi 33 GPUs the red team will be upgrading from the existing DCN 3.0 engine to the new DCN 3.2.1 engine. The APU on the other hand doesn't utilize the same version as the discrete RDNA 3 GPU family. It has the same series which is currently used by the existing RDNA 2 'GFX1030' APU series labeled as the DCN 3.1.4 series. The AMD Sabrina APU uses the DCN 3.1.6 engine.

In terms of features it looks like both DCN 3.2 and DCN 3.1 series come with support for just four display outputs. This has been the standard for RDNA 2 GPUs and will be retained for the RDNA 3 lineup too. Additional information shows that there's now MALL (Memory Access at Last Level) or Infinity Cache support for the RDNA 3 / GFX11 GPU so don't expect to see Infinity Cache designs on Phoenix Point APUs.

The AMD Phoenix Point APUs are expected to carry up to 24 Compute Units or double to amount of cores compared to the existing Rembrandt APUs so that's going to be a huge jump in graphics performance for an integrated chip which will be competing against Intel's Meteor Lake chips that pack up to 192 EUs in a tiled-GPU design. Meanwhile the AMD RDNA 3 GPU lineup is shaping up to be a worthy competitor against NVIDIA's next-gen Ada Lovelace products which are expected to be unveiled later this year.

On Friday July 8 pop star Selena Gomez arrived at a Sephora Store in Paris for her European Rare Beauty press tour wearing a throwback Alaïa look. The two piece outfit included a knitted jacquard plaid top and matching mini-skirt and she carried the black “Le Coeur” bag from Winter Spring 2022 which is shaped like a heart.

She accessorized with bright white pump heels and large hoops. Gomez left her hair down but it was partially slicked back giving the outfit even more of a '60s feel. The trip fell during Paris Fashion Week so it makes sense that Gomez went all out for her tour. She stopped to smile and wave at the crowd that had gathered to see her outside the store.

Gomez launched a new matte lipstick and liner collection for Rare Beauty which is a beauty brand that is vegan and cruelty-free in late June. She has been busy promoting her new hit on Hulu Only Murders In The Building which she co-stars in with legendary comedians Steve Martin and Martin Short. On June 27 she attended their season 2 premiere in Los Angeles wearing a glamorous floor-length gown that also had a classic feel—though this look was more old Hollywood.

The single-sleeve Michael Kors gown was made of shimmering silver material and had a few modern touches like a side cut-out and a thigh high slit that almost connected with the strategic window. She also wore that dress with hoops diamond by Effy Jewelry and had her hair swept back into a wavy pony tail.

There's even more on Gomez's plate than a budding beauty empire and an acting career. She recently told Entertainment Tonight during a red carpet interview that she’s also working on new music.

“It’s just been a little hectic with this” she said. “But I am in the studio. I’m excited.”

The Parrishes launched their company Treehouses of Serenity which builds unique travel destinations along the Blue Ridge Mountains in Asheville North Carolina in 2016. They've built seven properties so far — including the whimsical ""Wizard's Hollow"" and ""The Perch"" that's an elevated treehouse — on land they initially didn't know what to do with they told Insider.

""We were sitting around watching 'Treehouse Masters' one night and Caroline said 'Why don't we try an Airbnb treehouse because it's Asheville and it's such a cool little town?'"" Mike 65 told Insider.

""We started talking about it in 2015"" Caroline 45 said. ""And at that point the thought was just traditional treehouses but it's evolved from there.""

The couple later appeared on season two of DIY Network's ""The Treehouse Guys"" and built their first treehouse ""Sanctuary."" They completed their newest addition ""Alchemy"" an underground house with a hidden slide this February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc2VhdHRsZXJlZmluZWQuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS92ZXN0aWJ1bGUtZ2FsbGVyeS1zZWF0dGxlLWFpcmJuYi1yZW9wZW5zLWFzLWJhbGxhcmQtYXJ0LXNwYWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Vestibule former gallery and Airbnb reopens as Ballard art space,"A couple of years back I ducked into an art opening at a townhome in Ballard owned by Kascha Semonovitch and John Snavely. A few months later I stopped back in. But this time there was no one sipping champagne and discussing art. On my return visit I had the whole place to myself. I got to eat drink and sleep surrounded by the exhibition — no I literally slept in an installation perched in the sleeping loft.

That experience really encapsulates the concept behind  the appropriately named art gallery created by Semonovitch and Snavely. On the one hand their converted live/work space served as a gallery where they hosted lively gatherings while showcasing new work by artists.

But on the other as soon as the last La Croix and canapé were consumed and guests slowly left the opening to mingle outside and discuss the show the space became available as an Airbnb. Imagine actually living within the art itself.

Not only were Semonovitch and Snavely offering up a magical experience for art lovers but the arrangement also allowed them to help fund ongoing exhibits from the Airbnb rental fees.



""Collectively John and I value 'public life'"" said Semonovitch. ""We feel strongly that rather than buying art for our private home it would be better to invest in a public space and share art with other people. Especially art that is not limited to a material possessable object.""

The Vestibule was indeed buzzy and you would be hard-pressed to find nearby parking on the nights of their openings. Even with the uncertainty that we have all experienced over the past two years Kascha and John knew they wanted to continue to show artists' work in North Seattle. That led them to morph Vestibule 1.0 into Vestibule 2.0.

""For the first space (Vestibule) we bought the townhome new so we didn't have to do many physical changes just furnishing"" said Kascha. ""But each installation show meant taking out all the furniture painting installing the work [...] and then as soon as the show ended I'd have 24 hours to take it all down make it look like a more normative Airbnb and clean for guests. I'm glad not to do that anymore.""

In its new incarnation just recently opened Vestibule now holds down the corner of 15th Ave NW and NW 60th St.



Although the new space does not have an Airbnb component it does allow Kascha to expand the number of artists they can show and provides a larger canvas for artists' creations to take hold. Bonus: they have banana art in the bathroom.

""I was asking some artists 'what-would-you-do-with-a-gallery' questions and more than one expressed concern that there be something exciting in the bathroom"" Kascha said.

She also posed this question to her kids at dinner. Her six-year-old chimed in that there should be banana art.

""We laughed but then we realized that there are so many jokes around banana art. And money and banana art. So we told the kids that if they made the work they could list it for $1000. This number blew their minds.""

They have even created a that they hope to play in the bathroom during events.

Kascha who is also a writer and poet is ever on the lookout for artists who might be up for future collaborations. As Kascha explains visual artists tend to gather in physical communities. For example writers convene because there is a need to experience material things in person and to pass on craft and technical knowledge.



""I find artists by going out to see art and through other artists"" Kascha said. ""I go to many shows not just at galleries but at schools and 4Culture and keep track of what I like and what that artist does next.""

Kascha has been doing a lot of studio visits in the past month. Pushed to name a couple of artists who she would like to have exhibited at Vestibule Kascha points to potential installations by and in the near future. She also is taken by Michael Swaine's s work and would find a collaboration with him to be ""amazing.""



But Kascha also has an acute eye toward democratizing the process of getting into the art world and so also puts out open calls for work as she has for an upcoming exhibit . Kascha said ""If a small gallery like us doesn't have an open call who will?""

At some point she would like to have an exhibit that explores the intersection of faith and art.

""Over the past few years I've found in a number of conversations that many artists have or have had a relationship to a religious upbringing that they've escaped or even that they continue but hide [...] or a spiritual practice that intersects with their work"" Kascha said. ""But in secular super-liberal Seattle we don't talk about religion especially in the art world which seems to assume secularity. Serrah Russell Cicelia Ross-Gotta Connor Walden Sara Osebold and recently Daniel and May Kyton Tiffany Daniels Elliot have all expressed this in various ways. And so many others.""

Vestibule reopened in Ballard with  a group show alive with text and texture that included work by artists Amanda Salov Emily Gherard Emma Royer Ilana Zweschi Lakshmi Muirhead Season Evans and Sharon Arnold. Next up Allyce Wood's "" "" will fill the gallery with tapestries and open-studio weaving hours.

There have been some great gallery spaces in Seattle over the years. Kascha points to key players who have inspired her along the way including the True's Western Bridge Lawrimore Project and The Alice. Although these galleries have shuttered Kascha also gives a nod to Greg Lundgren's latest venture the on First Hill.

Vestibule 2.0 is continuing right where it left off. And although Kascha may be too modest to say it you can definitely add Vestibule to the list of art galleries making a mark in Seattle today.

Sticky floors drugs in the dining room and accidental orgies: why the party is finally over for Airbnb guests

Nikki Hay knew there was something wrong when she returned back to her small Edinburgh flat and her shoes became stuck to the floor.

It wasn’t typical for the laminate panelling to exhibit a glue-like quality and quickly enough the 30-year-old discovered what was causing the excessive stickiness – lots and lots of spilt alcohol.

Bottles of booze – vodka wine and tequila among the vast collection – seemingly littered every part of her two-bed property which she had rented out to an unassuming woman on Airbnb.

‘When I say there were bottles of alcohol on every surface I mean it. I filled up six bin bags worth of bottles’ Nikki says recalling the incident that took place in early 2020.

‘I went into one of the bedrooms and opened the wardrobe and even found bottles in there. My property sleeps four people and if only four people had consumed all that alcohol they’d be dead.’

An off-license worth of booze was not the only thing that Nikki found while tidying her apartment which also had food and leftovers littered everywhere.

‘A small ziploc bag of white powder was found under my rug which I immediately disposed of’ she says. ‘It was just a mess. Having to tidy everything up for the next guests in a few hours was just so stressful.

Nikki has ran an Airbnb in Edinburgh for four years (Picture: Supplied)

‘Nothing was broken so I didn’t report the incident to Airbnb. But I did leave the guest a really poor review saying she had disrespected the property and the house rules. She then deactivated her profile.’

Thankfully for Nikki’s sake raucous events in Airbnb properties like hers are set to be a thing of the past.

The holiday rental platform called time on ‘party houses’ earlier this year with a ban introduced as a public health measure during 2020 becoming permanent as travelling returns to pre-pandemic levels.

A statement released by Airbnb read: ‘The party ban [has] become much more than a public health measure. It developed into a bedrock community policy to support our Hosts and their neighbours.

‘Disruptive parties and events will continue to be prohibited including open-invite gatherings. “Party house” properties will continue to be strictly prohibited as well.’

Speaking to Metro.co.uk a spokesperson for the brand adds: ‘We take reports of disruptive parties very seriously.

Airbnb has now banned raucous house parties (Picture: Getty Images)

‘Hosts can report a party using our in-app 24-hour safety line and neighbours can utilise our Neighbourhood Support Line to speak to us directly with urgent concerns about a listing in their community like a party in progress.’

The new policy comes after numerous Airbnb hosts over the years have spoken to the press about their properties being trashed as a result of wild parties being held by a guest staying there.

In 2016 a woman rented out her West London flat via the site to a guest on New Year’s Eve only to find the place ‘trashed’ by a hundred revellers.

Meanwhile police were called to Bearsted Kent last year when an £800-a-night Airbnb was used to host what was described as an ‘illegal all-night rave.’

Over in the States things took a tragic turn at an event at a property in Pittsburgh attended by over 200 partygoers. There two boys were shot dead and eight were injured with partygoers jumping out the windows to avoid gunfire.

Airbnb has now promised to clamp down on those violating its party ban as well as reassuring hosts that their properties are safe.

According to a spokesperson for Airbnb potential violations include: ‘factors like whether there has been an open-invite excessive noise excessive trash excessive visitors parking that impacts neighbours.

‘Guests will still be required to abide by a host’s House Rules and hosts can cancel reservations penalty-free if they reasonably believe that a guest intends to hold an unauthorised party or event’ they add.

For Nikki who started using her flat as a rental property in 2018 alongside her job in sales and her jewellery business it’s a relief to know that there are safety measures to stop her property being trashed or misused by guests.

As a superhost – someone with a certain number of five star reviews who has never cancelled a booking – she wants to maintain the same quality for guests staying without compromising her status.

‘A lot of trust is needed to run an Airbnb’ she explains. ‘People seem to forget that it’s not a hotel this is my home. I don’t have a team of staff to help me look after this place this is something I run myself. I do all the washing and the cleaning.’

For Justine Smith Airbnb’s efforts to codify their rules on partying are too little too late. The 33-year-old’s wedding night became one to remember for all the wrong reasons after a booking at her home went awry in 2016.

Alongside her now-husband writer Justine had been using the site since 2015 to rent out the spare room in their apartment in downtown Montreal Canada – and for the most part found it a pleasant and straightforward experience.

‘We started renting out the room because we just needed the money at the time’ she explains. ‘It was a nice alternative to a long term let – we got to meet some interesting people and it allowed my husband and I to have some privacy if we felt like we didn’t want someone renting the room. It was a nice balance.’

However Justine made a grave error in the hectic run up to her nuptials. While planning a small low-key wedding at her parents’ house on New Year’s Eve she forgot to block out her flat as unavailable – and was crestfallen to see that the room had been booked by two twenty-somethings.

‘We did try to cancel it almost immediately but you are penalised with a $100 fine’ she says. ‘When we reached out to the guests they explained they weren’t even going to be in the flat. They were coming down from Ottawa which is more than a two hour drive away and they said they only needed a place to sleep for a night.

‘All the hotels in the area were booked up and they weren’t going to find anything else. Because we were going to be at my parents’ having a wedding reception we decided just to go for it. We even said to ourselves: “We probably won’t even notice they’ve been.”’

They were wrong. When newly spliced couple got back from their wedding celebrations at around 3am they walked through their front door to a ‘total mess’.

‘They were out but had eaten a lot of food and left everything out’ she says. ‘And for some strange reason they’d completely reorganised the furniture in the living room. It was the biggest mess I’ve ever seen in our apartment before or since.

‘I was annoyed but it was so late at night and they weren’t in so who was I going to fight? We decided just to go to bed.’

Things worsened however when their guests returned loudly slamming doors and moving furniture around. They were back from their New Year’s night out but the party was far from over.

‘They were clearly very drunk’ Justine says. ‘And we could hear snorting and sniffing so I’m pretty sure they were doing drugs – especially as we found the tell-tale baggies the next day.

‘I just lay in bed and listened I didn’t want to have a confrontation in the middle of the night especially on New Year’s Eve when the police would be so busy and could take a while to come. I was upset and confused but I felt powerless.’

Tired from an exciting but emotional and exhausting day the newlyweds fell asleep – but Justine was woken up by her husband.

‘He asked me to listen up because we could hear something. Then we heard them having sex in our living room’ Justine recalls smiling awkwardly. ‘I don’t know why they did that they had a room of their own to do it in.

‘My husband was concerned that a couple with so few boundaries may even try and take our stuff but it was the middle of Montreal winter at minus 10 degrees and it was clear they weren’t in any fit state. After some hushed discussions we both went to sleep.’

In the morning Justine braved crossing her living room to nip to the loo and found two naked strangers strewn across her sofa.

‘They weren’t the people who booked the room’ she remembers. ‘Those two were actually in bed with a third stranger so there were five of them in total.

‘Naturally seeing the actual state of our flat in the cold light of day left my husband and I a little upset. We did confront the guests who originally booked the apartment and they were incredibly apologetic and promised to tidy.

‘My husband told them they had an hour to clean up and get out and in all fairness to them that’s exactly what they did. They left a note for us apologising once again that everything got out of hand and even congratulating us on our wedding.’

But what would make a person treat someone else’s property with such disdain in the first place?

According to psychologist Callie Stewart trips away can often trigger an identity overhaul causing even the most mild-mannered holidaymakers to go into full-on party mode when given the chance.

‘A break can provide a certain type of person with an environment that allows them to let their guard down step out of their default identity and into one that they would choose’ she explains.

‘It’s liberating to have a brief moment to escape so some people act and behave however they want. When people are trashing their hotel or rental they’re staying in they’re not acting consciously – they’re using a very small window of opportunity to let go get loose and enjoy themselves.’

For Justine her guests’ decision to ‘let loose’ in her home – despite knowing it was her wedding night – led to her and her husband making a complaint to Airbnb about their behaviour particularly as their wild partying meant there was a casualty: their rug had been ‘soiled’ and had to be replaced.

‘Airbnb were helpful throughout the complaints process’ she says. ‘What we were asking for was such a small amount for a large company. They refunded us one night and paid for our new carpet which was $200 we just had to provide a receipt.

‘They also banned our guests from the platform to prevent it from happening again.’

At the time of the incident Justine recalls that she and her husband felt both bemused and angry. Now nearly six years later they can laugh off the wedding night debacle describing it as a ‘funny story’ they can tell friends.

‘They were only about 20’ Justine reflects. ‘They were just kids themselves. If they were older then I probably would have a different view on it. It’s no harm no foul – our house was mostly fine I’ve seen stories of people getting their entire properties trashed.’

The house had to be extensively tidied (Picture: Getty Images)

Justine and her husband even continued to use Airbnb for another year before letting out the room in their flat for a long-term basis to someone they met on the platform looking for a room to rent in Montreal.

‘We probably would have stopped at that point anyway’ she says. ‘We found as the site got more popular people’s expectations changed. People treated us more like a hotel demanding 10 fresh towels and access to things we couldn’t guarantee. We also had guests complain about noise in the other apartments but who are we to tell other people to be quiet in their own homes?

‘I think as the app really blew up more people wanted to rent whole houses especially if they were looking to party. We found bookings started to taper off and it wasn’t as lucrative as it once was.’

For Airbnb their party ban is serious business – even if it means losing customers. They confirmed in a statement that around 6600 people’s accounts had been suspended in 2021 alone for ‘attempting to violate’ the new rules.

‘We believe there is a direct correlation between our implementation of the policy in August 2020 and a 44% year-over-year drop in the rate of party reports globally a 49% drop in reports in Ireland and 63% drop in the UK’ a statement on their site reads. ‘The ban has been well received by our Host community and we’ve received positive feedback from community leaders and elected officials. As we build on this momentum we believe the time is right to codify this policy.

‘Strong policies must be complemented by strong enforcement. We’ve introduced a number of anti-party measures in recent years to enforce our policy and try to the best of our ability to stop both unauthorised parties and chronic party houses.’

Meanwhile Nikki says that as someone who still lets out her flat there is still more that can be done to put hosts at ease.

‘I think Airbnb should encourage guests when they book your place to introduce themselves to you and let you know why they’re staying at yours’ she says. ‘More and more recently I’ve had less of that. People just book your place and you don’t hear anything from them and it does make me a wee bit more anxious.

‘Another issue is that sometimes you can’t see a picture of who has booked your place. Sometimes their display image is a cartoon or a group shot so you don’t know who you’re dealing with.

‘A huge amount of trust is put in from the hosts and it would be nice to have some more reassurance’ adds Nikki.

‘I’ve set my account so that I have to approve people to book my property if they don’t have any reviews – if someone has poor reviews I don’t allow them to book. That makes me feel slightly more at ease.’

Thanks to the reasonable behaviour of most holidaymakers Nikki is still enjoying her time as an Airbnb super-host and says she has no plans to leave the platform particularly as it’s so lucrative for her.

‘I had one bad experience but on the whole the majority of people are pretty good’ she says. ‘If I had a string of rubbish guests it was causing me endless hassle and I had to replace stuff all the time then I would look to just rent my property out long-term. At the moment this works best for me.

‘Even so’ she adds ‘it’s always a relief to go back into my flat the morning after someone’s checked out and see everything is in one piece.’

The nearly 21000-square-foot mansion known as “La Consentida” which was designed by architect Chacho Rojas is currently listed on Airbnb for $620 per night (three-night minimum). It includes a swimming pool terraces and garden and is only four minutes away from the beach.

According to TV Azteca’s news show Ventaneando Gabriel purchased the home in 2003 and later gave it to his son Joan Aguilera. Apparently the home was abandoned for several years but was recently remodeled with the help of Aguilera’s mother-in-law Malaica Valiente.

The number of guests allowed to stay in “La Consentida” is 16 but the listing also says that “no parties” are allowed which is a bit confusing since one would think 16 people having fun under one roof would technically count as a party.

There are other amenities renters can take advantage of for an extra cost. This includes an additional three-bedroom apartment located in the lower part of the house. There is also a yacht for rent so guests can take a tour around the bay.

Late last month new music by Juan Gabriel was released through Virgin Music U.S. Latin the label Gabriel’s estate signed with earlier this year. His vocals were joined with Banda El Recodo and La India for a new single “Ya” which will be the lead track on his upcoming album Los Dúo 3.

“Ya” just might be the perfect song to play while staying at “La Consentida” with 16 friends – singing dancing drinking and eating.

The entire property is about as large as a regularly sized bedroom in a house. The bathroom is a full bath though so you will not have to worry about not being able to shower after a long day spent out in the hot sun and salty air. The bedroom is large enough for the king bed and any suitcases or supplies you need to bring — and features the same thatched walls as the outside of the hut to really emphasize the Tiki vibe. With doors on three sides of the bedroom that put you less than a foot away from the ocean it is hard to feel more beachy.

The real superstar of this Airbnb though is the patio. Facing the sun the patio has two comfy chairs and the space and hooks to hang a huge hammock where you can swing and lounge halfway above the water. The posts for the hammock also double as docks to anchor the paddleboards and other watersports supplies so you can slide right from the hammock to play in the ocean."

Or follow us on Google News

Making more moves in the electric aviation arena electric propulsion company Evolito has acquired aerospace battery company Electroflight.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the news though is that the two young companies previously collaborated under the name YASA. “Having previously worked together as YASA we successfully powered the worlds fastest electric aircraft the Spirit of Innovation to break the world speed record.” With such success under their belts they’ve joined forces in order to try to accelerate the transition to electric aviation. “Now as a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolito we look forward to accelerating the possibilities for emissions-free air travel together with Electroflight.”

“We are very excited to complete the acquisition of Electroflight today. The combined capabilities will enable us to deliver flexible solutions for our customers from best-in-class motor and controller subsystems to fully-integrated electric powertrains” said Ajay Lukha COO of Evolito.

What the two companies combined will be offering are electric aviation powertrains with fully integrated battery solutions. The case they are making is that they are offering high performance low weight and size and thus highly competitive electric aviation solutions. “Our high-performance low-weight axial-flux motors and controllers are smaller and lighter with a higher safety factor than any other competing electric propulsion technology. Evolito’s products enable a range of new electric propulsion applications helping to accelerate the industry’s move towards net zero.”

It’s a compelling pitch generally speaking. We are of course not fit to evaluate the competitiveness of Evolito or other electric aviation supplier companies in this nascent fast-changing market. However the history under YASA working with Rolls-Royce is another strong addition to their CV. Does that mean they offer the most cost-competitive electric airplane powertrain solutions? Certainly not — who knows which companies lead in that respect? However if I was trying to get an electric airplane or aviation company off the ground (pun somewhat intended) the Evolito team would have my ears and I’d be asking to see more details.

Note that YASA is now a fully owned subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz while Evolito was spun out of YASA in 2021.

“Electroflight have a proven track record of delivering safety critical innovative battery solutions for the electrification of aviation” Evolito says. “Evolito’s investors include B-Flexion and Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE).”

You can learn more about Evolito in the video below.

We wrote about the Rolls-Royce electric aviation project powered by YASA a few times in recent years. In January 2019 Nicolas Zart covered the announcement that Rolls-Royce would attempt to build the world’s fastest airplane. In December 2019 he followed that up when the electric airplane was unveiled. In January 2020 Rolls-Royce claimed that its electric airplane battery developed by Evolito and Electroflight was the world’s highest energy density “flying battery.” In October of 2020 I reported on the news that Rolls-Royce thought it was developing the fastest electric airplane in the world. Rolls-Royce then did set the electric airplane speed record in November 2021 less than a year ago.

Where Rolls-Royce will go from there and where Evolito will go from there we’ll wait and see. For now though it is clear that the dream of better faster more efficient and more cost effective electric aviation is the ongoing goal of the Evolito team which now includes the Electroflight team they collaborated with at YASA.

WEST LIBERTY — Macy Daufeldt is a deflector.

Tell her she’s great and she’ll flash you a quick smile of thanks and go on to tell you about her teammates.

“We’d be coming home from a volleyball match and I’d talk about this hit that she had” said Macy’s father Matt Daufeldt. “She’d usually change the subject to how good the pass was from the libero or how good the set was from the setter.”

Tell her she’s overrated and she’ll flash you a wry smile perhaps a wave to acknowledge that she heard you.

Then she’ll return to the court and stick it in your ear.

Ask the Davenport Assumption student body if Daufeldt was overrated after her riveting 37-kill masterpiece in the Class 3A state semifinals last November.

No? Didn’t think so.

Daufeldt helped elevate West Liberty High School girls’ athletics to an unprecedented level.

In the process she was the 2021 state co-player of the year in volleyball. A two-time first-team all-stater in basketball. A regular state placewinner in track and field (including a long jump championship as a freshman).

And today The Gazette honors her as its 2022 Female Athlete of the Year.

This was one of the deepest crops of area senior female athletes in recent memory and Daufeldt was a runaway winner as the award turns 40 years old.

“Her athletic ability is obvious. But her character — the way she is around little kids always has a smile on her face — that’s what I’m always going to remember” said Adam Loria the school’s athletics director. “As a human being she has no weaknesses.

“Macy likes to deflect the credit on to others. If you talk about the perfect teammate it’s her. She’s an easy kid to cheer for.”

The youngest sibling showed promise early

Our first introduction to Macy Daufeldt came in 2015 a few minutes after Nevada defeated West Liberty for the 3A state volleyball championship.

Interviews were wrapping up in the media room and Hailey Daufeldt — Macy’s older sister was on that West Liberty team — made her final comment of the day:

“Wait until you see my younger sister.”

Nearly seven years later Hailey said “Yeah I still remember that. It came true right?”

Right.

“Macy is one of those players you dream about getting to coach” West Liberty volleyball coach Ruben Galvan said.

Macy is the youngest of three Daufeldt kids (the middle sibling Spencer was a walk-on for the University of Iowa football team). And as the youngest she had plenty of opportunities to blossom as an athlete.

If Hailey needed a volleyball pepper partner Macy stepped in. If Spencer wanted to throw a football around Macy made a suitable receiver.

“I loved doing that” Macy said.

Matt Daufeldt was an athlete at West Liberty. Michelle (Forbes) Daufeldt was an athlete at Lone Tree.

Not long after their wedding they bought land a couple of miles southwest of West Liberty an operation that has grown to 1000 acres of crops 5000 hogs and a small herd of cattle.

Then came the children. Hailey graduated from West Liberty in 2016 Spencer in 2019.

“That’s a hard-working axe-to-the-grindstone family” said Matt Hoeppner who coached Macy three years in basketball.

As were Hailey and Spencer Macy was an active member of West Liberty’s FFA chapter.

“When I was younger I wished I lived in town and could walk to my friends’ house” she said during a recent interview in her family’s dining room. “Now gosh if I lived in town I’d hate it.

“I love this place.”

‘The best outside hitter in the state’

As it became clear that she had volleyball promise Daufeldt joined the Iowa Rockets club program — “(Rockets coach) David Rodgers really helped me build my mental game” she said — and when she reached high school she was ready to contribute at the varsity level immediately.

“She brought a totally different dynamic to the team” Galvan said. “We expected great things from her. There was probably some pressure to perform at a high level right away.”

“Macy saw Hailey have that success. I’m sure she wanted to match that or do better.”

And at the state tournament last fall she was breathtaking.

In a three-set quarterfinal sweep of Mount Vernon she set a 3A record with 33 kills. Then came the Assumption match a five-set marathon won by the Comets 16-14 in the fifth.

Daufeldt had heard chants from opposing fans directed at her before. This was unmistakable during a timeout from the Assumption students.

“O-ver-ra-ted.”

Bad move.

“Inside I was laughing” Galvan said. “That’s what we needed to get her going. She’s not one to swear but I think she wanted to. You could see it in her eyes. She was very motivated and it all worked to our advantage.

“We saw a different Macy that day. She’s never out there to prove anything to anybody to shove it in somebody’s face.”

As the Assumption students chanted Galvan made adjustments in the huddle.

Daufeldt’s eyes were on Galvan. One hand held the water bottle from which she drank. The other was waving to the opposing students asking for more.

“She was trying to stir them up a little bit” Loria said. “She was egging them on and she was feeding off of them.”

West Delaware ended the Comets’ run in the state finals. Afterward Hawks Coach Brett Mather called Daufeldt “the best outside hitter in the state” and a couple of weeks later the Iowa Girls Coaches Association concurred: Daufeldt shared state player-of-the-year honors with Dike-New Hartford’s Payton Petersen.

Daufeldt’s recollections of that week at the Alliant Energy PowerHouse?

“Honestly I can’t remember a single thing from the Mount Vernon match” she said. “I remember the winning point against Assumption a couple of back-row kills. But that’s it.”

“I need to re-watch those. I want to do that before I leave for college.”

Daufeldt committed to Drake University early in her high school career and never wavered from that though she’s probably Power 5-caliber.

“We had never thought much about Drake never gave them a thought” Matt said. “But we went up there when Macy was a freshman and were really impressed.”

The Bulldogs took their once-every-four-years summer trip in June to Brazil winning three of four matches against Brazilian club teams.

“The defense is really different than what we did in high school” Daufeldt said. “I am playing left back instead of middle back. It’s a big switch but it’s coming along. I’m going to have to work hard work for a spot. But I love the team.”

It wasn’t just volleyball at West Liberty

Daufeldt was volleyball-first at West Liberty but certainly not volleyball-only. Though the Comets never got to state in basketball during her four years they did post their best three-year run in decades — 53-16 and three River Valley Conference South Division second-place finishes.

She averaged 18.8 points and 8.7 rebounds as a senior.

“I know she does travel volleyball but she would tell me ‘I’m in basketball right now’ even though volleyball is her future” Hoeppner said. “She respected her basketball teammates enough to give all she had when she was there.”

Two of the family’s brightest sports moments came moments apart in May 2019 at the state track meet. Spencer earned a personal best on his final throw in the shot put and Macy won the long jump title on her final attempt.

“I talk to myself a lot anyway” Macy said. “I was just saying ‘You can do this. You’ve got this.’”

Daufeldt added to her medal collection in May placing second in the 2A long jump third in the shuttle hurdle relay and fifth in the 100-meter hurdles.

For four years Macy Daufeldt helped bring West Liberty girls’ athletics to new heights. And through it all she did it with perspective.

“She never carried her losses home” said her father.

Added her sister: “If something goes wrong Macy is good about thinking about it fixing it and forgetting it.”

Deflectors can do that.

First up is Abbott Laboratories (ABT Financial) a leading medical device and equipment health care company. The company spun off its biotech segment AbbVie Inc. (ABBV Financial) in 2013. Currently Abbott Laboratories is composed of four business units including Diagnostic Products Nutrition Products Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals. The company is valued at $191 billion and generates annual revenue of $43 billion.

Abbott Laboratories has a very strong GF Score of 93 out of 100. The company scores well in all categories that are used to determine the GF Score led by a 9 out of 10 for both profitability and growth ranks. Profitability metrics are better than the majority of the health care industry and close to Abbott Laboratories’ best for the last decade. Growth was powered by revenue and earnings growth without nonrecurring items.

The company has raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years qualifying Abbott Laboratories as a Dividend King of which there are less than 50 names with the required five decades of dividend growth. The dividend has a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16% since the company spun off AbbVie. The company raised its dividend 4.4% for the Feb. 15 payment date. This follows the prior year’s increase of 25%. Shares yield 1.7% which matches the five-year average yield exactly according to Value Line.

Abbott Laboratories is trading below its intrinsic value according to the GF Value chart.

Abbott Laboratories closed Friday’s trading session at $109.26. The stock has a GF Value of $128.88 giving it a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.85. Reaching the GF Value would result in a share price gain of 18%. The stock’s yield could push total returns towards the 20% level. Abbott Laboratories is rated as modestly undervalued by GuruFocus.

Allstate

Next up is Allstate Corp. (ALL Financial) which has become a top name in insurance through its segments such as Allstate Life and Allstate Protection. The company ranks as the number two provider of property and casualty insurance and is one of the largest names in life insurance. It writes insurance policies that cover auto homeownersand personal lines. The company’s brands include Allstate Esurance and Encompass. The $36 billion company has annual revenue of $42 billion.

Allstate’s GF Score is 93 out of 100. The company’s weakest area is financial strength where it receives just a 5 out of 10. Everywhere else the company has high marks. Allstate’s growth rank is a perfect 10 out of 10 due to outranking the majority of peers on revenue Ebitda and earnings per share without NRI growth. Momentum is 9 out of 10 profitability is 8 out of 10 and GF Value is a 7 out of 10.

Allstate has a dividend growth streak of 10 years including a 4.9% increase for the April 1 distribution. This followed a 50% increase in the prior year. The company’s dividend has a CAGR of 11.8% since 2012. Shares of Allstate yield 2.6% solidly ahead of both the stock’s five-year average yield of 2% and the average yield for the market index.

Shares are trading at a solid discount to the GF Value.

Allstate has a recent price of $130.87 and a GF Value of $147.53 giving the stock a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.89. Reaching the GF Value would result in a 12.7% gain in the share price. With the dividend total returns could push into the mid-teens range. Allstate is rated as modestly undervalued.

Cisco

The next stock for consideration is Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO Financial) one of the largest providers of internet-based networking and data transportation solutions. The company supplies the routers and switches that allow networks around the globe to connect to each other. In addition Cisco’s product line includes data centers cloud applications and security products. The company is valued at $180 billion and produced revenue of close to $50 billion in its most recent fiscal year.

Cisco has a GF Score of 93 out of 100. The company’s weakest score is in the area of momentum where it has a 5 out of 10. Cisco does well in most other areas led by a perfect 10 out of 10 in profitability. Here the company is ahead of most of its peers in almost every category. Cisco also scores well against its own history. The company earns a 9 out of 10 on growth and a 7 out of 10 on both financial strength and GF Value.

The company has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years. Cisco’s dividend CAGR is robust at 20% since 2012 but dividend growth has slowed greatly in the near term. The dividend has been raised just 1 cent or 2 cents per share per quarter over the last four years. Helping to compensate for this low growth rate is the current yield of 3.5% which is more than twice the yield of the S&P 500 Index. It is also better than the yield of 3.1% that Cisco has averaged since 2017.

The stock looks attractively priced looking at the GF Value chart.

Cisco closed the trading week at $43.39. Shares have a GF Value of $50.37 equating to a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.86. It could return 16.1% if it reached its GF Value. Total returns could approach the high-teens when including the stock’s dividend. The company earns a rating of modestly undervalued.

CSX

The final name for consideration is CSX Corp. (CSX Financial) the largest railroad in the eastern portion of the United States. The company began with just 13 miles of track in 1827 but now has approximately 21000 route miles that connect 23 states in the Northeast Midwest and Southeast U.S. as well as to two Canadian provinces. The $63 billion company generated revenue of $12.5 billion in 2021.

CSX’s GF Score is 91 out of 100. Financial strength is its weakest area at 5 out of 10 but the Piotroski F-score of 7 out of 9 shows a financially strong company. Profitability rank is a 9 out of 10 as CSX easily tops most competitors in the transportation industry. Rounding out the other areas that contribute to the GF Score momentum is a perfect 10 out of 10 GF Value is a 9 out of 10 and growth is 8 out of 10.

CSX has rewarded shareholders with a dividend increase for 17 consecutive years including a 7.2% increase for the March15 payment date. The latest increase was close to the company's dividend CAGR of 8.3% since 2012 and not too far off the prior year’s raise of 7.7%. Shares offer a yield of 1.4% in line with the five-year average.

The stock looks cheaply priced according to the GF Value chart.

CSX closed Friday at $28.99. The stock has a GF Value of $37.47 giving it a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.77. Shares could see a return of 29%. The dividend could push total returns into the low-30% range. CSX is rated as modestly undervalued.

Final thoughts

Identifying companies that tend to outperform might have gotten easier thanks to the GF Score ranking system. Using a variety of key components to rank stocks allows the investor to create a watchlist of high-quality companies from a single source.

Abbott Laboratories Allstate Ciscoand CSX are four stocks that have a GF Score of at least 91 out of 100. All four names rank highly in most individual categories. Each also has a least a decade of dividend growth and trades with a double-digit discount to their respect intrinsic values.

These companies could be excellent investment options for those looking for a combination of high returns income and value.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcmVtZXpjbGEuY29tL211c2ljL3dhdGNoLWthcm9sLWcta2lja3Mtb2ZmLWZpcnN0LXVzLXNvbG8tYXJlbmEtdG91ci1pbi1hLWZseWluZy1mZXJyYXJpL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vcmVtZXpjbGEuY29tL211c2ljL3dhdGNoLWthcm9sLWcta2lja3Mtb2ZmLWZpcnN0LXVzLXNvbG8tYXJlbmEtdG91ci1pbi1hLWZseWluZy1mZXJyYXJpLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH: Karol G Kicks Off First US Solo Arena Tour in a Flying Ferrari,"Last night (Sept. 6) Karol G unlocked a new achievement in her career.

Over the past few years Karol G has risen in the ranks in the reggaeton and Latine music scene. Her first tour for her debut album 2017’s Unstoppable was a club tour throughout the U.S. Last year she worked her way up into theatres and some arenas for the tour behind the KG0516 album. Now with the $trip Love Tour la Bichota is performing only in arenas across the country by herself just like her Colombian cohorts J Balvin and Maluma.

The setlist for Karol G’s $trip Love Tour features hits from her three albums Unstoppable Ocean and KG0516. Notably while singing “El Makinon” she flies around the arena in a floating Ferrari. In the fan videos where Karol G was singing “Provenza” and “MAMIII” sans Becky G the audience sang the words loudly back to her.

Cryptocurrency prices look set to end the week near highs despite strong US jobs data underpinning Fed tightening expectations.

Bitcoin was last trading just above $21500 while Ethereum found support above $1200.

The Coinbase Bitcoin premium returned to positive territory again on Friday suggesting a recovery in institutional demand.

Crypto Bulls Remain in Control

Amid impressive resilience in US stock markets in the face of the latest strong US jobs report and other US data this week that has pointed to resilience in the US economy cryptocurrency prices remain near-weekly highs. Some analysts had been hoping for data this week to show a weakening of the US economy that might deter the Fed from tightening so aggressively.

But despite the strong data crypto bulls remain in control. Though flat on Friday just above $21500 Bitcoin is currently on course to post a weekly gain of over 12%. That would mark its best weekly performance since late March.

The cryptocurrency hit more than three-week highs in the mid-$22000s on Friday. Analysts said technical momentum helped the world’s largest cryptocurrency this week following a bullish pennant breakout.

Meanwhile the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization Ethereum found support above $1200 on Saturday. ETH/USD is eyeing another run at resistance in the $1280 area. The cryptocurrency is currently on course to post a weekly gain of roughly 14%. As with Bitcoin that would mark Ethereum’s best weekly performance since March.

In terms of the major altcoins Polygon Avalanche Uniswap and Solana are the best performers in the crypto top 20 of the last week. According to CoinMarketCap their prices have risen between 20-30% in the last seven days.

Robust US Jobs Data Supports Aggressive Fed Rate Hike Timeline

Official labor market data released on Friday showed that the US jobs market remained healthy last month. Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that 372000 jobs were added to the US economy in June. That was more than the expected rise of 268K and only a slight slowdown from the pace of job growth in May.

The unemployment remained close to pre-pandemic levels at 3.6% as expected. The YoY rate of Average Hourly Wage growth fell a little to 5.1% slightly higher than the expected 5.0% and still well above the Fed’s 2.0% inflation target.

Analysts interpreted the strong data as supporting the case for another 75 bps rate hike from the Fed later this month. Even prior to the latest jobs data a few Fed policymakers have in recent days voiced support for such a move.

Story continues

Money markets now imply a near 100% probability of a 75 bps hike to a 2.25-2.50% target range. Next week’s US Consumer Price Inflation data for June probably won’t affect this pricing. If there was a big downside surprise markets would likely instead reduce their expectations for tightening beyond September and in 2023.

Bitcoin will Recover But it Could Be a Bumpy Road Says Rockefeller International Chairman

Rockefeller International Managing Director and Chairman Ruchir Sharma said in an interview on CoinDesk that Bitcoin could make a comeback similar to the stock price of e-commerce giant Amazon. During the so-called dot-com collapse of the early 2000s Amazon’s share price fell by as much as 90%. But Sharma noted that it recovered over 300x in the subsequent 20 years.

Bitcoin could follow a similar trajectory given that it is a fundamentally good idea Sharma argued. But first “we need the excesses to get weeded out” he said. Sharma warned that the current collapse may not yet be complete and the next six months could be difficult.

Again using stocks as a reference Sharma noted that bear markets on Wall Street typically last about one year and see stocks drop around 35%. But the current bear market is only six months old and has seen the S&P 500 lose around 20%. “I’m not willing to call the bottom as of yet on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies” he said.

Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Rises Suggesting Rising Institutional Demand

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted on Twitter on Friday that the premier of BTC/USD on Coinbase versus BTC/USDT on Binance turned positive for only the second time since April. According to CryptoQuant data the premium rose as high as 0.075 on Friday though it has since fallen back into modestly negative territory.

Still versus this time last week the premium is higher. Ki Young Ju explained that Coinbase is the main platform used by major US institutions to trade in Bitcoin. A negative premium suggests these institutions are selling. However the premium fell almost as low as -0.2 last week. Its recovery back towards zero suggests an improvement in institutional sentiment.

Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard Argues for Strong Crypto Regulatory Guardrails

In a speech on Friday the Vice Chairwoman of the US Federal Reserve Lael Brainard put forth an argument for strong crypto regulations. Brainard said the Fed has been “closely monitoring recent events where risks in the system have crystallized and many crypto investors have suffered losses”.

The risks and weaknesses of crypto are essentially the same as for traditional finance (TradFi) Brainard argued. “Some platforms combine market infrastructure and client facilitation with risk-taking businesses like asset creation proprietary trading venture capital and lending” she noted activities that are required to be separated in TradFi.

Crypto thus needs to meet similar safety standards before it grows large enough to threaten US financial stability Brainard stated. “Strong regulatory guardrails will help enable investors and developers to build a resilient digital-native financial infrastructure” she concluded.

The film is based on “Reaching For The Stars” the autobiography of Stockton native and former NASA astronaut José M. Hernández.

The son of migrant parents Salvador Hernández and Julia Hernández both from Ticuitaco Michoacán made it to the stars and now will be making it back to where his dream first started on television.

From the archives:Stockton's astronaut makes his lifelong dream a reality

It was December 1972 and Hernández was just 10 years old when he recalls his father making him hold the antenna of the television to improve reception.

“Here I am you know watching astronaut Gene Cernan on a black and white TV holding the rabbit ear antennas for dear life to improve reception” Hernández said. “I would get up and go outside and the moon was ... almost full and I would come back inside and see astronaut Cernan walk on the moon listen to the reporter still remember his name Walter Cronkite narrating that moonwalk and that's when it hit me. I said you know this is for me this is what I want to be.”

Growing up Hernández would travel back and forth from California to Mexico working in the fields in the Ontario/Chino area Salinas Stockton and Tracy. He worked in strawberries lettuce cherries peaches grapes and more.

Hernández's family after moving from one place to another ultimately remained in Stockton. He attended the University of the Pacific and applied to the NASA astronaut program 11 times before he was accepted on his 12th try.

In 2009 he finally made his dream come true when he went to space as a flight engineer part of the STS-128 Space Shuttle Discovery mission.

American actor Michael Peña. whose credits include ""The Martian"" where he played a pilot on a mission to Mars is set to portray Hernández in the film.

Filming is set to start in August and casting for his wife Adela Hernández and his parents is still underway.

“I think Michael Peña fits the bill because he's kind of like me in terms of normal looking. I mean he’s a very talented actor but I want the audience to sympathize with the character as the character struggles through 11 rejections to get selected as an astronaut” Hernández said.

The film was originally going to be produced by Netflix. Netflix gave the option to shelf the project for a few years or give up its rights and be free to shop it around which is how it ended up in Amazon Prime being interested and picking up on the project Hernández said.

“I think Netflix sold it to Amazon Prime and so now it's being made by Amazon not Netflix” he said.

Hernández said that he knows they have done some scouting in Houston at the Johnson Space Center and that they are doing some filming in Mexico. He is unaware if there will be any filming done in California but hopes they do some shots of Stockton and of University of the Pacific.

Mexican film director and writer Alejandra Márquez Abella will be directing the film. She has worked on films such as ""The Good Girls"" ""Semana Santa"" and ""Northern Skies Over Empty Space.""

“To me it's the greatest honor that they write a movie about my story that to me it feels kind of strange but what I'm hoping that the movie gets out is what I'm hoping it creates a sense of empowerment to kids” Hernández said. “Where they see you know the humble beginnings I came out of you know working as a migrant farm worker and that the key to moving forward or to breaking the cycle of living at or near poverty is through education.”

Hernández said he hopes his movie encapsulates inspiration but also the “five-ingredient” recipe that his dad gave him.

“Determine what your purpose in life (is) right recognize how far you are from your goal. Draw yourself a roadmap so you know how to get there. Back it up with an education and develop a work ethic second to none” Hernández said.

Hernández added his own sixth ingredient perseverance.

Hernández might have retired from NASA in 2011 but his legacy might not only continue through his new film but through his eldest son Julio Hernandez 27 who is pursuing his aerospace Ph.D. at Purdue University and has aspirations of becoming an astronaut himself one day.

“I think it's safe to say that the oldest one is. He's gonna try to become an astronaut because he's working on his PhD.” Hernández said. “When I asked him why Purdue? His answer was that he made a list of all astronauts NASA has selected and where they graduated from and that Purdue has produced the most astronauts. So that's why he went to Purdue.”

Hernández is a current Manteca resident and owns a vineyard Tierra Luna Cellars where he works alongside his father.

“There's a saying that you can take a kid out of the farm but you can’t take the farm out of the kid” Hernández said. “It's kind of another chapter of my life but it's kind of coming full circle because I started working in the fields and look at me now still working in the fields.”

Hernández is not only back to his roots with Tierra Luna Cellars but also has his own foundation the Reaching for the Stars Foundation a nonprofit organization with the mission to inspire youth to find a passion in STEM establish family support and community engagement.

Hernández's story can also be seen at the Children’s Museum of Stockton new STEM exhibit “Destination Space” which features Hernández's story as a young Stockton boy who dreamed of becoming an astronaut.

The exhibit by Dean Weldon creative director of Weldon Exhibits not only features the story of former NASA astronaut Hernández but is a replica of the International Space Station. It’s an interactive and hands-on exhibit where children can learn what it is like to eat work and sleep in space.

Hernández said he hopes that this film “A Million Miles Away” becomes an “inspirational classic.”

Typically an exercise in banality the CEO of a publicly traded firm produces a few pages of reflections on the previous year and on prospects for the future. In those instances in which a particular company has recently been subjected to unwelcome media scrutiny the shareholder letter is also an opportunity for the CEO to reassure investors that the firm has listened to its critics and is taking appropriate measures to remedy any perceived problems. This latter opportunity is especially important for Amazon which despite record profits and a breathtaking pace of expansion has endured a few rough years in the public relations department. In the spring of 2020 as is well known today the company unduly terminated a Staten Island warehouse worker for the insolence of organizing a walkout in protest of the firm’s wholly unsatisfactory COVID mitigation measures. And then in September a report from investigative journalist Will Evans who had obtained access to the company’s internal records revealed that between 2016 and 2019 the rate of serious injuries for Amazon fulfillment center employees had risen steadily from 5.9 per hundred workers to 7.7 the latter figure nearly double that of its industry peers. All this negativity cast a dark cloud over Jeff Bezos’s April 15 2021 shareholder letter which had been much anticipated since it was his last as Amazon CEO. While the letter was as discussed in last year’s commentary for this magazine littered with misrepresentation and misdirection Bezos cannot be accused of remaining silent on the matter: he dedicated no fewer than eighteen paragraphs to employee relations. And to say that the soon-to-be executive chair spoke boldly about the company’s planned revisions in this department amounts to an understatement. Henceforth Bezos announced Amazon would strive to be “Earth’s Best Employer” as well as “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.” Hardly content to while away his golden years aboard the Y721 Bezos even announced that he would be putting his time and energy where his mouth is indicating his eagerness to roll up his sleeves and “work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops” to remake Amazon as the world’s best and safest workplace. These were big promises and skeptics can hardly be faulted for doubting whether they were meant in earnest. As a general rule the more a firm seeks to cater to the desires of its customers the more it tends to demand from its workers. Perhaps the only concrete outcome of Bezos’s Parthian shot was that it cranked up the pressure on incoming CEO Andy Jassy whose first shareholder letter was published on April 15 2022. That Jassy appears to evince considerably less interest in workplace safety is evident enough from the fact that he couldn’t be bothered to devote more than two paragraphs to the matter. Jassy’s first address to Amazon investors indeed amounts to a near complete capitulation made abundantly clear in one startling act of erasure. Here’s Jassy revising the language of Bezos’ leadership principles: Last summer we added two new Leadership Principles: Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer and Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility. These concepts were always implicit at Amazon but explicit Leadership Principles help us ask ourselves — and empower more Amazonians at all levels to ask — whether we’re living up to these principles. At least “Strive to be Earth’s Safest Place to Work” however rhetorically displeasing it may have been was more or less concrete. Its replacement is a deliberately vague and shabby paraphrase of comic-book wisdom. Jassy’s first shareholder letter thus constitutes a case study in the downward adjustment of expectations not unlike the leader of a country at war conceding that no quick victory shall be forthcoming that the nation must gird itself for a long struggle for mounting casualties. It is now all too clear that if Amazon’s fulfillment centers are ever to become safe places to work — let alone “Earth’s Safest” — it will only be because change is imposed on the company.

Amazon and the Cult of Invention In a certain sense Jassy’s walking back of Bezos’s grand designs amounts to a wholly rational decision for the problem of workplace injury at the company’s warehouses under present conditions is all but unsolvable. In order to get a comprehensive understanding of the dilemma the new CEO has inherited we’ll need to take a look back at how his predecessor framed the matter in his final letter. Unlike Jassy who insists — rather preposterously — that the firm’s injury rates are “about average” Bezos did concede that Amazon needs “a better vision for our employee’s success.” But in proceeding to introduce the new leadership principles Bezos inadvertently stumbled into a clear articulation of the core problem: We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. The critical phrase is “what got us here” where the “what” stands in for the firm’s astounding feats in logistics — i.e. the ruthless efficiency that allows it to serve its customers’ every whim — and the “here” refers to Amazon’s market dominance in e-commerce. But could it be the case that the company’s obsession with customer service is also what resulted in its injury crisis? As a general rule the more a firm seeks to cater to the desires of its customers the more it tends to demand from its workers — something has to give here. But Bezos audaciously elides the contradiction promising that Amazon will become the best in the world at both. How is the company to achieve the impossible? Here Bezos appeals to one of the more exasperating aspects of our unhappy age: our near universal faith in “invention” — or more commonly “innovation” — as the solution to any and all crises: In my upcoming role as Executive Chair I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details we at Amazon are always flexible but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something and we’re not going to fail at this either. The cult of invention is so second nature to us that it even extends to those hardly rare instances in which the problem itself is the direct result of prior invention as is most certainly the case with Amazon’s injury crisis. One of journalist Will Evans’s more illuminating findings was that the rise in injuries at Amazon warehouses closely tracks with the introduction in late 2014 of the company’s robot fleet an “innovation” touted by the firm as a means of making “those jobs better and safer” indeed even of permitting workers “to take advantage of their innate human creativity instead of doing rote things over and over again.” Setting aside the subjective — and rather laughable — component of this claim the serious-injury rates in Amazon’s robotized facilities are consistently higher than for its non-robotized factories. As demonstrated in the 2021 report of the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC) between 2017 and 2020 the serious-injury rate for workers at robotic facilities was consistently between one-quarter and one-third higher than for employees in the company’s less “innovative” venues. The cult of invention even extends to those instances in which the problem itself is the direct result of prior invention as is most certainly the case with Amazon’s injury crisis. An easy way of immediately reducing injuries then would be simply to turn off the robots. But even this would be insufficient to bring Amazon into alignment with its industry peers let alone render it Earth’s Safest Place to Work. A bigger problem is the inhuman pace the company inflicts on its workers in all facilities. As noted in the 2022 SOC report the Washington State Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) office has in the past two years repeatedly cited Amazon for violations of multiple federal health and safety rules. Its admonishments directly connect the firm’s “very high pace of work” and its “monitoring and discipline systems” to its rate of injury. According to the SOC researchers this judgment is without precedent in the fifty-year history of the agency; never before has it been “determined that a company’s pace of work on its own is so high that it constitutes a separate violation of the OSHA Act requiring specific steps to reduce work speeds.” One of the many curiosities of Bezos’s 2021 shareholder letter was that he did not tout the substantial decrease in the serious-injury rate between 2019 and 2020 a 17 percent drop from the peak of 7.7 all the way down to 6.4. But we now know that there were good reasons for this omission for as the 2022 SOC reports illustrates this reduction was an unintended by-product of the company’s COVID mitigation measures. As part of its efforts to reduce infections the company temporarily suspended its notoriously draconian disciplinary system thereby significantly easing the pressure management exerts over warehouse employees. Not surprisingly the suspension was lifted in October — Prime Day was just around the corner after all — and the rate of serious injury began to climb again. Thus another means of reducing injuries reveals itself: Amazon could phase out its system of surveillance and punishment or at the very least soften its harder edges. But to ease up the pressure even a little would directly conflict with Amazon’s business model. One of the most deceitful gestures in Bezos’s final shareholder letter was his expression of pride in “the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees” that the firm’s beneficence also extends to “people who never got that advantage.” What distinguishes Amazon from its Big Five peers is that it directly employs hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers; as Francesco Massimo has recently estimated roughly 70 percent of the company’s employees work in the warehouses or as couriers. Amazon’s most impressive innovation is not the Alexa machine or the Kindle but the fulfillment center where the company has pioneered new techniques for maximum extraction of labor from its low-paid workforce. It is Amazon’s triple threat of surveillance technologies robotics and algorithmic management that permits the firm to deliver packages rapidly and at little or no cost to the customer — all at the expense of the health and well-being of the pickers and packers and sorters and drivers. It was Bezos himself along with Jeff Wilke and Dave “The Sniper” Clark who oversaw the development of this system of labor extraction indicating that at its very highest levels the company has long been aware of the damage this model inflicts on workers’ bodies. All that has changed is that thanks to the efforts of Evans and those who have followed in his wake the company’s efforts to conceal the magnitude of the crisis have increasingly faltered. But no amount of bad press is going to shame the firm into voluntarily surrendering what is most certainly its signal accomplishment. Instead we can expect more hollow reassurances that the company can and will achieve the impossible that Amazon is fully capable of being “Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work” and at the same time “Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company” — and indeed as Bezos concludes that the “two vision statements” will “reinforce each other.”

Incipit Andy Were it not for a compensation package in excess of $200 million one could almost pity Jassy for the mess he’s gotten himself into. With his predecessor seemingly preoccupied with plans for the establishment of a galactic empire the burden of remaking Amazon as Earth’s Best (if not safest) Employer now falls squarely on Andy’s shoulders. Like Bezos’s last Jassy’s first shareholder letter was eagerly anticipated — especially given the company’s recent failure to suppress a union organizing drive spearheaded by the aforementioned former Staten Island worker. Overlooked amid the enthusiasm for Jassy’s letter was the release of the SOC’s 2022 report which revealed that despite all the new measures promised by Bezos the serious-injury rate is once again heading in the wrong direction up from 6.4 in 2020 to 6.8 in 2021 against the figure of 3.3 for all other warehouse workers. Amazon employs a third of US warehouse workers yet accounts for 49 percent of serious injuries. (I reached out to Amazon for comment and have yet to receive a reply.) Much like his predecessor who had huffed that “if you read some of the news reports you might think we have no care for employees” Jassy in his shareholder letter bemoans the media coverage of his firm’s workplace injury record insisting that Amazon’s “injury rates are sometimes misunderstood.” In setting out to correct the record Jassy then offers up a series of deliberately misleading figures. In one carefully constructed sentence the new CEO concedes that Amazon’s serious-injury rate is a “little higher than the average of our warehousing peers” 6.4 against 5.5. But as Alex Press immediately countered in this magazine the rate of 6.4 is for 2020 rather than the 6.8 of 2021 thus concealing the unpleasant fact that injuries are once again on the rise. Even more egregiously Press notes the figure of 5.5 is inclusive of Amazon’s workforce which again constitutes fully one-third of US warehouse employees. The figure for non-Amazon warehouse workers is 3.3 indicating that the company single-handedly pushed the industry average up 2.2 points. According to the Bezos Theory of Value the only difference between customers and employees is that whereas customers receive goods for a price employees receive wages and benefits in exchange for labor. In an equally disingenuous gesture Jassy then claims that the serious-injury rate for Amazon couriers is significantly lower than the industry average 7.6 against 9.1. He does not however mention that Amazon’s “Delivery Service Partners” — that is the drivers of the blue vans who drop off the packages — are not included in this figure. As indicated in the 2021 SOC report these “independent contractors” are injured at nearly three times the rate of unionized UPS couriers. From Amazon’s perspective the Boys in Blue are someone else’s problem. All this obfuscation is meant to reassure shareholders that Amazon’s record is really not so awful and with a little more time for “learning inventing and iterating” those “passionate people” over in Ops will get this under control. And sadly enough it will likely work for as Greg Norman recently reminded us the investor class is on the whole a forgiving lot at least with respect to past indiscretions. It is indeed arguable that the strategy has already worked given the results of the May 25 annual shareholder meeting. All fifteen shareholder proposals — among them a call to suspend warehouse productivity measures for an independent audit of the company’s workplace safety culture for worker representation on the board and for a report on the firm’s union avoidance tactics — were defeated. In the letter Jassy informs the shareholders that in the early days of his tenure he spent “significant time” out there in the fulfillment centers. And with all the earnestness of an India Office inspector general the CEO is dismayed to report that the problem is . . . complicated. Like his predecessor Jassy largely attributes this to Amazon’s extraordinary scale of operations noting that the company hired no less than 300000 new workers in 2021. But this rather conveniently elides the company’s unprecedented rate of turnover which renders the argument moot. Even if Amazon was not growing it would still need to replace its entire warehouse workforce every eight months or so. As a backup self-defense the CEO adds personal insult to injury reminding shareholders that all too many of the new hires fall well short of the company’s optimal physical standards for its “industrial athletes.” Another through line between old and new CEOs concerns perhaps the most bizarre — and certainly most disturbing — aspect of Bezos’s final shareholder letter. As discussed in last year’s commentary Bezos articulated nothing less than a novel theory of value according to which workers (the hundreds of thousands of wage earners and contractors who pick pack and deliver the goods) are conceived as the beneficiaries of the company’s (senior management’s) largesse. Just like our customers and third-party sellers says Bezos “we” create “value” for them — no less than $91 billion worth in 2020 alone. This conflation of labor and consumption which would be laughed out of any business-school classroom is what permits Bezos to maintain the fiction that there is no contradiction between being best at serving customers while at the same time being best at meeting the needs of workers. According to the Bezos Theory of Value the only difference between customers and employees is that whereas customers receive goods for a price employees receive wages and benefits in exchange for labor. If there was any hope that Jassy might think otherwise it was quickly dissolved by his assurance that the company would approach the problem of workplace injury in the very same manner they “do other customer experiences.” Indeed the process is already well underway for Jassy is proud to announce that the safety team has “researched and created a list of what we believe are the top 100 employee experience pain points and are systematically solving them.” The word choice here is revealing as Jassy simply transposes a concept from the consumer-relations side — customer experience “pain points” — onto the qualitatively different domain of employee relations. For the Amazon warehouse workers who suffer from the company’s daily predations this is profoundly insulting. In effect Jassy equates the hassle of a broken hyperlink or an errant delivery address to the debilitating physical distress inflicted on workers’ bodies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbHVtYmlhbi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2p1bC8wOS9lYXN0LXZhbmNvdXZlci13YXJlaG91c2VzLWhhdmUtYW1hem9uLXRpZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,East Vancouver warehouses have Amazon ties,"Photo

Two new warehouse developments one on land owned by Amazon and the other to potentially be leased to Amazon will soon rise near 162nd Avenue and Fourth Plain Boulevard in east Vancouver turning the location into a further hub for warehouse distribution and truck traffic.

The pieces of land have been sitting as partial wetlands but plans for both show they won’t stay that way much longer. The city of Vancouver issued construction permits for the Amazon-owned land at 6100 N.E. 147th Ave. Bridge Industrial purchased the property at 5500 N.E. 162nd Ave. and will begin constructing a warehouse in the next few months.

Bridge Industrial also plans to improve and build upon the roadways around the facility for the additional traffic along 162nd Avenue.

The construction plans on Amazon’s property executed through Portland-based TC Pursuit Services include a lot mostly taken up by surface parking on 538000 square feet. Builders will also construct an 80000-square-foot warehouse to “be used by a single tenant for logistics delivery station” according to plans submitted to the city.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjE0ODUwLmNvbS8wNzEwMjY2MDMtYW1hem9uLXByaW1lLWdydWJodWIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Prime members now get a free year of Grubhub+ membership,"We’re big fans of ordering directly from local restaurants whenever possible but we realize there are lots of reasons people use third-party delivery services such as Ithaca To Go DoorDash Uber Eats and Grubhub. There’s a new reason to check out Grubhub: Amazon Prime subscribers get a free year of premium Grubhub+ membership with free food delivery and other perks.

In general if you can pick up the food yourself or the restaurant does its own delivery ordering directly from them means they earn the most money. Third-party online ordering and delivery services not only charge you for the delivery — they also charge the restaurant a hefty cut typically around 25% of the check. Considering how thin restaurant margins are that can mean the only business profiting from your order might be the delivery company.

Many restaurants simply don’t have the resources to do their own delivery and rely on these third-party services in order to offer delivery to their customers. Others rely on these online ordering tools for “discovery” — showing up as an option when diners don’t know what they’re in the mood for and just start surfing the options.

“They are all about the same” says one Ithaca restaurant owner of the third-party ordering and delivery services adding that “the marketplace of available restaurants serves a purpose for restaurants and patrons.” Despite the “slim slim margins” it’s worthwhile to get the restaurant in front of diners looking for a meal and some eateries send along coupons and discount codes to encourage those diners to order directly next time.

Knowing that and knowing that many Tompkins County residents are already Amazon Prime members whether it’s for the free shipping perks music streaming or Prime Video we figure it’s worth giving Grubhub+ a try.

Claim your Grubhub+ at amazon.com/grubhub

Grubhub+ membership offers $0 delivery fee on all orders that subtotal at least $12 (not including tax tip or other fees) a free $10 meal each month and discounts on orders from many participating restaurants.

If you’re not already an Amazon Prime subscriber it’s easy to sign up for a 30-day free trial and then activate Grubhub+. If you cancel your Prime membership after the free trial your Grubhub+ benefits end too. Amazon Prime free trials include access to the upcoming two-day Prime Day taking place July 12th and 13th and the option to add premium streaming services like Paramount+ Showtime and Starz to Prime Video.

Grubhub+ is even included with the half-price Prime Student membership.

GRAND RAPIDS Mich. – An American Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Grand Rapids officials said.

Around 10:15 p.m. Friday the flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago bound for Buffalo New York alerted Gerald R. Ford International Airport about possible smoke in the cockpit Lisa Carr the Grand Rapids airport public safety and operations director said in a statement to the Grand Rapids Press.

An aircraft rescue and firefighting team and Kent County officials responded to the call.

The plane landed safely in Grand Rapids and all passengers left the plane Carr said.

No injuries were reported.

Monica Gilliam 39 a photography professor blasted the airline after Kimber was not escorted off the plane and disappeared.

The youngster had been flying solo from Chattanooga to Miami last week to see her father for a three-week trip.

Her mother had forked out an extra $150 for her to be chaperoned through both airports and wear a badge information cabin crew she was not with an adult.

But when she got off the aircraft they simply smiled and waved at her and let her wander around the airport before finally being found by her dad.

It came amid general chaos at airports across the US with hundreds of flights canceled and thousands delayed over the July 4 holiday.

The weekend marked the busiest travel period since the pandemic began as nearly 50million took to the skies roads and rails to see loved ones.

Mayhem continued this week as nearly 100 flights into out and around the country were cancelled and 245 were delayed.

Meanwhile the Biden administration looked to invest $1billion annually for the next five years for improvements at 85 airports across the US.

The $5 billion will go toward several projects – including air traffic control towers terminals security checkpoints and baggage inspection and screening areas.

What SHOULD customers get for American Airlines' $150 unaccompanied minors policy? American Airlines' 'unaccompanied minors' policy says those aged five to 14 have to use their service. It says those aged between 15 and 17 can use it but it is optional. The system costs $150 to use each way on top of the ticket price and there is a further charge for siblings flying together. Its website says it includes: 'Early boarding to allow extra time to get settled and meet the flight attendants. 'Kids-only lounges in our hub cities for flight connections Complimentary Kids' Kits from Quaker with snacks and activities (for ages 5 – 10 in hub cities). 'An airport escort to help your child to the gate for flight connections Escorting the child to the authorized adult picking them up when they land. 'Keep in mind our flight attendants will be busy with onboard duties and can't continuously monitor your child during their flight. Let your child know to ring the call button if they need anything.'

Gilliam said: 'It's not OK and it shouldn't happen. Almost an hour after her flight landed I got a call from American Airlines.

'It was the American Airlines manager at Miami and he says 'your child is missing we've shut down the terminal we don't know where she is.'

The child's flight had landed early and instead of an escort she was ushered off the plane with a wave from the flight attendants Gilliam said.

She continued: 'It turns out that the flight attendants waved her off the plane and said 'bye' and she didn't know what to do so she kept going because they were telling her 'bye' so she kept walking.'

The child wandered through the terminal an image that shook Gilliam to her core.

'So she's going through the airport with that billboard on her that she was an unaccompanied minor in one of the largest human trafficking hubs in the country' she said on TikTok.

The child was able to get in touch with her father and he talked her through the airport until they met up without further drama.

'On the way out no American Airlines employees stopped her to see if she had an adult not one Miami airport employee stopped her and even the TSA security agent-before she left the secure area into baggage claim-stopped her.'

Flight cancelation Q&A: Why are airlines slashing so many flights and what is being done to fix it? Why are there so many delays and attempts by the airlines to cancel and delay flights? The airlines are increasingly trying to blame delays on understaffing at the Federal Aviation Administration which manages the nation's airspace and hires air-traffic controllers. The FAA has admitted it's understaffed especially in an important air control center in Florida which has meant a decrease in the quality of service and an increase in delays and cancelations. Problems were popping up well before the weekend with some disruptions caused by thunderstorms that slowed air traffic. Why are airlines cutting flights? Many of them including Delta Southwest and JetBlue have trimmed summer schedules to reduce stress on their operations. They are using larger planes on average to carry more passengers with the same number of pilots. Those steps haven't been enough so far this summer. Are the pilots striking? The pilots are not striking. Federal law creates a long and difficult process before airline workers can legally go on strike. The pilots are still walking picket lines while remaining on the job at various airports. The pilots plan to picket not strike on the days they're not scheduled to work in order to bring attention to the issues. Why are pilots attempting to picket? Pilots have complained that thinly staffed airlines are asking them to work too many flights with more pilots reporting fatigue. The Air Line Pilots Association claimed earlier this week its nearly 14000 members are working longer hours even as airlines cancel thousands of trips. What have officials proposed to potentially fix this or punish the airlines? The Biden administration is blaming the airlines saying it received billions in stimulus money to keep them afloat during the pandemic and should stick to the schedule it publishes. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said earlier this month that airlines had until July 4 to figure out the issues and work out the kinks so travelers can have a smooth summer holiday. Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote a letter to Buttigieg demanding he fine airlines $55000 per passenger for every flight cancellation they know can't be fully staffed. Congressional leaders are demanding the airlines provide answers as to why there continues to be disruptions especially since the industry received $50 billion in relief during the pandemic in an effort to keep business afloat.

Flyers across the US were hit by a slew of cancelations and delays that caused pandemonium across the country over the last week.

Around 48 million people traveled over the weekend with AAA estimating 3.5million were to take to the air.

But the actual number of passengers flying may have been dramatically higher as experts screened more than 2.4 million travelers at airports on Thursday alone.

But many fliers faced disappointment with 604 flights canceled by lunchtime last Saturday and 2879 delayed.

Since the hectic Juneteenth travel weekend the US has seen more than 12000 flights cancelled according to Flight Aware.

In addition to airport chaos and heavy traffic holiday travelers will have to contend with higher prices.

Average gas prices have soared 56 percent from a year ago mid-range hotel prices have increased 23 percent and average lowest airfares are up 14 percent.

They are using larger planes on average to carry more passengers with the same number of pilots. Those steps haven't been enough so far this summer.

Meanwhile the Biden administration is tapping funds from the bipartisan infrastructure bill to invest a whopping $1 billion annually for the next five years for improvements at 85 airports across the US.

The $5 billion will go toward several projects – some of the most important being upgrading air traffic control towers terminals security checkpoints and baggage inspection and screening areas.

'America is a country that brought the modern aviation age to the world — and yet around the world in most rankings of airport quality not one of our airports ranks among the top 25. That's something that we have to change' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told reporters.

The investment comes as U.S. airlines and airports continue to face staff shortages and other complications leading to an increase in flight cancellations and delays.

The Independence Day weekend holiday saw pre-pandemic travel levels in the U.S. which led to 1400 cancellations and 14000 delays Friday through Sunday.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) usually fronts investments in runways and air control towers but the administration's investments go further.

Buttigieg claimed while airlines are footing the costs for many airport improvement projects federal resources should also be allocated toward airport infrastructure.

'I don't think anybody could look at airports across America today and say that the existing system or the existing levels of funding have been adequate' he said.

'It is very natural for public funds to go to publicly important resources and pieces of infrastructure' Buttigieg added. 'And we think that includes airport terminals.'

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on Fox News to defend his record and explain why travel was disrupted over the holiday weekend. He said he had no plans to raise the retirement age for pilots beyond 65 to ease staffing shortages

The man in charge of implementing Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure package concurred.

'Airport terminals is not something the federal government has historically invested in. It's typically been to local airport owners and airlines that have done that' said Mitch Landrieu who is also a former New Orleans mayor.

'But the need is evident' he added.

Grants announced Thursday include $20 million each for the main airports in Detroit Michigan and Philadelphia Pennsylvania just to renovate their bathrooms.

Some of the largest FAA grants provided are $60 million to improve the terminal and bag-handling system at the Denver International Airport as well as $50 million for Boston's Logan Airport and another $50 million for the Orlando International Airport in Florida.

Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. will get $49.6 million to build a new concourse and the Pittsburgh International Airport will receive $20 million to build an additional terminal.

Another $5 million is going toward terminal expansion at Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport in Tennessee.

Projects range from massive hubs like the Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport to small regional airports like the Dexter Airport in Maine.

A whopping 532 airports across the country submitted grant applications for 658 different projects according to the FAA. If all were approved the total would amount to $14 billion.

Some of the complications with flights recently have been pilot shortages but Buttigieg said Tuesday that the administration does not plan to raise the retirement age despite how it could help with the staffing issue.

The maximum age for a pilot is 65 which was increased 15 years ago.

Even though Americans are living and working longer – including 79-year-old President Joe Biden – Buttigieg said the retirement age would not be increased again.

'I'm much more interested in raising the bar on things like compensation and job quality than lowering the bar on something like safety' Buttigieg told Fox News on Tuesday following the hectic holiday weekend for air travelers.

'And when you get to these training hours retirement age and those things those are fundamentally safety regulations' he added.

'The United States of America shouldn't be able to have a robust aviation system without watering down our expectations on safety and I will consider and entertain anything that does not compromise safety.'

American Airlines said it was investigating the incident involving Gilliam and her daughter.

A spokesman said: 'American cares deeply about our young passengers and is committed to providing a safe and pleasant travel experience for them' according to the airline's statement.

'We take these matters very seriously and are looking into what occurred. A member of our team has reached out to the customer to learn more about their experience.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2FpcmxpbmVzLXVyZ2VkLXRvLWxldC1mYW1pbGllcy1zaXQtdG9nZXRoZXItb24tcGxhbmVzLWJ5LXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWRlcGFydG1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines urged to let families sit together on planes by Transportation Department,"The Transportation Department on Friday urged airlines to make it easier for families to sit together on planes at no extra charge.

The department said in a notice to airlines that the carriers “should do everything that they can to ensure the ability of a young child” 13 or younger to sit next to an older family member.

The agency said it will monitor airlines starting in November and might propose new regulations.

The trade group Airlines for America said carriers “have always worked to accommodate customers who are traveling together especially those traveling with children and will continue to do so.”

The Transportation Department said it has received more than 500 complaints in the last five years about families unable to sit together. However that is only about 1% of all complaints against airlines and is dwarfed by gripes about refunds and flight problems.

In 2016 Congress prodded airlines to let kids sit next to a family member at no extra charge but the Trump administration Transportation Department did not draft rules on the matter and neither has the Biden administration.

The department said Friday that airlines could do several things to help relatives sit together including assigning adjacent seats at booking or setting aside areas for families.

Increasingly airlines charge extra for desirable seats to boost revenue. The 2016 law does not require them to make seat assignments that would upgrade a passenger to a better cabin or seat if there is an extra charge for that seat.

The department also issued a bill of rights for airline passengers with disabilities a summary of existing laws that travelers can use as a reference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1sYXRhbS1kb3Qtam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS1jb25kaXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta & LATAM Accept All DOT Joint Venture Conditions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1sYXRhbS1kb3Qtam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS1jb25kaXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIxODM4ODUvYWlybGluZXMtYXJlLXBpbG90aW5nLWEtcHJvZ3JhbS10by1zZWxsLXplcm8tY2FyYm9uLWZsaWdodHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines are piloting a program to sell “zero carbon” flights,"Business travel is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions in the corporate world.

The business software vendor Salesforce for instance generated 146000 metric tons of carbon emissions—roughly equal to the annual emissions of 18000 US homes—just by flying its employees around the world to client meetings and conferences in 2019. For comparison that’s about 60% as much carbon as all of Salesforce’s data centers generated that year hosting cloud computing services for over 150000 clients.

Salesforce has vowed to cut its carbon emissions to zero by 2040. To reach that goal the company will have to find a more climate-friendly form of business travel. That’s why Salesforce is one of dozens of companies experimenting with buying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates which are designed to give business travelers a way to book carbon-neutral flights. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has backed the concept and is designing an accounting framework that would allow airlines to sell SAF certificates to their biggest corporate clients.

If it works proponents say the scheme could help companies cut their carbon emissions jumpstart the market for lower-carbon jet fuels and create a pathway to decarbonize the airline industry by 2050.

The World Economic Forum’s SAF certificate framework

SAF is a category of jet fuels that releases between 50% and 80% less carbon than standard petroleum-based jet fuel. Right now SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of the fuel used in commercial flights because it’s more expensive than standard jet fuel and supply is very limited. But if there were an economic incentive for manufacturers to produce more SAF and for airlines to buy more of it the aviation industry could cut its carbon emissions considerably.

To create that economic incentive the WEF—along with airlines and some of their largest business travel customers—are designing a system they’ve dubbed “SAF certificates.” Under the proposed system companies like Salesforce could buy SAF certificates from airlines to offset the carbon emissions generated by their employees’ business travel. Airlines would use the money they make from selling these certificates to buy a certain amount of SAF instead of traditional jet fuel. By replacing a set amount of jet fuel with lower-carbon SAF the airline would reduce its carbon emissions by a clear measurable amount.

If the program is designed well—with transparency oversight and clear accounting—a company like Salesforce could buy SAF certificates and meaningfully reduce its business travel emissions to zero.

Airlines and their biggest corporate travel clients have been testing out the concept since 2021. Last year 11 companies including Boston Consulting Group Nike and HP bought enough SAF certificates from United Airlines to subsidize the purchase of about 3.4 million gallons of SAF (about 0.1% of United’s fuel consumption). In February JetBlue announced four companies including Salesforce will buy enough SAF certificates to subsidize 325000 gallons of SAF (0.05% of JetBlue’s 2021 fuel consumption).

The WEF has used data from some of these early transactions to design an accounting system for tracking how much each SAF certificate sale helps reduce carbon emissions. The organization plans to publish its accounting rules in September and test them out with a new round of experimental SAF certificate sales later this year. The WEF aims to establish a global SAF certificate market which meets the standards of environmental watchdogs like the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) by 2024.

What are sustainable aviation fuels?

Many types of fuel can count as SAF including biofuels made from corn algae used cooking oil municipal trash sewage and other forms of waste or synthetic fuels like liquid hydrogen created using renewable electricity. The key requirement is that all these fuels must emit at least 50% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel.

For now most SAF is biofuel made from used cooking oil which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions (pdf) by as much as 84% compared to conventional jet fuel. But there simply isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to meet the airline industry’s fuel consumption according to Mike McCurdy an engineer who heads the energy advisory department at consulting firm ICF. McCurdy estimates there’s enough readily available kitchen grease out there to produce 3 to 5 billion gallons of fuel a year split between SAF and biodiesel for trucks. Commercial airlines by comparison used 95 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2019.

Meeting the airline industry’s fuel needs through SAF will require fuel producers to refine the process for converting woodchips crops and household food waste into biofuels. But those fuel sources will require years of research and construction to scale up and become cost competitive. For instance one of the earliest alcohol-to-jet-fuel facilities operated by the alternative fuel startup LanzaJet aims to produce just 10 million gallons of SAF per year from corn ethanol when it opens at the end of 2022.

The SAF market’s chicken-and-egg problem

The SAF market needs billions of dollars in investment to scale up production to replace conventional jet fuel. But the market is stuck at an impasse. Airlines are reluctant to buy SAF because it typically costs about twice as much as conventional jet fuel. And manufacturers are reluctant to produce more SAF because airlines don’t want to buy it.

SAF certificates offer a way to break the impasse and start a virtuous cycle. If business travelers were to subsidize the extra cost of buying lower-carbon fuels airlines would be willing to use them. Greater demand from airlines should incentivize manufacturers to produce more SAF. As manufacturing scales up costs would fall and eventually SAF could become cost competitive with petroleum-based jet fuel according to Eliot Lees vice president for clean transportation at ICF.

“The challenge is priming the pump and getting this new renewable jet fuel into the fleet as quickly as possible” said Lees. “If you wait for the market to do it it’s going to be a challenge to meet the emissions target that both the federal government is pushing and the industry is trying to achieve.”

“If you wait for the market to do it it’s going to be a challenge to meet the emissions target that both the federal government is pushing and the industry is trying to achieve.”

“Priming the pump” starts with a handful of companies that collectively fly millions of employees around the world each year. Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Boeing Deloitte JPMorgan Chase McKinsey Microsoft Netflix and Salesforce are the founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) a group of corporate business travel giants committed to buying SAF certificates to push airlines and fuel manufacturers to ramp up SAF production and use. “Because there is significant concentration in demand for flying especially around corporate [travelers] we believe we can send a very strong signal to the market and help create the market for SAF” said Tarek Helmi who leads Deloitte’s work on sustainable energy.

Recent spikes in oil prices have brought SAF and conventional jet fuel closer to cost parity: The average US price of SAF is $8.33 per gallon compared to $7.33 per gallon for conventional jet fuel. But even small price premiums for SAF can be a big barrier for airlines according to Lees. “Aviation is a highly competitive industry with very small margins that there’s significant pressure to maintain and jet fuel makes up 30% of airlines’ costs” he said. Paying an extra dollar a gallon for fuel would eat into airlines’ margins at a moment when even the biggest firms are struggling to break even.

The SAF certificate accounting challenge

Before the WEF can help establish a trusted global market for SAF certificates it will need to create a transparent carbon accounting system. The certificates won’t have any value unless the businesses that buy them have can prove they are truly reducing carbon emissions as much as they say they are. Otherwise companies that buy SAF certificates will face the same accusations of greenwashing that plague the carbon offset market.

The best way to create that trust is through a clear consistent accounting system that wins the endorsement of recognized authorities on corporate carbon cutting schemes. Getting those organizations’ buy-in is crucial for convincing companies to spend money on SAF certificates according to Andrew Chen who heads the aviation decarbonization team at the Rocky Mountain Institute an environmental consulting group that helped found SABA and is working with the WEF to design the SAF certificate accounting system it plans to publish in September.

“The Science Based Targets Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are going to look at that suite of documents and say ‘Is this legit? Have they really thought through all of this? Do they have an accurate accounting approach?’” said Chen. If SBTI and GHGP aren’t satisfied companies will have a hard time justifying SAF certificate purchases.

So far the groups have been cautiously supportive of the WEF’s efforts. SBTI endorsed the sale of SAF certificates (pdf) to business travelers as a way to cut carbon emissions in August 2021. But the organization noted “the practicalities of corporate SAF procurement and accounting are currently poorly defined in the market” and stressed the need for more standard accounting practices before it could throw its full weight behind any SAF certificate scheme.

First airlines need to demonstrate that they used their certificate money to buy additional SAF on top of whatever quantity of SAF they were already legally required to buy. The EU for instance is considering a rule that would require airlines to buy jet fuel blended with at least 2% SAF by 2025. Airlines would have to buy that legally mandated amount of SAF first and then buy even more to fulfill their SAF certificate commitments.

Second airlines need to create clear consistent pricing for certificates across the industry. In early SAF transactions prices have ranged widely. Deloitte published a report detailing its experience buying SAF certificates from American Airlines Delta and United Airlines between February and April 2021. The consulting firm wrote that it paid an average of $130 per metric ton of carbon emissions avoided—but the prices ranged by more than $90 a ton between airlines and none of the airlines offered clear breakdowns explaining how they set their prices.

“We paid what we believe to be the price premium for sustainable aviation fuel over [conventional jet fuel] but it’s certainly not a transparent market yet” said Lisa Newman-Wise Deloitte’s climate chief of staff.

How can the airline industry reach zero emissions by 2050?

Ultimately SAF alone won’t get the airline industry to cut its carbon emissions to zero. Even if airlines replaced every drop of jet fuel they use with SAF they’d only reduce their emissions by 50% to 80%. To reach net zero airlines will have to replace their existing fleets of jet-fuel-burning planes with new models that can run on electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.

But those airplanes haven’t been invented yet. It will take decades for established planemakers like Boeing and Airbus or startups like ZeroAvia to develop a new generation of zero-emissions jets that can carry hundreds of passengers long distances. In the meantime airlines will keep buying conventional planes that burn jet fuel and those planes will stay in the sky for an operating life of up to 30 years.

SAF offers a way to bring down the airline industry’s emissions now as a bridge between the current generation of heavily carbon-emitting planes—which contribute more than 2% of all global greenhouse emissions—and that future generation of yet-to-be-invented zero-emission planes.

“This is what has to happen if we want to enjoy the benefits of an economy that is connected by aviation in the future and one that doesn’t create unacceptable climate impacts” said Chen."

“Any free people in the house here? Did Jesus set you free?” he asked revving up the dozens before him on a Saturday afternoon at a Gettysburg roadside hotel.

Mr. Mastriano a state senator retired Army colonel and prominent figure in former President Donald J. Trump’s futile efforts to overturn the state’s 2020 election results was addressing a far-right conference that mixed Christian beliefs with conspiracy theories called Patriots Arise. Instead of focusing on issues like taxes gas prices or abortion policy he wove a story about what he saw as the true Christian identity of the nation and how it was time together for Christians to reclaim political power.

The separation of church and state was a “myth” he said. “In November we are going to take our state back my God will make it so.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjMxODA2MzQvc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC1ydWxlLW9mLWxhdy1hYm9ydGlvbi12b3RpbmctcmlnaHRzLWd1bnMtZXBh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Supreme Court spent its past term rejecting the rule of law,"The highest Court in the most powerful nation in the world appears to have decided that it only needs to follow the law when it feels like it.

Last December for example the Supreme Court handed down a decision that fundamentally alters the Union — giving states sweeping authority to restrict their residents’ constitutional rights.

At least that’s what happened if you take the Court’s 5-4 decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson seriously. Jackson involved Texas’s anti-abortion law SB 8 which allowed “any person” who is not employed by the state to sue anyone they suspect of performing an abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy and to collect a bounty of at least $10000 from that abortion provider. The Court allowed that law to take effect even though abortion was still considered a constitutional right at the time.

If you apply the logic from Jackson more broadly any state could pass a law unleashing such litigious bounty hunters upon people who exercise any constitutional right. Perhaps a state wants to make it illegal to own a gun or maybe it wants to allow bounty hunters to sue any Black family that sends its child to a predominantly white school — and the federal judiciary will simply stand back and let it happen. Realistically the Court is unlikely to allow these sorts of attacks. But to spite abortion the conservative majority was willing to open the door to them.

Jackson moreover was only the beginning of a Rumspringa of conservative excess led by the Court’s Republican-appointed majority.

In its just-completed term the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade permitting states to ban abortions without having to resort to SB 8-style chicanery. It also overruled a seminal 1971 decision prohibiting the government from advancing one religious belief at the expense of others. It all but neutralized another half-century-old precedent permitting federal law enforcement officers who violate the Constitution to be sued. And the Court’s Republican majority dismantled two decisions protecting criminal defendants who were convicted or sentenced without adequate defense counsel most likely condemning an innocent man to die in the process.

The Court endangered huge swaths of long-existing gun laws striking down a New York state law that has been on the books for 109 years. And it did so in an opinion that simultaneously fetishizes the “Second Amendment’s plain text” while ignoring the first thirteen words of that amendment.

The same Court that attacked Roe as “remarkably loose in its treatment of the constitutional text” saw no problem with ignoring half of the text of the Second Amendment.

In what may be the most consequential environmental case in decades the Court relied on something called the “major questions doctrine” — a fairly new legal doctrine that is never mentioned in the Constitution or in any statute and that was invented entirely by judges — to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of much of its authority to fight climate change.

The Court even abandoned any pretense that it must be honest about the facts of the cases it decides claiming that a public school football coach who ostentatiously prayed on the 50-yard line after games — while surrounded by players spectators and members of the press — was merely engaged in a “short private personal prayer.”

It was a singularly alarming Supreme Court term. The Court didn’t simply abandon longstanding legal rules at times it seemed to abandon the rule of law altogether.

What is “the rule of law”?

I make a strong claim in this essay arguing that the Supreme Court of the United States is no longer deciding many major cases in a way that is recognizably “legal.” So let’s start by establishing a baseline definition of what constitutes the rule of law and what it means for a judge to act consistently with this principle.

Societies that adhere to the rule of law must apply the same binding rules to all persons and institutions including the state itself. According to the United Nations these rules must be “publicly promulgated equally enforced and independently adjudicated” and the rule of law demands “equality before the law” “legal certainty” and “avoidance of arbitrariness.”

The late Justice Antonin Scalia offered one of the best explanations of how a judge can act consistently with the rule of law in a 1989 essay. “When in writing for the majority of the Court I adopt a general rule” Scalia explained “I not only constrain lower courts I constrain myself as well.” Because “if the next case should have such different facts that my political or policy preferences regarding the outcome are quite the opposite I will be unable to indulge those preferences.”

Scalia’s formulation captures the rule of equality before the law. If a judge applies a certain rule to Republicans they must be comfortable applying it to Democrats as well. If they apply one rule to people who oppose abortion they must apply the same rule to people who support abortion.

Similarly Scalia’s formulation advances the values of legal certainty and non-arbitrariness. While there are extraordinary circumstances when the Supreme Court should overrule one of its previous precedents lawyers and lawmakers should typically be able to look at the Court’s past decisions and be able to predict how the law will apply moving forward. When possible the Supreme Court should hand down clear legal rules which enhance this predictability and that cannot easily be manipulated to hand down arbitrary decisions that favor some groups over others.

With these principles of equality clarity and non-arbitrariness in mind let’s take a look at some of the Court’s recent decisions.

Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson is one of the worst decisions in the Supreme Court’s history

There are a handful of Supreme Court decisions that legal scholars refer to as the “anti-canon” decisions that were so poorly reasoned and monstrous in their consequences that they are taught to law students as examples of how judges should never behave. The anti-canon includes cases like the pro-slavery decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) the segregationist decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) the anti-worker decision in Lochner v. New York (1905) and the Japanese-American internment decision in Korematsu v. United States (1944).

Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson belongs on this list. It is as Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent so thoroughly inconsistent with the idea that the Constitution binds every state government that it threatens to transform that document into a “solemn mockery.” Jackson introduces an intolerable amount of unpredictability and arbitrariness into US law transforming the constitutional rights that every American should reasonably be able to rely upon into dust that can be blown away by a sufficiently clever state legislature.

So long as Jackson remains good law no constitutional right is safe.

To understand why Jackson is so troubling and why it threatens literally all constitutional rights it’s helpful to understand why Texas wrote this law to rely on private bounty hunters.

As a general rule someone who believes that a state law violates their constitutional rights cannot sue that state directly in federal court. Under the Court’s decision in Ex parte Young (1908) however they may sue the state officer tasked with enforcing an allegedly unconstitutional law. Thus for example if a state passed a law requiring state police to blockade abortion clinics a plaintiff might sue the chief of the state police to block that law.

But SB 8 the anti-abortion law at issue in Jackson attempts to cut state officers out of the enforcement process altogether. SB 8 provides that it “shall be enforced exclusively through ... private civil actions” that can be filed by anyone who is not a state employee.

It should be noted that Texas lawmakers did not actually succeed in writing a law that no Texas state official plays a role in enforcing. The plaintiffs in Jackson sued a Texas state judge who would hear lawsuits brought under SB 8 as well as the clerk of a Texas court charged with moving these cases through the courts. If Young means anything these plaintiffs should have been allowed to move forward with their federal lawsuit.

But Gorsuch’s majority opinion in Jackson holds that these suits against Texas state judges and clerks may not proceed. That means there’s no way to obtain a federal court order halting SB 8.

In fairness an abortion provider could have conceivably waited until they were sued in Texas state court for violating SB 8 and then argued that SB 8 violates Roe v. Wade in state court. But even if Roe were still good law this defense is not adequate to protect abortion providers’ rights.

That’s because SB 8 doesn’t simply allow any person who is not employed by the state of Texas to sue an alleged abortion provider it also permits a victorious plaintiff to collect a bounty of at least $10000 from the provider. There is no upper limit to this bounty and an alleged abortion provider who successfully defends against an SB 8 lawsuit can still be sued by other individuals hoping to collect the bounty.

Anyone suspected of performing an abortion that violates SB 8 could be hit by hundreds or even thousands of lawsuits. And they would either have to hire an army of lawyers to defend against these lawsuits or risk being ordered to pay a bounty that has no upper limit. Either option risks bankruptcy.

If taken seriously moreover Jackson permits states to use an SB 8-like structure to attack any constitutional right. A state might allow private bounty hunters to sue any journalist who publishes a news article that paints a Republican elected official in a negative light or it might prohibit private citizens from criticizing the state’s governor. Shortly after Jackson was handed down Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to sign a law permitting private bounty hunters to sue anyone who “manufactures distributes or sells an assault weapon.”

It remains to be seen whether this Court would apply its Jackson decision to a state law attacking the Second Amendment or other constitutional freedoms. But if the Court winds up applying Jackson only to constitutional rights that a majority of its members do not like that’s an even worse outcome for the rule of law than if it applies Jackson’s anti-constitutional rule to every SB 8-style law that makes it through any state legislature.

The rule of law is the rule of equality; it means that the same rules must apply to liberal litigants as apply to conservatives.

The Supreme Court placed itself at the head of much of the executive branch of government

In its late June decision in West Virginia v. EPA the Court effectively placed itself at the head of multiple executive branch agencies — above President Joe Biden — giving itself veto power over any regulation handed down by these agencies. In doing so it fundamentally reshaped the US’s separation of powers.

Many federal laws lay out a broad overarching policy then give an executive branch agency authority to implement that policy through binding regulations. West Virginia concerned a provision of the Clean Air Act which requires certain power plants to use the “best system of emission reduction” that can be achieved with currently available technology and then tasks the EPA with determining what the “best system” to reduce emissions may be at any given moment.

This way as technology evolves to allow cleaner energy production the EPA can issue new regulations requiring the energy industry to adopt these cleaner technologies without Congress having to pass a whole new law.

West Virginia imposed an arbitrary new limit on EPA’s congressionally given authority which appears nowhere in the Clean Air Act or in any other federal law. Under West Virginia the EPA may not use its authority to encourage “generation shifting” — that is requiring the energy industry to shift from particularly dirty methods of energy production such as coal and toward cleaner methods such as solar or natural gas. Instead the EPA may only use its authority to require existing coal plants to install new devices or otherwise alter how they burn coal to produce energy.

To justify its policy judgment that generation shifting is not allowed the Court’s six Republican appointees relied on something called the “major questions doctrine.” Under this doctrine the Court explained in a 2014 opinion “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’” Thus if a majority of the Court deems a regulation to be too significant it will strike it down unless Congress very explicitly authorized that particular regulation.

But the Court has never fully articulated what causes a regulation to be so significant that it runs afoul of this doctrine and in any event the doctrine comes from nowhere.

The Constitution does not mention this doctrine. Nor does any federal law. The Court has in effect given itself the power to veto any regulation issued by the executive branch of government even when Congress broadly authorized an executive branch agency to regulate.

Until very recently the justices avoided such encroachments upon the executive’s domain. As the Court explained in Mistretta v. United States (1989) “in our increasingly complex society replete with ever changing and more technical problems Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.” Until a few years ago the Court’s decisions urged judges to defer to federal agencies on nearly all policy-related questions.

The reasons for this deference were twofold. As the Court explained in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984) agencies typically have much greater expertise in the areas that they regulate than the judiciary. And federal agencies also have far more democratic legitimacy than unelected judges who serve for life. “While agencies are not directly accountable to the people” the Court said in Chevron agencies answer to a president who is accountable to the voters. And so “it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices.”

But now the Court has given itself the power to declare any regulation that it does not like to be a sin against the “major questions doctrine” and in so doing to veto that regulation. That doesn’t just introduce far too much arbitrariness into federal law. It’s also an extraordinary transfer of power away from an elected branch of government and toward a judiciary staffed by unaccountable judges.

The Court does not behave as though it is bound by legal texts

The Second Amendment is unusual in that it states explicitly what purpose it is supposed to advance. It provides that “a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.” As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Miller (1939) the “obvious purpose” of the Second Amendment was to “render possible the effectiveness” of militias and the amendment must be “interpreted and applied with that end in view.”

Nevertheless the Supreme Court held last month in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that “individual self-defense is ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right” and that gun regulations must be judged according to whether they undercut this atextual purpose.

I don’t think much more needs to be said about Bruen (although if you want to read a longer critique of Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion in this case I wrote that piece here). The Second Amendment’s text is crystal clear about why that amendment exists. But six Republican appointees on the Supreme Court believe the Second Amendment should have a different purpose. So they decided that the text of the Constitution does not matter. That is the very hallmark of an arbitrary decision.

And it’s not the first time this Court has disregarded legal text to reach a certain end.

About a year ago in Brnovich v. DNC (2021) the Supreme Court invented a bunch of new limits on the Voting Rights Act — the landmark law prohibiting race discrimination in elections — that appear nowhere in the law’s text. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in dissent Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in Brnovich “mostly inhabits a law-free zone.” No lawyer could have read the text of the Voting Rights Act and predicted the specific limits the Court placed on voting rights in Brnovich.

Similar things could be said about most of the Court’s recent voting rights decisions. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013) for example the Court neutralized a provision of the Voting Rights Act that requires states with a history of racist election practices to “preclear” any new voting rules with federal officials before those practices can take effect. Shelby County rested on a so-called “‘fundamental principle of equal sovereignty’ among the States” that appears nowhere in the Constitution

Indeed the Constitution’s text indicates that Congress has broad power to decide how to protect voting rights. Its 15th Amendment provides that states may not deny or abridge the right to vote “on account of race color or previous condition of servitude” and it gives Congress the power “to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”

This year the Court took similar liberties with voting rights law handing down at least three “shadow docket” decisions that abridged the right of Black Americans to cast a vote that actually matters. In Merrill v. Milligan and Ardoin v. Robinson the Court reinstated racially gerrymandered maps in Alabama and Louisiana that effectively cut Black voters’ electoral power in those states in half. And in Wisconsin Legislature v. Wisconsin Elections Commission the Court struck down state legislative maps due to concerns that they may give too much electoral power to Black voters.

The Court provided little or no explanation for why it reached these decisions but the common theme is that a majority of the justices voted to reduce Black electoral power in all three cases. And the Court plans to hear the Merrill case again in October — most likely so that it can permanently weaken the Voting Rights Act’s safeguards against racial gerrymandering.

The Court claims the power to decide what happened in the past

One other theme from this recent term is worth mentioning. In three major constitutional cases involving three very different provisions of the Constitution the Court ruled that judges must look to historical practice when interpreting the nation’s founding document.

In the Bruen guns case the Court held that “the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation” if it wishes to defend a gun law against a Second Amendment challenge. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization the case overruling Roe the Court declared that rights that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution may only be protected by courts if they are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” And in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District the praying coach case the Court decreed that the provision of the First Amendment requiring separation of church and state “must be interpreted by ‘reference to historical practices and understandings.’”

One glaring problem with this approach to constitutional law is that history is contested and even expert historians frequently disagree about the right way to interpret historical events. So this new historicism inevitably invites arbitrary and unpredictable decision-making by judges.

In the Bruen case for example both Thomas’s majority opinion and Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent waste a simply mind-numbing amount of ink recounting centuries of gun laws stretching at least as far back as a 1328 law providing that Englishmen may not “ride armed by night nor by day in Fairs Markets.” In the end the six Republican appointees conclude that this multi-century tour of English and American gun laws supports the policy outcome preferred by the Republican Party; and the three Democratic appointees look at the exact same history and conclude that it supports the policy outcome preferred by the Democratic Party.

Similarly while Alito’s Dobbs opinion concludes that a right to abortion was “entirely unknown in American law” before the latter part of the 20th century the Roe opinion reached the opposite conclusion concluding that the historical practice was to allow abortions prior to “quickening” — “the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy.” At least some actual historians have argued that Alito is wrong and Roe was correct about this point.

In any event I like Samuel Alito am a lawyer and not a historian. I like Clarence Thomas do not have a doctorate in history or any formal training in how professional historians resolve historical debates. I do not claim any ability to resolve what people in 1789 might have thought about laws banning assault rifles that didn’t yet exist or whether the generation that ratified the 14th Amendment would have believed that mifepristone should be legal.

I will note however that the entire judiciary is staffed by lawyers and not historians and that judges typically decide cases based on briefs authored by lawyers who are not historians. So the Court’s penchant for turning constitutional cases into debates over history is likely to produce a lot of bad history and a lot of bad law. It’s a bit like demanding that the nation’s public health policy be determined by a panel made up entirely of physicists.

And that’s assuming that these amateur historians now tasked with determining whether the 17th-century jurist Sir Matthew Hale would have supported a ban on machine guns are acting in good faith. Which brings us back to the Court’s factually challenged decision in Kennedy.

Recall that in Kennedy six of the justices couldn’t tell the difference between a “short private personal prayer” and a public spectacle even after they were confronted with photographic proof that Coach Kennedy decided to make a public spectacle of himself. If these judges are so loose with the facts of a well-documented event that occurred in 2015 imagine the liberties they may take with truly contested events that occurred nearly 250 years ago.

This Court has no sense of humility

Not so long ago the Court had a very good solution to the problem that the meaning of legal texts — not to mention historical events — is often contested even by subject-matter experts operating in good faith.

Cases like Mistretta and Chevron counseled judicial deference to federal agencies because it is better for agencies accountable to a democratic president to resolve contested policy questions than to leave these questions to the one unelected branch of government. Other cases such as United States v. Carolene Products (1938) warned that courts should typically defer to Congress when it was unclear whether the Constitution permits a particular law to stand. The advantage of this approach is that the people can always vote out a Congress that passed a bad law but if the Court hands down a bad decision there is often no solution other than a constitutional amendment.

The current Court hasn’t simply abandoned these doctrines of deference it appears to be replacing them with new doctrines that don’t so much constrain judicial power as require judges to rely on historical sources when striking down laws that those judges don’t like. In cases involving federal agencies that can mean the new doctrines require judges to use the magic words “major question” whenever they want to veto a regulation.

American companies are moving manufacturing back to the US from Asia.

General Motors GE Intel and US Steel are among companies opening new factories in America.

Companies started reviewing their supply chains following the US-China trade war and pandemic.

American manufacturers are increasingly bringing production back to the US to reduce their reliance on global supply chains that proved vulnerable to disruption such as the pandemic.

An overwhelming majority of American companies with production operations in China have already moved some back to the US or plan to do so in the next three years according to Kearney's 2021 Reshoring Index.

Almost four in five corporations companies have already shifted production to the US and at least 15% are considering it due to high tariffs and ongoing supply chain challenges Kearney's report shows.

However imports from low-cost Asian countries to the US still increased last year.

""Reshoring"" manufacturing has also been spurred by geopolitical disruption triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.

General Motors announced in January it would spend $7 billion on four plants in Michigan. Last year it spent almost $40 billion buying parts from some 5600 US suppliers.

The manufacturer behind Chevrolet GMC Cadillac and Hummer announced its biggest investment to increase its battery cell production to achieve its aim of becoming North America's biggest electric vehicle producer.

GE Appliances is also investing on expanding US production to make products closer to customers and create more American jobs.

The company which produces appliances like refrigerators dishwashers and hot water heaters has invested more than $2 billion in its US plants and distribution centers since 2016.

It opened a water heater plant in May in Camden South Carolina and has increased its spend on US suppliers by two thirds in the past five years.

Intel is investing $12 billion on two chip factories near Phoenix that are due to open in 2024. The company said last year that the US has ""lost ground"" in manufacturing semiconductors.

The new US plants will help meet domestic demand for the billions of chips now used in a array of products from computers to cars.







US Steel is investing in a $3 billion steelmaking factory in Osceola Arkansas. Similarly Nucor is spending about $2.7 billion on a steel plate mill in Brandberg Kentucky with construction set to start later this year.

Generac Power Systems moved some production from China to the US after the pandemic. Last year it unveiled plans to open a new plant in Trenton South Carolina.

Lockheed Martin is putting $16.5 million into a new Missile System Integration Lab facility in Huntsville Alabama. The defense contractor already has 25 facilities in Alabama and expects to create a further 200 jobs there.

US companies started reconsidering having their supply chains abroad after a trade war with China resulted in high tariffs on Chinese imports.

The Trump administration pushed for ""America First"" trade and called to bring jobs back to the US as the trade war began in 2018.

Manufacturers told US trade officials in June 2019 that increasing tariffs on Chinese imports would increase costs for consumers and put jobs at risk. Two months later Trump told businesses that they should ""immediately"" look for alternative manufacturers to China ""including bringing your companies home"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5jaW5uYXRpLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvb3Bpbmlvbi1lbGVjdHJpYy1zY2hvb2wtYnVzZXMtd2F5LWRpc3RyaWN0cy1jbGVhbi11cC1kaWVzZWwtcG93ZXJlZC1mbGVldHMvNzgxNjQ3MTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Electric school buses a way for districts to clean up diesel-powered fleets,"Sarah Mostafa

Opinion contributor

As the mom of a toddler I am frequently thinking about his health and safety. There’s a lot to think about between the tragic news headlines that confront us too regularly.

One issue that's top of mind for me locally: our not-so-great air quality in Cincinnati.

While the concerning rates of lead poisoning and asthma from our poor indoor air quality is getting more attention many people still don’t know that Cincinnati continually ranks in the top 20 most polluted areas in the American Lung Association State of the Air Report due to harmful emissions from power plants cars and trucks.

That is one reason why I was glad to learn about the launching of the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program.

Wait. School buses?

Yes school buses. Every day over 20 million U.S. children ride to school on nearly 500000 school buses most which run on diesel. In Ohio alone more than 800000 children ride a diesel bus back and forth every school day. Diesel exhaust is a known human carcinogen. The tiny particles of pollution in diesel exhaust can lodge deep in the lungs and cause irritation worsening respiratory illnesses like asthma. This is bad for both students and drivers.

Put simply: Diesel pollution has no business being in the places where our kids live learn and play.

Now we have a solution right in front of us: electric school buses. The Clean School Bus Program funded with $5 billion from the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will allow hundreds of school districts to begin the transition from dirty diesel-powered buses to zero-emission electric ones. This is a huge step toward cleaning up the nation’s iconic yellow school bus fleet.

School districts and eligible contractors in Ohio and across the nation can apply now to the Clean School Bus Program to receive a rebate covering the cost of as many as 25 new electric school buses or the price differential between such buses and diesel buses. The rebate can also be used to install electric bus charging infrastructure.

Applications are open until Aug. 19 and the EPA is expected to announce recipients in October.

This funding is available thanks to the federal bipartisan legislation signed into law last November and it would not have passed without the leadership of U.S. Senators like our own Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown. They understand that when funding for electric school buses is allocated to the school districts that need it the most we see a significant transition away from the dirty diesel pollution that can put children’s health at risk.

Ohio has surrendered its place as a leader in clean energy development and climate action over the past few years. Opportunities to advance renewable energy and efficiency investments have been squandered keeping us reliant on polluting fossil fuels. But electrifying our transportation sector is an opportunity that we can’t ignore. While we do manufacture electric school buses and house distribution operations in the state there is not a single electric school bus on the road in Ohio today.

If we can make them here we should be able to drive them here and reap the rewards that come with cleaner vehicles. Our kids’ health is far too important for us to be left behind yet again.

For the past year I have been a volunteer with Moms Clean Air Force in Ohio. We have a membership base of more than 87000 Ohio parents and grandparents who care about children’s health. We have strongly supported congressional action to establish and fund the Clean School Bus Program to move our bus fleet toward electrification. As a result we can now be in the driver’s seat when it comes to protecting our children’s health from diesel pollution. I encourage readers to visit www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus to learn more.

Ohio let’s get rolling toward the clean energy future that awaits us.

For shear magnitude though nothing beats the 250K Business Platinum offer. The spend is significant at $30K but this particular offer allows six months to meet the spend instead of the normal three. The offer first surfaced last month when we reported it was being sent tp some people via mailer. Later we discovered that it was possible to find out if you were targeted by speaking with an agent over the phone even if you hadn’t received a mailer. The phone offer was slightly better than the mailer version in that it included the option to get another 10000 points by adding an authorized user card (for a total of 260000 Membership Rewards points).

Now US Credit Card Guide has posted a link directly to an application page for the 250K + 10K welcome offer. The link bypasses the initial landing page that you normally encounter when you click through an Amex credit card offer so it theoretically allows someone who isn’t targeted to apply for the welcome offer without needing to call or use various private browsers.

But be cautious. These sorts of links can be dangerous and there have been reports of them leading to an Amex shutdown. We initially debated about whether or not to even share the link but now that it’s making its way around the interwebs we decided to share it as an FYI to readers (and also to let folks know to be aware of the risk if they see the link elsewhere).

The Deal

American Express Business Platinum targeted welcome offer: Earn 250000 Membership Rewards points after spending $30000 within the first 6 months of card membership. There is an option to earn an additional 10000 points by adding an authorized user and spending $1000 on the authorized user card (the authorized user spending does apply towards the total minimum spend of $30K)

Quick Thoughts

While this is a killer offer I probably wouldn’t take the risk of using the link to apply. There’s so many safe (or at least relatively safe) methods to get a pile of of Membership Rewards points right now that for me the bank isn’t worth the risk on this one. That said I know there’s a lot of folks out there who like to push the envelope and will feel differently. I would at least advise trying the phone method first in case you can get targeted that way. It will come with much less shutdown danger.

When the bill came and Freeman paid with his credit card there was a notice on his credit card receipt that there would be a 2.5% charge for any purchases made entirely with a credit card.

“It was a little late in the game for me to run to the ATM and get some money” said Freeman who said he doesn't carry more than $20. “We’ve been trained for years to use a credit card because it’s so convenient.”

As a business owner Freeman understands rising costs of doing business. But he doesn’t think passing along credit card surcharges is the way to go.

“Credit card fees have always been a cost of doing business. It’s something we’ve absorbed and included in our pricing like electricity” said Freeman. “Because I own a tanning salon we don’t have a surcharge for electricity when our price goes up.”

Freeman said he understands that businesses costs are going up. But as a consumer he’d rather the business raise the price of goods and let consumers decide if they want to pay for the goods instead of what he calls sneaking in surcharges for the use of credit cards.

“These businesses clearly have no compassion for what people are going through with inflation attacking their disposable income at every turn. Apparently they also have no understanding of how fragile their relationship is with their customers” Freeman said.

He said he will stop going to businesses that charge surcharges.

Consumers don't want to be 'nickel and dimed'

There is nothing in Ohio’s laws that prevents businesses from adding a surcharge for credit card fees or requiring a minimum purchase in order to charge a purchase according to a spokeswoman for the Ohio Attorney General’s office.

The practice is allowed in most states said Ted Rossman a senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com. The exceptions are Connecticut Massachusetts and Maine he said.

Consumers “don’t want to be nickeled and dimed for everything” said Rossman. “You don’t want to have a certain line for credit card processing and a line item for heating or air conditioning and the rent and the employee’s health insurance and using the bathroom. It gets kinda of silly at some point.”

Rossman said a Morning Consult survey commissioned by American Express study in 2021 showed 78% of consumers agree that a surcharge makes them feel like a business does not appreciate their purchase.

A similarly strong majority (77%) agreed if they have the option they’ll take their business elsewhere rather than pay a surcharge Rossman wrote in an article he shared on the subject.

Surcharges have “proven to be an unpopular concept but it’s one that seems to be catching on more broadly. I think it’s short-sighted on the part of the businesses that implement it and I think it could turn off their employees” Rossman said.

Some retailers but not many have also turned to offering discounts for paying cash to try to discourage credit card use said Rossman.

In Ohio many gas stations have moved to offering some type of ""discount"" or lower price if the customer registers for a program to pay via a direct payment from a checking account — which doesn't come with a fee to the customer or retailer — instead of credit card payments.

Rossman said he feels like gas stations that post different prices for credit card and non-credit card purchases aren't viewed as critically by consumers.

""What I think people really don't like are surprise fees"" Rossman said.

""The point is I think people don't like these 'gotcha' fees on a bill"" he said. ""When you discover that your receipt has this extra line item that you weren't anticipating it just rubs people the wrong way. That leads a lot to an outcry on social media and I've heard of companies that have had to backdown and sometimes the business owner was well-intentioned.

""Sometimes I hear the business owner thought 'the surcharge was better from a PR (public relations) standpoint because it signifies that it's temporary or it signifies that I'm not profiting or gouging..but in reality though I just don't think it sits well.""

Often called ""The Crossroads of the World"" it's a vibrant bustling part of the city that's a must-see for first-timers and a must-avoid for grizzled New Yorkers.

Visitors pay a premium to stay here often in oversized hotels like the mammoth Marriott Marquis — one of the most popular redemptions in the Bonvoy program.

Yet just a few steps away from the madness is another Marriott option The Chatwal a boutique luxury property with only 76 rooms and suites.

It seemed like the perfect midweek staycation for me and my wife — a quick kid-free getaway just 1.5 miles physically from our home but miles away mentally.

Booking

This hotel does not come cheap. But that doesn't mean there aren't ways to maximize your spending there.

I chose to book via the American Express Fine Hotels + Resorts program.

The base rate was $735 for a deluxe king room measuring about 270 square feet. Booking the same room directly via Marriott as a Bonvoy member would have been $720.

However by booking via American Express I was offered a shot at a noon check in guaranteed 4 p.m. check-out daily breakfast for two people and a possible room upgrade. It also came with a $125 property credit which I knew I would use for dinner at the hotel's popular restaurant The Lamb's Club. Finally there is an up to $200 annual credit for holders of The Platinum Card® from American Express for prepaid bookings via Fine Hotels + Resorts.

That same room is going for 79000 to 91000 Bonvoy points a night. Based on TPG's current valuations those points are worth about $663.60-$764.40 which can be a good deal when you factor in taxes. My one-night stay as an example ended up costing $846.92 including New York City's high lodging taxes.

The free breakfast and $125 credit toward my dinner still made the Amex booking a better bargain especially since as a Titanium elite member I earned 6095 Bonvoy points worth $51 based on TPG valuations. That said if I wasn't eating at the hotel (and testing out all the benefits for you) and had not already used my $200 credit (which I had) I probably would have used points for the stay.

Location

The primary reason to pick The Chatwal is its central location. It is steps from Times Square and minutes from other popular spots like Rockefeller Center and Bryant Park. This area is great for first-time visitors to New York those with Broadway theater tickets or folks with business in midtown.

At the same time the hotel's location on 44th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues is just shielded enough from the nearby bustle to make it a good spot to sleep relax and catch your breath after a day out in New York.

The hotel sits in a 1905 building designed by Stanford White part of the legendary architecture trio McKim Mead & White. It initially opened as Lambs a professional theater club near the heart of Broadway. In 2010 the building was renovated and opened as The Chatwal named after Sant Singh Chatwal the founder of Dream Hotel Group.

(The hotel company also just opened up a new luxury retreat in the Catskill Mountains called The Chatwal Lodge that I recently reviewed.)

The hotel's history is evident in its lobby and other public spaces. I've been a longtime fan of its tiny but attractive Art Deco lobby with an atrium opening to its second-floor bar. A giant clock — one of the hotel's signature items — hangs beyond the front desk. You don't spend hours in this lobby but just walking through does take you back in time.

Check-in

I began my check in the day prior to my stay on the Marriott app but knew I would still have to stop by the front desk to get my key.

On the day of arrival I messaged the hotel via the app to see about a possible upgrade as a Titanium elite member. And then I waited — and waited some more. I wouldn't hear back until more than four hours later well after I had already settled into my room. Oh well.

When I arrived at the hotel around 3 p.m. two doormen were waiting to assist with luggage — a treat to see in this age of limited staffing. A quick walk up six stairs and I was at the front desk.

There was no wait at the front desk. The representative was helpful gave me a letter outlining all the benefits I would receive from booking through Amex Fine Hotels + Resorts explained my one-category room upgrade and offered me a bottle of water.

Moments later I was in the elevator and on my way to my third-floor room. (My wife would arrive later.)

The room

My upgraded room was a ""Grand Deluxe"" king facing 44th Street measuring about 350 square feet. The only real upgrade from the entry-level king room I'd originally booked was a small loveseat and the street view.

The closet was impressive and could have comfortably housed a wardrobe much more extensive than my overnight one. There was a tray to leave out shoes for the hotel's butler to come and shine for free. Plush robes and slippers were waiting in the closet. I couldn't have been happier.

Then I looked at the rest of the room and it was — well just fine. It was clean and comfortable but not exactly luxurious or posh enough to justify a $700-plus nightly rate. The desk and loveseat had seen better days; there were scuffs and nicks all over. The room felt very cramped even by New York City standards. It was technically large but none of the furniture was really inviting making it just feel smaller. A thick layer of grime on the windows darkened my view of the street below.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Scott Mayerowitz/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

There were lots of scratches marks and the text on various switches had been rubbed away. One side of the bed had easily accessible outlets on the nightstand and the other didn't. In other words: It's time for a light renovation.

Then I walked into the bathroom.

No room let alone a bathroom should have as many mirrored spaces as this one. Plus the tiles had sparkling specks in them adding even more reflective surfaces to the room. While the hotel is only 12 years old the bathrooms felt like a flashback to the 1970s and the age of Studio 54. (At least there wasn't a disco ball?)

The Asprey bath products were nice but I found it odd to see plastic cups in the bathroom — especially when paying these rates. Would it be too much to ask for nicer glass ones? Perhaps this was a pandemic-era cut that hasn't been reversed.

Back in the bedroom there was a small TV mounted on the wall. The bed was comfortable but not exactly memorable.

Despite being in the heart of Manhattan the double-paned windows did an excellent job of keeping out the city noise and we slept through the night soundly.

Food and beverage

Here is where The Chatwal shines. Long before I spent the night I would come to this hotel for a pre-theater drink or a business breakfast or lunch.

There are very few spots near Times Square where you can saunter in sit down and have an excellent cocktail. To me The Chatwal has always been that oasis — dating back to the days when I would earn Starwood Preferred Guest points for my food and beverage tabs there.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Scott Mayerowitz/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

But the real star has always been The Lambs Club a cozy restaurant off the lobby named after Lambs the theater club that used to occupy the building. Pre-pandemic this was one of New York City's power lunch spots a place to settle in to an inviting table surrounded by deep red leather banquettes and photos of old-time stars of stage and screen.

The restaurant recently reopened under the leadership of chef Michael White the man behind Michelin-starred New York restaurants Marea and Ai Fiori — two of my favorites. As soon as I booked my stay I made a reservation for dinner too.

My wife and I started our meal with the fluke crudo and a phenomenal dish of raw scallops which were fresh and had a rich luscious texture. We moved on to the lamb chop special and — what shockingly turned out to be my favorite dish — orecchiette with lobster scallops and clams in a spicy tomato sauce. We ended with the sundae described on the menu as chocolate cake maraschino cherry chantilly bruleed bananas chocolate pearls and Maldon salt. That sounded like a lot of flavors all at once but it was actually the perfect end to our meal — a lovely balance of sweet salty and tangy flavors.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 5 (Photo by Scott Mayerowitz/The Points Guy) 0 1 2 3 4

These dishes aren't cheap. The orecchiette for instance cost $46. Our meal with just one glass of wine each came to $265 before tip. But The Lambs Club does offer a three-course pre-theater dinner for $70 which actually seems like a steal.

The food was very good but fell short of my dining experiences at Marea. Everything was delicious but the sense of ""wow"" was missing from some of the dishes. The crudo dishes were great but the entrees just lacked that same burst of creativity and uniqueness. Maybe it was the dark windowless setting. Maybe it was being in Times Square. Maybe I was just tired and picky that night — but I wasn't as impressed.

Breakfast the next morning back at Lambs Club on the other hand actually exceeded my expectations. My eggs were fluffy and flavorful the orange juice was freshly squeezed and the potatoes were just the right level of crispiness. My coffee cup never went empty and the staff warmed up milk for my wife's coffee so it didn't cool the drink down too much — a nice little touch. (For those not having breakfast at The Lambs Club there is free coffee in the lobby near the elevators.)

Fine Hotels + Resorts covered $80 worth of breakfast – which was just about everything except for the tip.

Amenities

This is a small city hotel and I didn't expect a plethora of amenities but the ones that were available were disappointing.

In the basement there is a small gym with three treadmills one all-purpose weight machine and some free weights with a bench. Nothing else.

There is an indoor pool next to the gym and a spa but both were still closed in June due to the pandemic.

The hotel also used to offer a chauffeured Mercedes-Benz E350 to bring guests anywhere within 20 blocks for free. That too was unavailable during our stay but the staff told us they hoped to bring it back by Labor Day.

Service

Every in-person contact we had with the staff was great — from the team at the front desk to the bartender in the lobby who walked me through the cocktail menu. (He told me I couldn't go wrong with the Gold Rush a bourbon honey and lemon drink that was created for the hotel's 2010 opening.)

While there might be a global staffing shortage The Chatwal didn't seem to have any issues. There was always someone at the front desk a concierge two doorman greeting guests and plenty of bartenders all for a hotel with just 76 rooms. Maybe the spa pool and house car are still casualties of the pandemic but everything that was available operated perfectly which is a very hard feat these days.

That said we didn't really interact that much with the staff. Doors were opened hellos delivered and any questions we had were quickly answered but I can't say I walked away feeling a connection to the hotel on a personal level. This is an urban property where you sleep unwind a bit and maybe have a drink or a meal. The staff was helpful but not overly warm.

The only issue we had was at departure. We had a guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout and I needed to use that time to do some work.

Several times the staff questioned if we were going to really need it with housekeeping even knocking on the door to check up on me. And when I left the room around noon to help my wife into a cab the front desk staff quickly stopped me to warn me that I had left my laptop in the room. Yes I had — because I was going back. Housekeeping had been quick to enter — despite the do not disturb sign — and had seen that I was still set up at the desk. I'm glad they stopped me but at the same time they didn't seem to really believe that one of us would be sticking around longer. It left me feeling much less welcome than I had been the day before.

I understand hotels have to turn rooms over but a guaranteed late checkout should be honored without this level of fuss.

Checking out

The Chatwal is a good option for those loyal to Marriott who want to stay near Times Square but be a little apart from the madness of the area.

The service was (mostly) great but the hotel is starting to show its age and could use a light refresh. While the public spaces have always felt special to me the room itself was very underwhelming.

I really wanted to fall in love with The Chatwal but instead was just left wanting just a little bit more luxury.

I'll be back for a business breakfast or lunch and probably a drink at the bar one night before a Broadway show. I just won't be spending the night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdXNhZ3ltLm9yZy9kaXNpZG9yZS1taWx0b24tdG9wLXNlbmlvci1qdW5pb3Itc3RhbmRpbmdzLWF0LTIwMjItYW1lcmljYW4tY2xhc3NpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disidore Milton top senior junior standings at 2022 American Classic • USA Gymnastics,"Amelia Disidore (Overland Park Kan./Great American Gymnastics Express) claimed the top spot in the senior all-around at Friday’s American Classic while Annalisa Milton (Lee’s Summit Mo./Great American Gymnastics Express) captured the junior title.

RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil (July 8 2022) – The U.S. rhythmic team of Erica Foster (Chanhassen Minn./NorthWest Rhythmic) Evita Griskenas (Orland Park Ill./North Shore Rhythmic Gymnastics Center) and Alexandria Kautzman (Simi Valley Calif./California Rhythms) captured Pan American Championships gold Friday night in Rio de Janeiro Brazil behind a standout all-around performance from Griskenas that saw her summit the podium twice in one evening. With the victory the U.S. has qualified a full-sized team for the individual competition at this year’s World Championships in Sofia Bulgaria in September. The U.S. Senior National Group also picked up hardware Friday at Parque Olimpico-Arena Carioca 01 claiming bronze in the group all-around.

Griskenas’ 115.800 outpaced runner up Geovanna Santos da Silva from Brazil (113.750) by more than two points. Kautzman posted the third-highest all-around score of 113.600 but finished fourth after Canada’s Carmel Kallemaa who also finished with a 113.600 came out ahead in the tie break. Foster was ninth with a 108.450.

The U.S. team finished with a cumulative 285.850 to claim gold. Brazil was second with a 280.400 followed by Canada (279.950) in third.

Despite qualifying in the top spot for the hoop (31.550) and ribbon (28.450) finals and advancing to the clubs (28.300) final in sixth Griskenas a 2020 Olympian will forego Saturday’s apparatus finals and head straight to The World Games which are ongoing in Birmingham Ala. Her departure aside the U.S. will be well represented in the event finals. Kautzman’s 29.850 on hoop 28.250 on ball 28.250 on clubs and 27.350 on ribbon have qualified her for the full finals slate and Foster will also compete tomorrow on ball (29.500) and ribbon (26.950).

The U.S. Senior National Group is also moving on to both group event finals after securing the bronze medal in the all-around. They finished with a combined 47.850 a mark surpassed only by groups from Brazil (62.200) and Mexico (60.550). The U.S. group advanced in third on three ribbons and two balls with a 23.500 and fourth on five hoops with a 24.350. The group which trains at North Shore Rhythmic Gymnastics Center is comprised of Maria Bolkhovitinova (Northfield Ill.) Gergana Petkova (Barrington Ill.) Katrine Sakhnov (Sammamish Wash.) Karolina Saverino (Elk Grove Village Ill.) Hana Starkman (Plantation Fla.) and Emily Wilson (Brooklyn N.Y.).

The junior competition got under way Friday with hoop and ball for individuals and five ropes for groups. Rin Keys (Porter Ranch Calif./Burlo Gymnastics) is comfortably in the top spot at the midway point of the all-around. Her 58.150 after two apparatus has positioned her more than five points ahead of Brazil’s Isadora Oliveira who is second with a 53.100. Reigning U.S. junior all-around champion Jaelyn Chin (Aventura Fla./Bessonova’s School) is fifth with a 49.950.

Keys’ 28.750 on hoop and 29.400 on ball have qualified her in the top spot for both apparatus finals. She’ll be joined in the hoop final by Megan Chu (San Diego Calif./Ingenious RG) and in the ball final by Chin who qualified second with a 28.800. Ksenia Pototski (Brooklyn N.Y./Isadora by Matchpoint) posted the day’s third-highest score on ball (27.700) but will not compete in the event final due to the two-gymnast-per-country limit.

The U.S. junior group consisting of Goda Balsys (Northbrook Ill.) Annabella Hantov (Chicago Ill.) Kristina Lee (Woodridge Ill.) Isabelle Novoseletsky (Highland Park Ill.) and Kalina Trayanov (Deerfield Ill.) all of North Shore Rhythmic Gymnastics Center is third after Friday’s five ropes performance. Their 20.400 has advanced them to the apparatus final.

The junior all-around will conclude Saturday with individuals showing clubs and ribbon beginning at 8 a.m. ET. Junior groups will follow on five balls at 12:20 p.m. ET while senior individual and group event finals will wrap up a full day of competition beginning at 3:30 p.m. ET.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tL2tlbGx5LXBhc2gtc3dpbXMtNTctNy1zaGFpbmUtY2FzYXMtc3dpbXMtNTAtNS1pbi1hdXN0aW4tMTAwLWZseXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kelly Pash Swims 57.7 Shaine Casas Swims 50.5 in Austin 100 Flys,"2022 AUSTIN SOUTHERN SECTIONALS

Carson Foster stole the show early on Saturday in Austin but it was again the pair of Kelly Pash and Shaine Casas who served as brilliant understudies later in the session in the 100 butterfly.

Foster opened the men’s racing with a 1:55.89 in the 200 backstroke which would have placed him 4th at the World Championships earlier this summer (read more about his swim here).

It also would have placed 3rd at the US International Team Trials behind Ryan Murphy and Shaine Casas.

Casas a former Texas A&M Aggie who is now training at Texas as a pro didn’t swim that 200 backstroke however. Like much of the Texas men’s crew he is racing secondary events this week and that includes the 100 fly.

Casas won the A-Final in Austin on Saturday in 50.56 (splits: 23.42/27.14). That is his fastest time by more than half-a-second clearing the 51.09 that he swam earlier this year at the Pro Swim Series meet in San Antonio.

Casas swam the 100 fly prelims at the US International Team Trials in April qualifying 6th in 51.75 before dumping the final. While he has now emerged primarily as a backstroke on the international scene as a freshman Casas actually dropped the backstroke races for the butterfly races at the NCAA Championships.

That swim jumps Casas from the 10th-best American in history to the 4th-best American in history in the event behind only a list of Olympic multi-gold medalists. Each of the three men ahead of him also set the World Record at least once in their careers.

All-Time Top 5 Men’s 100 LCM Butterfly:

Caeleb Dressel 49.45 – Tokyo 2020 Michael Phelps 49.82 – 2009 Worlds Ian Crocker 50.40 – 2005 Worlds Shaine Casas 50.56 – 2022 Austin Sectionals Maxime Rooney 50.68 – 2019 US Nationals

Casas’ emergence here gives the Americans another weapon in an already-versatile men’s medley relay lineup. The group of contenders includes Michael Andrew who could swim the fly or breast legs Casas who could swim the fly or backstroke legs and Caeleb Dressel who could swim the fly or free legs. That kind of versatility gives American coaches lots of options to play the ‘hot hand’ at future international competitions.

Casas previously won the 100 free (48.23) and 100 back (52.51) this week and is scheduled to swim the 200 IM on Sunday to complete his meet.

Not to be overshadowed is University of Texas woman Kelly Pash in the 100 fly. She won in a time of 57.73 which is half-a-second better than she swam at the Tokyo 2020 US Olympic Trials last summer as a new personal best.

Pash didn’t race at the US International Team Trials in April but if she had that time would have placed her 4th.

The swim also makes her the 19th-best American in the history of the event and ranks her 13th in the world this season.

Previously this week Pash was 2nd in the 200 fly in 2:09.35 which is not a best time and won the 200 free in 1:59.47 which is a best time by a tenth. That makes her breakthrough in this 100 fly even more remarkable.

In that race Pash a rising senior finished ahead of a pair of sub-minute Texas teammates. Emma Sticklen a rising junior was 2nd in 59.00 and Dakota Luther who is transferring in to Texas next season was 3rd in 59.44. Sticklen’s swim misses her best time by just .14 seconds.

This reaffirms that the Longhorns will have the deepest butterfly group in the NCAA next season.

The next tiebreaker is lowest number of points based on the number of yellow and red cards in all group matches followed by the drawing of lots a situation which could come into play in Group B.



Canada and Costa Rica have both qualified for the World Cup and have clinched a spot in the semifinals but the final order of finish in the group will come down to the final match day. The teams will square off a 7 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. local on July 11 at Estadio BBVA and enter the match deadlocked on points (six each) goals scored (seven) goal differential (+7) and total cards accumulated (one yellow card each). Should Canada and Costa Rica tie the match and receive the same number of cards in the match Concacaf will have to draw lots to determine who finishes first in the group.



The other Group B match between Panama and Trinidad & Tobago which will be played at 7 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. local at Estadio Universitario will determine the third-place finisher from that group. Both nations are in search of their first points of the tournament though Panama has the superior goal differential and would secure the inter-confederation playoff berth with a draw.

BALANCED ATTACK STAUNCH DEFENSE LEAD RED WHITE AND BLUE

The USWNT has been in fine form through its first two matches of the Concacaf W Championship opening the competition with a 3-0 win over Haiti on July 4 and following it up with a 5-0 victory over Jamaica on July 7.

The USA leads all teams in the tournament with eight total goals scored which have come from six different players. Alex Morgan – who tallied twice against Haiti – and Sophia Smith – who netted a brace of her own against Jamaica – lead the USA with two goals each and are tied for second in scoring among all players this tournament. Midge Purce Rose Lavelle Kristie Mewis and Trinity Rodman have one goal apiece.



Mallory Pugh leads the USA and ranks second in the tournament with two assists this tournament while Kelley O’Hara Naomi Girma Sofia Huerta and Ashley Sanchez have also tallied assists for the USWNT.



Defensively the USA is one of three teams yet to concede a goal this tournament and has allowed just four shots on goal. The USWNT has now kept a clean sheet in each of its last 30 matches in World Cup and Olympic Qualifying a streak that dates back to its World Cup qualifying campaign in 2010. Defender Alana Cook leads the USA with 180 total minutes played this tournament followed by Pugh (163 minutes) and defender Emily Fox (135).

Unlike previous years where the rosters for Concacaf Qualifying have featured 20 players this year roster sizes were expanded to 23 matching the current World Cup roster size. U.S. Women’s National Team head coach Vlatko Andonovski announced his 23-player roster for the final competition on June 13 bringing in a squad that includes proven veterans on the international stage as along with dynamic up-and-coming talent.



Teams are allowed to utilize five substitutes per match in this tournament which the USA did in the tournament opener vs. Haiti and again on July 7 vs. Jamaica.



Nine players of the 23 players on this roster for the Concacaf W Championship were part of the 2019 team that won the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Only 10 players entered this tournament with previous experience in World Cup or Olympic qualifying at the senior national team level though 12 players have since made their World Cup and Olympic Qualifying debuts. The only player who has yet to see action this tournament is goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury.

INSIDE THE SERIES: USA VS. MEXICO

Monday’s match in Monterrey will be the 42nd meeting all-time between the USA and Mexico which will move Mexico into tie with Sweden for the fourth most common opponent in USA history trailing only Canada (62 games) China PR (58) and Norway (50). The USA leads the overall series with Mexico 39-1-1 and has won the last 15 head-to-head meetings between the teams by an overall margin of 64-4.



The USA and Mexico squared off most recently in the Send-Off Series in July of 2021 prior to the USWNT’s departure for the Tokyo Olympics. The teams played twice in East Hartford Connecticut resulting in a pair of 4-0 wins for the USA on July 1 and July 5.



This will be the first meeting between the USA and Mexico in a competitive match since squaring off on February 7 2020 in the semifinals of Concacaf Olympic Qualifying. The USA won 4-0 behind goals from Rose Lavelle Samantha Mewis (x2) and Christen Press to clinch its spot in the Tokyo Olympics.



Mexico is the opponent the USA has faced most frequently in World Cup and Olympic Qualifying with the teams meeting 13 times previously in Concacaf Qualifying. The USA has won 12 of those 13 meetings with Mexico’s only victory in qualifying – and only win ever against the USA – coming in the last matchup between the teams in Mexico a 2-1 victory for the home side in the semifinals of World Cup Qualifying in Cancun. Mexico’s only other result against the USA came during an October 2007 friendly in Albuquerque New Mexico drawing 1-1.

ABOUT THE CONCACAF W CHAMPIONSHIP

For the first time Concacaf is holding qualifying for the Women’s World Cup and the Olympics in the same tournament. That puts an end to the format which has seen eight previous Concacaf World Cup qualifying tournaments and five previous Concacaf Olympic qualifying tournaments. For the 1996 and 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cups teams qualified through their placing at the previous years’ World Cup.







The eight-team field for the Concacaf W Championship features the USA and Canada who automatically qualified for the championship round as the highest-ranked teams in the region at No. 1 and No. 6 in the world respectively along with the six group winners from the Concacaf W Qualifiers. For the qualifiers 30 teams were drawn into six groups of five for the qualifying competition and played a total of four matches across the February and April 2022 FIFA Windows to determine the group winners.

Mexico Costa Rica Jamaica Panama Haiti and Trinidad & Tobago won their respective groups to join the USA and Canada in the field for the Concacaf W Championship which is one of the two new major women’s summer competitions taking place in the region from 2021 through 2024.



After round-robin group play in the Concacaf W Championship the top two finishers in each group – the USA and either Jamaica or Haiti from Group A and Canada and Costa Rica from Group B – have booked a spot in the semifinals and guarantee their place in the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Additionally both group stage third-place finishers will advance to a 10-team FIFA Women’s World Cup intercontinental play-off. At the conclusion of the Concacaf W Championship the winning nation will also guarantee its place in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games Women’s Football Tournament and the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup. The runner-up and the third-place nations will progress to a Concacaf Olympic play-in to be played in September of 2023.

MEXICO ROSTER NOTES

Mexico was stunned in its first two games falling to Jamaica 1-0 on a header goal from Reggae Girlz star Bunny Shaw and then fell to Haiti 3-0 as Les Grenadières scored on three set plays – two penalty kicks converted by Roselord Borgella (14th minute) and Nerilia Mondesir (67th) and one free kick (which was smashed home by Sherly Jeudy in the 78th) that resulted from a last defender call that led to a red card ejection for Greta Espinoza who will be suspended for the game against the USA.

Mexico is eliminated from qualifying directly to the 2023 World Cup and will need a win over the USA to even have a chance to finish third and earn a berth to the 10-team FIFA Inter-Confederation Playoffs that will send the final three nations to Australia and New Zealand.

The Federación Mexicana de Fútbol officially launched the Liga MX Femenil in 2017 and the league has shown some tremendous growth and been successful both on the field and in the stands and fifteen members of this Mexico roster play in the league.

Of the 14 players on Mexico’s roster playing in their domestic league six play for the four-time overall champion Tigres UANL . Four play for reigning Apertura champions Chivas two play for Club America and one each for Pumas and CF Monterrey.

That leaves eight players playing outside Mexico which includes five playing in the USA three of them in the NWSL and two in college. Defender Jimena Lopez who played at Texas A&M plays with several USWNT teammates at OL Reign midfielder Maria Sanchez who hails from Idaho and played collegiately at Idaho and Santa Clara plays for the Houston Dash and forward Diane Ordonez who was a youth international for the USA and hails from the Dallas area and played at UVA plays for the NC Courage.

Mexico also has several other players with U.S. ties. Defender Bianca Sierra who is a star for Tigres is from Mountain View Calif. and played college soccer at Auburn.

Chiva forward Alicia Cervantes has led the Mexico league in scoring for the past two seasons.

The matches in July of 2021 were first against the USA for manager Monica Vergara who took over in January of 2021. She is the first female head coach in Mexico WNT history. The 39-year-old Vergara who is very much under intense pressure from the Mexican media after the very poor start to this tournament was a long-time member of the Mexican National Team and debuted as a teenager. She was a member of the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup Team as a 16-year-old playing against Germany and Italy. She played against the USA prior to the World Cup on March 28 1999 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3ZpcmdpbmlhL2FsbC1zcG9ydHMvaGlnaGxpZ2h0LWhvb3MtYWxleC13YWxzaC1hbmQta2F0ZS1kb3VnbGFzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Highlight Hoos: Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass | UVA Swimming,"Courtesy of Rob Schumacher/USA TODAY Sports

With the 2021-2022 Virginia athletics season officially completed we enter the college sports offseason optimistic for things to come for the Cavaliers next season. But with the fall seasons still a couple of months away we have time to take a look back at some of the incredible athletic accomplishments achieved by UVA student athletes during the 2021-2022 sports year in a series called Highlight Hoos.

So far we've covered Diana Ordóñez (Virginia women's soccer) Mia Barnett (Virginia cross country and track & field) Leo Afonso (Virginia men's soccer) Brooklyn Borum (Virginia volleyball) and Amber Ezechiels (Virginia field hockey).

Today we take a look at the last year of impressive accomplishments of the Virginia swimming dynamic duo of Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass representing both UVA and Team USA.

Olympic Trials - June 2021

Traveling back to just over a year ago this was a moment both Kate Douglass and Alex Walsh catapulted themselves to the national spotlight. As the reigning 2021 NCAA national champions the two Wahoo swimmers set their sights on the Tokyo Olympics.

Both swimmers participated in the 200-meter individual medley at the Olympic Trials in Omaha Nebraska. After solid performances in the heats and semifinals on June 15th Douglass and Walsh were in good positions for the final race where the top two swimmers earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.

The final event was a nail-biter to say the least. After the first 50 meters Alex Walsh was in fourth place and Kate Douglass was in second. Walsh used a strong backstroke and breaststroke leg to take the lead at 150 meters while Douglass had fallen to third place. In the final 50 meters Douglass used a strong freestyle to catch up. Walsh finished first with a time of 2:09.30 and Douglass finished two hundredths of a second behind her for second place. She edged out Madisyn Cox by two hundredths of a second as well showing how an infinitesimal margin can mean the difference between joy and heartbreak in swimming. Walsh and Douglass were in Cox was out.

While both Douglass and Walsh qualified for the Olympic Trials in other events they were not in the top two finishers of those races which meant their one shot at an Olympic medal in Tokyo would be in the 200 IM.

Tokyo Olympics - July 2021

Douglass and Walsh had become Olympians for the first time but their work wasn’t done yet. The 200 IM race had a similar structure with heats semifinals and then the final race with the top eight swimmers. Kate Douglass was seeded first heading into the finals and Alex Walsh was seeded third.

The 200 IM once again proved to be a thriller with swimmers changing places throughout the race and no clear winner until they touched the wall. Walsh and Douglass stuck with the pack in the first 50 meters and then Alex Walsh made her move during the backstroke and breaststroke as she did in the trials. In the freestyle lap four swimmers were neck and neck for the three medals. Walsh and Japan’s Yui Ohashi battled it out in lanes three and two respectively with Ohashi taking the victory by .13 seconds and Walsh taking second. Kate Douglass used a strong finish to beat Great Britain’s Abbie Wood by .09 securing the bronze medal. The UVA teammates embraced in the pool after securing the silver and bronze medals and cementing their names in USA Swimming history.

NCAA regular season - November 2021 - January 2022

Back at the collegiate level both swimmers showed why they were Olympians. With matching Olympic rings tattoos Douglass and Walsh dominated the regular season. In the six meets Douglass and Walsh swam in Walsh won or was part of 18 winning events and Douglass won or was part of 20 winning events. While a few of these races are counted twice as Douglass and Walsh dominated in relays a lot of these were individual victories which helped propel the women’s swim team to a dominant regular season.

15th FINA Short Course World Championships - December 2021

Kate Douglass attended the 2021 FINA Short Course World Championships in Abu Dhabi and had a successful performance with two gold medals two silver medals and a bronze medal. She took home gold in the 200-meter freestyle relay and 400-meter freestyle relay. After swimming in the heats she also earned silver medals in the women’s 200-meter medley relay and the mixed 200-meter medley relay. Finally Douglass won bronze in the 200-meter individual medley.

ACC Championships - February 2022

Virginia won its third-straight ACC Championship in February and its two biggest stars shined bright at the start of the postseason.

Alex Walsh won three individual events: the 200-yard individual medley the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard breaststroke. She set UVA and ACC records with the 200 breast as well as a UVA record on the 200 free. Walsh also was part of the winning 400 medley relay 400 freestyle relay and 800 freestyle relay. Virginia’s 400-yard medley relay team broke an NCAA US Open (fastest time in the U.S) and American (fastest time by an American) record. All of these accomplishments led to Walsh being named the ACC Women’s Most Valuable Swimmer in the meet.

Kate Douglass earned Women’s Swimmer of the Year honors in the ACC for her performance during the regular season but she also excelled at the ACC championships. She won individual titles in the 50 freestyle 100 freestyle and 100 butterfly and also won four relays. She was part of the record-breaking 400 medley relay with Walsh and she also contributed to the NCAA US Open and American record time in the 200 medley relay and 200 free relay. Finally Douglass also was victorious in the 400 free relay.

Women’s NCAA Championships - March 2022

Walsh and Douglass were the driving force behind Virginia’s second consecutive national championship. They both won three individual events and joined forces to win three relays and then Douglass earned a relay win in the 200 medley relay and Walsh came in second in the 800 free relay.

In the 400 medley relay and the 400 free relay that included both Douglass and Walsh Virginia set NCAA US Open and American records. The 400 medley relay record actually tied the record from the ACC Championships made by the exact same group. They also won the 200 free relay together.

Douglass set NCAA US Open and American records in both the 50 freestyle and 200 breaststroke at the national championships and she set an American record in the 100 fly. In the seven total events she participated in she won all seven and broke a record in five of them. Even more impressively she set American records in three events that were each different strokes and different distances a feat never before accomplished at the NCAA Championships.

Walsh took home the individual title for the 200 IM the 400 IM and the 200 fly in her accomplished meet including an NCAA US Open and American record in the 200 IM. She won six out of the seven events she participated in.

Honda Sport Award - April 2022

The Honda Sport Award is given to the top female athlete in 12 different sports and then the winner is eligible to win the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year award. Both Kate Douglass and Alex Walsh were named among the four finalists for the award along with Katharine Berkoff and Tarrin Gilliland. Douglass ended up winning the award giving her the title of the best female collegiate swimmer.

U.S. International Team Trials - April 2022

The Phillips 66 International Team Trials took place at the end of April in Greensboro North Carolina and was the selection meet for the 2022 FINA World Championships. Alex Walsh competed in three events and Kate Douglass competed in four after choosing to skip two events she could have swam due to meet scheduling.

Alex Walsh set a US Open record with a time of 2:07.84 in the 200 IM and won gold guaranteeing her a spot on the FINA World Championship team. She also came in fifth in the 100 breaststroke and sixth in the 200 freestyle.

Kate Douglass placed second in the 200 breaststroke to earn her roster spot and also finished fourth in the 100 butterfly and fifth in the 50 freestyle showing how versatile of a swimmer she can be yet again.

19th FINA World Championships - June 2022

A few weeks ago Douglass and Walsh finished competing for Team USA in Budapest Hungary for the FINA World Championships the biggest swim meet in non-Olympic years.

Douglass earned a bronze medal in the 200 breaststroke finishing behind USA teammate Lilly King and Australia's Jenna Strauch. She also added a bronze medal in the 400 freestyle relay along with teammates Torri Huske Erika Brown and Claire Curzan. She swam in the heats of the 400 mixed freestyle relay which ultimately won a bronze medal so she can add that to her medal haul as well.

Walsh set a personal best in her signature race of the 200 IM with a time of 2:07.13 and took home the gold medal at the World Championships. She also swam in the heats for the 800 freestyle relay and the 400 medley relay which both ended up winning gold so Walsh walked away with three gold medals from the meet.

“The dynamic has changed totally” said Herron owner of Greenworks Flowers.

While her shop lives or dies by the same customers that drive any other retailer its location is not quite as ordinary: It’s built into an underground shopping center. The shop is part of Houston’s network of underground pedestrian tunnels and shopping plazas a prominent outpost in a subset of the North American retail landscape.

Underground shopping centers — a diverse collection of below-grade commercial spaces that can include an array of vendors such as newsstands bakeries restaurants galleries and even dentists’ offices — have been a popular fixture in developments from New York to Houston to Toronto offering business owners a captive audience of weekday commuters using expansive networks of tunnels to beat heat cold and traffic. The pandemic has disrupted that retail real estate balance.

Analysts designers and more than a dozen businesses in some of the most prominent underground developments in North America say their trade has been struck a double blow first by a pandemic that temporarily brought business to a halt then by the changed patterns of city life. The dependable vigor of workday crowds is gone. In its place the curated dependence of underground spaces on office workers above has become a burden as the reality of long-term hybrid work settles in.

“It is at the mercy of what the return of office workers looks like” said Grant Humes head of the Financial District Business Improvement Area in Toronto where more than 17 miles of tunnels connect shops in a below-ground network known as the PATH.

“The PATH is one of those places where unless you have a reason to be there you don’t have a reason to be there — and your reason to be there is usually that you’re going to work” he said.

In Houston that dependency stands out in stark terms. Data from security firm Kastle Systems which tracks office attendance using anonymous keycard data from clients’ properties has shown office use rates there hovering around 56% among the highest in the nation and yet returning workers aren’t filling the underground spaces the way they once did.

Instead Herron said she can clearly see the outcome of new hybrid work policies implemented by above-ground employers. On days when more workers happen to be in the office at once she estimates traffic by her shop reaches about 70% of its pre-pandemic level — but other days it drops without warning to a third of what it once was — or less.

“The companies are still not operating like before” Herron said. “I don’t think they ever will again.”

Locked In

The challenges facing underground retailers are a combination of shifting demand and the constraint on spaces that are by their very nature difficult to update said David Greensfelder a consultant who has taught planning for the Urban Land Institute a research and public policy group.

Invisible from the sidewalk they can’t pivot to catch the attention of casual passers-by when commuter traffic slows.

“If you’re looking for a newspaper and you’re already above ground you’re probably not going to go underground to buy that newspaper” Greensfelder said.

From her shop beneath Houston’s streets Herron put it even more bluntly: “The rhythm for somebody like me who has been in this same location for 30 years has to be reinvented.”

Houston’s 6 miles of tunnels are largely linked to the surface by entrances in the lobbies of office buildings above them and the fate of individual sections has hinged on the choices of the businesses overhead leaving parts of the system worse off than others according to Robert Pieroni director of economic development for Central Houston Inc. a downtown business association. That system can also provide a welcome relief in a Gulf Coast city plagued by high temperatures and humidity.

From his station as a cook at Treebeard’s restaurant under downtown Houston about a quarter-mile from Herron’s flower shop Wendell Malone watched as the pandemic emptied the tunnels. Now he estimates the restaurant serves about 400 people a day about two-thirds as many as it did before the pandemic.

In Chicago where five miles of tunnels connect transit stations to some of the city’s most prominent buildings and provide a respite from the frigid winter weather the picture is more dire.

The city’s main downtown business association said that through June traffic counts in the tunnels lingered near 40% of pre-pandemic levels even as monthly averages on above-ground streets have doubled that figure hitting 80% or more.

Canada’s two largest underground retail venues in Toronto and Montreal have fared better thanks to being integrated differently into the fabric of life in the cities above.

Largest Underground Retail Complex

With more than 17 miles of tunnels and 4 million square feet of retail space including convenience stores theaters and medical services the Toronto PATH network holds the Guinness World Record for largest underground shopping complex.

Fellow cold-climate city Montreal has an underground retail system that's likewise among the largest in the world.

But unlike many U.S. developments both systems connect not only transit and offices but convention centers multiple stadiums and residential buildings creating a user base more resilient to office attendance shifts.

Still fluctuating traffic has hit underground retail hard according to Bradley Jones head of retail for Toronto-based Oxford Property Group the largest commercial landlord in Toronto.

While Oxford doesn’t track PATH traffic specifically Jones said retailers in the food court connected to the underground network are only back to about 50% of their pre-pandemic top-line sales.

“Tuesday Wednesday Thursday — in some cases they're getting back to pre-COVID numbers but when you average it over the five days it’s less” he said.

With a hybrid work model appearing to be the norm for some time to come finding ways to flex with the crowds such as dynamic scheduling and inventorying will probably be required.

To meet the challenge Oxford is looking to leverage the convenience factor of the tunnels pivoting away from commuter dependency and toward lifestyle tenants such as medical and legal offices gyms and other fitness tenants.

Seeing the Light

The overall gloomy outlook for the subterranean segment comes with at least one bright spot: The newest underground developments seem to have come back stronger from the pandemic lows.

Typically built around a central often atrium-style core newer underground developments are generally designed with more external features in mind with all aspects of the project including the architecture and the leasing strategy designed to draw pedestrians from outside rather than simply serving as an amenity for the offices above.

MarketPlace 28 a four-story 200000-square-foot retail development retrofitted below the 28 Liberty building in New York by China-based owner Fosun in 2018 has large banks of windows lighting a vertical well that drops through all four stories. The below-grade development is anchored by a theater at its lowest level a move intended to draw users down and through the retail space said Gensler lead retail designer Jason Carney who worked on the project.

“It’s not dependent at all on commuters or commuter patterns” said Carney. “It’s an entertainment destination.”

In Houston one of the newest developments connected to city tunnels is Understory a two-story atrium beneath the Bank of America Tower completed by Skanska in 2019 with similar design principles: ample daylight carried downward through an atrium-style core and strong sightlines from street level.

The goal was to lure more visitors than the building’s office users said Matt Damborsky Skanska’s executive vice president for Houston who oversaw the design of the lower-level space.

“We wanted to say ‘Hey the tunnel’s down here’” said Damborsky. “We were hyper-focused on creating a space that not only people in the building could use but also people could come in off the street and use.”

Direct comparisons are hard to come by but Damborsky said his impression was that Understory fared better than other parts of Houston’s tunnel system during the pandemic. Seven of its nine storefronts are occupied.

For spaces that can’t be reoriented to include natural light and street-level visibility Gensler’s Carney said he thinks the key will be creating more abstract types of “visibility” to the above-ground world including using tech tools to draw shoppers and space enhancements such as art installations as well as a leasing strategy that prioritizes a destination-making tenant mix over simply pushing rents.

Especially for older tunnel-and-hub developments whether they survive may hang on whether other drivers are able to take the place of a five-day-a-week office crowd.

“Rent is a function of sales and sales is a function of being able to capture demand” the Urban Land Institute's Greensfelder said. “So if the demand has left you do the math.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTA5L3RoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1hbXVzZW1lbnQtcGFyay1zLXdpbGQtcmlkZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The American Amusement Park's Wild Ride,"Why did this happen?

But more and more French women are asking: Could what happened in the U.S. happen here?

The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to strip women of the right to abortion has reverberated across Europe's political landscape forcing the issue back into public debate in France at a time of political upheaval.

With women increasingly taking leadership positions in French politics lawmakers in both houses of parliament have proposed four bills to enshrine the right to abortion in the French Constitution in order to defend it from future threats.

The most notable initiative comes from President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance. His detractors on the left say Macron's party is being opportunist while far-right critics accuse it of using the issue to distract from more pressing matters.

Abortion in France was decriminalized under a 1975 law named for Simone Veil a prominent legislator former health minister and key feminist who championed it.

“This right was fought for and was inalienable” said Yaël Braun-Pivet the first woman elected speaker of the National Assembly France’s most powerful house of parliament. In her first address to the chamber last week Braun-Pivet made the inscription of abortion rights into the French Constitution a top priority.

“It is my conviction as a woman today that we need to be the watchdog so that it stays in place forever” Braun-Pivet said.

Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne also expressed concerns over the potential effects of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on recent efforts to recriminalize abortion in Europe. Borne only the second woman in French history to have been appointed prime minister called the reversal of abortion rights in the U.S. a “historical turn in the wrong direction.”

“It’s a stark warning that women’s rights should never be taken for granted” Borne said last week after meeting health care providers and reproductive health specialists in Paris. She called for inscribing these rights into the French Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

The European Union’s parliament adopted a resolution Thursday condemning the U.S. decision and urging the addition of a sentence reading “Everyone has a right to safe and legal abortion” to the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. Abortion is legal and practiced without much political opposition in most EU nations but is banned in Malta and sharply restricted in Poland.

In France a poll this week found a solid majority of respondents support the right to abortion even including most voters who support Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party and the conservative Republicans. The results were consistent with past surveys.

However the effort to inscribe abortion rights in the French Constitution may not succeed if Macron's political rivals decide they don't want to give him an easy win.

Macron's party lost its majority in the National Assembly in last month's election while the leftist Nupes coalition became the biggest opposition force and Le Pen’s National Rally won a record number of seats.

“The right to abortion is not questioned by anyone” Le Pen said on France-Info radio last week. Still she blasted efforts to cement abortion rights in the constitution accusing Macron's allies of “political diversion.”

“They want to shift the focus from the main concerns for French people which are purchasing power security and out-of-control immigration” Le Pen said.

On the far left lawmakers noted that Macron's party dismissed earlier efforts to enshrine abortion in the constitution. Mathilde Panot leader of the hard-left France Unbowed parliamentary group is now pushing Borne to propose a government bill on the issue instead of a bill that originated in parliament which would speed up the process.

Last year French lawmakers passed a law extending the abortion deadline from 12 to 14 weeks and allowing midwives to perform the procedure.

Feminist activists marched last weekend in Paris to show solidarity with American women and support French efforts to seek constitutional guarantees.

“People think that women will always have this right but considering the rise of conservative political and religious movements we have our doubts” said Violaine De Filippis a Parisian lawyer and feminist activist who joined the march.

Some experts say Macron’s lawmakers are being alarmist.

Anne Levade a public law professor at La Sorbonne University said in a blog post that “clearly there is no risk in France that abortion rights would ever be challenged like they were in the U.S.”

But Mathilde Philip-Gay a law professor and specialist in French and American constitutional law said France's Constitutional Court could also be influenced by politics if groups craft a long-term strategy to end the right to abortion.

“It is not on the agenda right now but in 10 or 12 years French judges could do the same thing that judges of the Supreme Court did” Philip-Gay said.

An inscription into France's constitution “could make it harder for abortion opponents to challenge these rights but it couldn’t prevent them from doing it in the long run.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmljYW5zb25nd3JpdGVyLmNvbS9pLWFtLXRoZS13YWxydXMtdGhlLWJlYXRsZXMtbWVhbmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Meaning of the Weirdest Beatles Song “I Am The Walrus”,"While we will be the first to raise our hands as Beatles fans we can’t deny that their song “I Am The Walrus” is just weird.

Videos by American Songwriter

Released in 1967 “I Am The Walrus” runs at just over four and a half minutes of pure psychedelic rock/pop and nonsensical lyrics. Don’t get us wrong though it’s certainly entertaining to sing along with the goo goo a’joobs and the opening line I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.

But what does it all mean? Is there a meaning behind the lyrics? Keep reading to find out.

The meaning of “I Am The Walrus.”

Long story short “I Am The Walrus” is nonsense. But it was designed to be so and craftily at that. John Lennon wrote the majority of the song and it was then officially credited to the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership.

In several interviews after the fact Lennon explained that “I Am The Walrus” was written in response to learning that fans were analyzing the lyrics of The Beatles’ songs. More specifically Lennon had read a letter from a student from his alma mater Quarry Bank High School for Boys that said the literature classes were studying the meaning of The Beatles lyrics. (That study sounds a little familiar…)

So Lennon decided to pen a song so obscure and so bizarre that the meaning would be impossible to discover. Thus “I Am The Walrus.”

“Let the fuckers work that one out Pete!” Lennon is cited telling Pete Shotton an old school friend.

Man you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

How did Lennon come up with the lyrics?

In his infamous 1980 interview with Playboy and Yoko Ono which was published in 1981 Lennon explained his thought process for the song in more depth.

“The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend” he began. “The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend and it was filled in after I met Yoko. Part of it was putting down Hare Krishna. All these people were going on about Hare Krishna Allen Ginsberg in particular. The reference to ‘Element’ry penguin’ is the elementary naive attitude of going around chanting ‘Hare Krishna’ or putting all your faith in any one idol. I was writing obscurely a la Dylan in those days.”

He continued “It’s from ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter.’ ‘Alice in Wonderland.’ To me it was a beautiful poem. It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant like people are doing with the Beatles’ work. Later I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought Oh shit I picked the wrong guy. I should have said ‘I am the carpenter.’ But that wouldn’t have been the same would it? (singing) ‘I am the carpenter….'”

Song structure

The song itself can be divided into three parts: The beginning inspired by a police siren (Mister City p’liceman sitting pretty little p’licemen in a row) the middle a short rhyme about Lennon sitting in his garden (Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun) and the finale as a truly nonsensical part directed at the students attempting to dissect Beatles songs (Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna).

“I Am The Walrus” is really three songs combined. And each is more curious than the last.

A shoutout to “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” and Shakespeare

As if there wasn’t enough in “I Am The Walrus” there are a few notable callbacks and allusions in this tune.

In the third verse there’s the obvious callback to the 1967 song “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.” See how they fly like Lucy in the sky see how they run they sing. Another allusion in the song is to the Shakespearian play King Lear specifically Act 4 Scene 6. There’s no significance to the illusion other than setting a trippy atmosphere and the outro of “I Am The Walrus” includes several lines from King Lear exactly as they were broadcasted on British radio at the time.

Bizarre. Frustrating even. And yet we still love it.

Telok Blangah is an ideal place for those who want to reside in a peaceful area that’s not too far from Singapore’s urban landscape. Not only does it have amazing views of both lush greenery and the sea but it’s also a place steeped in history.

This is exactly why Terry and Rachel (@cookingpotbay*not their real name for privacy reasons) chose Telok Blangah Towers. With just 3 blocks it offers a good amount of privacy despite its central location.

That and the fact that the unit has the luxury of nearly full-length windows which is something rare to find in HDBs today.

And so to complement that they looked to keep their home simple and in a minimalist fashion.

If you’re leaning toward the minimalist type of design look no further as Terry and Rachel share how they achieved this in their home in Telok Blangah Towers.

Achieving A Timeless and Minimalist Home Design

Terry said that their budget for the renovation was $60k. But they didn’t consider this to be a tight budget. They knew that there was always a possibility that they would exceed the allocation in case there were certain higher-quality materials they’d end up choosing in the course of the renovation.

“Our final renovation cost excluding furnishings appliances et cetera came up to around $70k” he revealed.

As they anticipated some of the reasons the budget increased were due to choosing costlier materials such as tiles vinyl flooring and switches. “There were also some top-ups for changes in measurements and other miscellaneous items such as making good certain walls where we stripped the wallpaper off.”

The couple said they didn’t have any concrete theme in mind “but we did mention to our ID that we simply wanted something timeless and minimalist” said Terry.

What they wanted was for their home to look simple enough for them not to tire of it soon without compromising on cosiness. Even before they started the reno they’ve been surfing a lot of Instagram home accounts which served as an inspiration for their home design.

“We realised that our home looks a lot like a modern Korean home – clean with a lot of use of muted block colours” he said in retrospect.

Getting the house ready for reno means having to knock down the walls of one of the bedrooms. This feat left them with an expanded living room kitchen study room and master bedroom.

Here’s how their home turned out room per room.

Living Room

As soon as you enter the living room the combination of clean white colours and light wood flooring creates a modern but very clean ambience. It is further emphasised by the flooding of natural light from the windows.

They’ve also added a curved niche display wall in the living room. “This is something we knew we had always wanted even before we began sourcing for interior designers” said Terry.

Kitchen

The biggest change they did for the kitchen was knocking down the wall at the entrance. It helped create a space to accommodate an extended countertop which the couple now use as their breakfast counter.

In the kitchen proper the minimalist and clean lines continue to dominate the design. They opted for open shelving to help open up the space even more and allow the light from the yard and kitchen window to flow inside the room.

Master Bedroom

Terry said that they decided to add a platform for their bed – not so much for the bonus storage but because they just love platform beds for some reason. “Again this was something we knew we wanted from the very start.” We reckon that platform beds always provide a feeling of snugness which contributes to that cosy feeling that they were after.

Everything else in the room was designed around their platform bed centrepiece. The couple admitted that it was a pleasant surprise for them that their ID was able to adapt their wardrobe which sits on an extension of the platform bed. “The resulting effect looks fairly Japanese” Terry said.

Bathroom

Clean lines and muted colours continue to permeate even up to the design of their bathroom. The frosted lighting creates a warm ambience even in this space.

Study Room

They didn’t make any major changes in the study room’s layout except for making the vinyl flooring and wall colours consistent with the rest of the house. “We wanted to leave this room as a space that we could easily repurpose if necessary in the future” Terry noted.

Bringing The Vision To Reality

Terry and Rachel are both extremely satisfied with how their home turned out after the reno since the outcome was similar to what they envisioned beforehand.

“We followed our ID’s plan quite closely” said Terry “including his 3D rendering.” He added that they even went so far as to sourcing for furniture and fixtures that looked like those in the 3D rendering.

The couple did extensive research when they were searching for an ID. Instead of hiring a contractor directly they contacted Authors Interior & Styling.

“We approached Authors Interior & Styling directly purely based on the portfolio they had on their socials.”

They did not have a specific interior designer in mind during that time though. “Jun from Authors was randomly assigned to us who proved to be the perfect fit for what we required” said Terry.

When it comes to sourcing furniture the couple was very diligent about it. Terry shared that they visited a lot of stores in Singapore in person. They knew from the very start that they would not be making any blind purchases online especially for the big-ticket items.

“As with most clueless homeowners our Google searches led us to Tan Boon Liat. It’s something which we still believe is a great first stop for new homeowners as there are so many shops to view” Terry recalled.

While their sofa required a little bit more research he said they managed to find their dining table at Tan Boon Liat. For their dining chairs and bar stools their ID provided them with a list of suggestions from Taobao where they eventually got these furnishings.

When asked what was the best part of their home after the renovation both of them answered that it was and still is the living room.

“The reason we purchased this unit was due to the white “full-length” windows present in the living room” Terry said. They believe that this was a rare find for them since most HDB units these days only offer three-quarter windows.

“The knocking down of the 3rd bedroom and kitchen wall was what really opened the space for us” he added. Indeed it further enhanced the natural light streaming from the living room windows since the windows (in the area where the 3rd bedroom used to be) provide additional lighting.

Lessons Learned From A Successful Renovation Journey

Just as with most renovation projects these days COVID-19 was the one that offered the greatest challenge to the homeowners’ determination and patience. Terry and Rachel were not able to escape it either.

“Our tiling schedule was delayed by 2 weeks due to a lack of workers” Terry said. They also experienced unexpected delays from suppliers of their vinyl flooring which was very disruptive to the reno. It affected the entire schedule for fittings and appliance deliveries. He admitted that they chose to lay the vinyl flooring last.

This experience taught them to exercise patience and prepare for the worst including last-minute changes of plans. “There were a number of changes that we made as the renovation went along” he said “deviating not only from our planned schedule but also the design of the 3D rendering.”

Still they were lucky enough to have had most of their renovation go as planned.

The couple from Telok Blangah Towers leaves this guidance to new homeowners who are planning to renovate their homes.

Always be ready to listen to your ID’s advice which comes from a professional standpoint. At the same time they also recommend being firm if there are any design concepts you would like to try. “Ultimately it will be you coming home to look at your house every day.”"

With a megadrought draining water reserves in the West states are looking for alternatives to handle water rights many of which were set more than 100 years ago when water supplies were far more abundant.

Back then just posting a sign next to a water diversion was enough to be considered a right one which could still be honored now. But the climate crisis is now straining those rights. There just isn’t enough water in California to satisfy what’s been allotted on paper.

For years debate has raged in California about the best way to fix the water rights system for life in the modern era. Many of the senior water rights held in the state were set before 1914 when the permit system was established and when mining was big business.

“It’s an old water system that many perceive isn’t set up to deal with current climatic and hydraulic conditions” Nathan Metcalf a water rights attorney for California law firm Hanson Bridgett told CNN. “It’s just not really set up to deal with climate change and the changing needs for water both from an environmental standpoint and then there’s also the rub between agriculture and municipal.”

Recognizing the dour effect of climate change on the state’s hydrology Democrats in California’s Senate have proposed using $7.5 billion in state and federal funds to “build a climate-resilient water system.”

Of those funds $1.5 billion would be used to buy land with senior water rights from holders willing to sell them voluntarily in prioritized waters. The Democrats argue “fundamental changes” to the state’s water system are “needed to realign demand supply and the flexibility of the system.”

The proposal which has yet to work its way through the legislature would look to “retire water use incrementally from multiple water uses in a basin and across wide geographies” which would help provide clean drinking water while also improving fish habitats and wildlife refuge conditions.

“The problem with trying to regulate the senior water rights is that it’s a property interest so you always run the risk of a takings claim by taking that property” Metcalf said.

A takings claim could be brought by property owners against the government if it seizes private property for public use. Owners could also make a takings claim if regulations go too far in restricting their use of the land.

But Metcalf said there could be situations where it’s mutually beneficial for a property owner to cede his or her water rights.

“If it’s economically advantageous for both the farmer and the state to purchase those water rights to put to another use I think that’s a possibility” Metcalf said. “I could also see certain agricultural sectors being opposed to that because you never know when or how you’re going to use that water right in the future.”

Metcalf said the government could simply buy senior water rights which might be an easier option than trying to regulate those rights which often leads to years of litigation.

A novel approach

In Northern California the State Water Board is trying something it has never tried before: a voluntary water sharing agreement for water rights holders in the Upper Russian River watershed in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties.

For months rights holders met once a week to come up with an agreement in anticipation of another supply shortage. It’s an effort to avoid curtailments spurred by the severe drought conditions last year which led to water demand outstripping supply.

“Conditions deteriorated so quickly there weren’t really alternative options. We had to move forward with the curtailment process. We developed an emergency regulation” said Sam Boland-Brien a supervising engineer with the State Water Board. “That resulted in all kinds of surface water users … in the upper part of this watershed having to stop diversions.”

In fact water levels got so low “there was this really concrete risk that Lake Mendocino up near Ukiah was going to run empty” Boland-Brien said adding the storms rolling through in October last year kept the lake from running dry before the end of winter.

Coming too close to running out of water was the catalyst to find a better way to share water he said.

The State Water Board said more than half of the total eligible water rights holders have signed up for the program including municipalities along the river which hold the oldest rights in the watershed dating back to the late 1800s as well as local water districts and some larger institutional wineries.

The more rights holders involved the better. By enrolling in the program rights holders committed to a water use reduction of up to 20% to 30% for senior holders. Due to the oppressive drought cities are also enforcing water conservation. Those water savings are incorporated into what can be shared with other rights holders in the community as well Boland-Brien noted.

All the agreements create a pool of water available for more junior rights holders who would have otherwise had their water curtailed. Participants can also do further transfers or exchanges among each other creating an added level of flexibility.

“What the program achieves is it smooths out that ‘all or nothing’ aspect of the appropriative system” Boland-Brien explained. He said a better-managed voluntary system is more likely to get buy-in from rights holders than state regulatory actions alone.

“Those who still have water rights produce a little bit” Boland-Brien said. “They reduced their usage … so those that [have more junior rights] can make it through the irrigation season on a reduced amount.”

An emergency curtailment regulation remains in place as a backstop for those rights holders who did not join in the program. As water levels continue to drop curtailments will kick in based on seniority.

The program went into effect July 1 and will expire at the end of the year but there’s hope that it could be expanded into the future.

“The idea is that this would continue in future years and so each year there would be a slightly different mix of water supplies and people signed up so that even if you’re a junior some years you could still benefit from the flexibility” Boland-Brien said.

A court rules in favor of deviating from the law

The Upper Russian River program is in line with what Mike Young a professor at the University of Adelaide and a specialist in water policy reform says is needed to equitably handle water rights in drought-stricken areas except he argues every rights holder needs to be included in any water-sharing program.

“Everybody has a percentage share of whatever is available and that goes up and down” Young said to CNN. “Have boards that make decisions in the interest of everybody and everybody has an incentive to make the system work. The board makes the final decision and the profits are allocated to shareholders … You run a water accounting system that looks like your bank account.”

In Nevada a fight over Diamond Valley’s groundwater rights ended up at the Nevada Supreme Court which set a precedent when it ruled 4-3 the state engineer can deviate from Nevada’s water laws which are based on water rights seniority to regulate Diamond Valley’s water under a new groundwater management plan approved by those water users when supplies are depleting.

About four years ago Young spent time with farmers in Diamond Valley an area in Eureka County which relies heavily on groundwater; too heavily Young said. According to the court’s ruling “the Diamond Valley Hydrologic Basin is over-appropriated and over-pumped such that groundwater withdrawals from the Basin exceed its perennial yield.”

“The thing about rivers and groundwater resources is they don’t lie” Young said adding in one day he helped the farmers draft the new groundwater management plan.

“Someone’s got to write the rule book down and the problem is that America doesn’t have a decent rulebook for playing the game called water use” Young said. He argues developing water accounting systems where the resource is scarce should be basic.

“Every irrigator in the west should have a water account that says how much water they may take from the system” Young said. “Taking water that is not in your account is seen by everyone as bad as going next door and harvesting their crop.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzZGsuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9lYXN0LXN0LWxvdWlzLXNpbmtob2xlLXN3YWxsb3dzLWNhci82My0xOWMwMzM5ZS1kN2UxLTQ1NGUtOWU5YS02OTcxMGIxMmRhZmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,East St. Louis residents call for action after sinkhole swallows car,"Days after a sinkhole submerged a car on an East St. Louis street residents returned to the site to have a wider discussion about the city's infrastructure.

EAST ST. LOUIS Ill. — A car was completely submerged in a massive sinkhole in East Saint Louis on the 4th of July.

On Saturday a group of citizens returned to the site to have a wider discussion about the city's infrastructure.

The hole on North 32nd Street was blocked off and had been filled with gravel by Illinois American Water according to a city spokesperson.

Darius Edwards who had stepped away from the car told 5 On Your Side he was lucky to have his life.

""It kind of traumatized my fiancé and it kind of ruined our 4th of July. Anyone could have been hurt people sit here every day probably getting groceries out of the car. Anything. Children in the car.”

Illinois American Water responsible for the city’s water system acknowledged what could have happened and how they responded saying “this was a rare unfortunate incident."" They did not mention how they would move forward.

Read the full statement:

On Monday July 4 we received a phone call from the East St. Louis Police Department about a car that had fallen into a hole in the street in front of this home. Unknown to us at the time there was a water main break under the street directly in front of the home and underneath the car. We were not aware of this leak yet because water had not surfaced onto the ground or street. Unknowingly a car had parked on the street directly above the out-of-sight water main break. Due to the impact of water below the street and the weight of the car the street buckled and the car fell into an opening.

The car was parked. No one was in the car. Fortunately no one was injured . Apparently the driver was inside a nearby home.

Our employees immediately went to the scene. A towing company was called. The car was lifted from the hole and the car was taken to a local towing company.

We worked with the towing company and tracked down the owner of the car. The car’s owner was relieved that we found her and explained to her what had happened. This week the car’s owner has been working closely with our insurance company on fixing or replacing the car.

This was a rare unfortunate incident. We are extremely pleased and relieved that no one was in the car and no one was injured.

Metro East Organizing Coalition and Empire 13 grassroots organizations that have been very local about the city’s restoration and history this summer called for action on the infrastructure issues community members said have plagued their neighborhoods for decades.

""Companies will readily come like you see the gravel in there. But the street is still not repaired. Then it will sit like this for months and years"" said Dr. Larita Rice-Barnes executive director of the Metro East Organizing Coalition.

The response from the water company was much different from what citizens wanted to hear.

""To make sure that they have people in place that are going to monitor our streets. That are going to fix the streets. That are not going to let them sit like this"" Rice-Barnes said.

""The state and the federal government have to address environmental racism"" said JD Dixson with Empire 13. ""From Belleville to Illinois you see it. You go up to Belleville and there are manicured lines and streets that are even Evenly paved. No potholes.""

5 On Your Side received the following response from Mayor Robert Eastern III’s office:

“As the mayor of this great city E. St. Louis we are also concerned with the water main break in our community.

American companies are moving manufacturing back to the US from Asia.

General Motors GE Intel and US Steel are among companies opening new factories in America.

Companies started reviewing their supply chains following the US-China trade war and pandemic.

American manufacturers are increasingly bringing production back to the US to reduce their reliance on global supply chains that proved vulnerable to disruption such as the pandemic.

An overwhelming majority of American companies with production operations in China have already moved some back to the US or plan to do so in the next three years according to Kearney's 2021 Reshoring Index.

Almost four in five corporations companies have already shifted production to the US and at least 15% are considering it due to high tariffs and ongoing supply chain challenges Kearney's report shows.

However imports from low-cost Asian countries to the US still increased last year.

""Reshoring"" manufacturing has also been spurred by geopolitical disruption triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.

General Motors announced in January it would spend $7 billion on four plants in Michigan. Last year it spent almost $40 billion buying parts from some 5600 US suppliers.

The manufacturer behind Chevrolet GMC Cadillac and Hummer announced its biggest investment to increase its battery cell production to achieve its aim of becoming North America's biggest electric vehicle producer.

GE Appliances is also investing on expanding US production to make products closer to customers and create more American jobs.

The company which produces appliances like refrigerators dishwashers and hot water heaters has invested more than $2 billion in its US plants and distribution centers since 2016.

It opened a water heater plant in May in Camden South Carolina and has increased its spend on US suppliers by two thirds in the past five years.

Intel is investing $12 billion on two chip factories near Phoenix that are due to open in 2024. The company said last year that the US has ""lost ground"" in manufacturing semiconductors.

The new US plants will help meet domestic demand for the billions of chips now used in a array of products from computers to cars.







US Steel is investing in a $3 billion steelmaking factory in Osceola Arkansas. Similarly Nucor is spending about $2.7 billion on a steel plate mill in Brandberg Kentucky with construction set to start later this year.

Generac Power Systems moved some production from China to the US after the pandemic. Last year it unveiled plans to open a new plant in Trenton South Carolina.

Lockheed Martin is putting $16.5 million into a new Missile System Integration Lab facility in Huntsville Alabama. The defense contractor already has 25 facilities in Alabama and expects to create a further 200 jobs there.

US companies started reconsidering having their supply chains abroad after a trade war with China resulted in high tariffs on Chinese imports.

The Trump administration pushed for ""America First"" trade and called to bring jobs back to the US as the trade war began in 2018.

Manufacturers told US trade officials in June 2019 that increasing tariffs on Chinese imports would increase costs for consumers and put jobs at risk. Two months later Trump told businesses that they should ""immediately"" look for alternative manufacturers to China ""including bringing your companies home"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lubm92YXRpb24vd2F0ZXItc3RyYXRlZ3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A water expert reveals how farmers could save U.S. Southwest cities from drought,"“Are you going to run out of water?” is the first question people ask when they find out I’m from Arizona. The answer is that some people already have others soon may and it’s going to get much worse without dramatic changes.

Unsustainable water practices drought and climate change are causing this crisis across the U.S. Southwest. States are drawing less water from the Colorado River which supplies water to 40 million people. But levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell the river’s two largest reservoirs have dropped so low so quickly that there is a serious risk of one or both soon hitting a “dead pool” a level when no water flows out of the dams.

On June 14 2022 U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton warned Congress that the seven Colorado River Basin States — Arizona California Colorado Nevada New Mexico Utah and Wyoming — need to reduce their diversions from the Colorado River by 2 million to 4 million acre-feet in 2022. An acre-foot is enough water to cover an acre of land about the size of a football field with a foot of water — roughly 325000 gallons. If the states don’t come up with a plan by August 2022 Touton may do it for them.

To achieve Touton’s objective states need to focus on the region’s biggest water user: agriculture. Farmers consume 80 percent of the water used in the Colorado River Basin. As a longtime analyst of western water policy I believe that solving this crisis will require a major intervention to help farmers use less water.

John Oliver host of HBO’s ‘Last Week Tonight’ delves into the West’s water crisis.

Lawns in the desert

It’s not an exaggeration to call the Southwest’s water shortage a crisis. Declining river levels are compromising electricity generation from hydropower which affects the power supply for millions of people. Farmers are fallowing fields and using less water on their crops. This in turn imperils food production already under global strain from the war in Ukraine. Drought conditions could wipe out endangered species especially salmon.

There is something profoundly unsettling about the lush green landscape in Southern California a desert transformed by the power of water. The average annual rainfall at Los Angeles International Airport from 1944 to 2020 was 11.72 inches (30 centimeters). That’s not much more than Tucson Arizona gets in the middle of the Sonoran Desert.

Now however western states are imposing unprecedented restrictions on water use. On June 1 2022 the Metropolitan Water District wholesaler to 20 million Southern Californians urgently called for a 35 percent reduction in water use. In response the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power is limiting residents to watering their lawns twice a week for eight minutes per session. Other providers allow just one weekly watering.

The California Water Resources Control Board has ordered many farmers and San Francisco Bay-area cities to stop diverting water from the San Joaquin River system. Golf course operators are under substantial pressure to reduce water use.

Focus on irrigation

Still agriculture uses far more water than lawns and golf courses. In 2017 U.S. farmers irrigated about 58 million acres (23 million hectares) of cropland almost two-thirds of it in the West.

In recent decades western farmers have significantly changed their irrigation practices. Many have switched from flood systems which literally flood fields to pressurized systems. Typically these are center pivots that apply water from sprinklers connected to a large arm that slowly moves around a core creating those large usually green circles that airplane passengers can see across the West. This shift reduces water losses from evaporation percolation into the soil and runoff.

In 2012 U.S. farmers used pressurized systems on 72 percent of their fields up from 37 percent in 1984. That still leaves 28 percent or 20 million acres (8 million hectares) that are flood irrigated.

And center-pivot systems are not as efficient as drip or micro-irrigation which delivers water directly to plants’ root zone through hoses embedded in the soil. Drip irrigation delivers water slowly reducing runoff and evaporation. Microirrigation systems use 20 percent to 50 percent less water than conventional sprinkler systems.

But drip systems are quite expensive costing upwards of US$2000 per acre. They are not cost-effective for farmers who grow low-value crops such as alfalfa and are prohibitively expensive for small farmers.

Most farms that irrigate are small operations with fewer than 50 acres (20 hectares) and less than $150000 in annual revenues. But large-scale farms with annual revenues over $1 million use about 60 percent of irrigated water.

Bigger farms have the necessary capital to invest in sprinkler systems but not necessarily enough to invest in highly efficient subsurface drip or micro-irrigation. Existing U.S. Department of Agriculture programs offer modest incentives usually a maximum of $100 per acre — not enough to justify switching for most farmers.

Balancing rural and urban needs

Helping farmers switch to high-efficiency irrigation systems would benefit the entire Southwest. I propose a two-pronged approach.

First Congress would provide funding to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to offer farmers more generous financial incentives to switch to micro-irrigation systems. The 2021 infrastructure bill contains $8.3 billion to assist western states in adapting to drought and climate change. I believe that this financial aid with support from the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the USDA could persuade millions of American farmers to make the move.

Second to augment the federal program state municipal and local interests including government agencies and private businesses would create funds to underwrite the entire cost of converting farms to micro-irrigation. As I envision it cities could offer to absorb 100 percent of the purchase and installation costs of microsystems in exchange for a percentage of the water that farmers would save by making the switch.

A program that’s cost-free to farmers would be far more attractive than existing federal programs. In my view locally financed programs managed in collaboration with farm communities could reallocate a lot of water in a short time frame. This could be done through either a formal water rights transfer or short- or medium-term leases with farmers retaining water rights.

In the past farmers have been rightly suspicious when city representatives arrived with proposals to buy agricultural water. All too often such transfers have triggered economic death spirals for rural communities. But it need not be so.

Because farmers consume about 80 percent of western water while residential commercial and industrial use is less than 10 percent I believe reducing agricultural consumption by a few percentage points would solve the municipal and industrial need for water. If farmers achieve this reduction thanks to increased efficiencies from micro-irrigation systems — paid for by cities — the farmers could grow as much product as they do now with slightly less water.

Making this shift could raise economic and technical challenges. For example most farms would probably fallow or reduce the production of low-value crops such as alfalfa which could affect animal feed prices. And one disadvantage of drip irrigation systems is that gophers love to gnaw on the plastic tubes so farmers would need an animal control program.

Nonetheless I see voluntary compensated water transfers as a strategy that would protect the long-term viability of rural communities and keep the taps flowing in western cities. Limits on watering lawns won’t solve the West’s water crisis.

That is according to Eirgrid officials who have for the first time provided more definite timelines on the construction programme. They revealed they expect to start laying down the cable in Cork next year and have given some specifics on when and where the work will be carried out.

More than 1000km of cable is to be laid between northern France and Ireland - the vast majority of which will be on the seabed – and this will augment the country’s electricity supply in the years ahead.

Shane Cooney Eirgrid’s onshore project manager said the remainder of the €1bn funding for the project from the EU is expected to be sanctioned by the winter enabling work to get underway early next year on the Irish side.

The seabed cable will make landfall at Claycastle beach Youghal. From there it will follow the N25 as far as the Two Mile Inn to the east of Midleton with minor diversions on the route around the villages of Killeagh and Castlemartyr.

Once the cable gets to the Two Mile Inn it will be diverted away from the main road skirting to the north of Midleton and onto the former Amgen site at Carrigtwohill from its northern side. A converter station is to be built there as the French will be sending the current in DC form.

Mr Cooney said this is the most efficient way to transmit it and it will then be converted back into AC current which is used here and cabled on to connect with the national grid at Knockraha.

He said laying cable alongside the N25 from Carrigtwohill to Midleton now would inhibit the future upgrade of the road which has been put on hold due to the current lack of government funding for the project. Mr Cooney added that TII (Transport Infrastructure Ireland) officials held the same view as Eirgrid.

Mr Cooney said earthworks will start at the Amgen site in 2023 and roadworks to enable cable-laying will get underway on the rural roads between there and the Two Mile Inn during 2023 and into 2024.

Residents' concerns

However he added that cable trenching works on the side of roads along the whole Youghal – Knockraha route could go on until 2026.

People living on some of the rural roads north of Midleton and Carrigtwohill have said they fear their lives will be significantly impacted by the work which Fine Gael councillor Sinead Sheppard pointed out to Mr Cooney.

He replied Eirgrid will appoint community liaison officers to ensure school runs creamery tanker drivers home helps festivals organisers etc will be advised of any disruption in advance.

Fianna Fáil councillor Sheila O’Callaghan said Eirgrid “need to make life as comfortable as possible for all involved” and that other utility companies had left roads in a less than desirable state after working on them.

Mr Cooney said this would not happen maintaining many of the roads in the area are in poor condition and it “will be a plus” for locals when they're resurfaced following the cable-laying.

Michelle Walsh Eirgrid’s senior community liaison officer said a community benefit scheme will be opened to provide money for worthy projects in the areas impacted.

She said that the community fund will be administered through the independent East Cork development agency Secad.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A thermocouple consists of two dissimilar conductors soldered or welded together at one end. These ubiquitous devices use the Seebeck effect to measure temperature.

This article takes a look at the Seebeck effect laying the foundation for a discussion of thermocouples in the next article in this series.

Brief History of the Seebeck Effect

In 1822 Thomas Seebeck a German physicist noticed that a loop created by connecting two semicircular pieces of bismuth and copper can deflect a nearby compass when there is a temperature gradient along the loop (Figure 1).

Figure 1. A high-level representation of Seebeck's accidental thermo-magnetism discovery. Image used courtesy of Analog Devices and Linear Technology

Seebeck’s friend Hans Christian Oersted who had published his discovery of the connection between electricity and magnetism in 1820 suggested that the needle should have been moved by a magnetic field generated by an electric current flowing through the loop. This was the first thermoelectric effect discovered. At that time it was not easy to develop an explaining theory for the observed physical phenomenon because even basic concepts such as voltage current and resistance were not clearly formulated then. In fact the mechanisms of this phenomenon were not well understood until the discovery of electrons in 1897.

It is also worthwhile to mention that the experiments conducted by Luigi Galvani  the discoverer of animal electricity were also related to the Seebeck effect. In 1786 Galvani observed that the muscles of a dissected frog contract when touched by dissimilar metal probes.

Temperature Effects on Electrons—Electron Redistribution

Thanks to the efforts of many great minds in the history of science we have a better understanding of physical phenomena such as the Seebeck effect. A detailed discussion of the theory behind the thermoelectric effects is beyond the scope of this article; however a simplified intuitive explanation can still provide us with a basic understanding of this effect.

Today we know that an electric field or thermal energy can liberate some electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of a conductor. While the valence electrons are bound too tightly to atoms to contribute to the electric current the electrons in the conduction band have enough energy to move freely in the material. When a temperature difference exists between the two ends of a metal bar the hot region produces more free electrons. The electrons at the hot end are also more thermally agitated than the electrons at the colder end of the conductor. These thermally agitated electrons diffuse more rapidly than lower-energy electrons.

A higher concentration of the thermally agitated electrons in the hot end of the wire causes the diffusion of electrons from the hot end to the cold region. As a result of this thermally-induced electron diffusion the hot region becomes positively charged compared to the opposite end of the conductor. Figure 2 shows how a temperature difference redistributes electrons and makes them travel from the hotter region to the colder end.

Figure 2. An overview of how temperature differences affect electron distribution from hot to cold. Image used courtesy of TI .

You may wonder how long this redistribution of electrons is going to continue? The developed thermal voltage attempts to produce a current in the opposite direction of the thermally-induced current. As more and more electrons travel from the hotter to the colder end an increasingly larger thermal voltage develops across the wire. At some point this thermal voltage becomes large enough to counteract the temperature-induced diffusion of electrons. When this equilibrium is achieved the net current through the conductor will be zero.

Seebeck Voltage—the Seebeck Coefficient

The open-circuit voltage produced by a temperature gradient along a wire is called Seebeck voltage and this phenomenon is referred to as the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck voltage produced for a given temperature difference depends on the material properties.

To assess the strength of the Seebeck effect in a given material the Seebeck coefficient is defined as:

$$S = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta T} = \frac{V_{\cold}-V_{\hot}}{T_{\hot}-T_{\cold}}$$

Equation 1.

Where ΔV denotes the voltage difference obtained by applying a small temperature difference (ΔT) along the material. Note that by convention ΔV is defined as the voltage on the cold side minus the voltage on the hot side. With the example depicted in Figure 2 V cold – V hot is negative leading to a negative Seebeck coefficient. We’ll discuss the sign of the Seebeck coefficient in greater detail shortly.

In Equation 1 ΔT is assumed to be small. Therefore we can also define the Seebeck coefficient as the first derivative of the produced voltage with respect to temperature:

$$S = \frac{dV}{dT}$$

Equation 2.

Seebeck Coefficient—Absolute or Relative?

The values obtained from Equations 1 and 2 are referred to as the absolute Seebeck coefficients meaning that they specify the Seebeck effect of an individual material. For example the absolute Seebeck coefficient of aluminum at 0 °C is −1.5 μV/K. The Seebeck coefficient of a material can be also specified as a relative value with respect to reference material. For example the Seebeck coefficient of aluminum might be reported with respect to platinum which has an absolute value of -5 μV/K at 0 °C. In this case the relative Seebeck coefficient of aluminum is given as:

$$S_{Aluminum Relative} = S_{Aluminum} - S_{Platinum} = -1.5-(-5)=3.5\frac{\mu V}{K}$$

Figure 3 gives the Seebeck coefficient of aluminum as well as some other common materials measured relative to platinum.

Figure 3. Example Seebeck coefficients for different materials. Data used courtesy of M. Li .

The absolute Seebeck coefficient of a material cannot be directly measured by a multimeter. This is due to the leads of the voltmeter (as well as any other conducting materials at the input of the measurement circuit) can experience a temperature gradient and create additional Seebeck voltages. The voltage measured in this way will depend on the Seebeck effect of both the tested material as well as the materials used in the measurement circuitry. The absolute Seebeck coefficient can be determined by applying the Kelvin relation for the Seebeck coefficient . However the relative value can be easily determined by measuring the output of a thermocouple circuit.

Seebeck Effect's Temperature Dependence

The Seebeck coefficient is a function of temperature. Figure 4 shows how the absolute Seebeck coefficient of platinum (Pt) and niobium (Nb) changes with temperature.

Figure 4. A graph showing the coefficients of Pt and Nb vs temperature. Image used courtesy of M. Gunes .

It should be noted that above a minimum size of submicron order the Seebeck coefficient is independent of the material’s geometry cross-sectional area and length.

Sign of the Seebeck Coefficient

As mentioned above the theory behind the thermoelectric effects is rather complicated. With some metals such as copper electrons travel from the cold to the hot end of the wire leading to a positive Seebeck coefficient.

From Figure 3 we observe that the Seebeck coefficient of copper is about +1.5 μV/K at 0 °C. The magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient are related to an asymmetry of the electron distribution around the Fermi level.

The features of two-dimensional electrons on a square lattice in a magnetic field with NN (t a and t b in x- and y-directions respectively) and NNN (t c ’) hoppings called the Harper-Hofstadter-Hatsugai (HHH) model2534 can be implemented as a one-dimensional system through the dimensional reduction2534 that is one of the components of the two-dimensional momentum is replaced with cyclic time. We show that the classical analog of the HHH model can be synthesized in a tunable one-dimensional electric circuit by modulating capacitances or inductances appropriately.

Here we consider a lossless electric circuit consisting of N nodes and the corresponding LC resonators where neighboring LC resonators are coupled. According to Kirchhoff’s law the current I and the voltage V satisfy2335

$${{{{{\bf{I}}}}}}=\left(i\omega C+\frac{1}{i\omega }W\right){{{{{\bf{V}}}}}}$$ (1)

where C and W are the N × N matrices of capacitances and the inverse of inductances of the circuit and I and V are the N-vectors. ω is the angular frequency of alternating current. The HHH model can be implemented in either of the two cases; the first case has a fixed inductance and various capacitances of the circuit and the second case has a fixed capacitance and various inductances. Here we select the first case for the use of the advantages of variable capacitors that have been widely used in electric circuits as shown in Fig. 1a i.e. the system of Fig. 1a consists of N nodes and the corresponding resonators with each resonator having a constant inductance L 0 and a variable capacitance \({C}_{j}\left(1\le\ j\le N\right)\). The neighboring jth and \((j+1){{{{{\rm{th}}}}}}\) resonators are capacitively coupled by the capacitance \({C}_{jj+1}\). C 01 is the capacitance between node 1 and the ground through jumper 2. In the periodic boundary condition (PBC) jumper 1 has the short connection with jumpers 2 and 3 being opened. Likewise in the open boundary condition (OBC) jumpers 2 and 3 have the short connections with jumper 1 being opened.

Under the constant inductance L 0  Eq. (1) is then rewritten as

$${{{{{\bf{I}}}}}}=i\omega {C}_{0}\left[H-\frac{{\omega }_{0}^{2}}{{\omega }^{2}}E\right]{{{{{\bf{V}}}}}}$$ (2)

where

$$H=\frac{1}{{C}_{0}}\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}{C}_{1}+{C}_{01}+{C}_{12} & -{C}_{12} & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -{{DC}}_{NN+1}\\ -{C}_{12} & {C}_{2}+{C}_{12}+{C}_{23} & -{C}_{23} & \cdots & \cdots & 0\\ 0 & -{C}_{23} & \ddots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ \vdots & 0 & \vdots & \ddots & \cdots & \cdots \\ 0 & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & {-C}_{N-1N}\\ -D{C}_{NN+1} & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & -{C}_{N-1N} & {C}_{N}+{C}_{N-1N}+{C}_{NN+1}\end{array}\right]$$ (3)

and \({\omega }_{0}=1/\sqrt{{L}_{0}{C}_{0}}\). (We have normalized the matrix H by the capacitance C 0 .) E is the identity matrix. The boundary condition is periodic (open) when \(D=1(D=0)\). Note that \({C}_{{{{{\mathrm{01}}}}}}+{C}_{NN+1}\) holds when imposing the PBC. We set the capacitances in the diagonal and non-zero off-diagonal components so that they satisfy \(\big({C}_{j}+{C}_{j-1j}+{C}_{jj+1}\big)/{C}_{0}=-2{t}_{a}{\cos }\left(\frac{2{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}}{T}\tau +2{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}\phi j\right)+{const}.\) and \({C}_{jj+1}/{C}_{0}=-{t}_{b}\left\{1-2{t}_{c}{\cos }\left(\frac{2{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}}{T}\tau +2{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}\phi j+{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}\phi \right)\right\}\) respectively to emulate the HHH model. Here const. stands for an offset value for those capacitances to be positive. The parameters τ T ϕ and t c are the adiabatic parameter (regarded as time variable1014) the period of the adiabatic parameter the magnetic flux and the NNN hopping amplitude normalized by t b (t c = t c ’/t b ) respectively.

In an electric circuit the local density of states in quantum systems is evaluated by measuring the real part of the impedance at node n with other nodes being opened. The real part of the impedance at n node Z n is expressed as21

$${{{{{\rm{Re}}}}}}\left[{Z}_{n}\left(\omega +i0\right)\right]=\frac{1}{2f{C}_{0}}{\sum }_{i}{\delta }\left({\lambda }_{i}^{H}-\frac{{\omega }_{0}^{2}}{{\omega }^{2}}\right){\left|{\psi }_{in}\right|}^{2}$$ (4)

where \({\lambda }_{i}^{H}\) and \({\psi }_{in}\) are the eigenvalue and the nth component of the ith eigenmode of H respectively. f is the frequency \(\omega /2{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}\). The detail of the derivation of Eq. (4) is described in Supplementary Note 4.

Figure 1b c shows the top view and the unit cell of the fabricated circuit. Wire-wound inductors ceramic capacitors and variable capacitors are mounted on a FR4 board and N = 89 LC resonators are coupled in series (represented by the red dashed line). The capacitances are tuned by DC bias voltages supplied from the multi-channel digital to analog (D/A) converter boards so that the capacitances are distributed to emulate the HHH model.

Observation of edge states near the topological phase transition

We now turn to our experimental results. As shown above the local density of states at node n is evaluated by measuring the impedance at the node. In order to observe spectra for the bulk and topological edge states we select nodes 1 44 45 and 89 for measuring the impedances where we assume that nodes 1 and 89 correspond to the left-edge and the right-edge respectively and the average of the impedances at nodes 44 and 45 correspond to the bulk. We vary τ from 0 to 1 with ϕ = 1/2 fixed in the OBC. First we set the NNN hopping parameter as t c = 0.1. Figure 2a–c show the impedance maps of the bulk the left-edge and the right-edge respectively. We observe the gap around 0.96(ω 0 /ω)2 in the bulk (white horizontal dashed line Fig. 2a). On the other hand there are states at τ = 0.75 for the left-edge (Fig. 2b) and at τ = 0.25 for the right-edge (Fig. 2c) at 0.96(ω 0 /ω)2 (white horizontal dashed line Fig. 2b c) respectively. Figure 2d shows the impedance spectra of the three cases at τ = 0.25. We clearly observe the strong peak in the impedance of the right-edge and small impedances of the left-edge and the bulk at 0.96(ω 0 /ω)2. Similarly for τ = 0.75 there is the strong peak in the impedance of the left-edge and small impedances of the right-edge and the bulk at the same frequency (τ = 0.75 in Fig. 2a–c). Therefore we conclude that the left- and right-edge states are observed at τ = 0.75 and τ = 0.25 respectively.

In a e the averages of nodes 44 and 45 (bulk the color bars show \(2f{C}_{0}{{\mbox{Re}}}\left\{\left[{Z}_{44}\left(\omega \right)+{Z}_{45}\left(\omega \right)\right]/2\right\}\)) are shown where f C 0 and Z n (ω) are the frequency the normalizing capacitance and the impedance at ω on node n. b f show impedance maps on node 1 (left-edge the color bars show \(2f{C}_{0}{{\mbox{Re}}}\left[{Z}_{1}\left(\omega \right)\right]\)). c g Show impedance maps on node 89 (right edge the color bars show \(2f{C}_{0}{{\mbox{Re}}}\left[{Z}_{89}\left(\omega \right)\right]\)). The dashed lines in a–c and e–g are the pseudo-Fermi energy. Full size image

The topological phase transition implies the change of the behaviors of edge states. To see this we invert the sign of t c as \(0.1\to -0.1\). The results are shown in Fig. 2e–g. As in the case of t c = 0.1 we observe the gap around 0.96(ω 0 /ω)2 in the bulk [white horizontal dashed line (Fig. 2e). Contrary to the case of t c = 0.1 there are states at τ = 0.25 for the left-edge (Fig. 2f) and at τ = 0.75 for the right-edge (Fig. 2g) at 0.96(ω 0 /ω)2 (white horizontal dashed line Fig. 2f g) respectively. Figure 2h shows the impedance spectra of the three cases at τ = 0.25. We clearly observe the strong peak in the impedance of the left-edge state and small impedances of the right-edge state and the bulk state. Thus the left- and right- edge states are observed at τ = 0.25 and τ = 0.75 respectively. This means that the locations of edge states have flipped by the topological transition from t c = 0.1 to −0.1.

Here we deduce the topological numbers of the edge states I edge . We assume the “virtual Fermi energy” in the gap of 0.96(ω 0 /ω)2 (white horizontal dashed line Fig. 2a–c e–g). In the case of t c = 0.1 as τ increases eigenvalues of the right-edge state decrease across the virtual Fermi energy at τ = 0.25 i.e. the right-edge state becomes occupied. Likewise eigenvalues of the left-edge state increase across the virtual Fermi energy at τ = 0.75 i.e. the right-edge state becomes unoccupied. According to the theory of the topological pumping13 \({I}_{{{{{\rm{edge}}}}}}=1\) is determined from the edge state for the case of t c = 0.1. On the contrary the left-edge state becomes occupied at τ = 0.25 and the right-edge state becomes unoccupied at τ = 0.75 when t c is inverted as \(0.1\to -0.1\). Thus \({I}_{{{{{\rm{edge}}}}}}=-1\) is determined for the case t c = −0.1.

We note that our result is consistent with the behavior of the massive Dirac fermion36. Theoretically the edge state has a linear dispersion in a bulk gap when the gap is opened which is the feature of the massive Dirac fermion363738. The similar feature is observed in our experiment. The edge states in our experiment have approximately linear dispersions crossing the virtual Fermi energy and the sign of the derivative of the dispersions on τ at the same node is inverted in the topological transition.

Observation of bulk Chern numbers in the topological phase transition

In the previous section we observed the topological phase transition by the edge states under the OBC. Here we extract the bulk Chern numbers from experimental impedance spectra of the Hofstadter butterfly under the PBC by employing Středa’s formula. We will show that the bulk Chern numbers are consistent with topological numbers obtained from the edge states.

We vary the flux parameter ϕ = p/q where the integer p is varied from 1 to 88 with q = 89 fixed. For each p impedance spectra for all N = 89 nodes are measured. The details of the measurements are presented in Methods. We have experimentally measured the impedance spectra \(2f{C}_{0}\mathop{\sum }

olimits_{n=1}^{89}{{{{\rm{Re}}}}}\left[{Z}_{n}\left(\omega \right)\right]\). The impedance spectra for all p values are mapped in Fig. 3a c e for t c = 0 0.1 and −0.1 respectively. Clear contrast of high impedance (bright color) to low impedance (dark color) is observed even in regions of higher-order gaps of the Hofstadter butterfly spectra. In the case of t c = 0 the Hofstadter butterfly map is symmetric with respect to \(\phi {{{{\rm{=}}}}}1{{{{\rm{/}}}}}2\). In the case of t c = 0.1 the center gap opens at ϕ = 1/2 and the large gap runs from the left to the right upwards (Fig. 3c). When the sign of the t c is inverted the connection of the center gap of the Hofstadter butterfly switches and the large gap runs from the left to the right downwards (Fig. 3e). The butterfly spectra are well reproduced by numerical calculations and the circuit simulations (see Supplementary Note 2).

In a c e the color bars show \(2f{C}_{0}{\sum }_{n=1}^{89}{{\mbox{Re}}}\left[{Z}_{n}\left(\omega \right)\right]\) where f C 0 and Z n (ω) are the frequency the normalizing capacitance and the impedance at ω on node n. The label in each of the maps in c e represents the Chern number of the gap determined from d f. Each value of \({\sum }_{i}^{{{\prime} }}{A}_{i}/\mathop{\sum}

olimits_{i}{A}_{i}\) in d and f is obtained by the linear approximation from the corresponding hatched range of ϕ. Full size image

To extract the bulk Chen number \({C}_{{{{{\rm{bulk}}}}}}\) we employ the Středa’s formula39 ΔIDS/Δϕ = C bulk  where IDS represents the integrated density of states which is the number of eigenvalues below the target gap divided by the total number of eigenvalues. For the lossless case each eigenstate in principle appears as a peak in the impedance spectrum. However in the presence of resistive loss some of the eigenstates having a finite bandwidth are overlapped in a peak of the impedance. In order to count the number of eigenstates we fit the spectra of \(2f{C}_{0}\mathop{\sum }

olimits_{n=1}^{89}{{{{\rm{Re}}}}}\left[{Z}_{n}\left(\omega \right)\right]\) by using the Lorentzian function of \({\sum }_{{{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}}{A}_{{{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}}\frac{{a}_{i}}{{\pi }^{2}{\left[{\left({\omega }_{0}/\omega \right)}^{2}-{\left({\omega }_{0}/{\omega }_{{{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}}\right)}^{2}\right]}^{2}+{a}_{i}^{2}}\) where A i  a i  and ω i represent the area of the Lorentzian the half width at half maximum and the peak angular frequency ω i of the ith peak. Thus the number of eigenstates in a peak is counted by A i even when some of those eigenstates are overlapped or degenerated. Therefore \({\sum }_{i}^{{\prime} }{A}_{i}/\mathop{\sum}

olimits_{i}{A}_{i}\) equivalently corresponds to the IDS where Σ’ indicates the summation below the gap we consider. Examples of the approximated spectra are shown in the Supplementary Note 3. The least square method was used for the approximation of the Lorentzian curves where the number and positions of spectral peaks are determined by the function findpeaks of MATLAB40 with A i and a i being fitting parameters. First we verify the derivation of bulk Chern numbers in the specific gaps of the butterfly using t c = 0 which are indicated by labels in Fig. 3a. The ϕ dependence of \({\sum }_{i}^{{\prime} }{A}_{i}/\mathop{\sum}

olimits_{i}{A}_{i}\) below the target gaps is shown in the top panel of Fig. 3b. The bottom panel of Fig. 3b shows the residual of the approximation mentioned above where the residual is calculated by integrating the deviation of the fitting curve from the experimental curve along (ω 0 /ω)2 with respect to the corresponding experimental area for each ϕ. In Fig. 3b we observe that \({\sum }_{i}^{{\prime} }{A}_{i}/\mathop{\sum}

olimits_{i}{A}_{i}\) exhibits a symmetric set of linear lines over the range of ϕ. This is the Wannier diagram41 and its global features are reproduced experimentally. Table 1 shows the summary of measured \(\frac{\Delta }{\Delta \phi }\left({\Sigma }^{{\prime} }{A}_{i}/\Sigma {A}_{i}\right)\) for each gap where \(\Delta \phi =1/89\). We have retrieved the experimental values using linear functions from the hatched range of ϕ (\(5/89\le \phi \le 16/8973/89\le \phi \le 85/89\)) where the residual of the spectra approximation is less than 0.05 (bottom panel of Fig. 2b). The experimental values (the 2nd row in Table 1) are almost integers for the gaps which are consistent with the theoretical values25 (the 3rd row in Table 1). Therefore deducing Chern numbers up to ±3 is confirmed. The deviation of the experimental values from the theoretical values may attribute to the accuracy of the accumulation \({\Sigma }^{{\prime} }{A}_{i}\) below the gap i.e. high accuracy is obtained when the target gaps are located below 0.96 (ω 0 /ω)2 (the subscripts of labels are b and c) for Chern numbers of ±1 ±1 ±2 and ±3. We note that the residual is not small out of the hatched range of ϕ [bottom panel of Fig. 2b]. This can be related to the number of spectral peaks in the Lorentzian approximation. Namely within the hatched region e.g. at \(\phi =10/89\) the Lorentzian approximation has 9 peaks and excellently agrees with the experimental spectrum (See Supplementary Fig. 3a). On the other hand at \(\phi =30/89\) which is out of the hatched region the Lorentzian approximation has only 3 peaks and the discrepancy of the approximation curve from the experimental curve in the spectrum is pronounced (See Supplementary Fig. 3c).

For others it has been an opportunity. Amid Western sanctions and a flood of Western companies exiting the Russian market Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin made an emotional appeal to the country’s IT community in April urging them “not to fear anything” stay in Russia and help to build a new sovereign internet. Vladimir Zykov was one of those who answered the call. “We heard Mishustin and we did it"" said Zykov director of projects for IT firm Digital Platforms who was behind the creation of NashStore a self-styled Russian alternative to Google Play. NashStore is one of a host of domestic tech analogues seeking to replace Western firms forced out of Russia by Kremlin bans or international sanctions. Experts however are skeptical that domestic alternatives are viable in the long term — or whether Russia’s current IT sector can muster the know-how to create a “sovereign internet” that can operate on its own terms.

“It's just a bunch of bull**** propaganda” said Mikhail Klimarev the head of Russia’s Internet Protection Society which is linked to opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Other analogues that have been set up include RuTube Russia’s answer to YouTube; Tamtam a copy of messaging app Telegram; and Rossgram an app that describes itself as Russia’s version of Instagram. All have experienced significant teething problems. While Google Play still operates in Russia Alphabet which owns Google Play suspended all payment-based services for its platforms in Russia — meaning Russian users have been unable to pay for apps since March. Apps for sanctioned Russian companies are also not available. Mishustin ordered Russia's Ministry of Digital Development Communication and Mass Media to create a domestic equivalent of Google Play by June 1. That said Zykov opened the door for NashStore (“Our Store”) which is described as “sanction-proof” on its website. “Our goal is to make a multi-functional and convenient app store” Zykov told The Moscow Times. “We’re at the very beginning. But you can already see that our platform is designed to be more modern than Google Play.” NashStore was launched on May 9 a day of patriotic celebrations in Russia marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Digital Platforms lists five government ministries among its partners and Mishustin’s order means officials have been keen to see Google Play alternatives get off the ground. But ties to the state also have drawbacks.

RuStore

Just half an hour after its May launch NashStore went offline amid a DDoS attack in which the company claimed more than million bots flooded its servers. Zykov said NashStore was targeted because of state support but that he was grateful for the disruption — any publicity he said is good for business. Perhaps more importantly NashStore is facing competition from other Russian firms — also with state support — seeking to create a similar product. An app store called RuMarket was opened in April and Russian internet giant VK launched RuStore the following month in conjunction with state-owned lender Sberbank cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab and tech giant Yandex. With the involvement of major Russian companies RuStore appears likely to be chosen by the government as the official Russian alternative to Google Play. Zykov said that the Ministry of Digital Development Communication and Mass Media ditched NashStore in favor of its VK rival without any warning. “It’s an unpleasant story I don’t understand why they did it” he said. The government introduced legislation to the State Duma earlier this month that would mandate the creation of a Russian app store and oblige it to be installed on all smartphones and other electronic devices. The legislation was fast tracked as an amendment to a new bill on data protection and will likely be passed into law in the coming weeks.

But even if tech companies can secure state support they do not necessarily have the know-how to successfully bring products to market — at least not quickly. Instagram replacement Rossgram was founded after Russia’s media censor Roskomnadzor blocked access to the U.S.-based company in March — but the app still hasn’t launched. RuStore remains in beta testing and is not expected to launch fully until toward the end of the year according to VK head Vladimir Kiriyenko. On NashStore’s opening day users were told to download the app via Yandex Disk a cloud sharing platform but the company’s developers did not purchase a business account from Yandex — meaning downloads were capped at 1000 and hundreds of potential customers were unable to access the software. Even those who managed to sign up found their choices limited. While Apple’s App Store has 4 million apps and Google Play has 25 million the number of apps on NashStore is closer to 1000. RuStore has even fewer.

Why trust us?

Apple’s AirPods Max are a remarkable set of wireless headphones. They have superb noise cancellation their ambient/transparency mode is the best you can get and despite being one of the heaviest headphones on the market they are surprisingly comfortable. But Apple has yet to address the AirPods Max’s greatest weakness: they’re a $549 set of headphones that only work with compressed lossy digital audio.

What’s that have to do with USB-C? Everything.

The great digital divide

The AirPods Max’s problem in a nutshell is the way they deal with audio connections. At issue is the fact that even though the Apple Music streaming service now offers most songs in lossless audio — in some cases at a hi-res audio level of 24-bit/192kHz — there’s no way to hear the full quality of these lossless tracks on the AirPods Max.

If you listen wirelessly the headphones rely on the AAC Bluetooth codec. AAC sounds pretty good all things considered. But it’s still a lossy codec which means a fair amount of the information and detail contained in a CD-quality (or better) recording has to be discarded in order to make the audio stream small enough to be transported over Bluetooth.

This isn’t a situation unique to Apple’s headphones. All Bluetooth headphones so far must use lossy compression — even if they’re equipped with a very high quality codec like Sony’s LDAC or Qualcomm’s aptX HD.

The difference is that other headphone companies acknowledge this limitation by offering users a wired connection (sometimes analog sometimes digital) that lets them get around lossy compression by going direct to the source. Want lossless? You need a wired connection.

The AirPods Max have an optional wired connection too but it has to be the strangest wired connection in the headphone industry. Instead of piping analog audio straight into the headphone’s drivers so that you can use an external headphone amp and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) of your choosing and instead of using a direct digital connection so that you can feed the headphone’s internal DAC/amp with an unadulterated lossless digital signal Apple has used a bizarre hybrid approach.

Its $35 Lightning-to-3.5mm audio cable takes an analog signal from your source device then converts it into a digital signal before finally converting it back into an analog signal. (And yes you read that right — you have to buy that cable separately.) It’s a process that Apple has acknowledged is less than ideal when it comes to listening to lossless music saying “given the analog-to-digital conversion in the cable the playback will not be completely lossless.”

USB-C to the rescue?

This illogical state of affairs raises the question of why does it exist in the first place? And what (if anything) can Apple do to fix it? I have some theories.

First let’s get some tech stuff out of the way.

Apple’s Lightning port can’t send analog signals. We know this because if you want to use a set of analog headphones with any iPhone newer than the iPhone 7 you’ll need a Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone adapter. And if it can’t send analog signals it follows that it can’t receive them either.

This explains why the Lightning-to-3.5mm audio cable does its analog-to-digital conversion — the signal going into the AirPods Max’s lighting port must be digital.

Apple could sell a Lightning-to-Lightning cable to deliver that digital signal but it has never opted to do so perhaps because you’d need a USB-A and USB-C adapter to use that cable with Apple’s other products and that starts to get messy. And Apple is all about simplicity not messiness.

If only there were a single compact fully reversible connector that can handle both analog and digital audio signals the AirPods Max’s woes would finally be put to rest. Oh wait there is: it’s called USB-C.

USB-C is incredibly dexterous. With the right hardware behind it it can deliver up to 90 watts of power. It can act as the interface for Thunderbolt 3/4 devices with up to 40Gbps of bandwidth. And yes it can manage analog and digital audio.

It’s already being used by the Master & Dynamic MW75 and the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 in both digital and analog capacities so this isn’t just theory — it works. And if Apple incorporated it into the next AirPods Max it would give folks the best of both wired worlds: analog when people already own headphone DAC/amps that they love and digital for when they’re content to let the headphones’ built-in circuitry do the heavy lifting.

Will Apple add USB-C to the next AirPods Max?

That’s the million-dollar question and I think the answer is yes. But it might not happen as soon as we’d all like. Despite rolling over and adding USB-C to its MacBook Air MacBook Pro and select iPad models Apple has resisted switching from its proprietary Lightning connection to USB-C on the iPhone.

Pressure from the European Union makes that switch inevitable but not immediate. Most Apple watchers think the iPhone 14 widely expected to be announced in the fall will still have a Lightning port.

So that makes the iPhone 15 the most likely candidate to get the USB-C port. Assuming Apple’s historical pattern of releasing a new iPhone every fall holds that means 2023 will be the end of the line for Lightning-equipped iPhones. When that happens there’s virtually no reason for Apple to keep using its proprietary port on any device finally paving the way for an AirPods Max with USB-C.

What about lossless audio via wireless?

With the first headphones to use Qualcomm’s aptX Lossless Bluetooth codec now in the wild we have officially entered a new era for portable wireless sound quality. But if you’re hoping that Apple will add aptX Lossless to the AirPods Max while we wait for USB-C I suspect you’ll be disappointed.

Apple has never licensed any aptX codecs from Qualcomm for the iPhone or any of its AirPods family of wireless earbuds and headphones and I don’t expect that to change any time soon. It is however conceivable that Apple will do what Apple loves doing and create a version of its AirPlay wireless technology that supports lossless audio on wireless headphones.

At the moment AirPlay 2 supports lossless music up to 24-bit/48kHz but only over Wi-Fi connections not Bluetooth. A Bluetooth-compatible version of AirPlay would certainly create some interesting opportunities but if Apple is indeed working on such a strategy it’s likely further down its road map for the AirPods Max than USB-C.

This was the first such experiment ever performed on a rocket.

This deorbiting sail is developed by the Institute 805 of the Shanghai Academy of Spacecraft Technology (SAST) allowing a dysfunctional or a ‘dead’ spacecraft to leave orbit sooner to contain the spread of space debris.

It was installed on the payload capsule of the Long March-2D Y64 carrier rocket that was launched into space on June 23 and unfurled in orbit on June 26 according to the SAST.

The sail is a kite-like sheet that stretches up to 25 square meters and has a thickness of one-tenth the diameter of a hair according to the SAST developers.

Once unfolded the sail increases the drag acting on the spacecraft which is why it is also called the ‘drag’ sail thereby decelerating the spacecraft until it is moved out of its orbit which will burn up within the Earth’s atmosphere within a few years.

“The thin sail uses aerodynamic resistance formed by the thin atmosphere of the low-orbit environment to decelerate the satellite and gradually leave the original orbit slowly” the SAST developers explained to the Global Times.

According to SAST developers their sail can enable a 300-kilogram payload capsule to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere within two years. It allows for a much faster deorbiting process which could otherwise take hundreds of years.

Threat From Orbital Debris In The Space

If deorbiting measures are not taken the satellites can last for hundreds of years in space until their service is over posing a threat to other active in-orbit spacecraft.

A famous example is a collision between the ‘Iridium 33’ an American active commercial satellite and the dysfunctional Cosmos 2251 of the Soviet Union in 2009. The two satellites collided at a speed of 41843 kph at an altitude of 789 kilometers above Siberia.

The crash resulted in 2300 pieces of large trackable debris and countless smaller debris scattering across more than a thousand kilometers in space causing problems for subsequent space programs.

According to the European Space Agency (ESA) an estimated 13100 satellites have been launched into orbit since 1957 with 8410 remaining in space and 5800 still functioning.

In addition up to 27000 smaller pieces of debris are also being tracked by NASA congested in the orbit zone and traveling extremely fast—25266.70 kph in low-Earth orbit (LEO).

The total mass of all objects in orbit is around 9900 tons while the statistical model suggests 130 million pieces of debris are from 1mm to 1cm in size.

Dangerous Encounters With Space Debris

In March 2022 a leftover piece of a Chinese Long March 3C rocket slammed into the Moon creating a 65 feet wide crater on the lunar surface. If this piece had hit the International Space Station (instead) it could have led to disastrous consequences.

For example in November 2021 the ISS was forced to perform a maneuver to avoid a piece of debris from the now-defunct Chinese Fengyun-1C weather satellite that China destroyed in its 2007 anti-satellite missile test.

The satellite had exploded into more than 3500 pieces of debris most of which fell into the ISS’ orbital region.

Similarly even Russia had destroyed one of its defunct Soviet-era satellites the Cosmos 1408 in an anti-satellite weapon test in November 2021 creating a field of at least 1500 trackable pieces of debris in low orbit that forced the ISS crew to take cover multiple times as the station’s orbit intersected with the junk.

The latest instance of ISS’ avoidance maneuver was on June 16 when the ISS crew had to conduct a complicated maneuver to avoid being hit by orbital debris from the Kosmos-1408.

Till August 2020 the ISS has had to perform 27 collision avoidance maneuvers since 1999.

Despite these maneuvers a piece of space junk hit the robotic arm of the ISS provided by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) the Canadarm2 causing a hole of 5mm diameter as was noticed during a routine inspection in May 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple CEO Tim Cook allegedly took time out from the annual Sun Valley conference to take a trip in a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle.

A repeat visitor to the Allen & Co Sun Valley media retreat Tim Cook takes time to speak to the chiefs of other major companies in attendance with the event used to share ideas and to broker deals. In one excursion Cook seemingly checked out a product by a potential competitor in the automotive space.

According to people familiar with the event speaking to Bloomberg Cook was seen taking a ride in a green Rivian electric pickup truck in downtown Sun Valley on Thursday. Cook's use of the vehicle allegedly ferried the Apple CEO from the Sun Valley Resort to a downtown location for dinner.

Rivian CEO and founder R.J. Scaringe attended the retreat and brought along two electric vehicles with him. Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone was reportedly one of the dozens of attendees who inspected the vehicles over the course of the event.

It is likely that Cook used the opportunity to check out a major rival to Apple's own automotive plans as the company has been working on its own Apple Car project for quite some time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmltb3JlLmNvbS9hcHBsZS1jZW8tdGltLWNvb2stc3BvdHRlZC1yaWRpbmctcml2aWFuLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLXN1bW1lci1jYW1w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple CEO Tim Cook spotted riding in a Rivian at billionaire summer camp,"Rivian (Image credit: Rivian)

What you need to know

Apple CEO Tim Cook is attending Allen & Co.'s Sun Valley Conference in Idaho.

He took a ride in a Rivian R1T downtown for dinner.

Apple is reportedly working on its own electric vehicle.

Apple CEO Tim Cook hitched a ride in a Rivian R1T while in attendance at Allen & Co.'s Sun Valley Conference in Idaho this week as Apple is rumored to be producing an electric car of its own.

As reported by Bloomberg:

Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook was spotted in downtown Sun Valley Thursday taking a ride in a Rivian Automotive Inc. battery-electric pickup.The chief executive officer borrowed the metallic green R1T while attending Allen & Co.'s Sun Valley Conference in Idaho according to people familiar with the matter. Cook and others took the vehicle from the Sun Valley Resort where the conference is held downtown for dinner the people said asking not to be identified.

Rivian founder and CEO R.J. Scaringe is also in attendance at the conference and brought not one but two Rivians with him and R1T and the R1S presumably so all of the world's richest leaders could get a good look at the burgeoning EVs.

The news is interesting because Rivian is a prospective rival not only of Tesla but also Apple's own rumored Apple Car which is supposedly targeting a launch in 2025. Project Titan is one of Apple's worst-kept secrets with reports indicating the company plans to launch an autonomous electric vehicle.

At WWDC 2022 the company unveiled its next generation of CarPlay alongside iOS 16 which promises to take over the entire dashboard of compatible vehicles with a wealth of information from your car and iPhone.

Inside away from the elements Mr. Gaesser pondered what the coming year might bring for farmers.

As tractors and planters throughout the Midwest rolled into fields like the ones near his house earlier this year Mr. Gaesser 69 was hopeful that soaring grain prices and heightened global demand for food would translate into robust revenues. But he also expected that sharply higher costs for fuel fertilizer and other necessities would cut deeply into profits.

And then there is Big Food.

Companies like PepsiCo Cargill Walmart and General Mills are trying to convince farmers like Mr. Gaesser to adopt new climate-friendly agricultural techniques through a variety of financial incentives and programs. They have good reason. Together these companies have pledged that at least 70 million acres or roughly 18 percent of the nation’s total cropland an area about the size of Nevada will be operated using regenerative agriculture techniques by 2030.

Through photosynthesis plants — whether corn or trees — convert carbon dioxide from the air into energy that is stored in the soil. Regenerative farming techniques such as planting a cover crop during the fall allows that process to continue throughout the winter months when the soil would normally be bare.",,,,,,,,,,,,

On the podcast Krystal Kyle and Friends Peterson explained to Kyle Kulinski why Page remains the focus of his ire.

“See I would’ve left Ellen Page alone if she hadn’t been parading her new abs in a fashion magazine” he said continuously misgendering Page by using his dead name and his old pronouns.

“How many kids do you think she convinced to convert? One? A thousand?” Peterson asked.

He was referring to Page’s turn as Esquire’s cover star in June. The Umbrella Academy actor showed off his new physique in several photos some of them shirtless and talked about how comfortable he feels working out in his new body.

For Peterson it’s all tantamount to “social contagion.”

“She has the responsibility not to entice confused adolescents into a catastrophic decision before they have the maturity to make that decision” he said.

The University of Toronto psychology professor—who has developed quite a following among the “intellectual” right—was suspended from Twitter after tweeting that Page “had her breasts removed by a criminal physician” on June 22. According to screenshots of his account shared on social media the platform flagged the post as “hateful conduct” and barred him from posting until he agreed to delete it.

The suspension even drew criticism from Elon Musk who said the platform has gone “way too far in squashing dissenting opinions.”

Kyle said the tweet got Peterson in “trouble” but the professor downplayed the importance of his suspension.

“Well I don’t know if it got me in trouble you know I don’t think I’m in trouble Twitter banned me but I don’t consider that trouble” Peterson said.

Kyle argued that trans people are going through the same kind of persecution that gay people did during their fight for acceptance prompting Peterson to interrupt him.

“You’re utterly wrong” he said. “There’s nothing about that that’s right.”

He brought up Canada’s 2017 law that added “gender identity or expression” to a section of the criminal code targeting hate speech defined as inciting hatred and advocating for genocide. The anti-discrimination law “might” make it a crime to “repeatedly consistently refuses to use a person’s chosen pronoun” a University of Toronto law professor told the CBC.

Jordan B. Peterson is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto a clinical psychologist a public speaker and a creator of Self Authoring. Romy Arroyo Fernandez

Not one to be silenced Peterson continued to rage against Page on Kyle’s podcast. Amid a flurry of typical anti-trans attacks the professor expressed concern that the Canadian law would usher in a state of mass panic and uncertainty.

“For every one person of that sort that we hypothetically save we doom a thousand more as a consequence of confusion and social contagion” he said.

“Often when you introduce social confusion you can produce a psychogenic epidemic. Generally it’s adolescent females who are more susceptible to it” he added. “It’s absolutely and definitely the case that we’ve doomed thousands of kids to brutal mutilating surgery and premature sterility and we’ve done that on the altar of our hypothetical moral virtue and compassion.”

Kyle who continuously argued that adults should be able to choose what they do with their bodies called Peterson out for his “moral panic” sending the frazzled professor into another impassioned diatribe.

When temperatures do rise having a fan that oscillates makes all the difference — especially if you have a small portable air conditioner that needs help circulating air or worst of all no air conditioning (or ceiling fan) at all.

Oscillation moves fans from side to side and the best oscillating fans also move up and down. The rotation helps better move air around. It’s the most inexpensive yet effective way of cooling your home. You’re probably most familiar with a tabletop oscillating fan but pedestal and tower fans have larger coverage areas. Mounted fans may be better for households with kids and pets although there are plenty of bladeless models. Keep an eye out for ones with heating capabilities that can stay in use in the winter as well as fans with ionizers that can keep out allergens and dust. Remote controls are also helpful since you don’t have to get up to operate the fan from bed.

Today's Top Deals

Tower fans are generally considered the best oscillating fans due to the vents that run along the entire body of the fan enabling better airflow.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Gallagher & Co.'s (NYSE:AJG) Stock?,"Most readers would already be aware that Arthur J. Gallagher's (NYSE:AJG) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically we decided to study Arthur J. Gallagher's ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

See our latest analysis for Arthur J. Gallagher

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Arthur J. Gallagher is:

12% = US$987m ÷ US$8.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has the company made $0.12 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"" we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged the higher the ROE and profit retention the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

Arthur J. Gallagher's Earnings Growth And 12% ROE

To begin with Arthur J. Gallagher seems to have a respectable ROE. Further the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. Consequently this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 15% seen over the past five years by Arthur J. Gallagher.

As a next step we compared Arthur J. Gallagher's net income growth with the industry and pleasingly we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AJG worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether AJG is currently mispriced by the market.

Is Arthur J. Gallagher Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Arthur J. Gallagher has a three-year median payout ratio of 45% which implies that it retains the remaining 55% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered and given the decent growth seen by the company it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Besides Arthur J. Gallagher has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. As a result the expected drop in Arthur J. Gallagher's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 15% over the same period.

Summary

In total we are pretty happy with Arthur J. Gallagher's performance. Particularly we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Elena Rybakina n'en revenait pas. Après avoir su inverser la tendance face à Ons Jabeur la Kazakhe a remporté ce samedi à Wimbledon son tout premier titre en Grand Chelem. Alors qu'elle n'a pas exprimé sa joie de manière spontanée à l'issue de la rencontre et lors de la remise du trophée la native de Moscou a confié qu'une fois le match conclu elle était « juste super contente qu'il se termine ». Incrédule Elena Rybakina a admis en conférence de presse que « ces deux semaines ont été tellement imprévisibles » et qu'elle ne croyait pas avoir pu s'imposer en finale sur le Centre Court. Assurant qu'elle est « toujours très calme » la Kazakhe a admis qu'elle était « sous le choc » à la fin de cette finale. « Je savais au fond de moi que je pouvais le faire. Mais en même temps c'était trop d'émotions a ajouté Elena Rybakina. J'essayais juste de rester calme. Peut-être qu'un jour vous verrez une énorme réaction de ma part mais malheureusement pas aujourd'hui (samedi). »



Rybakina : « J'ai plus apprécié la demi-finale »

Interrogée sur sa capacité à profiter de cette finale la Kazakhe a confié que ce n'était pas forcément le cas. « Je n'ai pas apprécié autant que j'aurais dû. J'ai plus apprécié la demi-finale a-t-elle déclaré face à la presse. Je ne sais pas pourquoi. Peut-être parce que j'avais très bien joué. Mais bien sûr je me souviendrai toute ma vie de cette journée ! » A l'issue d'un parcours quasiment sans faute avec des succès face à Bianca Andreescu Ajla Tomljanovic ou Simona Halep pour se hisser en finale Elena Rybakina a confié avoir prouvé « qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire d'avoir une grande équipe dès le plus jeune âge ». « Tout le monde peut y arriver quelle que soit sa situation financière. Mes parents ont toujours cru en moi. Ils ont d'abord voulu que je m'amuse sur le court ce que j'ai toujours fait.

Un casque conçu pour fendre l'air et assurer une excellente ventilation tout en conservant bien sûr le confort et la sécurité. La coque intérieure de l'Egos se distingue par la présence de sa principale caractéristique DUAL DENSITY.

S'il ne sera commercialisé qu'à compter du mois de septembre la marque italienne fournit déjà des informations sur ce nouveau modèle qui vient enrichir une gamme déjà large.

Les plus observateurs d'entre vous auront sans doute remarqué que les coureurs du Team Bahrain Victorius utilisent depuis le début de ce Tour de France un tout nouveau casque l'EGOS.

Source : communiqué de presse

Cette technologie DUAL DENSITY confère au casque une double fonction. S a forme permet une plus grande ventilation au sommet de la tête assurant ainsi une plus grande sensation de confort pour le cycliste.

Sa structure en revanche se caractérise par une densité plus douce que la coque intérieure assurant ainsi une meilleure absorption des chocs et réduisant le poids du casque.

La sécurité et le confort sont également améliorés par les nouveaux DEVIDER et FID LOCK. Le nouveau Divider est une évolution du précédent et permet grâce à sa géométrie au cycliste de régler la sangle une seule fois et ainsi de conserver une position constante et parfaite pendant toute la sortie.

La nouvelle fermeture à sangle quant à elle a été conçue pour être plus rapide et plus sûre grâce à un système de fixation magnétique FIDLOCK pratique et sécurisé. Egos intègre les dernières innovations conçues par le Département Produit pour améliorer le confort des cyclistes. AIRFRAME BAND est un spoiler positionné à l'avant du casque en contact avec le front et caché par le casque. Cette bande permet de canaliser le flux d'air à l'intérieur du casque facilitant ainsi la ventilation et le refroidissement optimal de la tête.

Disponible en 3 tailles (S M et L) Egos est équipé du nouveau système anti-dérapant RSR11 pour un ajustement optimal grâce à sa structure enveloppante et ses réglages micrométriques en hauteur et en largeur.

Egos est également équipé d'un nouveau rembourrage et d'un rembourrage anti-insectes avec moustiquaire. Deux autocollants réfléchissants sont positionnés à l'arrière du casque pour une visibilité accrue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZXRlbGVncmFtbWUuZnIvY290ZXMtZC1hcm1vci9zYWludC1icmlldWMtMjIwMDAvbGUtZ3JvdXBlLWQtZW50cmFpZGUtbXV0dWVsbGUtYnJpb2NoaW4tdGkta2Vud2FsbGVyLXNlLXJlbm91dmVsbGUtZW4tMjAyMi0yOTIxNjEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Le groupe d'entraide mutuelle briochin Ti Kenwaller se renouvelle en 2022,"Le groupe d’entraide mutuelle (GEM) Ti Kenwaller qui s’occupe d’apporter soutien et activités aux personnes cérébro-lésées ou victimes de traumas crâniens tenait son assemblée générale ce jeudi 7 juillet faisant le point sur une année 2021 marquée par la crise sanitaire et des départs internes.

They were in:

Near Brookville in southeastern Indiana’s Franklin County. Emergency Management Agency officials here confirm this was “a small tornado” according to the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office.

Reily Township in Butler County

Morrow area of Warren County.

Rotation was detected on radar in all of these areas confirms Jim Lott a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.

NWS received damage reports in these locations as well he said early Wednesday mostly downed trees and wires.

Roofs were ripped off homes and barns in Franklin County he confirmed.

The weather service plans to send a team out to survey as many tornado-suspected areas as possible on Wednesday he said.

However they will be somewhat limited because more severe weather is expected Wednesday night.

Right now they plan to go first to Warren County and then to Franklin and Butler counties if they have time NWS said at 7 a.m. Wednesday.

Damage from a possible tornado was also reported in the Clarksville area of Clinton County along U.S. 22 and State Route 350 according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Wilmington post.

NWS said they could not confirm that because they’ve had no overnight reports of damage in that county.

Power outages were approaching 1000 at midnight but now are down to 635 Duke Energy customers mostly in Warren County according to the utility’s website.

A tree fell into two homes on Hayden Drive in Greenhills according to the NWS and Greenhills police.

It happened about 10:30 p.m. in the 40 block of Hayden Drive police say.

It fell into one house first damaging it to the point water came in and then fell onto the second house.

Neither family had to evacuated and no injuries were reported police say.

In Warren County FOX19 NOW Reporter Courtney King said a tree fell on a house in Morrow on Thompson Street.

The homeowner said the tree didn’t cause major damage but the home’s power was out.

People were asked to avoid dark areas due to downed powerlines.

FOX19 NOW Chief Meteorologist Steve Horstmeyer said there were reports from law enforcement about downed trees and arcing power lines on Indiana State Route 101 north of Brookville.

There were also reports of roofs blown off houses near the state line in Bath and a campground “totally destroyed” on State Route 101.

Standing water was reported at around 11 p.m. on northbound Interstate 75 near Cincinnati backing up traffic.

Cincinnati firefighter Kirsten Worth rescued one person from a car submerged in high water on Yoast Avenue in North Fairmont.

“Our firefighters have responded to dozens of storm-related calls tonight fortunately only minor injuries have been reported so far” Cincy Fire & EMS said on social media.

But on board the 12-year-old girl quaked with fear.

The captain and crew who she says had tortured her and three other women and girls were not finished. And the punishment for disobedience the men warned would be death.

It was the third night that the girl and around 140 other ethnic Rohingya refugees had been trapped on the wooden fishing boat floating off the coast of Indonesia. These children women and men had fled Bangladesh and their homeland of Myanmar in a bid to escape violence and terror only to face the same horrors with a crew that seemed to delight in their dread.

Huddled among the other women and girls the 12-year-old — identified in this story only by the initial N because she is a sexual assault survivor — tried to hide her face. She had already survived a night in the captain’s bedroom where she says he and several crew members had beaten and sexually abused her.

Like most of the passengers she had survived attacks by Myanmar’s military that forced her and her family to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. There she had survived nearly seven years in violence-plagued refugee camps. And she had thus far survived this journey without her family who hoped she’d make it to Malaysia where she was promised as a child bride to a man she had never met.

Her young life had been one long battle to survive. And so it seemed this night would be no different.

The captain was in a rage. He ordered more girls to join him and his crew in the bedroom.

No one budged.

“If you don’t come to us” the captain shouted “then we will capsize this boat!”

What happened next would force N and the other Rohingya on board into yet another battle for survival.

For many this would be the battle they finally lost.

____

In March Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from atop the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia’s northern province of Aceh. Another 67 passengers including at least 28 children had been killed when the boat capsized according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Until now little was known about how the boat capsized or why. This account as told to The Associated Press in separate interviews with eight surviving passengers provides the first insight into what happened on board and why so many died. The men women and children interviewed include witnesses of the events leading to the capsize and of the sexual abuse as well as the only surviving sexual assault victim N.

The disaster is the latest in a string of tragedies to befall the Rohingya a stateless Muslim minority that suffered mass slaughter at the hands of Myanmar’s military in 2017 in what the United States has dubbed a genocide. Over the past two years the Rohingya have increasingly fled Bangladesh's refugee camps where gang violence and hunger has surged and Myanmar where a bloody conflict between the ruling military junta and ethnic rebel groups has escalated. Muslim-majority Malaysia which the Rohingya view as relatively safe is the preferred destination.

The results of this mass exodus have been catastrophic. Last year 4500 Rohingya — two-thirds of them women and children — fled Myanmar and Bangladesh by boat the UNHCR reported. Of those 569 died or went missing while crossing the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea the highest annual death toll since 2014.

International indifference toward the Rohingya has in many ways worsened the crisis. In several cases coastal countries in Asia have ignored pleas to rescue imperiled Rohingya boats despite international laws mandating the rescue of boats in distress. Global donations for the nearly 1 million Rohingya languishing in overcrowded camps have plummeted leading to slashed food rations. And no country is offering large-scale resettlement.

Most Rohingya understand the risks of taking to the sea. But those who board the vessels say the world has left them with little choice.

And so it was that N arrived one night in March at a remote beach in southern Bangladesh where she climbed into a small fishing boat that would take her away from everything she knew including her family.

Like an increasing number of underage Rohingya girls she had been promised as a wife to a man in Malaysia she’d spoken to only by phone. These marriages are rooted in desperation: Many parents in the camps can no longer feed their children or afford the traditional dowry demanded by grooms. The men in Malaysia forfeit dowries and often send money to the brides’ parents.

The fishing boat ferried N and her fellow passengers to a larger boat which took them deeper into the Bay of Bengal. One day later they were moved again to an even bigger boat with a crew from Myanmar.

For around a week they slid seamlessly through the sea. The crew was kind providing enough food and water. The children had space to play. The waves were placid. For Rahena Begum traveling with her 9-year-old daughter and 12- and 13-year-old sons it almost felt too easy.

Until suddenly it wasn’t.

The captain told those on board the plan had changed. They would need to transfer everyone to an Indonesian fishing boat with a crew who would take them the rest of the way to Indonesia. From there the passengers would be smuggled into neighboring Malaysia. Though the captain gave no reason for the switch the recent surge in Rohingya arrivals has put Indonesian authorities on alert for boats from Bangladesh and Myanmar.

The sight of the rickety Indonesian vessel sent a chill through the passengers. Muhammed Amin who had fished the waters off Bangladesh for years and spent countless hours on boats estimated the Indonesian vessel was built to accommodate at most 60 people — not 140.

But the Myanmar captain and crew he says reassured him the boat was safe and that it would reach Indonesia in one day.

Reluctantly Amin N Rahena and the others climbed into the Indonesian vessel. The Myanmar boat soon disappeared into the distance.

____

Almost immediately the Indonesian captain and crew separated the men from the women.

The men were forced into the boat’s cramped stifling cargo holds one of which was beneath the captain’s bedroom. Anyone who protested was beaten Amin says.

The captain and crew turned to the women and girls but they did not speak Indonesian and could not understand their demands.

A few Rohingya men who spoke the language were allowed out of the hold to translate. When the women understood what the captain wanted they began to cry.

The men told the crew to leave the women alone. The crew beat them and then beat the women.

Seventeen-year-old Samira whose husband was stuck in the hold became an early target. The captain and crew repeatedly ordered her into the bedroom. A relative of Samira’s Fatima Khatun told the tearful teen to say she was sick and used hand signals to explain to the captain that Samira was married. The crew moved on.

N however had no one to protect her. And she quickly caught the captain’s attention.

She was a child stuck in the middle of the ocean facing a group of men who warned they were armed though no one ever saw a gun.

She had no choice.

And so N and four other women and girls entered the bedroom.

It wasn’t long before the stillness of the night was shattered by their screams.

____

Through her terror N struggled to make sense of what was happening then struggled to make it stop. But inside the room there was no pity only pain.

One of the women managed to slip out but N and the others were trapped. Two of the girls were teenagers and the third around 20 N estimated. All were in tears.

The abuse by the captain and five of his six crew members lasted all night N says. Attempts to fight back were met with beatings.

From the cargo hold below the bedroom the men could hear the cries. Those who dared to climb onto the deck could see the abuse unfolding through the room’s windows. But believing the crew was armed they say they were powerless to stop them.

When morning finally dawned N spotted a man she knew and signaled to him for help. He approached the room and was beaten by the crew but persuaded the captain to let N out to use the toilet. She hid among the other women and hoped the captain was finished with her.

He was at least for the moment. But he and the crew were not done with the other three girls whose assaults continued for a second night.

In the sweltering hold 19-year-old Jannat Ullah’s yearning for fresh air grew so intense he risked climbing on deck. When he emerged he says he looked through the bedroom window and saw the captain raping one of the teens. A crew member spotted Jannat and slapped his head until he retreated. But later Jannat says he watched through a gap in the wall as another crew member raped the same girl.

The sun was rising again along with the passengers’ desperation. The crew had given them no water and only tiny portions of rice noodles and eggs. They wondered how much longer they could last.

Fatima Khatun sitting next to the captain’s room with her 8-year-old daughter Ruma had witnessed the abuse of the girls inside and could bear no more. She signaled through the window to the girls to come out.

At last that night they did emerging sobbing and speechless. Fatima and Samira told them to cover themselves with hijabs and tried to hide them.

It was then that the captain and crew began demanding fresh victims.

The women and girls refused. The crew kicked and punched them. The women wept but stood their ground.

The captain and crew had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana the passengers told the AP. The captain was growing angrier.

“If you don’t come into the room I will capsize this boat!” he thundered again and again.

Samira told herself he must be joking.

____

It was around 9 p.m. and many of the children had fallen asleep oblivious to the chaos. As Fatima fretted over the captain’s threats daughter Ruma slumbered against her arm.

Fed up with the hold Amin and Jannat had come up on deck. The captain Amin says looked drunk his body wobbly. The captain went to the toilet and then headed to the helm.

Which is when Jannat says he saw the captain push the steering wheel with his leg.

The vessel tilted violently sending passengers tumbling. And then it smashed into a wave.

___

In the blackness of the water people screamed for salvation for God for their children.

“RUMA!” Fatima cried searching wildly for her daughter who had been ripped away when the boat overturned. “RUMA!”

Fatima fought to stay afloat but the water was swallowing her as fast as she was swallowing the water.

Suddenly hands closed around her arm and yanked upwards. Passengers who had climbed on top of the overturned hull were pulling her to safety.

She screamed and screamed for her little girl. But Ruma was gone.

Jannat could hear his 7-year-old cousin Futika shouting from somewhere inside the boat. Frantic the teen swam back into the vessel and spotted Futika wedged with others inside the cargo hold. Jannat tried to yank him free again and again. But it was futile. Jannat swam out clambered onto the hull and wept.

Those who were drowning desperately clutched at others struggling in a sea that was fast becoming a graveyard. Among the dying were mothers and fathers sisters and brothers a 3-year-old boy and his parents.

Scores of passengers found themselves trapped under heavy fishing nets that ensnared them when the boat overturned. Women wailed for help that did not come.

N battled her way through the throngs until she made it onto the hull. Once again she had managed to survive.

But the three girls who were abused alongside her in the captain’s bedroom had not their battered bodies disappearing into the depths.

In the water Rahena Begum spotted her 9-year-old daughter Rema but her two sons were nowhere to be seen. Other passengers pushed Rahena and Rema onto the hull then began to pump the unresponsive child’s chest and water-swollen stomach. Suddenly Rema’s hand moved and she sputtered a few words.

Rahena pulled her daughter into her lap and cuddled her. Her baby was alive at least for now. So was her 13-year-old son who’d also made it onto the hull. But her 12-year-old boy Noor Aziz was missing. She would never see him again.

Amin knew they had to keep the vessel stable if they had any hope of surviving. He ordered the men to stand on the corners of the hull to try to balance the weight.

The crew meanwhile wanted to be anywhere but the boat. Amin spotted the captain and three crew members swimming away using water jugs as flotation devices. The remaining three crew tried to follow them but Amin and the other men held them back forcing them to stay on the hull. Amin feared that if rescuers found them on the boat without a crew the passengers would be blamed for the disaster.

Hours passed and those on the hull waited for a miracle. In the morning it seemed to arrive in the form of another fishing boat. Scores of passengers leaped into the water and swam toward it. But the fishing boat was tiny and could not hold them all. The crew allowed six people on board then headed for shore.

The waves had worsened and passengers’ frantic attempts to flee the overturned boat had left the vessel unstable. It capsized again.

Rahena found herself back in the water fighting once more to save her daughter. She spotted Rema slipping below the surface and grabbed her before other passengers pushed the pair back onto the hull.

But Rema had grown delirious. She tried to bite people and could not speak. Rahena knew her daughter was in urgent need of help.

Others never made it back on board. Samira’s husband Akram Ullah estimates at least 20 drowned when the boat overturned the second time.

The subsequent capsize had knocked loose the remains of passengers who had drowned inside the vessel the night before. Jannat spotted the lifeless body of his little cousin Futika bobbing in the waves.

More fishing boats arrived and passengers called out for help. But those on board the vessels simply shot photos and videos of them then left.

A few passengers tried to swim to shore promising to send help if they made it. They were never seen again. And help still did not come.

But at least the rain did.

The passengers weak with thirst collected what they could in a tarp and shared sips of it thanking Allah for sparing their lives.

Yet as another night passed it was clear not everyone would be spared. Rahena’s daughter cradled in her lap had gone still. Rahena hugged her little girl and tried to talk to her. But the life had drained from her daughter.

The passengers prayed for the child then slid her body into the sea.

Around 30 minutes later Rahena says the rescue ship finally arrived.

____

In the days following the disaster the bodies of 12 women and three children were recovered from the waters off Aceh according to the UNHCR. The search for more has been called off.

Although the fishing boat’s crew rescued the initial six people from the hull the morning of March 20 search and rescue vessels were not launched until later that evening. Officials finally spotted the boat around 9 a.m. March 21 about 22 kilometers (14 miles) offshore and finished evacuating all the passengers from the hull around midday.

Ibnu Harris Al Hussain chief of Banda Aceh’s search and rescue agency said the rescue operation began shortly after his agency learned about the capsized boat. He also said officials needed time to coordinate a plan to care for survivors once they reached land while crews at sea initially kept their distance out of fear the passengers would hurt themselves trying to swim to the rescue boat.

“The most important thing is that we have ensured their safety when they were found” Hussain wrote to the AP.

On April 2 police announced they had arrested three members of the crew plus a fourth man who was not on board the boat. They were charged with people smuggling which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Police are still searching for the remaining crew including the captain whose mobile phone activity places him in Malaysia West Aceh Police Chief Andi Kirana told the AP.

Police are not considering murder charges Kirana says because they believe the capsize was an accident — the result of an overcrowded boat simply taking on too much water.

But N and the other passengers believe the disaster was a deliberate act of revenge by a sadistic captain and crew who thought they could escape. And for that — and for all the suffering endured — the punishment N says should fit the crime.

“They tortured us. They treated us like animals” she says. “We want the government to treat them like animals.”

Kirana also said police are not considering rape charges because they haven’t received any reports of sexual assault. But N says police have never questioned her about what happened on board.

For now she and the other passengers remain in limbo sleeping under tents behind a government office building. They have been shifted between shelters amid protests by locals who want them to go away. But there is nowhere for them to go.

Though they have survived so much some wonder what it was all for.

Rahena questions why she was spared when two of her children were not. Her husband already in Malaysia blames her for attempting the journey and for the death of their daughter and son.

“I lost my hope when I lost my children” Rahena says. “I feel like I have nothing.”

N alone and aching for her mother hopes to somehow make it to Malaysia and to the man who wants her as his wife.

Maybe then she says she will finally be free — though in reality Rohingya child brides in Malaysia often become prisoners to abusive husbands.

For now all she can do is fight to survive another day and pray for a future free of pain.

“I don’t want to suffer anymore” she says.

The entrepreneur and reality TV star was one of the celebrities who roasted the NFL legend on the Netflix special but was greeted with boos from the audience in attendance Sunday at the Kia Forum near Los Angeles.

Host Kevin Hart introduced Kardashian and as the Kardashians star took the podium she thanked the comedian and paused after the initial cheers. The cheers then turned to boos prompting Kardashian to say “All right all right all right.”

Kardashian concentrated her jokes on Brady who she was once rumored to be dating.

“I’m really here tonight for Tom. I wasn’t going to come tonight but since I’m not here as Tom’s date there’s still a good chance I might” she joked.

Kardashian delivered another joke likening Brady’s appearance to her stepdad Caitlyn Jenner.

“I do know it would’ve never worked out” Kardashian said of a relationship with Brady. “An ex-athlete high cheekbones silky hair. … You remind me too much of my stepdad now.”

A meme showing “the evolution of Tom Brady” appeared on screen showing the transformation of Brady’s physical appearance and ending up looking like Jenner.

Kardashian continued: “Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must’ve been really hard but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She’s one of the best athletes in the world who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life. You can become a commentator a far-right Republican or even a strong confident woman.”"

We explain how we designed our experiments how data was prepared and analysed and showcase results for the different image analysis tasks. The datasets and selected trained models are publicly available via the Zenodo data sharing platform38 (Supplementary Table 2) allowing users to explore the DL technology described in this work. An overview of the networks applied in this study is provided in Table 1.

Image segmentation

Image segmentation represents the main application of DL technology for bacterial bioimages. Most networks for bacterial segmentation focus on phase-contrast images as their high contrast allows for efficient segmentation even at high cell densities333940. If no phase contrast is available researchers have to perform segmentation on bright field or fluorescence images which is challenging due to reduced contrast and increased image heterogeneity. We thus sought to test various DL networks for their capability to segment different types of non-phase-contrast images frequently encountered in microbiological studies. For this we generated and annotated different datasets comprising bright field and fluorescence microscopy images of rod- and cocci-shaped bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus for bright field S. aureus and B. subtilis for fluorescence) (Fig. 2a). For all datasets we trained DL models using ZeroCostDL4Mic as it provides rapid and straight-forward access to a range of popular DL networks22. To evaluate their performance we calculated common metrics which compare the network output of test images to the respective annotated ground truth (Supplementary Note 1 Table 2).

Fig. 2: Segmentation of bacterial images using open-source deep learning approaches. a Overview of the datasets used for image segmentation. Shown are representative regions of interest for (i) S. aureus bright field and (ii) fluorescence images (Nile Red membrane stain) (iii) E. coli bright field images and (iv) fluorescence images of B. subtilis expressing FtsZ-GFP47. b Segmentation of S. aureus bright field and membrane-stain fluorescence images using StarDist9. Bright field and fluorescence images were acquired in the same measurements and thus share the same annotations. Yellow dashed lines indicate the cell outlines detected in the test images shown. c Segmentation of E. coli bright field images using the U-Net type network CARE14 and GAN-type network pix2pix18.

Morphological features were normalised to the first value for each track. Scale bars are 2 µm (a d) 3 µm (b c) and 10 µm (e). Full size image

Table 2 Metrics to evaluate model performance. Full size table

Five popular networks were used for segmentation namely U-Net841 CARE14 pix2pix18 StarDist9 and its recent variant SplineDist42 (Supplementary Table 3). As the underlying network architectures vary the workflows to obtain instance segmentations (individual objects from binary masks) differ in terms of for example input/output data formats and image post-processing (Supplementary Fig. 1). While StarDist and SplineDist provide instance segmentation directly as network output instances have to be generated from U-Net CARE and pix2pix predictions by post-processing the outputs. CARE and pix2pix were not explicitly designed for segmentation but are versatile enough to generate probability maps that can be segmented subsequently. Similar to U-Net the instance segmentation performance depends not only on the trained model but also on the applied post-processing routine.

For our first dataset we recorded live S. aureus cells immobilised on agarose pads either in bright field mode or using the fluorescent membrane stain Nile Red (Fig. 2b). Due to their coccoid shape we speculated that StarDist9 is well suited to segment this kind of data (Table 1). Testing an unseen and fully annotated dataset demonstrated cell counting accuracies (recall) of 100 ± 1% (membrane fluorescence) and 87 ± 3% (bright field) (Table 3). The reduced accuracy for bright field images is caused by optical artefacts at high cell density leading to merging of defocussed cells (Fig. 2ai). Next to performing segmentation in the cloud trained models can also be downloaded and conveniently used with the StarDist plugin distributed via the image analysis platform Fiji43 (Supplementary Video 1). Similar to the ZeroCostDL4Mic notebook this enables efficient segmentation of live cell time-lapse data (Supplementary Video 2).

Table 3 Summarised network performance for the different tasks and datasets. Full size table

Motivated by this finding we sought to know whether StarDist is also suitable for segmenting rod-shaped cells. For this we recorded bright field time-lapse images of live E. coli cells immobilised under agarose pads44 (Fig. 2c). Bright field images show less contrast than phase contrast images and suffer from high noise making them challenging to segment. Still they are widespread in bacterial imaging and proper segmentation would be beneficial for studying bacterial proliferation (i.e. cell counts over time) and morphology (cell dimensions and shape). We annotated individual image frames spread over the entire time series and trained supervised DL networks to reflect varying cell sizes and densities. All networks showed good performance for semantic segmentation as indicated by high intersection-over-union (IoU see Supplementary Note 1 Table 3) values for all time points (IoU > 0.75) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). For instance segmentation however the model performance varied strongly. While instance segmentations of U-Net CARE and pix2pix worked well for early time points and thus low cell density (Fig. 2b) individual cells in crowded regions could not be resolved using basic image post-processing (i.e. thresholding). This led to a successive decrease in the recall value over imaging time and therefore a decreasing number of correctly identified cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The best counting performance at low and high cell densities was achieved using StarDist which correctly identified 87% of the cells for the entire test dataset (Table 3). However as StarDist assumes star-convex shaped objects the accuracy of the predicted cell shape decreases with increasing cell length (and thus axial ratio) rendering this network less suited for morphometry of elongated rod-shaped cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Using a multi-label U-Net (ML-U-Net trained to detect cell cytosol and boundary) instead of a single-label U-Net provided the best compromise between instance segmentation performance and proper prediction of cell morphology. This notebook uses training data in which each label (here cell boundary and cytosol) is visualised by a different grey value. Such training data can be generated using Fiji macros that we provide in our repository and which also allow to obtain instance segmentation from the network output. Applying the trained ML-U-Net to time-lapse videos allows to extract single-cell instances that can subsequently be tracked using e.g. TrackMate4546 (Supplementary Video 3).

Next we were interested in the performance of DL networks for the segmentation of complex fluorescence data. Although typical images used for segmentation show high contrast (fluorescent membrane stains phase-contrast images) images with complex fluorescence distributions or low signal represent a significant challenge. Fluorescence images of B. subtilis cells expressing FtsZ-GFP47 show a bimodal intensity distribution with the characteristic localisation in the septal region and diffusing FtsZ monomers that produce dim labelling of the cytosol (Fig. 2d). Growth for several cell cycles results in the multi-cellular chains of B. subtilis and microcolony formation providing a dataset with increasing cell density and a large number of cell-to-cell contacts. When we tested different networks for this challenging dataset we found that U-Net and pix2pix provided well segmentable predictions at low to medium cell density (Fig. 2d Supplementary Fig. 2c d). However these networks also suffered from undesired cell merging at high cell densities leading to reduced recall and precision values (Supplementary Fig. 2c d). As for segmentation of E. coli bright field images StarDist and its variant SplineDist42 showed high recall and precision values also for mid- and high-density regions while the multi-label U-Net preserved cell morphology at slightly lower instance segmentation accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 2d). In contrast to StarDist SplineDist is not limited to convex shapes which makes it a good candidate network for the segmentation of curved bacteria (e.g. Caulobacter crescentus). Nevertheless SplineDist is computationally more expensive and thus takes longer to train.

As another example for cell tracking we trained a StarDist model to detect stationary E. coli cells (bright field images) that resume growth upon addition to agarose pads (Fig. 2e). Applying this model to time-lapse data and tracking individual cells over time (Supplementary Video 4) allows to extract morphological features such as cell area or circularity. Our analysis revealed that the cell area (and thus also the volume) increases with growth while the circularity only decreases slightly (Fig. 2f). This might indicate that bacteria expand in all directions during lag phase in contrast to exponentially growing cells that mainly elongate (Supplementary Video 3). Of note StarDist models can be directly applied within the Fiji TrackMate plugin making cell tracking straight-forward and convenient46.

Finally and motivated by generalist approaches such as Cellpose10 we were interested in whether a single StarDist model is capable of performing all the segmentation tasks shown in Fig. 2b-d. We thus trained a model on pooled training data and evaluated its performance (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although bright field and fluorescence images differ significantly the obtained ‘all-in-one’ model showed similar precision and recall values compared to the specialist models (Supplementary Table 4). However it also shows the same limitations such as incomplete predictions for long and curved bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 3). For cells with suitable morphology StarDist allows segmenting large images with thousands of cells as shown for live rod-shaped Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells imaged at various magnifications (Supplementary Fig. 4). It also demonstrates that DL segmentation models can perform well on images with low signal and a noisy background.

Object detection and classification

To explore the potential of object detection for microbiological applications we employed an implementation of YOLOv212 for two distinct tasks: Identification of cell cycle events such as cell division in bright field images (Fig. 3a) and antibiotic phenotyping of bacterial cells based on membrane and DNA stains (Nile Red and DAPI respectively) (Fig. 3b) (Supplementary Table 5). These labels are commonly used to study antibiotic action as they are easy to use and also facilitate live-cell staining of bacterial cells48.

Fig. 3: DL-based object detection and classification. a A YOLOv2 model was trained to detect and classify different growth stages of live E. coli cells (i). “Dividing” cells (green bounding boxes) show visible septation the class “Rod” (blue bounding boxes) represents growing cells without visible septation and regions with high cell densities are classified as “Microcolonies” (red bounding boxes). (ii) Three individual frames of a live cell measurement. b Antibiotic phenotyping using object detection. A YOLOv2 model was trained on drug-treated cells (i). The model was tested on synthetic images randomly stitched from patches of different drug treatments (ii). Bounding box colours in the prediction (iii) refer to the colour-code in (i). Vesicles (V orange boxes) and oblique cells (O green boxes) were added as additional classes during training. Mecillinam-treated cells were misclassified as MP265-treated cells (red arrows). Scale bars are 10 µm (a overview) 3 µm (lower panel in a and b) and 1 µm (b upper panel). Full size image

We chose YOLOv2 due to its good performance in a recent study in which a network was trained to classify cell nuclei in fluorescence images34. For growth stage classification of live E. coli cells in bright field images we used the same dataset employed for segmentation (Fig. 2c). Here we wanted to discriminate between rod-shaped cells dividing cells and microcolonies (defined as 4+ cells in close contact) (Fig. 3a i) using a training and test dataset that we annotated online (https://www.makesense.ai/) or locally (LabelImg)49 (see methods).

Due to the small size of bacterial cells we initially investigated the influence of the object size on the performance of YOLOv2. Since object detection networks rescale input images to a defined size the relative object size changes with size of the region of interest. When we trained our model on large images we encountered missed objects wrong bounding box positioning or false classifications (Supplementary Video 5). To quantify this effect we determined recall and precision values as well as mean average precision (mAP see Supplementary Note 1 and Table 2) for the test dataset (Table 1 Supplementary Table 6). mAP represents the common metric for object detection taking into account model precision and recall over a range of object detection thresholds12. For object detection challenges (e.g. PASCAL visual object classes (VOC) challenge50 well-performing models typically yield mAP values in the range of 0.6–0.8). However for our large-FoV growth stage classification dataset we obtained a mAP of 0.386 with a size-dependent performance for the different classes (AP Microcolony > AP dividing > AP rod (non-dividing)) (Supplementary Table 6). Smaller images resulted in improved network performance (mAP = 0.667) with classification of the majority of cells in the image (Fig. 3a Supplementary Video 6). Knowing the size-dependent performance is important for the design of an object detection experiment. If the focus is on the detection of large structures such as microcolonies the YOLOv2 model can be trained on large fields of view. However small regions of interest or higher optical magnification should be used if small objects are to be detected. Object density is another parameter that affects the performance of YOLOv2 models. As YOLOv2 uses a grid-based approach for object detection in which each grid region can only hold one object very close objects (i.e. non-dividing cells at t = 0 in Fig. 3a or dividing cells at t = 19 min yellow arrows) are not resolved. Instead only one bounding box of the corresponding class is predicted. Thus object density should be considered as a limiting factor when planning to train a network for object detection. When applied to time-lapse recordings of growing E. coli cells the model facilitates identification of class transitions e.g. from rod-shaped (non-dividing) cells to dividing cells and at later time points to microcolonies (Fig. 3a ii Supplementary Video 6).

As a second task for object detection we explored its suitability for antibiotic phenotyping (Fig. 3b). In antibiotic phenotyping bacterial cells are classified as non- or drug-treated cells based on cell morphology and subcellular features (commonly DNA and membrane stains). This facilitates the assignment of a mode of action to antibiotics or potential candidate compounds being a promising tool in drug discovery348. To explore whether object detection networks can be used for this purpose we generated a dataset of images including membrane- and DNA-labelled E. coli cells grown in the absence or presence of antibiotics. We used five different antibiotics that target different cellular pathways (Fig. 3b Supplementary Table 7). Nalidixate blocks DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV thus stalling DNA replication. Mecillinam and MP265 (a structural analogue of A22) perturb cell morphology by inhibiting peptidoglycan crosslinking by PBP2 or MreB polymerisation while rifampicin and chloramphenicol inhibit transcription and translation respectively. As additional classes we included untreated cells (control) membrane vesicles and oblique cells. The latter class represents cells that are only partially attached to the surface during immobilisation. Such cells can be identified by a focus shift and are present in all growth conditions (Fig. 3b i). Further examples for each class are provided in Supplementary Fig. 5.

We trained a YOLOv2 model on our annotated dataset and tested its performance on images containing cells treated with different antibiotics (stitched images see methods) (Fig. 3b ii/iii) or images that only show one condition similar to the training dataset (Supplementary Fig. 6). The YOLOv2 model showed a comparable performance for both datasets with mAP values of 0.66 (stitched image dataset) and 0.69 (individual conditions) indicating a good generalisability of our model. Hereby the AP values for the different classes varied substantially ranging from 0.21 (vesicles) to 0.94 (control) (Supplementary Table 8). Poor prediction of membrane vesicles is likely caused by their small size which agrees with the observations made for growth stage prediction. Intermediate AP values are observed when antibiotics induce similar morphological changes as it is the case for mecillinam (AP = 0.605) and MP265 (AP = 0.526). This led to misclassification between these classes (Fig. 3b red arrows Supplementary Fig. 6) indicating that both treatments result in a highly similar phenotype.

This similarity allowed us to test whether YOLOv2 can identify antibiotic modes of actions in unseen images. We omitted MP265 data during model training but included images of MP265-treated cells in the test data. Due to their similar phenotype MP265-treated cells should hence be predicted as Mecillinam-treated. This was indeed the case as shown by the high mAP value (0.866) and specificity (recall = 0.961) (Supplementary Fig. 6b) demonstrating the applicability of object detection networks for mode-of-action-based drug screening.

Denoising

As denoising approaches allow for faster and more gentle imaging14153551 we consider them as powerful tools for bacteriology. To test their applicability to bacterial data we recorded paired low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images of an H-NS-mScarlet-I52 fusion protein in live E. coli cells. H-NS decorates the bacterial nucleoid homogeneously under nutrient-rich growth conditions and maintains nucleoid association after chemical fixation53. This allows the study of chromosome organisation and dynamics an important field of bacterial cell biology. We trained the CARE and N2V models on image pairs acquired using chemically fixed cells to prevent motion blur in the training dataset (Supplementary Table 9). We found that both parametric and DL-based approaches strongly increased the SNR of noise-corrupted images as indicated by the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM)54 (Fig. 4a). These metrics are commonly used to assess SNR and quality of image pairs with higher values representing improved performance (Supplementary Note 1 Table 2). Under the conditions tested we obtained the best results using the supervised network CARE (SSIM = 0.897 ± 0.005 PSNR = 36.1 ± 0.09) (Table 3). Next we applied the trained models to denoise live-cell time series recorded under low-SNR conditions (Fig. 4b Supplementary Video 7). This led to an apparent increase in SNR and intensity analysis revealed a 20x lower photobleaching rate as indicated by the exponential intensity decay time t 1/2 (Fig. 4c).

Fig. 4: Image denoising for improved live-cell imaging in bacteriology. a Low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) image pairs (ground truth GT) of fixed E. coli cells labelled for H-NS-mScarlet-I. Denoising was performed with PureDenoise (parametric approach) Noise2Void (self-supervised DL) and CARE (supervised DL). Structural similarity (SSIM) maps compare low-SNR or predictions to ground truth (GT) high-SNR data. b 10 s interval representative time points of a live-cell measurement recorded at 1 Hz frame rate demonstrating CARE can provide prolonged imaging at high SNR using low-intensity images as input. t 1/2 represents the decay half time. c Intensity over time for different imaging conditions providing low/high SNR images shown in a/b. d Structural similarity between subsequent imaging frames was calculated for raw and restored time-lapse measurements (Methods). e Denoising of confocal images of MreB-sfGFPsw expressing E. coli cells imaged at the bottom plane (i).

(iii) Tracks of MreB filaments (colour-coded) and overlaid with the average image (grey) of a live-cell time series.

Note that the distribution in g was cut at a max speed of 150 nm/s excluding a small number of high-speed outliers but allowing for better visualisation of the main distribution. h Denoising of FtsZ-GFP dynamics in live B. subtilis.

Scale bars are 1 µm (a b e i) and 0.5 µm (e iii and h). Full size image

However the performance of the different denoising approaches in fast live cell measurements could not be assessed by the standard PSNR and SSIM metrics because of the lack of paired high-SNR images. As noise reduces contrast and structural information content in images subsequent image frames in low-SRN time series should exhibit higher signal variation than in their high-SNR counterparts. We therefore speculated that calculating the structural similarity between successive image frames (e.g. between frame 1 and frame 2 frame 2 and frame 3 etc.) could report on denoising performance for live-cell time series (Fig. 4d). In fact all denoising approaches significantly increased SSIM values while preserving relative intensities over time (Supplementary Fig. 7a).

As all the previous models were trained on fixed-cell data the results on live-cell data could be compromised by potential fixation artefacts. Because N2V is self-supervised it was possible to train it directly on the live-cell data. Hence we could compare the performance of a N2V model trained on fixed-cell images with the one trained on live-cell images. This resulted in high structural similarity throughout the time series (Supplementary Fig. 7b) indicating that no artefacts were introduced by training on fixed-cell data. Similar observations were made when comparing the fixed-cell N2V and CARE models. Analysis of raw and denoised (CARE) time series of chemically fixed cells showed a constant SSIM value of 0.96 in the subsequent-frame analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7c). This indicates that the high contribution of shot-noise under low-SNR conditions for this target can be overcome by the denoising method. Of note the SSIM value obtained in fixed-cell measurements is higher than for denoised live-cell time series (0.82) (compare Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7c). To test whether this effect is caused by nucleoid dynamics (Supplementary Video 7) we recorded a time series under high-SNR imaging conditions using a small region of interest. High SNR imaging leads to lower noise contribution and higher SSIM values for subsequent image frames but induces strong photobleaching that leads to a rapid drop in structural similarity over time (Fig. 4b Supplementary Fig. 7d). However the first SSIM value of the high-SNR time series (representing the similarity between frame 1 and frame 2) is close to the corresponding SSIM value of the denoised low-SNR time series. This indicates that (i) the model provides optimal denoising performance and (ii) the lower SSIM values in live-cell measurements originate from nucleoid dynamics rather than representing denoising artefacts.

To probe the limits of denoising approaches we recorded confocal images of E. coli cells chromosomally expressing MreB-sfGFPsw55. MreB forms filaments which show processive movement along the inner membrane (Fig. 4e)565758. Imaging the bottom plane of the cells this movement can be tracked in order to determine filament speed an analysis that is commonly performed in MreB studies. We speculated that processive movement represents a good readout for model performance and trained a CARE model on paired low-SNR/high-SNR data. The trained model as well as the parametric denoising using PureDenoise improved the SNR and structural similarity although to a smaller extent compared to the HNS-mScarlet-I nucleoid dataset (Fig. 4a Table 3). To test model performance on live-cell time series we tracked MreB filaments using TrackMate4546. High SNR movies show long tracks and a filament speed of 17 nm/s which is in good agreement with reported values59 while tracking raw data resulted in significantly shorter tracks and higher filament speed (Fig. 4f/g). Surprisingly DL-based denoising did not restore track length and speed which we account to model hallucinations that are caused by the high contribution of shot noise at this low SNR (Fig. 4f/g). This leads to strong frame-to-frame intensity fluctuations which obscure processive filament movement (Supplementary Video 8). As PureDenoise can integrate temporal information during the denoising process shot-noise contribution is reduced leading to more sensible restoration results i.e. processive filament motion similar to the high SNR measurements (Fig. 4e–g Supplementary Video 8).

As another example we denoised time-lapse images of FtsZ treadmilling in live B. subtilis cells. These movies were recorded in vertically aligned cells using the so-called VerCINI approach (Fig. 4h) and contributed to study the critical role of FtsZ treadmilling in cell division4760. As the constant movement of FtsZ-GFP renders acquisition of low and high SNR image pairs difficult we used the self-supervised N2V method for the denoising task. Here denoising emphasises subtle details that are difficult to be identified in the raw image data (Fig. 4h). This allows for long time-lapse imaging of FtsZ dynamics with enhanced image quality (Supplementary Video 9).

Artificial labelling

Artificial labelling can be very useful for bacterial imaging as it increases the multiplexing potential and circumvents phototoxicity. Because of their much smaller size bacteria provide less structural information in bright field images than eukaryotic cells (Fig. 5a). However we regard the cell envelope as a promising target for artificial labelling as exact cell shape determination is of interest for morphological studies (e.g. for antibiotic treatments) or in the context of spatial positioning of target molecules in individual cells6162. This is even more valuable if super-resolution information is obtained. To explore whether such information can be extracted using DL we recorded different training datasets. The first dataset includes bright field and corresponding diffraction-limited widefield fluorescence images in which the E. coli membrane is stained by the lipophilic dye Nile Red (Fig. 5a i). For the second dataset we acquired super-resolved PAINT images6364 together with bright field images (Fig. 5a ii). For both datasets we tested a 2D version of fnet20 as well as CARE. For the diffraction-limited dataset both networks were able to predict pseudo-fluorescence images from bright field images with fnet showing slightly better performance (SSIM fnet = 0.88 ± 0.06 SSIM CARE = 0.83 ± 0.05) (Fig. 5a Table 3). This is not surprising as fnet was designed for artificial labelling while the good performance of CARE demonstrates the versatility of this network. Similar values were obtained for the super-resolution dataset (Fig. 5a Supplementary Fig. 8) with predictions showing good agreement also on the sub-diffraction level (see cross-section as inset in Fig. 5a). Additionally although trained on fixed cells the model can also be used to predict highly resolved membrane signal in live-cell time series (Supplementary Video 10).

Fig. 5: Artificial labelling of E. coli membranes. a fnet and CARE predictions of diffraction-limited (i) and PAINT super-resolution (SR) (ii) membrane labels obtained from bright field (BF) images. GT = ground truth. Values represent averages from five test images and the respective standard deviation b Pseudo-dual-colour images of drug-treated E. coli cells. Nucleoids were super-resolved using PAINT imaging with JF 646 -Hoechst64. Membranes were predicted using the trained fnet model. CAM = Chloramphenicol. Scale bars are 2 µm (a) and 1 µm (b). Full size image

We then wanted to know how well our model generalises i.e. whether it can predict the super-resolved membrane of bacteria grown in the presence of different antibiotics (see methods). Both fnet and CARE models successfully predicted the membrane stains in drug-treated cells (SSIM fnet = 0.85 ± 0.07 SSIM CARE = 0.85 ± 0.05 averaged over all treatments) (Table 1) indicating that it detects image features independent from the cell shape (Supplementary Fig. 8). The increased resolution and contrast in membrane predictions allow to map the positioning of subcellular structures (here the nucleoid) with higher precision (Fig. 5b). This typically requires the acquisition of multi-colour super-resolution images64 which is more intricate and time-consuming.

Resolution enhancement

Super-resolution membrane images can also be obtained by training a supervised DL network on paired low-resolution/high-resolution image datasets14161722. Here we used structured illumination microscopy (SIM)65 to record membrane images of dye-labelled live E. coli and S. aureus cells. SIM images are reconstructed from a set of images recorded at different grid positions and angles which hence requires higher light doses than a single widefield image. As acquisition of such image sets is only required during the network training but not during its application super-resolution prediction reduces the light dose and also increases the achievable temporal resolution17. Training of two CARE models on paired low/high-resolution images of E. coli and S. aureus using the ZeroCostDL4Mic notebook provided models that facilitate robust prediction of SIM images from single widefield snapshots (Fig. 6). Here contrast and resolution of predictions agreed well with reconstructed SIM images (Supplementary Video 11) as shown for cross sections along single E. coli and S. aureus cells (Fig. 6a b iii). To evaluate the quality of super-resolution images we used SQUIRREL which detects reconstruction artefacts in super-resolution images66. This analysis yielded similar errors for neural network predictions compared to SIM reconstructions both for E. coli (resolution-scaled Pearson coefficient of 0.898 ± 0.018 (SIM) vs 0.907 ± 0.018 (prediction)) and S. aureus (0.957 ± 0.012 (SIM) vs 0.963 ± 0.010 (prediction)) (Supplementary Fig. 9). SSIM values between predictions and GT SIM images were determined as 0.84 ± 0.03 (E. coli) and 0.92 ± 0.01 (S. aureus). Estimating the spatial resolution using image decorrelation67 verified the very good agreement between the predicted (137 ± 7 nm for E. coli and 134 ± 5 nm for S. aureus images) and reconstructed SIM images (122 ± 2 nm for E. coli and 134 ± 1 nm for S. aureus images) with the expected 2x increase in resolution (308 ± 24 nm for E. coli and 289 ± 5 nm for S. aureus widefield images). This strategy is hence well suited to perform single-image super-resolution microscopy17 in bacterial cells.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2Fuc3dlcmluZy10b3AtMTAtcXVlc3Rpb25zLXN1cGVyY2xvdWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Answering the top 10 questions about supercloud,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2022/07/09/answering-top-10-questions-supercloud/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2Fuc3dlcmluZy10b3AtMTAtcXVlc3Rpb25zLXN1cGVyY2xvdWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFscGhyLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tZmFjdG9yeS1yZXNldC15b3VyLWFuZHJvaWQtdGFibGV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Factory Reset Your Android Tablet,"A factory reset restores the default data and options of your device and erases all other data in the process.

This method is usually used as a last resort if you can’t make your device work in any other way. It’s often required if the device encounters a system glitch recent update malfunctions or starts acting strange.

In this article you will find out about two different methods to restart your Android tablet.

Back Up Your Data Before Resetting Your Tablet

Performing a ‘factory reset’ will erase the data from your device so you’ll lose a lot of valuable information if you don’t back it up. You can toggle automatic backup on all recent versions of Android.

Go to Settings. Select the Backup & Reset option from the Personal Settings section. Toggle Back up my data.



This will automatically store everything to your Google Drive account. Later when you perform a factory reset you can log in to your account and retrieve the data to your phone again.

Also a regular factory reset shouldn’t wipe the contents of an SD card but to avoid any inconvenience it would be best to remove it from the tablet before you proceed.

Factory Reset Your Tablet Using the Settings App

Every Android device should have a Factory reset option in the Settings app. If your tablet is working properly you should be able to manually navigate to the option.

Not all Android tablets are the same. But usually you should follow these instructions:

As you probably guessed open up the Settings app on your tablet. Go to the Personal section and select Backup & Reset. Tap Factory data reset.

Confirm your command if prompted.

If you’ve done everything correctly the tablet should restart and start the erasing process. Wait for the system to finish. Once the data wiping is over it will automatically reboot.

Note that not all Android versions have the same interface. Sometimes the aforementioned steps can slightly differ from one other.

For example instead of Personal section the factory reset can be listed in Privacy and sometimes even in the Storage menu. So double-check all possible options the Factory reset should be there by default.

Factory Reset a Tablet from Recovery Mode

In some cases your Android tablet may malfunction in a way that you can’t access your Settings menu. The screen may freeze the system won’t respond or it may become too slow to open any app. If so you’ll have to access the recovery mode before you perform a factory reset.

To enter recovery mode you’ll have to press and hold the designated hotkeys. However not all Android devices follow the same process.

How to Access Recovery Mode from Different Android Tablets

Depending on your android tablet’s manufacturer you’ll have to follow different steps to enter recovery mode. These are some possibilities:

Samsung tablet: Press Volume Up + Home + Power Button LG: Press Volume Down + Power Button. After the logo appears hold Volume Down but release the Power button. Then press it again. Motorola Moto Z/Droid: Press Volume Down + Power button. Keep holding the Volume Down but release the Power button HTC: Press Volume Down + Power and after the screen changes release the Power button while still holding Volume Down. Google Nexus / Pixel Sony Xperia Asus Transformer: Hold Volume Down + Power button

If your phone is not on the list you’ll probably easily find the necessary steps to access recovery mode. Just look up your device online.

The tablet manufacturers make accessing this mode complicated on purpose. The purpose of this is to prevent any accidental access of this mode since it would be extremely easy to accidentally erase all data from the device.

Navigating the Recovery Mode Menu

Once the tablet goes into recovery mode it should display an image of an Android avatar lying on his back with a red alert triangle above. After that you should follow these steps:

Navigate through the available options using the Volume Up and Volume Down keys. Go to the wipe data/factory reset option and press the Power Button.

Use the Volume Up/Down keys to select Yes — delete all user data and press the Power button again.

Wait for the device to perform the factory reset and reboot.

Android Tablet Troubleshooting

Most of the time a factory reset should refresh your system. When you perform it your tablet should work the way it was when you first got it at least in the beginning. However if it works well just for a while and starts acting slow or strange again it is most likely a hardware issue. If you have an older device the recent system and app updates will slow it down a lot.

On the other hand if you bought your device recently and it still doesn’t work well after a factory reset it may be a hardware issue. You should take it to a tech repair service so they can further diagnose the issue.

Double Check Before You Proceed

A factory reset can cause a lot of data loss even if you think you’ve backed up everything that you need. So before you confirm the command double-check if you’ve saved all the data that you need.

Also if you think that recent app and system updates are slowing your device down you shouldn’t download them all at once as they will just cause the same issue. Instead try to get only the essentials until you switch to a better tablet.

Housing following critical report,"The B.C. NDP government has fired the board of its housing agency after an independent probe of B.C. Housing uncovered some problems.

The provincial housing agency's budget is nearly $2 billion an increase of more than 140 per cent from five years ago. And with a $7-billion boost in the budget for the next decade the province tasked firm Ernst & Young to look into the agency.

Just a week after its report went public B.C. Housing Minister David Eby announced its board of commissioner members are out.

The Ernst & Young probe — completed in May but released late last month — found problems in the agency including inadequate oversight over decisions and spending and unclear roles and responsibilities potentially impacting B.C. Housing's ability to manage risks.

A Friday news release from the province said Eby made the decision and the new board would ""ensure the implementation of best practices"" at the agency. The statement directly referenced the Ernst & Young report.

""The review was initiated by the B.C. government in 2021"" the statement read ""to ensure that B.C. Housing can deliver its expanded budget and mandate in consideration of government's historic $7-billion investment in affordable housing over 10 years and the rapid growth of the Crown corporation.""

But B.C. Liberal housing critic Mike Bernier called the firings — announced late Friday — an attempt to ""hide something.""

""We've seen them blame everything from local governments to foreign investors"" he said in a phone interview. ""Now they're blaming the hand-picked board that they already had put in place.""

He said the B.C. NDP failed to deliver on many of its housing promises. Asked whether the previous B.C. Liberal government bore any responsibility for the issues at B.C. Housing Bernier said there were problems that needed to be addressed but ""At the end of the day the buck needs to stop with the government.""

""Sometimes changes need to be made"" he said. ""But it also is unfortunate when we find the government will make grandiose announcements and promises — and look for blame with the agencies when it doesn't happen.""

Eby could not be reached by time of publication. But his ministry says that since 2017 it has funded almost 34000 ""affordable new homes"" that are underway or constructed. And many more it says are expected under its $7-billion plan for the coming decade.

Typical of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ndp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ndp</a>. Wait until late on a Friday to try and hide more of the failures of this <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ndp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ndp</a> government. Eby has failed to deliver on almost every housing promise as Minister of this file! <a href=""https://t.co/ZOPF9qwSTg"">https://t.co/ZOPF9qwSTg</a> —@Mike_A_Bernier

Board members replaced

The outgoing board members had all been appointed after the New Democrats came to power in 2017.

Included in the change — announced in the news release — is the replacement of NDP-appointed board chair Cassie Doyle.

She is replaced by Allan Seckel former head of B.C.'s public service under the B.C. Liberal government in the 2000s and the province's former deputy attorney general.

""Doyle did not seek re-appointment of her four-year term which ends July 18 2022"" the province said in a June 30 release.

Although Doyle's role was scheduled to end this month seven of the former board members were appointed to serve until 2023 and two until 2024.

A provincial release said Doyle had overseen the Building B.C. housing program as well as ""extraordinary measures to house people"" during the pandemic wildfires and floods and last summer's deadly heat dome.

Other board members removed were Barb Carle-Thiesson Joanne Granek Penny Gurstein Kerry Pateman Susan Russell-Csanyi Sonia Sahota and Perry Staniscia.

They're being replaced by Jill Kot Sheila Taylor Mark Sieben and Russ Jones — plus two new appointees taking their seats in several weeks: former Snuneymuxw First Nation chief Doug White and Clifford White the former chief councillor of Gitxaata Nation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“The dynamic has changed totally” said Herron owner of Greenworks Flowers.

While her shop lives or dies by the same customers that drive any other retailer its location is not quite as ordinary: It’s built into an underground shopping center. The shop is part of Houston’s network of underground pedestrian tunnels and shopping plazas a prominent outpost in a subset of the North American retail landscape.

Underground shopping centers — a diverse collection of below-grade commercial spaces that can include an array of vendors such as newsstands bakeries restaurants galleries and even dentists’ offices — have been a popular fixture in developments from New York to Houston to Toronto offering business owners a captive audience of weekday commuters using expansive networks of tunnels to beat heat cold and traffic. The pandemic has disrupted that retail real estate balance.

Analysts designers and more than a dozen businesses in some of the most prominent underground developments in North America say their trade has been struck a double blow first by a pandemic that temporarily brought business to a halt then by the changed patterns of city life. The dependable vigor of workday crowds is gone. In its place the curated dependence of underground spaces on office workers above has become a burden as the reality of long-term hybrid work settles in.

“It is at the mercy of what the return of office workers looks like” said Grant Humes head of the Financial District Business Improvement Area in Toronto where more than 17 miles of tunnels connect shops in a below-ground network known as the PATH.

“The PATH is one of those places where unless you have a reason to be there you don’t have a reason to be there — and your reason to be there is usually that you’re going to work” he said.

In Houston that dependency stands out in stark terms. Data from security firm Kastle Systems which tracks office attendance using anonymous keycard data from clients’ properties has shown office use rates there hovering around 56% among the highest in the nation and yet returning workers aren’t filling the underground spaces the way they once did.

Instead Herron said she can clearly see the outcome of new hybrid work policies implemented by above-ground employers. On days when more workers happen to be in the office at once she estimates traffic by her shop reaches about 70% of its pre-pandemic level — but other days it drops without warning to a third of what it once was — or less.

“The companies are still not operating like before” Herron said. “I don’t think they ever will again.”

Locked In

The challenges facing underground retailers are a combination of shifting demand and the constraint on spaces that are by their very nature difficult to update said David Greensfelder a consultant who has taught planning for the Urban Land Institute a research and public policy group.

Invisible from the sidewalk they can’t pivot to catch the attention of casual passers-by when commuter traffic slows.

“If you’re looking for a newspaper and you’re already above ground you’re probably not going to go underground to buy that newspaper” Greensfelder said.

From her shop beneath Houston’s streets Herron put it even more bluntly: “The rhythm for somebody like me who has been in this same location for 30 years has to be reinvented.”

Houston’s 6 miles of tunnels are largely linked to the surface by entrances in the lobbies of office buildings above them and the fate of individual sections has hinged on the choices of the businesses overhead leaving parts of the system worse off than others according to Robert Pieroni director of economic development for Central Houston Inc. a downtown business association. That system can also provide a welcome relief in a Gulf Coast city plagued by high temperatures and humidity.

From his station as a cook at Treebeard’s restaurant under downtown Houston about a quarter-mile from Herron’s flower shop Wendell Malone watched as the pandemic emptied the tunnels. Now he estimates the restaurant serves about 400 people a day about two-thirds as many as it did before the pandemic.

In Chicago where five miles of tunnels connect transit stations to some of the city’s most prominent buildings and provide a respite from the frigid winter weather the picture is more dire.

The city’s main downtown business association said that through June traffic counts in the tunnels lingered near 40% of pre-pandemic levels even as monthly averages on above-ground streets have doubled that figure hitting 80% or more.

Canada’s two largest underground retail venues in Toronto and Montreal have fared better thanks to being integrated differently into the fabric of life in the cities above.

Largest Underground Retail Complex

With more than 17 miles of tunnels and 4 million square feet of retail space including convenience stores theaters and medical services the Toronto PATH network holds the Guinness World Record for largest underground shopping complex.

Fellow cold-climate city Montreal has an underground retail system that's likewise among the largest in the world.

But unlike many U.S. developments both systems connect not only transit and offices but convention centers multiple stadiums and residential buildings creating a user base more resilient to office attendance shifts.

Still fluctuating traffic has hit underground retail hard according to Bradley Jones head of retail for Toronto-based Oxford Property Group the largest commercial landlord in Toronto.

While Oxford doesn’t track PATH traffic specifically Jones said retailers in the food court connected to the underground network are only back to about 50% of their pre-pandemic top-line sales.

“Tuesday Wednesday Thursday — in some cases they're getting back to pre-COVID numbers but when you average it over the five days it’s less” he said.

With a hybrid work model appearing to be the norm for some time to come finding ways to flex with the crowds such as dynamic scheduling and inventorying will probably be required.

To meet the challenge Oxford is looking to leverage the convenience factor of the tunnels pivoting away from commuter dependency and toward lifestyle tenants such as medical and legal offices gyms and other fitness tenants.

Seeing the Light

The overall gloomy outlook for the subterranean segment comes with at least one bright spot: The newest underground developments seem to have come back stronger from the pandemic lows.

Typically built around a central often atrium-style core newer underground developments are generally designed with more external features in mind with all aspects of the project including the architecture and the leasing strategy designed to draw pedestrians from outside rather than simply serving as an amenity for the offices above.

MarketPlace 28 a four-story 200000-square-foot retail development retrofitted below the 28 Liberty building in New York by China-based owner Fosun in 2018 has large banks of windows lighting a vertical well that drops through all four stories. The below-grade development is anchored by a theater at its lowest level a move intended to draw users down and through the retail space said Gensler lead retail designer Jason Carney who worked on the project.

“It’s not dependent at all on commuters or commuter patterns” said Carney. “It’s an entertainment destination.”

In Houston one of the newest developments connected to city tunnels is Understory a two-story atrium beneath the Bank of America Tower completed by Skanska in 2019 with similar design principles: ample daylight carried downward through an atrium-style core and strong sightlines from street level.

The goal was to lure more visitors than the building’s office users said Matt Damborsky Skanska’s executive vice president for Houston who oversaw the design of the lower-level space.

“We wanted to say ‘Hey the tunnel’s down here’” said Damborsky. “We were hyper-focused on creating a space that not only people in the building could use but also people could come in off the street and use.”

Direct comparisons are hard to come by but Damborsky said his impression was that Understory fared better than other parts of Houston’s tunnel system during the pandemic. Seven of its nine storefronts are occupied.

For spaces that can’t be reoriented to include natural light and street-level visibility Gensler’s Carney said he thinks the key will be creating more abstract types of “visibility” to the above-ground world including using tech tools to draw shoppers and space enhancements such as art installations as well as a leasing strategy that prioritizes a destination-making tenant mix over simply pushing rents.

Especially for older tunnel-and-hub developments whether they survive may hang on whether other drivers are able to take the place of a five-day-a-week office crowd.

“Rent is a function of sales and sales is a function of being able to capture demand” the Urban Land Institute's Greensfelder said. “So if the demand has left you do the math.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL25ldy15b3JrL3dhbnRhZ2gvbWFuLWNhdWdodC10cnlpbmctcm9iLWJhbmstcG9saWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man Caught For Trying To Rob Bank: Police,"SEAFORD NY — Police have made an arrest in connection to an attempted bank robbery earlier in the week.

Applications for a change of use of the properties have been submitted by commercial agents Savills on behalf of the applicant The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited of London.

New plans have been drawn up to convert ancillary retail units on the first floor of the Rivergate Arcade in Peterborough into flats.

The aim of the venture is to find a new use for what are currently empty ancillary retail units.

The proposals seek to turn the units into self-contained residential studio flats of various sizes between 39 square metres to 53 square metres for one or two occupants.

A spokesperson for the arcade owners has been contacted for a response.

Rivergate is also one of eight key development sites making up a £600 million transformation of Peterborough and is seen as providing an opportunity for a new gateway into the city centre and to the Embankment and Fletton Quays.

And as part of that change the issue of creating new apartments with ground floor restaurant and retail uses has been a subject of discussions between the owners of the Riverside Arcade and the city council.

The proposed conversion is one of many developments in Peterborough changing city centre offices into apartments driven by changes in retail and the trend for home working which means companies do need as much office space.",,,,,,,,,

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"“Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?” asked a 1921 Ladies Home Journal article. Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

Warren Buffett has lived through 26 periods where the S&P 500 was in a bear market. Eleven of them came after he first invested in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.41%) (BRK.B 0.30%) in 1965.

The legendary investor has led Berkshire to trounce the market during the past 57 years. His decisions made during major downturns made a big difference in his overall performance. Here's what Buffett does in bear markets -- and you should too.

1. Don't be afraid

One of Buffett's most famous quotes is: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful."" During bear markets many investors are fearful. But that's exactly the time when Buffett isn't afraid at all.

In 2008 and 2009 the stock market reeled as the U.S. economy experienced what would be called the Great Recession. Anyone who lived through this time knows how scary it was for most investors.

However Buffett wrote in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders after the dust settled ""It's been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend."" That's almost certainly still his view during the current bear market.

2. Put your money to work

In that shareholder letter Buffett also wrote ""We've put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years."" He wasn't exaggerating.

At the beginning of 2008 Berkshire's cash position stood at $44.3 billion. Over the next two years the company retained operating earnings of around $17 billion. But Berkshire finished 2009 with a cash stockpile of $30.6 billion. Buffett practiced what he preached by being greedy when others were fearful.

Guess what the multibillionaire is doing in this bear market? Putting Berkshire's money to work. So far in 2022 Buffett and his investment managers have bought 16 stocks. He's especially loaded up on shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.08%). Berkshire now owns a 17.4% stake in the oil and gas company. Oxy has been a big winner with its shares more than doubling year to date.

One common denominator in all the stocks that Buffett buys is that he looks for high-quality businesses at an attractive price. As he wrote in early 2009 ""Whether we're talking about socks or stocks I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.""

That's a smart approach for all investors. Most stocks are available right now at a discount to their prices last year. However not all of them have quality underlying businesses.

3. Think long-term

Regardless of what the economy or the stock market is doing Buffett always maintains a long-term perspective. During the dark period in the midst of the Great Recession he wrote to Berkshire shareholders:

Amid this bad news however never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past... America has had no shortage of challenges. Without fail however we've overcome them. In the face of those obstacles -- and many others -- the real standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven-fold during the 1900s while the Dow Jones Industrials rose from 66 to 11497. Compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during which humans secured only tiny gains if any in how they lived. Though the path has not been smooth our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has and it will continue to do so. America's best days lie ahead.

The current state of affairs isn't nearly as bad as it was in 2008 and 2009. This bear market presents a huge opportunity for long-term investors who aren't afraid to put their money to work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2hvbWVzL2FkdmVydGlzaW5nLWZlYXR1cmVzL2hpc3RvcmljYWwtcGFsbS1zcHJpbmdzLWVzdGF0ZS1saXN0ZWQtZm9yLTMtNW0tMjYwNTQwMy_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9ob21lcy9hZHZlcnRpc2luZy1mZWF0dXJlcy9oaXN0b3JpY2FsLXBhbG0tc3ByaW5ncy1lc3RhdGUtbGlzdGVkLWZvci0zLTVtLTI2MDU0MDMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historical Palm Springs estate listed for $3.5M,"The first estate to introduce the two-story layout to Palm Springs in 1933 has hit the market for $3498000.

The first estate to introduce the two-story layout to Palm Springs in 1933 has hit the market for $3498000. Sandra Quinn of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties has been selected to represent the home at 466 S. Patencio Road in the Historic Tennis Club community one of the city’s oldest and most exclusive neighborhoods.

The estate is one of famed architect Wallace Neff’s signature designs. He was largely responsible for developing the region’s distinguished architecture often referred to as “the California style.” Neff originally designed the home as a gardener’s cottage belonging to a larger estate which was then owned by the heir of the Singer Sewing Machine fortune. Before the property was divided into several separate estates the main home and cottage were the first of their kind in Palm Springs to feature more than one level.

“This estate is not only rich in its history but also in its design and attention to detail” Quinn said. “It offers remarkable highlights and features that most can only dream of including dual-level kitchens custom tile and ironwork throughout Moorish arches an owned solar panel system and panoramic views of the San Jacinto Mountains.”

Situated on roughly a quarter-acre lot the home underwent substantial improvements in the 1950s upgrading and expanding the indoor living quarters while giving it a Moroccan-inspired facelift with Moorish-inspired accents throughout. The estate features four bedrooms four baths a three-car garage two kitchens an attached casita multilevel patios and a resort-style yard.

Enclosed by private iron gates the Palm Springs getaway welcomes guests through a secluded courtyard and outdoor seating lounge which leads to the upstairs main entry. Once inside the 3306 square feet of indoor living space the grand foyer guides residents into the formal dining and living room. Lined from wall to wall with French doors the living room grants seamless access to an expansive second-level patio.

Each level of the home is equipped with a kitchen including the backyard’s complete outdoor cooking area which showcases a built-in barbecue and poolside island seating. The main level also features an indoor kitchen with white wood finishes and all black appliances. Just upstairs is the home’s largest kitchen with stainless steel appliances and oversized French doors that open to a separate balcony overlooking the surrounding mountain ranges.

The upstairs primary suite showcases a spa-like bath equipped with custom tile glass countertops an oversized walk-in closet and shower. The room also offers direct access to a secluded outdoor terrace with sweeping views of the backyard’s sparkling cobalt blue tiled pool. On the lower level residents can enjoy an oversized family room and office a casita tucked away with its own patio and entrance an elongated outdoor patio an outdoor fire pit and lounge area.

The property’s location within the Historic Tennis Club is just steps away from Tahquitz Canyon’s popular hiking trails and a block to the heart of town with many shops and restaurants. The neighborhood features some of the first buildings that were built in Palm Springs with 11 of its structures on the historic registry. The community is known for bringing world-class tennis to the desert and is home to renowned architectural designs and hotels.

DALLAS - The legend of Shaquille O’Neal has moved to Dallas with the Hall of Famer having recently acquired a home in Carrollton.

And now that he's here? He's becoming a generous neighbor last week picking up the tab for a couple of shoppers at Best Buy and then also handing out cash and hot meals to folks in need.

The final sale price of the home is unknown the property was last listed at about $1.22 million. (See more here.)

But the value of the former NBA star who began with the Orlando Magic and who reached great heights with the Los Angeles Lakers may be priceless when it comes to bumping into him around DFW.

Here's his cash-register help at the Best Buy ... The encounter was caught on video and posted to Instagram on July 4.

And here's the same Instagram account Hot Freestyle posting another video of O'Neal on July 6 giving a woman in need a hot meal and money.

DFW is not necessarily the home base of O'Neal who grew up in Texas in San Antonio before becoming a world-wide figure. He's got a few places to hang his hat. O’Neal reportedly sold his 31000-square-foot mansion in Windermere Florida last October for a price of $11 million. … leaving him some spare change to finally have a place in DFW to call home … all in addition to his home in the Ladera Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles (Hollywood!) and his 14-acre compound near Atlanta home of the “NBA on TNT” studios.

As it continues to churn out movies at a brisk pace the company has become known for using movie magic to assemble scenes that look very different from what was actually shot. For example Elizabeth Olsen and John Krasinski appeared together in a fan favorite scene in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” but Olsen later revealed that she never actually met Krasinski.

It appears that the same kind of trickery went into making “Thor: Love and Thunder.” In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly Natalie Portman revealed that one of her favorite scenes in the film was shot in the unlikeliest of places.

“There’s one scene that’s one of the most visually beautiful scenes I’ve seen on film and we shot [it] in real life in a Best Buy parking lot” Portman said. “It’s so wild to be on this size of movie and we were literally in a parking lot with a blue screen doing this really dramatic thing. It looks so stunning on film but every time I see it I’m like ‘That’s a Best Buy parking lot.’”

Portman did not specify which scene she was referring to leaving fans to speculate about which scene most closely resembles a Best Buy parking lot. While she noted that it’s the most beautiful scene in the movie that doesn’t necessarily mean it was the most beautiful scene they shot. In a recent interview with IndieWire Portman spoke about her fondness for many scenes that were ultimately cut from the film.

“There were whole sequences planets characters and worlds that didn’t end up in the movie that were hilarious and amazing and [that] we spent a lot of time and energy on and certainly the entire crew also designing and conceiving” Portman said. “It’s just amazing how much great material is not in the film considering how much great material is in it. Usually it’s like you’re just trying to get enough good stuff to put in the film and this had overflow. So that was really surprising.”

We rounded up four of the most popular chocolate frostings at the grocery store and tested to see which ranked highest in overall taste amongst testers and how each of the differing chocolate flavors would complement your baking endeavors best.

Southern Living

For that reason we chose an array of chocolate frostings that each had a little something unique. Read on to find the best store-bought chocolate frosting to try now ranked from testers' most favorite to least.

Winner: Betty Crocker Rich & Creamy Milk Chocolate Frosting

Betty Crocker

This one stood out amongst the crowd most prominently in terms of nostalgia with testers relating this longtime classic spread to memories of Easter bunny cakes made with grandmothers and bake sale cupcakes made with mothers. Creamy and easily spreadable this frosting is made to the flavor of milk chocolate which means it is not quite as indulgent in terms of cocoa as it is sugar.

Some testers noted a subtle sour cream tinge underneath all the sugar that seemed to help balance out the saccharine sweetness and make the frosting taste more old-fashioned. This super pliant and sweet chocolate frosting would pair quite well with our festive confetti Birthday Sheet Cake for any chocolate frosting lovers making for a low maintenance and wonderfully swirled top.

Runner-Up: Pillsbury Supreme Chocolate Fudge Frosting

Upon first glance testers were excited to try out this fudgy chocolate frosting that was much darker in color smooth and shiny than some of the other frostings with one tester noting that the frosting was ""wetter"" than the others which could in turn make it more easily spread onto desserts.

Again this frosting had the notable sweetness of most store-bought frostings but the fudgy dark chocolate factor made it seem more balanced in flavor with at least one tester again noting an underlying sour cream note that made it seem more homemade overall.

Third Place: Betty Crocker Whipped Chocolate Frosting

Here texture is what makes this particular frosting different from the rest. If you prefer airy and light frostings this new recipe by Betty Crocker would fit the bill. Testers were pleasantly surprised when dipping spoons into the springy and incredibly fluffy frosting and most noted that the lighter texture made the chocolate flavor shine through better and the characteristic sweetness less noticeable.

Imagine the super airy frosting used on Publix store-bought cakes and you're off to a good start. It almost tastes mousse-like upon first bite which seemed a crowd-pleasing divergence from the usual texture of store-bought frostings and had more than one tester going back for another try. We'd say it makes a quick and complementary substitute to sandwich between and top the denser layers of our Coca Cola Chocolate Cake.

Fourth Place: Duncan Hines Creamy Chocolate Buttercream Frosting

Duncan Hines

This well-known store-bought frosting initially intrigued testers with a seemingly much thicker darker and stiffer appearance than some of the other frostings and while the richer consistency was commended by some the lack of spreadability was a point of contention when discussing how easily it would work with something more tender like a cupcake.

The recipe boasts no high fructose corn syrup which testers noted as a plus but the saccharine sweetness was said to still be at the forefront of their taste buds. Overall we could see the denser texture and rich color being a good option for those in need of a sturdy frosting that won't leak or spill out such as when filling our Sprinkle Sandwich Cookies.

No matter the type of indulgent chocolate treat you're making there is a store-bought option to help quicken things up."

This is due to the many economic issues that eat away at your savings. Inflation for example is increasing the cost of gas groceries and other daily necessities. The COVID-19 pandemic on the other hand has thrown a wrench into many people’s personal finances.

Starting Your Investment Journey

This infographic from BlackRock introduces their MyMap range of multi-asset investment funds and describes the benefits to first-time investors.

Today’s Savings Struggles

The above infographic highlighted three savings struggles that make it difficult to meet your future financial goals.

The first is inflation which refers to the increase in prices of goods and services over time. To understand how inflation can erode the value of your savings consider this example:

£100 worth of goods in 2000 would cost £179 in 2021

£100 worth of goods in 1980 would cost £456 in 2021

In other words inflation reduces the purchasing power of your savings over time.

The second savings struggle is increasing longevity also known as longer life expectancies. Living a longer life is generally a good thing but it does increase the risk of outliving your savings. Coming up with a solid retirement plan is becoming more important than ever.

A third struggle is the COVID-19 pandemic which appears to be having a long-term impact on UK households. In a December 2021 survey UK families were asked to rate their financial situation following the pandemic. Of the 5770 respondents only 38% said they were “financially secure”.

How MyMap Can Help First-Time Investors

Investing has the potential to generate inflation-beating returns. This not only protects your wealth from erosion but may help it grow over time.

Unfortunately just 33% of Brits are currently investing in the stock market. To improve this ratio BlackRock developed the MyMap range of investment funds which are designed to be approachable for first-time investors. This means that simplicity is a top priority.

As shown below each MyMap fund is diversified across several types of assets. Or to put it another way diversification means spreading your savings across different types of investments to mitigate the risk of any particular one performing poorly. In this case diversification is achieved through a single product.

Fund Allocation to Equities (%) Allocation to Bonds (%) Allocation to Alternatives (%) MyMap 3 22% 75% 3% MyMap 3 Select ESG 26% 74% 0% MyMap 4 45% 52% 3% MyMap 4 Select Income 33% 67% 0% MyMap 5 64% 33% 3% MyMap 5 Select ESG 64% 36% 0% MyMap 6 82% 15% 3% MyMap 7 Select ESG 100% 0% 0%

MyMap funds also vary by the amount of risk they take with a lower number signifying less risk. This is why MyMap 3 is heavily weighted towards bonds which are relatively safer than equities. MyMap 6 takes the opposite approach by investing heavily in equities which offer greater return potential at the cost of higher risk.

Generally speaking MyMap 3 is suitable for shorter-term goals (like buying a new car) while MyMap 6 is suitable for longer-term goals (like retirement).

Putting Your Money to Work

For over 30 years BlackRock’s mission has been to help people build better financial futures. The MyMap range embodies this by giving new investors a simple one-stop solution for whatever their goals may be.

He’s a stranger in one of those towns that doesn’t take too kindly to strangers. He’s well-dressed and missing an arm and carries himself as if a tornado wouldn’t rattle him so we have to assume he’s a detective of some sort although it’s never quite made clear. Nevertheless everyone tries to rattle him from the hotel clerk to a local roughneck played by Lee Marvin. And who among us would not be intimidated by Lee Marvin?

Well Spencer Tracy for one. He plays the stranger John J. Macreedy in the 1955 classic Bad Day at Black Rock and he is sure of his mission throughout. He has come to the town of Black Rock to find the whereabouts of a resident named Komoko who has seemingly gone missing. Why exactly he’s searching for this man is unclear at first and what happened to Komodo is unclear. It is clear though that everyone in town knows what happened and they’re not telling. The Hotel Clerk is hostile the town sheriff is a drunk the cowboys glare at him and all the residents seem cowed by a local landowner named Reno Smith (Robert Ryan).

That’s pretty much all there is to the story but the film doesn’t need anything else. The Duffer Brothers could stand to take notes; there are no wasted shots actions lines of dialogue or moments of film. Everything serves the story. In fact the first scene sets the basic tone of the film and then every scene progressively increases the tension from the scene that came before it. As we watch Macreedy close in on the truth we also watch the town close in on him. By the last act it seems highly doubtful he’s going to make it out of Black Rock alive. Paul Thomas Anderson has said that aspiring filmmakers should skip film school and watch this movie. As the streaming series has become the dominant narrative form we seem to have lost our taste for lean taut stories with no needless subplots. We mistake bloat for “epic” storytelling. This one is tight as a drum.

Thrillers of the era tended to be fairly no nonsense and Bad Day at Black Rock is one that straddles genres: its setting is Western and its storyline is noir. Certainly the stranger who gets off the line at the town that doesn’t want him is a classic noir storyline although he’s usually shadowed in night not exposed in the full light of high noon. Critics of the time and today have tended to praise the “social conscience” of the film the way it deals with racism conformity and arguably the stifling atmosphere of 50s McCarthyism but the noir was always the closest Hollywood ever came to social realism in film. The protagonists are always social outsiders and outcasts. They’re always trying to catch a break in a society that simply won’t let them.

There’s also a classical tragedy aspect to noirs that I’ve seldom seen discussed a feeling that one’s fate is inescapable no matter how man struggles against it. Here in a strange way Mcreedy is not so far removed from Antigone with the same deep sense of responsibility to the dead against all opposition from the larger society. Here too respect for the dead amounts to civil disobedience and Smith is even a sort of mad king.

Admittedly this might seem a bit of a stretch but another thing that happens when you tell a pared down and simple story: it takes on the character of a parable. The town of Black Rock is moldering away and falling apart rotted from within by the dark secret it keeps but sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say and the town has plenty of that. Is the evil at the heart of town the anti-Japanese racism unleashed by the Second World War? Bigotry more generally? Greed and dishonestly? Closed societies where everyone has an eye on each other? I suspect the reason it’s still a perfect film is it has room to take on all those themes but it’s still just a story of one guy who’s trying to find out what happened to another guy.

Circle Internet Financial CEO Jeremy Allaire



By Matt Taibbi / Substack

Subscribers have noticed that it’s been quiet on this site for a while. This is because I spent much of the last month researching the #CryptoCrash and the last week and a half engaged in an increasingly maddening search for a civilized and respectful way to write about one particular actor: Circle Internet Financial makers of USDC at $55 billion the second-biggest stablecoin in the world.

I’m giving up the hunt for “civilized and respectful.” That dog lived a long life but it now must be taken out and shot. I’ve dealt with many frustrating institutions from Bank of America to the press office of the FSB but none produced such headaches. They’re the mother of all black boxes and God help anyone invested in them.

Trouble started with one question. On April 12 Circle announced it had raised $400 million with investments from BlackRock Fidelity Marshall Wace and Fin Capital noting BlackRock and Circle had entered into a “broader strategic partnership” that would include “exploring capital market applications for USDC” that would “drive the next evolution of Circle’s growth.” This would involve the establishment of a new BlackRock-managed government money market fund the Circle Reserve Fund through which BlackRock would become “a primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves.”

Sources called with concerns. The fund’s registration statement says “shares are only available for purchase by Circle Internet Financial LLC.” Not only is this unusual — one legal expert I spoke with said he’d “never seen such a fund… available for sale solely to a single entity” — but it raised a potentially troublesome issue for USDC holders. If Circle is to be the sole counterparty to a reserve fund that would mean reserves would belong to the company not its users. This could raise the same issue that recently dogged its partner the digital exchange Coinbase when it revealed in an SEC filing that “In the event of a bankruptcy the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors.”

The firm insisted “your funds are safe with Coinbase” but as noted in another story coming out today the damage was done and the news triggered market mayhem. Coinbase isn’t the same kind of company as Circle but the issue of bankruptcy remoteness is relevant to both. It’s at the core of the whole dilemma of the cryptocurrency markets. Certainly the question of who actually owns and controls reserve assets exists or seems to exist. Here Circle is unlike some competitors whose user agreements specifically spell out that reserves are say “fully backed by US dollars held by Paxos Trust Company LLC” or “custodied pursuant to the Custody Agreement entered into by and between you and Gemini Trust Company LLC.” Those describe trust agreements which are truly bankruptcy remote.

Circle’s BlackRock fund suggested a different arrangement. Also the new fund would be “permitted to invest up to one-third of its total assets in reverse repurchase agreements.” Would Circle be making use of that provision?

After 2008 we learned some firms really hated being boring old depository banks because regulators didn’t allow them to do anything really risky with giant sums of customer cash they held that could easily earn huge returns at scale. It’s like walking into a casino with a trillion dollars in chips and being barred from all the really fun tables. This is how the so-called “London Whale” episode took place. A wing of JP Morgan Chase called the Chief Investment Office whose ostensible purpose was to reduce risk at the company started to make enormous returns of $400 million or more on trades its officers didn’t feel were directional bets at all but hedges. The company felt these trades were only sort of risky. “We believed that what we were doing at the time was consistent with [American accounting practices]” is how one executive later described their attitude.

Then those “hedges” turned into giant suckholes of loss and instead of unwinding them the bank doubled down and next thing you knew they had a $12 billion bomb crater and Elizabeth Warren was screaming at an eye-rolling Jamie Dimon on television.

After 2008 remember Chase had the reputation of being Wall Street’s “good bank” or at least the non-stupid one with the New York Times even describing Dimon as Barack Obama’s “favorite banker.” But the London Whale episode revealed the company’s extreme impatience with the idea that they owed it to anybody either regulators or depositors to refrain from engaging in certain types of risky behavior. This impatience was written all over executives’ faces at subsequent Senate hearings.

The big tell always is when finance executives start giving what one analyst described to me as “nuanced answers to yes and no questions.” In the Whale episode Michigan Senator Carl Levin had to ask repeatedly if the bank had lied when it said in a public conference call that the chief banking regulator the OCC was getting data about those infamous trades on a “regular and recurring basis.” Chase Vice Chairman Douglas Braunstein kept talking around the question first saying “I believed it to be a true statement at the time” that the bank was being “fully transparent” with regulators then hedging again and again and again before finally conceding “They did not get the detailed positions regularly.”

Getting back to Circle I reached out with simple questions. Do USDC holders bear bankruptcy risk or not? Will they be making money lending their reserves or not? The firm at first was solicitous and seemed anxious to educate about their company structure. Then the answers became contradictory. Then they became “nuanced.” Finally there was so much spin the company’s name began to make unpleasantly ironic sense.

For instance Circle “is not a trust” but believes it holds funds in trust; USDC both is and is not a virtual currency (it may be a “stored value product”); and in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy USDC holders would be “shielded from Circle creditors” although nothing is bullet-proof and of course there’s risk. How are USDC holders shielded from Circle creditors and “separated from a bankruptcy estate”? According to the firm customers first of all are guarded “per the protections afforded under state money transmission laws.”

Without being cheeky this is a little like saying the DMV is making sure you’re driving safely. Moreover Circle is only regulated in the states where Circle has licenses and the firm has obtained licenses only in those states were licenses are required (what happens to USDC holders in Wisconsin Minnesota and Wyoming for instance?). Beyond that by their own public admission “not all states in which we are licensed regulate virtual currency activity as money transmission.”

Regarding the BlackRock fund’s provision allowing them to borrow up to a third of the reserves I learned that government money market funds typically do not borrow but also that the company would enjoy access to the Fed and its repo borrowing program.

The dealbreaker came after reading Circle’s User Agreement which contains the following passage:

Circle is not a fiduciary and Circle does not provide any trust or fiduciary services to any User in the course of such User visiting accessing or using the Circle website or services.

I had reason to be surprised to learn that Circle is not a fiduciary and does not provide any trust or fiduciary services. When I expressed that surprise to a Circle spokesperson recalling certain recent communications involving the exact word “fiduciary” their response was:

The paragraph cited from the Circle Account User Agreement refers to Circle’s custody of supported digital assets in a Circle-hosted wallet and does not relate to USDC reserves management.

Answers don’t get much more “nuanced” than this. The company was now saying Circle is not a fiduciary and does not provide any trust or fiduciary services to anyone visiting accessing or using the Circle website or services unless those services involve the company’s management of USDC reserves. In that case the firm does believe it has a fiduciary responsibility with respect to reserve funds as required by state law ostensibly in those states where Circle both has a license and virtual currency is regulated as money transmission.

Asked where exactly its reserves are right now the company replied:

As we have shared publicly the cash portion of the reserve is held with a number of banking partners including Silvergate Bank Signature Bank and New York Community Bank. The US Treasury bills are purchased by BlackRock and are held in custody at BNYMellon. We have not published a detailed breakdown of how much cash is held with which bank partner. We are working with many leading banks to onboard them and add them to our group of partners.

This is a non-answer. Circle discloses where some of its reserves are but not all and not how much of what is where. Now Circle separately features a Yield program which offers guaranteed returns. These were never as high as Terra’s preposterous and obviously Ponzoid 20% guaranteed returns which quickly attracted $60 billion that vanished even more quickly but the program exists nonetheless at one time offering 12-month yields as high as 10.75%.

In the time it’s taken to write this piece the guaranteed return has dropped from 6% to 1% to 0.5%. In characteristic fashion Circle’s web page on the subject contains both the incorrect statement “Circle Yield’s interest rates offer superior returns compared to traditional fixed-income investments” like 1 month CDs and 8-week T-bills — this is no longer true — and the correct statement “In comparison to traditional fixed-income investments products like Circle Yield can offer superior returns.”

The company maintains that the program is relatively small that there “is currently less than $300M in loan volume outstanding for the Circle Yield program” and “no ‘exposure’ as we are over-collateralized at 125%.” (It is “over-collateralized” by plummeting Bitcoin). All the same the company began this past Tuesday July 5 to allow customers with active loans to withdraw funds from Circle Yield before the conclusion of those loans with no penalty until August 2 2022 at 11:59PM ET. Asked why they did this the firm said:

There is currently much uncertainty in the digital asset lending and borrowing markets. Circle Yield is a regulated 125% overcollareralized fixed-term product offered to businesses only and has performed as designed during these turbulent times with borrower margin calls being met in a timely fashion to sustain the 125% overcollaterlization. However we recognize that our customers might wish to withdraw their assets entirely from these markets at this extraordinary time… We have made a one-time change to the legal product structure to enable all our customers to withdraw their funds if they so wish during this time of uncertainty.

Make of that what you will. Meanwhile the firm also believes federal bankruptcy laws should protect USDC holders but this belief depends on the notion which Circle states for the record that “USDC reserves are held in segregated accounts for the benefit of USDC holders not Circle” and “USDC reserve funds are held for the benefit of USDC token holders” because “Circle does not and will not use USDC holders’ money to run its business or pay its debts.”

If Circle does not and will not use USDC holders’ money to run its business how is it projecting to earn $438 million in revenues from its USDC reserves this year and over $2.188 billion next year? Again is USDC a utility-like product content to earn little caring for giant piles of money or more like a profiteering financial firm that earns money creatively leveraging up its assets? This raises another question that first came up last year. If Circle is holding its reserves in segregated accounts strictly for the benefit of customers why was it at least at one time keeping a not-insignificant portion of its reserves in commercial paper and instruments like Yankee CDs?

Last summer after Allaire announced plans to go public via a $4.5 billion SPAC deal Coinbase said that all of its USDC holdings were “backed by a dollar in a bank account.” As Bloomberg wrote the promise “was important for the stablecoin which unlike Bitcoin has a set price and can be redeemed by users for regular currency.”

However after being contacted in August by Bloomberg reporter Joe Light Coinbase president Emilie Choi began issuing a series of amended statements on Twitter for instance: “We know that a lot of customers get USDC on Coinbase and we previously said that every USDC is ‘backed by a dollar in a bank account.’ Our language could have been clearer here.”

Circle then said that it had been backed entirely by cash until March 2021 when it began to buy U.S. Treasuries to “accommodate the coin’s rapid growth” as Bloomberg wrote. In fact the very first time that Circle made a major disclosure in describing its reserve assets releasing in July of 2021 an attestation by what one former regulator chucklingly called a “grownup” auditor Grant Thornton it turned out only 61% of its reserves were in cash with a surprisingly high amount held in riskier or less liquid investments like corporate bonds and commercial paper:

A spokesperson for the company also said that as the news outlet put it “the coin’s reserves moved to a broader portfolio of investments in May 2021.” In other words by a seemingly extraordinary coincidence Circle only branched out into riskier investments in the exact month before its first major audit-like disclosure and just before Bloomberg ran a story saying that the “backed by a dollar in a bank account” representation was “not true.”

The response was brutal. “You can’t market a product with falsities” Columbia Law School lecturer Lev Menand told Light. Such companies “say trust us and that’s all well and good until there’s a problem” was how Georgetown professor Adam Levitin put it.

Circle from there began to make new gestures toward transparency publishing regular attestations from Grant Thornton each of which appeared to show moves away from riskier holdings and toward cash and short-term treasuries. For example in July 2021 Grant Thornton attested that 47% of the assets backing USDC were cash and cash equivalents while 16% were in corporate bonds and 8% were in commercial paper. Within a month the auditor was saying 100% of Circle’s reserves were “cash and cash equivalents” although “Circle Internet Financial LLC’s management is responsible for its assertions.” Then in early December when Allaire testified before congress he said (emphasis mine):

The dollar-denominated reserves backing USDC are held conservatively in the care custody and control of the U.S. regulated banking system. These are strictly held in cash and short-duration U.S. treasuries and we have consistently reported on the status of these reserves and their sufficiency to meet demands for USDC outstanding with third party attestations from a leading global accounting firm.

Strictly speaking this wasn’t true. Circle had indeed reported on its reserves but hadn’t done so in detail until that spring of 2021 when it announced a sudden move into riskier investments. The Grant Thornton attestations soon after began dropping the detailed breakdowns from its reports and moreover tweaked its language from saying reserve accounts were “correctly stated” to “fairly stated.” These reports include the curious lines “Circle Internet Financial LLC’s management is responsible for its assertion” and “Individuals who acquire and utilize USDC tokens and other crypto assets are responsible for informing themselves of the general risks and uncertainties.” The firm in its most recent “report” used the word “opinion” four times and “audit” zero times. Grant Thornton did not respond to requests for clarification as to whether or not they consider these reports audits though the company Circle considers itself audited.

Circle’s rep has always been as the good crypto not a target of armies of short-sellers like Tether. As far back as 2018 it made news by ostensibly seeking to become the “first cryptocurrency company to obtain a banking license” and the company over the years has emphasized that it is “focused on providing even greater transparency quality and scale for USDC reserves” because “trust and transparency are our ultimate goals.” Four years after it first declared its intention to be the first coin with a bank license we’re still reading headlines like “Circle Will Apply for U.S. Crypto Bank Charter in ‘Near Future’” in the hopes now of becoming the fourth stablecoin to get licensed. The company does not believe current law allows it to become a bank but similar companies didn’t seem to have had a problem.

None of this has dented Circle’s momentum or reputation. In fact in mid-February Circle and its partner Bob Diamond’s Concord Acquisition Corporation announced they were doubling the size of their SPAC (click here for a TK video refresher on what a SPAC is). The February agreement set the value of the new Concord-Circle deal at a whopping $9 billion with a big chunk of that value they said coming from the booming success of USDC in the marketplace:

The new agreement… reflects improvements in Circle’s financial outlook and competitive position – particularly the growth and market share of USDC one of the fastest growing dollar digital currencies. USDC’s circulation has more than doubled… reaching $52.5 billion as of February 16 2022.

Diamond is perhaps best known for bringing American-style huge CEO compensation to Europe and for stepping down as Barclays chief after Britain levied a then-record $92.7 million fine for manipulating the LIBOR interest rate benchmark. Less-well-remembered is his role in the largest bankruptcy in history Lehman Brothers an episode I wrote about in The Divide. After Barclays acquired the shipwrecked firm for pennies in September of 2008 the bank’s creditors sued claiming Barclays absconded with between $4 and $7.6 billion in funds owed to them through a variety of schemes. The creditors mostly lost that case which was eventually settled for $1.28 billion. This is relevant because the question of whether or not USDC reserves are truly bankruptcy remote is central to this story. Asked about this Circle replied “We are delighted by the support and involvement of all of our shareholders.”

Meanwhile the players from the Circle side have their own history. Jeremy Allaire and at least one other future Circle officer were accused in 2002 of making misleadingly positive statements about a failing product called Spectra while selling “over $53000000.00” of stock in their company Allaire Corporation in the first three quarters of 2000. In August of 2000 Allaire was asked about an annual goal of 100% growth and reportedly said “We definitely think that is achievable.” A month later the company announced a substantial third quarter loss and its share price dropped 40% in three days prompting the action.

Massachusetts District Judge William Young used remarkably strong language to reject a motion to dismiss the suit saying “It is difficult to conceive of a complaint pled with more particularity than the one presented” and “in many respects if this complaint is not specific enough no complaint is.” He added:

Essentially the Plaintiffs invested in a company which promised to build the best mousetrap ever. When it was done the mousetrap was ugly did not catch mice and as word got out people stopped buying.

The case was eventually settled for $12 million without an admission of wrongdoing. In conversations with former regulators some raised a question as to whether or not the Allaire Corporation case might prevent Circle officers from ever obtaining a banking license given that charters are only given to persons of “good character and responsibility.” Opinions on the matter were very mixed. However it was certainly not a non-issue.

“Any case involving alleged fraud will be a matter of great concern to the banking regulators” said former FDIC General Counsel Mike Krimminger. “If there were a settlement with no admission of guilt there might be explanation that could be acceptable to regulators but it will still be a real concern that could be fatal to an application.”

In any case when asked this week why that old story shouldn’t make investors in a different newer mousetrap nervous a Circle spokesperson replied:

The case settled without any finding of wrongdoing… The defendants disputed the factual allegations and as with the vast majority of securities class actions the case settled. The factual allegations were never tested in court and there is really nothing more to say about this 20 year old case.

In 2008 when reporters and investigators began pulling at the threads of terms like “fully hedged” or “triple-A tranche” they often found there was almost no way to stop pulling even if they wanted to. In fact by the time people stopped pulling the entire global financial system was basically a pile of string. It may very well be that the same experience awaits anyone who pulls at threads like “100% backed” or “secure wallet” or other such catch-phrases from any one of dozens of crypto companies. In other words these issues may not be unique to Circle. But make no mistake: this is the definition of an “opaque ledger.” If every crypto company will struggle this badly to answer basic questions like Where’s your money? or What’s your risk? the storm hasn’t even started yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5pZS9saWZlL2hlYWx0aC13ZWxsYmVpbmcvYWdlLXByb29mLXlvdXItcGVsdmljLWZsb29yLWFuZC1ib29zdC15b3VyLXNleC1saWZlLXdpdGgtZXhwZXJ0LXRpcHMtZm9yLWJlZm9yZS1kdXJpbmctYW5kLWFmdGVyLW1lbm9wYXVzZS80MTgyNjEyNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Age-proof your pelvic floor and boost your sex life with expert tips for before during and after menopause,"Often overlooked these muscles are a workhorse from holding your organs in place and keeping the urethra seal shut to improving your sex life it’s time we showed our pelvic floor a little love

Around one in two post-menopausal women have pelvic organ prolapse and one in four experience bowel incontinence. And at least 50pc of menopausal women suffer from pain with intercourse.

The issues related to pelvic floor dysfunction in and around menopause are many and common – but there are things you can do to future proof your pelvic floor health and minimise life-limiting symptoms.

“The most poignant change that influences the pelvic floor the vagina and the vulva around the menopause is a reduction in oestrogen” explains Helen Keeble a specialist pelvic health physiotherapist at the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin. “That means that all of our internal tissues become drier more fragile and thinner and it can also change the pH vaginally which makes you more at risk of thrush and urinary tract infections.”

In addition these changes are associated with a higher risk of troublesome conditions like stress and urge urinary incontinence and prolapse. Symptoms from previous birth injuries can also be triggered and exacerbated – but it’s important to remember that menopause doesn’t necessarily mean that things are destined to get worse Keeble stresses. “Menopause is just a risk factor. It all depends on how proactive you are and even if things are exacerbated they can be changed and improved.”

Specialist women’s health physiotherapist Maeve Whelan who is practice associate and founder of Milltown Physiotherapy in Dublin echoes this sentiment. “There’s a lot of chat where you’ll hear people say menopause caused stress incontinence for instance but it doesn’t cause it.

“If you have a functioning pelvic floor menopause isn’t going to come against you unless you get a huge amount of vaginal dryness – and even then normally if you do pelvic floor exercises that’ll compensate” she says.

Where there are structural issues such as tears in the fascia or a muscle however menopause can trigger symptoms in those who have previously been symptom free. “When there’s still that elasticity in the muscles your posture is great and so on you can get away with no symptoms – but when you start to load other factors onto it the symptoms start. Certainly oestrogen is a big part of it but over time the same way the muscles of the back and the glutes and so on get tighter and stiffer so do the pelvic floor muscles and many women end up tensing the pelvic floor even more.”

“It’s the same with prolapse” Whelan says. “The walls of the vagina mightn’t have come down much but when you put all the other factors in – age weight gain lacking fitness posture – they’ll come down further. That’s not just menopause causing it; the damage would’ve been there from childbirth.”

Pelvic floor issues can be categorised into four domains explains Whelan. The first covers issues related to the bladder including stress and urge urinary incontinence bladder urgency and over-active bladder. “People will have heard of latch key syndrome where the bladder activates the minute they put the key in the door and they don’t make it to the toilet” she notes.

Secondly there are symptoms related to the bowel which may include leaking or difficulty controlling wind but also commonly increased constipation and problem passing bowel movements. “This is more taboo unfortunately than bladder problems” says Whelan “but it’s very prevalent.”

Thirdly there’s pelvic floor support including issues like prolapse which is generally the result of injury to the pelvic floor muscles and the surrounding soft tissues during childbirth. “The symptoms tend to be that you can see or feel the wall of the bladder or the wall of the rectum coming down or a feeling of pressure or tension” says Whelan.

Finally many women suffer from pelvic pain sometimes to the point where sexual activity isn’t tolerable. “This is a huge and distressing one for women as there’s the double whammy of the pain and also not being able to enjoy sex. And it’s really prevalent – at least 50pc of menopausal women experience sexual dysfunction.”

So if you’re perimenopausal and have yet to develop symptoms like these what can you do to give yourself the best chance of good pelvic floor health throughout menopause? Keeble has four key pieces of advice. “Definitely do your pelvic floor exercises” she says – something that can prevent problems and symptoms further down the road but is also very effective after symptoms arise.

“It’s never ever too late. For most women pelvic floor exercises resolve the issue. With urinary incontinence for example for seven out of ten women the issues will be completely resolved with pelvic floor squeezes alone.

""That’s why all the evidence-based guidelines now say that every woman who has incontinence or prolapse should do at least a three or four-month programme before trying anything else. They really do work – it just takes time.”

Her second piece of advice is to avoid constipation at all cost. “This is one of the most crucial things to do to help reduce incontinence and prolapse. Straining on the toilet really weakens our pelvic floor. You can be doing all the squeezes but if you’re straining you negate all the benefits” she cautions.

Thirdly you need to learn to relax your tummy. “So many women have been told to hold their tummies in but it constantly puts pressure down on the pelvic floor and over time that can weaken it. Doing exercise that targets the core like yoga and pilates is fine – as long as you’re not clenching the core muscles all the time” Keeble explains which brings her to her fourth point.

“Being active in whatever way you enjoy is crucial for pelvic floor health as well. I see so many women who’ve had a hysterectomy or are post-menopausal and have been told that pilates is their only option but in reality – and the research is catching up to say this as well – life is too short to be forcing yourself to do something you don’t enjoy.""

“Being active in whatever way you enjoy is crucial for pelvic floor health as well. I see so many women who’ve had a hysterectomy or are post-menopausal and have been told that pilates is their only option but in reality – and the research is catching up to say this as well – life is too short to be forcing yourself to do something you don’t enjoy.

""As a physio I often encourage women I see to try high-impact exercise because of the benefits for bone health in menopause but nothing is off limits.” For Whelan this last point is crucial to any conversation on menopause wellness. “General fitness is really important” she says. “You have to correct any negative postural changes for the body to be more upright so that the load of the upper body doesn’t come down on the pelvic floor.”

This involves building strength in a wide range of muscle groups – from the abdominals to the hamstrings and the lower spine all of which help the pelvic floor. “The core in particular acts together with the pelvic floor. It’s the corset muscle that wraps around everything and by activating that muscle we can activate the pelvic floor system too” Whelan explains.

“But other big muscle groups are important as well: the back the hips the glutes. If they’re not strong there’s going to be more pressure from the body down on the pelvic floor.”

Whelan talks a lot about progressive loading and the encouraging evidence about the positive impact of high-intensity resistance and impact training on bone mass. “Random glute squeezes are not necessarily going to be enough” she explains. “You have to learn about the percentage increase – how many repetitions how many times a week – and build a challenging progression of these exercises.”

In an ideal world says Whelan everyone would see a qualified physiotherapist – but she’s aware that there’s a cost barrier and not everyone will be able to. “Yoga and pilates teachers understand progressive loading too and there are personal trainers at gyms who are qualified to help with this. But there’s any amount of websites that talk through these exercises as well.”

When and why to see a pelvic floor physiotherapist

“Prevention is always better than cure and we’re seeing an increase in women being proactive and coming to prevent problems in recent years which is great” says Keeble.

“But if you’re experiencing any pain at all in the pelvic floor go straight to the physio and we can help to diagnose what’s going on. Any symptoms related to the bladder the bowels or prolapse should be helped by pelvic floor exercises. If you’re experiencing painful sex we might need to do some release work to help the pelvic floor relax as well.”

The GP is a good place to start. They might know of physiotherapists to try and they can help with topical oestrogen – something that both Keeble and Whelan are keen to talk about. “Topical oestrogen applied to the vulva or vaginally negates all of the effects of the decline in the body’s natural oestrogen and it only takes a few weeks to help” says Keeble.

“At the moment you have to go to the GP to get it but it’s so safe such a low dose. Any woman I see who’s menopausal I tell them to go on it. Topical oestrogen and pelvic floor exercises combined are a really winning combination.”

“There are so many women of all age groups living with sexual pain chronic pelvic pain urethral pain rectal pain – they’re living with these horrific symptoms and they don’t have to” Whelan urges. “I like to empower women and get them away from the association of menopause that suggests leaking or pain are part of it. With pelvic floor muscle strengthening and posture so much can be done.”

How to do your pelvic floor exercises

⬤ Lie down and forget about the breath at the beginning.

⬤ Tighten the muscles around the back passage as if stopping wind and then lift across the vagina and to the front to the bladder as if trying to stop the flow of urine — so it’s all the way from the back to the front.

⬤ Don’t lift the chest don’t tighten the tummy don’t squeeze the buttocks. It should be an isolated squeeze.

⬤ Hold for five seconds then let it go and when you do nothing else should change — just let go of the pelvic floor. It’s important to treat each exercise like an elevator where the lift doesn’t just go all the way up but all the way down to the basement too.

⬤ Repeat ten times then do another ten three times a day.

⬤ As your strength improves start holding each squeeze for ten seconds – and then add fast contractions all the way in and all the way out ten times.

Avoiding constipation and straining

⬤ Guidelines say that we should be aiming for 30 different types of fibre per week which sounds like a lot but is actually very achievable once you start adding up all the different vegetables fruits and wholegrains.

⬤ In addition to fibre make sure that you’re getting enough water. Those who suffer from urinary incontinence can tend to limit their fluid intake because they worry about leakage but that’s a recipe for disaster. Aim for 1.5-2l water.

⬤ Movement is really important. As little as a 10-minute walk every day can help reduce the risk of constipation.

⬤ Put a step or stool under your feet when you go to the toilet to mimic a squatting position. This makes it physically easier to open the pelvic floor and allow the stool to come out more easily. When in that position with your knees wide and hips open try to breathe into your tummy so that it inflates. This will have the effect of a plunger as the diaphragm moves up and down.

⬤ After a three-to-six-month period reduce to a maintenance programme just once a day."

The call came in at about 7 p.m. after he was missing in the water.

Fire crews started searching both sides of the river using boats and rescue lines. They said the water is 15 to 18 feet deep in some spots.

Parts of Sayles and Fairmont streets were blocked off for a few hours as crews searched the area.



The Cumberland Water Rescue and Recovery Unit also responded to the scene.

They were the ones who found the body.

It was not immediately known if drugs or alcohol played a factor in the man's death.

Utah's Great Salt Lake.

Footen who works for a company called Earthviews that creates maps of aquatic and terrestrial environments noticed how much conditions have worsened.

""So 30 years ago we would not have been over there along the side of the mountain and there would have been a shoreline actually not a lake bed"" Footen told CBS News' John Blackstone.

Three decades ago the Great Salt Lake covered about 3000 square miles. Now at its lowest level ever recorded it covers less than a thousand. The decline has led to air quality issues in the midst of historic drought conditions.

""All the minerals from the mountains all the heavy metals from the mountains have been coming into this lake for thousands of years and if the lake bottom is completely dry then the wind picks up and creates dust storms that carry those heavy metals into the air and spread them around to urban areas like Salt Lake City"" Footen said.

To calculate how severe those dust storms could be scientists from the University of Utah biked across miles of land that was once underwater.

""The dust that comes off the lake is very visual"" said Dr. Kevin Perry a professor from the University of Utah. ""You can see this wall of dust and it reduces the visibility. And people are very concerned about what might be in the dust that they're breathing.""

To measure what might be in the dust Perry uses an instrument that mimics a dust storm.

""What that does is it creates a swirling wind inside this chamber that stimulates wind speeds of up to about 50 miles per hour"" Perry said.

What Perry discovered has raised serious health concerns for millions who live in the Salt Lake City region.

""I was looking at heavy metals and unfortunately we found very high concentrations of arsenic in the soil"" he said. ""And arsenic is concerning for a variety of reasons. It can lead to lung cancer skin cancer bladder cancer cardiovascular disease and diabetes.""

Preventing arsenic-contaminated dust storms requires getting more water into the Great Salt Lake. But that's no easy feat when Utah is in a megadrought with more than 20 years of below average precipitation.

Joel Ferry runs a farm along the Bear River. For five generations his family has been using water from the river to grow food and raise cattle.

""We have water rights to take that water"" Ferry said. ""And so what we try to do is we say 'Let's reduce the amount of water that we're taking out of the Bear by doing irrigation efficiency practices.'""

Efficiency is necessary since Ferry's water allocation was cut by 30% last year. So he installed drip irrigation for some of his crops. Meanwhile other fields have been carefully leveled to make better use of flood irrigation.

Ferry's commitment to saving water had led him to a new career. He said he was asked by Gov. Spencer Cox to serve as the executive director of the Department of Natural Resources. In his role Ferry will be tasked with convincing farmers industry and city dwellers in Utah to understand the importance of water conservation.

""We've got to get we've got to figure this out"" he said. ""It's not going to be cheap but there are solutions and we're creative.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9sZWFybi1tb3JlLWFib3V0LXdvbHZlcy82MDAxODc3NzQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State of Wolves: Learn more,"Read up on wolves follow them on social media or see some in person at places around Minnesota.

The 570 Washington Street joint-venture development team of Zeckendorf Development Atlas Capital Group and The Baupost Group on Friday nailed down a $322 million financing package from Blackstone which will kick-start the $1.25 billion-plus luxury residential project.

Realty Check first reported on the Zeckendorf-Atlas development plan on Feb. 7 (Baupost had not yet joined the team). There was some skepticism at the time that it would actually go forward partly because although the developers had a contract to buy the land the deal had not yet closed.

But it’s happening now – and there’s no turning back.

The Newmark duo of Dustin Stolly and Jordan Roeschlaub who are co-heads of the Newmark Debt & Equity unit arranged the joint venture among the trio and arranged the financing package.

The lead developer is Zeckendorf which famously built the celebrity-filled condo tower at 15 Central Park West. It was nicknamed the “Limestone Jesus” for its sacrosanct reputation as the city’s best-selling luxury residence. Current and past residents include Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein Robert De Niro Denzel Washington and Alex Rodriguez.

The new downtown project won’t necessarily resemble it and might not even be limestone. But comparisons are inevitable.

It will have two towers rising to 450 feet overlooking the Hudson River on the 1.3-acre empty lot on the West Side Highway between Houston and Clarkson streets.

However Robert A.M. Stern who designed 15 CPW does not appear to be involved at 570 Washington where architectural firm COOKFOX is working on the design.

Michael Eglit head of U.S. Originations for Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies commented “We are pleased to support the first stage of this development…. We look forward to the completion of this project and to our continued investment activity in New York City.”"

Flight Details

China Airlines Boeing 737-800 – registered B-18616 was operating flight CI120 from Taipei to Naha with 157 passengers and 8 crew members on board. Flight 120 landed safely at Naha Airport after a flight time of one hour and six minutes.

The crew taxied the aircraft to the gate de-configuring the aircraft as per the after-landing checklist. However after the pilots shut off the engines and the passengers were prepared to disembark a fire erupted in engine number 2.

Ground crew members noticed the flames coming out of the engine and informed the air traffic controller. Subsequently the controller informed the captain about the situation and the captain ordered an emergency evacuation saying “Passenger Evacuation! Passenger Evacuation!”

Soon after performing the evacuation procedures together with the First Officer the captain made an announcement in Chinese saying “Cabin crew proceed with emergency evacuation immediately after all passengers have been evacuated from the aircraft.”

Miraculously everyone on board managed to disembark the aircraft through the four hatches using slides just before the plane exploded. After ensuring that all those on board disembarked the aircraft the Captain and First Officer exited the aircraft through the cockpit window. As seen in the video below the pilots attempted to exit the cockpit using the escape rope but the F/O ripped off the rope when the number 2 engine and right-wing fuel tanks exploded. The captain jumped from the window without using the rope. Besides some minor injuries all passengers and crew members were evacuated safely.

The aircraft was badly damaged and destroyed by the fire leaving only part of the airframe intact. The fuselage was bent lengthwise at the part immediately aft of the wing roots. The left-wing which was almost entirely burned and had lost its original shape laid over the engine resting on the ground. The wing portion between the engine and fuselage was destroyed by the explosion of the fuel tank and the burnt main landing gear was tilted forward. The right main landing gear was burned and stood upright while both the engines and the wing tip were resting on the ground.

The No. 1 (left) engine was entirely burned while the fuselage-side cowling of the No. 2 (right) engine was consumed by the fire and the engine itself was partially burned at the fuselage-side fan sections. The aircraft was written off due to the extensive damage.

ARAIC Investigation

Following the incident the Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission of Japan (ARAIC) designated an investigator-in-charge and other investigators to investigate the accident. Accredited representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Taiwanese Aviation Safety Council also participated in the investigation including the on-site investigation at Naha Airport. The on-site investigation found that the fuel had leaked out from a puncture hole found in a slat’s track.

The flight captain stated that they received no fire indication during the flight or after the landing. The recording in the cockpit voice recorder also clarified that the pilots did not observe any abnormalities before the incident.

There was no fire alarm or the like during the pre-flight check of the aircraft during the flight or after the landing. I found no indication of abnormal fuel consumption during the flight either. Everything was normal until the accident. Captain China Airlines Flight 120

Digging into the incident investigators found that an incorrectly installed bolt in the right-wing of the aircraft’s No 5 slat down-stop had worked itself loose. The bolt was torqued without the requisite washer in place during scheduled maintenance some six weeks before the incident (The aircraft had undergone scheduled maintenance (C Check) from July 6 to 13 2007). As a result the nut worked itself loose and caused the entire down-stop assembly to detach which eventually fell onto the track of the slat-can assembly during the ground movement at Naha Airport.

During taxiing the slat track moved back into the track can pushing the detached assembly ahead of it. The powerful hydraulic slat actuator moved the slat track into the fully retracted position eventually shoving the downstop bolt straight through the wall of the track can thus puncturing the fuel tank.

As a result the fuel leaked out through the hole which measured 2-3 centimeters in diameter. A fire started when the volatile jet fuel came into contact with high-temperature areas on the right engine. Much of the fuel burned out during explosions as there was no sign of fuel leakage during taxiing. Investigators discovered that the cause of this near-disaster fire and explosion was a single missing washer. The washer was found lying just below the opening provided in the front end of the wing forward spar through which the main track passed.

Temporary Grounding and Aftermaths

Following the incident the Republic of China Civil Aeronautics Administration grounded the entire fleet of Boeing 737-800s of China Airlines Mandarin Airlines and the Republic of China Air Force for further inspection of the fuel systems. Similarly the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau also asked the Japanese operators of 737-700 and 737-800 aircraft to inspect their aircraft. However no irregularities were found and the aircraft returned to service.

In its final report the ARAIC recommended the US Federal Aviation Administration supervise Boeing to ensure that maintenance instructions take into account the conditions under which the work must be performed. A similar recommendation was also sent to the Civil Aviation Bureau of Japan.

For decades the nuns quietly lived in seclusion spending their days in contemplative prayer and doing chores from cooking to cleaning to making their own clothes. They also run a gift shop sew vestments for priests and supply communion wafers to about 100 parishes in the Archdiocese of Boston.

Since it opened in 1934 the Franciscan Monastery of St. Clare has been a well-known landmark in Jamaica Plain. Nestled between the beautiful Arnold Arboretum and busy Arborway rotary the handsome brick building is home to 10 cloistered nuns who hardly ever leave the property.

The Poor Clare nuns have since scrapped their plans to raze the building. But they still intend to sell the monastery and use the proceeds to move to a smaller place possibly this fall. Alternative plans to redevelop the property — without tearing down the whole building — are in the process of being drafted LaCasse said.

“They decided to go back to the drawing board” LaCasse said.

Kathy Kottaridis the executive director of Historic Boston Inc. said the monastery appears to be the oldest remaining purpose-built women’s monastery in New England. Many in the community want the building to be preserved.

“I’m glad they’re moving in that direction” she said. “It has such an institutional presence right there and it has an interesting history.”

Sister Clare Frances McAvoy the abbess of the monastery said although the demolition plans are “off the table” the sisters are moving forward with their plans of vacating the property.

“We do need to move” she said. “This building is too big. And it’s too expensive.”

For McAvoy and the remaining sisters it will be a major change. Over the years they have “witnessed the joys and sorrows of some of over one hundred other women who came here with their dreams and faithfully walked this way and of some of a hundred others who tried” McAvoy said. “But these walls know every one of these women and every moment of their lives as well as mine. This is sacred and holy ground.”

The three-story monastery building sits on 2.8 acres of land and was made to house 50 nuns. At one point in the 1950s there were 64 sisters living there and they were running out of space.

Today they have the opposite problem. The 10 sisters range in age from 60 to 91 years old and with more than 54700 square feet of living space they are in charge of maintaining a massive building that is in need of repairs that they can’t afford. The Poor Clare nuns said they were told it would cost millions to bring the building up to code.

“There’s a lot of work needed to save the building” LaCasse said. “It’s in rough shape.”

The roof is leaking. The gigantic boilers need to be replaced with a new heating system. Asbestos needs to be removed. The building is in need of new plumbing and electric wiring. The brick exterior needs repairs.

“It costs a fortune to heat in the winter” LaCasse said.

The building was made specifically to suit the lifestyle of these cloistered nuns.

Everything they needed was right there at the monastery according to Sister Lorraine DeMers.

“When I came here I felt like I was entering a little city on its own” she said. “All of our necessities were met. ... To me it was a little island.”

In addition to the spacious kitchen and dining room there’s a library sewing rooms a laundry room a chapel and a burial crypt which up until recently held the remains of deceased sisters. (In anticipation of their upcoming move the sisters relocated the 39 bodies that once occupied the space to Mount Benedict Cemetery in West Roxbury in the fall of 2021. They now use the crypt as a storage room.)

To this day the sisters only leave the property when necessary such as for medical and dental appointments. Three of the sisters have driver’s licenses and Sister Mary Veronica does most of the food shopping and makes regular trips to Costco and BJs to stock up on food and household supplies.

Each sister plays a role in their little tight-knit community. The sisters refer to McAvoy the abbess as “The Boss.” Sister John Paul Tenneson oversees the distribution of altar breads to parishes across the archdiocese. Sister Mary Rigodon sews vestments for priests. Sister Mary Francis Hone is the scholar and resident historian. She also serves as the webmaster updating the website and blog. Sister Mary Joseph Aspell the jokester of the group (”I’m a tap dancer” she quipped) greets visitors who come into the lobby of the monastery where the sisters run a small gift shop that sells rosary beads baptismal candles greeting cards and mugs emblazoned with slogans like “Choose Joy.”

They even have a monastery mascot of sorts: a 15-pound striped cat named Baby who has his own room stocked with cans of Fancy Feast and a variety of cat toys.

The sisters have a purchase-and-sale agreement in place with Boston-based Holland Properties. The plan was for Holland to build 26 townhouses on the site after the monastery was torn down. But once word got out about the plans for demolition the sisters became the targets of intense criticism.

“Wasteful. Shame on your poor clares!” one angry commenter wrote on the Jamaica Plain Historical Society’s Facebook page. “The ‘poor’ sisters and their order are scoundrels” quipped another.

“It sounds liked they’ve been alone for too long and decided that they’re unbelievably special” another Facebook user wrote. “So special that their building is as holy as they think they are.”

After the nuns’ application to raze the building was filed with the Boston Landmarks Commission in February a public hearing was scheduled for April but it was never held.

The Poor Clare nuns have been looking to downsize for about 20 years and have found a property not far away that is smaller than the monastery but is large enough to accommodate them. They wouldn’t specify the location but said it is located within the archdiocese.

“The house has enough rooms for each of us to move right into” the sisters’ website states. “Praise God! Depending totally upon God’s guidance and Providence so graciously expressed in the continued friendship and kindness of our neighbors we need to move to this smaller place. Our need to take this step is urgent. We depend upon the sale of this property in order to purchase the new place we so badly need.”

Their attorney said the alternative plans to redevelop the current property — without tearing down the monastery — should be ready in the “next few months” LaCasse said.

“The whole thing is being reimagined” he said.

McAvoy said they hope to move out of the monastery by September or October of this year.

“Material Adverse Effect” was cited by Musk’s lawyers in a regulatory filing Friday which argued that undisclosed information about bots on the social media platform is “fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance.”

To escape the deal Musk must prove the alleged omission amounts to an “unexpected fundamental permanent” negative development—akin to blowing a hole in the transaction that can’t be fixed said Larry Hamermesh a University of Pennsylvania law professor.

In a 2020 case involving Boston Scientific Corp. a Delaware judge defined the term as an “adverse change in the target’s business that is consequential to the company’s long-term earnings power over a reasonable period which one would expect to be measured in years rather than months.”

So far Delaware courts have found only one case in which a clear MAE emerged—Fresenius SE’s $4.3 billion buyout bid in 2018 for rival drugmaker Akorn Inc.

A judge blessed Fresenius’ decision to walk away from the deal after finding Akorn executives hid an array of problems that cast doubt on the validity of data backing up approval for some drugs and profitability of its operations.

It can be a lot of fun buying stocks trading in the single digits. While there are a lot of bad companies down in the cheap seats sometimes you can find some amazing bargains. Our roundtable has found three really cool biotech stocks trading under $10 a share.

Here's why we like SeaSpine (SPNE) Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX -1.68%) and Agenus (AGEN -7.26%).

Growth at a serious discount

Patrick Bafuma (SeaSpine): Looking at growth prospects spinal surgery pure-play SeaSpine caught my eye. This healthcare company offers hardware for spinal implants as well as orthobiologics -- implanted medication at the surgical site that enhances bone repair after surgical procedures. It also offers a surgical navigation system designed to improve the accuracy of hardware placement thus providing a faster and more cost-effective radiation-free surgery. In short SeaSpine gives its orthopedic and neurosurgical customers a complete solution to meet patients' evolving clinical needs.

And business is picking up. In the first quarter of 2022 the company grew total revenue 21% over the prior-year period to $50.7 million slightly exceeding the high end of guidance by $1 million. In fact the company raised full-year 2022 revenue guidance by $5 million to a range of $231 million to $235 million. This reflects growth of approximately 21% to 23% over full-year 2021. SeaSpine also sports an adjusted gross margin of 62% for the first quarter and reminds me of another surgical supplier Stryker and its 64% margin. This is a good company to be in considering Stryker has handily beat the S&P 500 over the last two decades.

SeaSpine expanded its product portfolio with the full commercial launch of four products and systems in 2021. It is guiding for a 15%-18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years and aims to be profitable by the end of 2024. This healthcare company trades below an Alexander Hamilton yet its market cap of $220 million is actually below its 2022 full-year revenue guidance. Given that and its anticipated double-digit CAGR for the next few years SeaSpine looks to swim past the market for years to come.

Re-imagining drug discovery

Taylor Carmichael (Recursion Pharmaceuticals): I've been binge watching Elementary this last week a great modern-day update of Sherlock Holmes. Among other things I love that Sherlock is an out-of-the-box thinker who tries to be logical and rational as he approaches crime. Some of his theories apply to drug discovery as well. After all in both cases you are trying to solve a mystery.

Holmes hates concepts like ""luck"" and ""guessing."" (As a stock investor I am totally on board with this hatred.) But he takes this antipathy even further. Holmes is very dubious about having a scientific hypothesis about a crime before you have enough facts. So his first move is always collecting data. This will result in a future hypothesis that is more likely to be right.

Recursion is trying to bring Sherlock's approach to drug discovery. There's a danger in scientists forming a hypothesis about a disease before they have data known as ""confirmation bias."" They're looking for positive data to confirm their hypothesis and they're blind to the negative data that negates it. This human bias is perhaps why so many drugs fail to make it to market (almost 90% of them).

Recursion has a new way to find drugs. The biotech has created a massive map of biology. Using artificial intelligence (AI) Recursion has run 100 million highly reproducible experiments. From this data set the AI software has inferred 240 billion biological relationships that might help scientists treat diseases. Researchers accessing this data can now create a data-based hypothesis using human intuition to find drugs that are more likely to work well.

Traditional Drug Discovery Approach Recursion Drug Discovery Review the scientific literature Review an AI map of biology Generate a hypothesis Navigate a massive index of machine-generated hypotheses created from the results of 100 million experiments Try to validate the hypothesis Already validated 10% success rate in humans Unknown success rate in humans

Right now Recursion has a small market cap ($1.5 billion) and an even smaller amount of revenue ($13 million over the last year). This biotech doesn't have a P/E ratio and it's P/S ratio is astronomical. Nonetheless there was a fair amount of excitement at the IPO probably because mega-caps like Roche and Bayer are collaborating with the biotech and Cathie Wood is an investor.

The stock is now down about 71% from its IPO and in this market it might fall further. But I suspect Recursion will emerge a big winner with its data-based approach to drug discovery. If you're interested I would suggest opening with a small position (under 1% of assets).

A potential 10-bagger

George Budwell (Agenus): Agenus is a small-cap immunotherapy company with enormous potential as a growth vehicle for patient investors. Although the company's share price has jumped by a whopping 61% over the last 30 days Agenus' stock is still down by an eye-catching 59% from its 52-week high.

Agenus' shares have started to turn the corner recently due to an important clinical update for its next-generation CTLA-4 antibody known as botensilimab. Specifically botensilimab when used in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor balstilimab reportedly produced an unprecedented overall response rate in patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer.

To date Agenus' lead anti-cancer candidate has shown clinical activity across nine different types of cancer that do not respond to the current slate of available immunotherapies. Put simply this biologic anti-cancer therapy could be a game-changer for scores of patients with hard-to-treat malignancies.

What's more Agenus also has a handful of high-value collaborations underway. As things stand now the company has $2.8 billion in potential milestone payments in play from a host of partners such as Bristol Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences. That's a sizable amount of money for a company with a market cap under $800 million at the time of this writing.

The bottom line with Agenus is that the company does have a long way to go to realize its full potential. Botensilimab after all is only in mid-stage development right now. But with a possible franchise-level drug in hand and multiple partnerships in full swing Agenus' stock appears poised for a long-tailed growth spurt in the years ahead. In fact this small-cap biotech arguably has the very real potential to morph into a large-cap immunotherapy behemoth by the end of the decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tc2Qtc3VzcGVuZHMtdmFjY2luZXMtc3VwcGxpZXMtdG8tcnVzc2lh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSD suspends vaccines supplies to Russia,"US pharma giant Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK) known as MSD outside of the USA and Canada has stopped its supplies of vaccines against chickenpox rubella measles and mumps to Russia but will continue sales of its drugs that do not have Russian analogues reports The Pharma Letter’s local correspondent.

Appearing on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast Tuesday afternoon Brown reflected on what Tomlin meant to him on and off the field.

“Mike Tomlin…that dude was like my pops to be honest” an emotional Brown told Whitlock. “Ever since I met Mike Tomlin I always knew I’ll have success. I feel like when I went to the Steelers Mike Tomlin once I saw him and talked with him I knew I was going to the Steelers. Mike Tomlin was that father figure for me. Outside of coach. Obviously as a coach and the minutia as a coach he was always challenging me at the utmost to make sure I was better.”

Brown had a winding journey to the NFL. A Florida kid who played his college ball in the MAC at Central Michigan becoming a sixth round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Scouts questioned his level of competition his slight frame his 4.57 40-yard Combine time.

Pittsburgh took the chance on him late in the draft. He found the end zone on his first regular season touch taking a reverse for a touchdown on a kickoff against the Tennessee Titans. His role as a receiver was limited in the early goings but he made his name known in his debut playoff game. Tied 24-apiece against the Baltimore Ravens Brown made a 58-yard helmet catch down the right sideline on a 3rd and 19 heave from Ben Roethlisberger setting up the game-winning touchdown.

From there his career took off. He finished second on the team in receptions yards and touchdowns in 2011. His breakout year came in 2013 leading the team with 110 receptions for 1499 yards and eight touchdowns. His numbers became video-game like in 2014 leading the NFL in receptions (129) and yards (1698) and in his prime was essentially uncoverable. For six straight seasons he posted at least 100 receptions 1200 yards and eight touchdowns. In NFL history no one else has done it more than four times consecutive or not.

In his now famous interview with The Pivot in 2022 Mike Tomlin acknowledged Brown would never play for the Steelers again but spoke well of him.

“We had nine great years” Tomlin told Ryan Clark Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder. “I appreciate that dude in ways that I can’t explain to y’all that I won’t even bother to attempt to explain to y’all because it sounds like I’m defending him in some way…the nature of our relationship and what we all did together requires no defense.”

The feeling seems mutual.

“That guy Mike Tomlin always had my back always believed in me” Brown said. “So I’m always indebted to Mike Tomlin. He was one of those guys that’s stood in the foxhole for me. And that meant a lot to me.”

But Brown eventually felt like his time was up in Pittsburgh and he made a loud exit forcing the team to trade him. Brown hasn’t said he regrets the move telling Whitlock he was chasing a Super Bowl ring he eventually received with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But had Brown stayed with Tomlin he might’ve gone down as the greatest receiver in NFL history. Instead he’ll be remembered for as much what he did off the field than on it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvdHJhdmlzLXNjb3R0LWFpci1qb3JkYW4tMS1sb3ctb2ctc3AtdmVsdmV0LWJyb3duLWRtNzg2Ni0yMDItcmVsZWFzZS1pbmZv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Travis Scott X Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP ""Velvet Brown"" Rumored To Be Arriving Soon","A new Travis Scott and Jordan Brand shoe is on its way and it looks like the partnership will be hitting the classic Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP.

On Tuesday May 7 the Stranger Things star 20 marked her fiancé Jake Bongiovi’s 22nd birthday with a sweet Instagram post which featured a snapshot of Bongiovi walking towards Brown. Another photo showed the pair holding hands — and showing off her engagement ring — in a convertible.

“The day u were born is my favorite day” she wrote. “I love you ❤️”

The post comes nearly two months after the actress and Bongiovi celebrated three years as a couple.

“Three years of bliss” she wrote on Instagram at the time adding “Love you best friend.”

On his own Instagram Story the son of Bon Jovi rocker Jon Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley also marked the milestone with a post dedicated to Brown.

Over a snap of the actress smiling as she pet an adorable dog he wrote: ‘Time flies when you’re having fun” and added a heart emoji.

He continued “I love you so much 3 years :).”

Brown and Bongiovi first sparked romance rumors in June 2021 when they were spotted walking hand-in-hand in New York City. They then got engaged in April 2023 which Brown announced in an Instagram post that showed her wearing an engagement ring while posing on the beach next to Bongiovi.

The couple has regularly shared their love for one another in posts on social media including in May 2023 when the actress celebrated Bongiovi's 21st birthday and called him her fiancé for the very first time.

It certainly was.

Around the Flamingo's 20th anniversary in 1967 Kirk Kerkorian acquired the property for $13 million at a time when a number of Strip hotel-casinos were changing hands during the Howard Hughes whirlwind. Kerkorian planned to use the Flamingo as a sort of hotel school to train the core staff of the huge International that he was then planning. He immediately invested $2.5 million into improving the casino expanding the theater and tearing down the iconic champagne tower.

Shortly thereafter in one of the very few missteps in Kerkorian's long storied and immensely profitable career he overextended his financing and in order to stave off foreclosure and/or bankruptcy he had to sell the Flamingo to Hilton Corporation in 1970; in so doing Hilton became the first major hotel chain to enter the Nevada market. Hilton quickly embarked on a massive expansion program that added 500-room hotel towers in 1977 1980 1982 and 1986 a 728-room tower in 1990 and a 908-room tower in 1993. The 400-unit Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare tower opened in 1993.

In 1998 Hilton's gaming properties including the Flamingo were spun off as Park Place Entertainment. That deal included a license good for two years only to use the Hilton name. When Park Place failed to renew the Hilton licensing agreement in 2000 the property was renamed Flamingo Las Vegas.

So the Flamingo was the Flamingo Hilton for a total of 30 years -- from 1970 to 2000.

As an addendum to this answer rumor has it that the Flamingo might not be a Caesars property for much longer. In its first-quarter earnings call in early May the Caesars Entertainment CEO told analysts and journalists that the company ""started the process of selling a Las Vegas-Strip asset early in 2022 ... putting us somewhere in the middle of summer for a confirmation of a transaction.” Two days later Bloomberg reported that the sale of the casino that's ""in motion"" was yes the Flamingo.

Apparently Caesars has been asking $1 billion for the 76-year-old property which is a bit rich for some ""private equity firms and other operators reluctant to buy an older property that needs a lot of maintenance."" Further complicating matters VICI Properties has a right of first refusal on the sale of the Flamingo. According to Bloomberg ""Caesars considered selling Planet Hollywood but decided to keep that property so it can continue using its theater for concerts.""

If the above timetable turns out to be true we should know if something is happening with the Flamingo within the next month or so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamF5Z2luc2JhY2gvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9pbi10aGUtbW9uZXktYXQtdGhlLTIwMjItd29ybGQtc2VyaWVzLW9mLXBva2VyLW1haW4tZXZlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In The Money At The 2022 World Series Of Poker Main Event,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2022/07/10/in-the-money-at-the-2022-world-series-of-poker-main-event/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamF5Z2luc2JhY2gvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9pbi10aGUtbW9uZXktYXQtdGhlLTIwMjItd29ybGQtc2VyaWVzLW9mLXBva2VyLW1haW4tZXZlbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvbmV3cy9lbHRvbi1qb2huLXJ1bW9yZWQtdG8tcmV0dXJuLXRvLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1mb3ItYWxsZWdpYW50LXN0YWRpdW0tcGVyZm9ybWFuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elton John Rumored to Return to Vegas for Allegiant Stadium Performance,"Elton John Rumored to Return to Las Vegas for Allegiant Stadium Performance

Posted on: July 10 2022 08:12h.

Last updated on: July 11 2022 06:32h.

UPDATE: Elton John is scheduled to perform at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas at 8 pm on Nov. 1. Tickets will soon be on sale.

Renowned musician Elton John is likely once again to appear in Las Vegas according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal based on recent hints from official Twitter accounts. The report says he will perform sometime this November in Allegiant Stadium.

Word about the performance was hinted at in Allegiant Stadium’s Twitter account. On Sunday a tweet showed a photo of the letter “E” outside of the stadium. It tells readers and apparently John fans simply “Tomorrow 8 AM.”

In addition on John’s Twitter account appearing on Saturday is a picture of Allegiant Stadium’s field. “In Two Days” appears in both end zones. On the 50-yard line is an “E.”

The Review-Journal predicts info about the show will appear on Twitter on Monday.

John will be in the western US performing during October and November. It is already known he will be at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara Calif. on Oct. 8 and 9. He is to perform too on Nov. 4 at Minute Maid Park in Houston. On Nov. 9 he will be at Petco Park in San Diego.

The West Coast performances are likely to conclude with performances on Nov. 17 through 20 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The concerts are part of his “Farewell Yellow Brick Road: The Final Tour.”

Las Vegas Residency

John now 75 was formerly in residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. “The Red Piano” was performed between 2004 and 2009. “The Million Dollar Piano” was at the venue between 2011 and 2018. In total he performed 445 shows during the two residencies the Las Vegas Weekly reported.

During his Sept. 6 2019 farewell performance in Las Vegas he told the sold-out crowd “I’m going to miss you guys. You’re in my heart you’re in my soul every fiber of my being. I will never forget you but I have a life now. Years ago I never thought I’d have a family of my own but I do now … I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

Accolades

In 2019 Billboard Magazine ranked Elton John in third place on the list of the greatest all-time artists. The Beatles were first. The Rolling Stones second.

Among his many accolades are Academy and Tony awards as well as several Grammy Awards. He also was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

John has been honored with one diamond 40 platinum or multi-platinum and 23 gold albums during his career. He has sold more than 300 million records.

The second best-selling single of all time was his performance of “Candle in the Wind 1997.” It was in memory of his friend Princess Diana. The song was performed at her funeral following her sudden death from a car crash in Paris.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9wb2tlci9mb3JtZXItYmFubmVkLXBsYXllci1tYWtpbmctbW9zdC1vZi0ybmQtY2hhbmNlLWF0LXdzb3AtMjYwNTIxNS_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcG9rZXIvZm9ybWVyLWJhbm5lZC1wbGF5ZXItbWFraW5nLW1vc3Qtb2YtMm5kLWNoYW5jZS1hdC13c29wLTI2MDUyMTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former banned player making most of 2nd chance at WSOP,"Luke Vrabel who was reinstated this summer following a five-year ban from the World Series of Poker was climbing the Main Event chip counts on Day 3.

Luke Vrabel sat calmly in his black Iron Maiden T-shirt at table No. 678 in Bally’s Event Center on Saturday alternating between friendly banter with other players and checking his phone.

The last thing he wanted to do was bring any negative attention upon himself.

“I’m really happy to be back” Vrabel said. “It’s been amazing.”

Five years ago Vrabel was banned from the World Series of Poker and all Caesars Entertainment properties following an incident during the “Colossus” No-limit Hold’em tournament.

But he was reinstated this summer by WSOP vice president Jack Effel prior to the start of the $10000 buy-in Main Event No-limit Hold’em World Championship and was climbing the chip counts entering the dinner break on Day 3 of the tournament.

The Main Event which drew the second-largest field in its history with 8663 entrants continues Sunday with Day 4.

Vrabel declined Saturday to discuss why he was banned but posted in 2017 on the poker forum twoplustwo.com and Facebook about the incident. He also appeared in 2017 as a guest on the “HighRollerRadioTV” podcast to explain what happened.

According to Vrabel’s posts and interview the poker pro from West Hartford Connecticut was being heckled by a group of fans with 10 players remaining in the 2017 “Colossus” event at the Rio Convention Center.

Vrabel said on the podcast he asked a tournament director to quiet the fans but claimed he was told “They did nothing wrong. Sit down and deal with it.” When the taunting escalated Vrabel said in the interview he asked the tournament director to remove the fans.

Section 40-c of the WSOP official rules state that “All Participants are entitled to expect civility and courtesy from one another at every table and throughout the WSOP area. Any individual who encounters behavior that is not civil or courteous — or is abusive in any way — is encouraged to immediately contact a WSOP Tournament official.”

Vrabel who admits he too can be loud and difficult at times at the table said in the interview that security was called soon after. But rather than being stationed near the fans the two guards were posted on either side of Vrabel as he played.

After play halted with nine players remaining Vrabel posted that he confronted the tournament director and the two clashed once again. According to Vrabel’s posts and interview the tournament director called him an obscenity.

“(H)ere i am playing for 1 million dollars … the biggest moment of my wsop career by a long shot and this guy is siding with spectators” Vrabel wrote on twoplustwo.com.

Vrabel returned the following day for the final table and was eliminated on the sixth hand in ninth place for nearly $80000. Afterward he posted he would never play the WSOP again.

According to unconfirmed posts on twoplustwo.com Vrabel was banned soon after because of the incident during the “Colossus” and his subsequent comments about it on social media and podcast interviews.

Effel declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed about Vrabel. The spokesperson said Caesars does not comment on security procedures or in this case reinstatements.

Vrabel said Saturday his friend and fellow poker player Nicholas Palma spoke last week to Effel on his behalf trying to get the ban lifted.

Vrabel was set to play a $400 buy-in event at Aria recently when he said he received a phone call from Effel.

“He called me personally and he said ‘You’re back. We’re leaving all that in the past and we’re moving on with our lives’ ” Vrabel said. “I was praying. I could see it in (Palma’s) eyes that he really felt it. So I was like ‘Maybe he’s right.’

“Jack gave me a call and boom here I am.”

Vrabel who first gained recognition in 2011 when he won nearly $700000 and a Lamborghini in the online PokerStars Sunday Million saw his stack fluctuate wildly during the first three levels on Day 3.

After starting with 119000 chips Vrabel lost almost 25 percent of his stack early on then recovered to just shy of the 20000-chip mark.

He dipped down once again but about an hour before the 6 p.m. dinner break Vrabel scored a key double-up with pocket jacks. He was sitting on 331000 chips (82 big blinds) when play paused as the money bubble grew closer.

Poker pro Michael Rocco was the unofficial leader at the dinner break with 1.4 million chips.

“Most people are thrilled (I’m back) because they know I’m a good guy and it shouldn’t have gotten to that point” Vrabel said. “I’m having a great time.”

Much like cruise line loyalty programs reward you for sailing cruise casinos offer additional perks for your shipboard gaming activity.

Each of the three largest cruise lines has its own casino rewards programs. Royal Caribbean has Club Royale Norwegian Cruise Line has Casinos at Sea and Carnival Cruise Line has Players Club. You'll need a players card with each program to earn status and rewards which is either your cruise card or a separate card you get once you sign up.

If you'd like to nab everything from free drinks to free cruises from your casino play you'll want to sign up for these cruise line casino rewards programs the next time you sail. For even greater benefits discover how to leverage onboard benefits from your elite status elsewhere and follow these tips to get the most out of your time on the gaming floor at sea.

Basics of cruise casino loyalty programs

Cruise-based casino programs operate similarly to their land-based counterparts but with a few crucial differences. You can earn rewards and status for your gaming activity on board a cruise ship and the more you wager the more you'll accrue of both. Like most loyalty programs you'll only earn rewards if your qualifying activity is tracked so remember to use your players card whenever you gamble.

Earning rates vary and aren't always disclosed but the industry standard is for players to earn 1 redeemable point and tier credit for every $5 wagered on reel slots and every $10 wagered on video poker machines. These rates are explicit on both Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line cruises.

Earning rates for table games depend on what you're playing how much you bet and how long you play but since the house edge is lower you can expect to earn less per dollar wagered than you would playing slots. Note that some games (like Texas Hold 'em and coin pushers) aren't eligible to earn rewards.

One major difference from many land-based casinos is that cruise ship casino programs reward you exclusively for gameplay; you won't earn points or benefits from dining shopping or any other onboard activities. Cruise lines instead offer separate loyalty programs that reward guests for sailing activity though some benefits overlap between the two programs.

You can typically redeem earned points for free play or credits to your onboard bill; specifics and minimum redemptions vary by loyalty program. The cruise lines are not transparent about the points-to-dollars conversion rate for credit.

Royal Caribbean Club Royale

(Photo courtesy of Royal Caribbean International)

Club Royale membership is open to guests 18 years or older on most sailings; you must be 21 or older to play on Alaska voyages. You can enroll by using your SeaPass card at an eligible slot machine or presenting it to casino management at a gaming table. You can also enroll before sailing by calling a casino representative at 888-561-2234 or (if you have sailed previously with Royal Caribbean) through the Crown & Anchor Society.

Club Royale offers four status tiers based on gaming activity during the program year which starts April 1 and ends March 31 of the following calendar year.

Choice (1 tier credit).

Prime (2500 tier credits).

Signature (25000 tier credits).

Masters (100000 tier credits).

Choice status lets you redeem points as free play or as credits to your onboard expense account (with a minimum redemption of 5000 points). You'll also begin earning Instant Cruise Rewards Certificates which range from a $100 discount to a complimentary cruise (minus port taxes and fees).

Prime status waives convenience fees up to 5% and gets you complimentary drinks in the casino. At this level you'll also get an annual complimentary cruise in an interior cabin on select sailings (again minus taxes and fees). Signature status gets you complimentary Wi-Fi for one device and upgrades the annual complimentary cruise to a balcony cabin.

Finally the top-tier Masters status adds a slew of perks like priority entertainment access and dining reservations an onboard credit of up to $100 luggage delivery access to exclusive events and a further upgrade to a grand suite on your annual complimentary cruise. You can view a full list of benefits with more details on the Club Royale site.

While you can accrue tier credits for the duration of the program year Royal Caribbean does not carry over redeemable points from one cruise to the next. Unredeemed points expire at the end of each voyage so don't miss the deadline to cash out (typically the night before debarkation).

Norwegian Cruise Line Casinos at Sea

Casinos at Sea is separate from Norwegian's Latitude Rewards program and is open to guests 18 years or older. You can enroll at the casino host desk (which is worth a visit anyway as I'll discuss later). Casinos at Sea offers five status tiers based on gaming activity during the program year which again runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.

Jade (0 points) .

Pearl (5000 points).

Sapphire (15000 points).

Ruby (35000 points).

Elite (100000 points).

Jade status allows you to redeem points as free play or toward onboard expenses like spa treatments specialty dinners and credits to your final bill. The minimum redemption is just 1000 points on sailings of four days or fewer and 2500 points on sailings of five days or more.

At the Pearl level you get a $100 onboard credit complimentary house drinks in the casino free play when sailing in your birth month and stateroom amenities like complimentary candies or dessert delivered to your cabin. At this level you'll start earning discounts on staterooms.

Mid-tier Sapphire status gets you waived convenience fees and priority disembarkation on top of a bump up to complimentary premium drinks a $200 onboard credit and better stateroom discounts. Ruby status adds another step up to larger stateroom discounts and complimentary Ultra drinks along with waived cash advance fees and a complimentary internet package of 400 minutes or 1250MB.

You'll find the high-end benefits when you earn top-tier Elite status which further augments some of the benefits already mentioned and adds a complimentary shore excursion (up to $300 per person for two guests) private transfers and waived service charges.

Note that while Casinos at Sea operates on Norwegian Cruise Line as well as sister cruise lines Oceania and Regent Seven Seas Cruises the benefits described above are specific to Norwegian only. Check the full list of benefits to see which ones apply to your trip.

One feature that sets Casinos at Sea apart from Club Royale is the option to carry points over from one cruise to the next. Points expire 18 months after they're earned rather than at the end of your trip so regular cruisers can build up a sizable balance over time. However if you'd like to redeem points for credit to your onboard bill Norwegian specifies a weirdly tight redemption window which is 6 to 9 p.m. on the last day of your cruise.

The Players Club is available to guests 18 years or older. You can enroll when using your Sail & Sign card in the casino either by inserting it in a slot machine or presenting it to a dealer at a table game.

Unlike with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian (and even Carnival's own VIFP loyalty program) status tiers in the Carnival Players Club are not well defined. Carnival doesn't publish details of how casino perks are earned or redeemed specifying only that ""comps are extended on board based on your level of play.""

However Carnival does advertise four tiers of invitation-only cruise packages with rewards similar to what you'll find in other cruise casino programs so you can get a sense of the available benefits even if the threshold to unlock them is unclear.

At the lower end Getaway cruise packages offer extras like complimentary drinks in the casino premier boarding and special treats or gifts delivered to your room. The mid-tier Premier and Ultra packages come with added perks such as invitations to special events and priority debarkation while the top-tier Elite packages add luxury benefits like a complimentary airport transfer and shore excursion as well as VIFP Club Platinum status for the duration of your cruise.

Ultimately Carnival's path to status is less straightforward than in the other programs but the perks of playing are comparable.

How to leverage casino status for cruise benefits

Your existing status with land-based casino and hotel programs may also qualify you for perks on your next cruise.

The MGM Rewards program offers members a variety of benefits on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises. These range from discount offers and welcome amenities for Sapphire and Pearl members to onboard credits of up to $300 and annual complimentary cruises for Platinum and Noir members. You'll need to validate your MGM Rewards status and request these benefits at the time of cruise booking (at least 10 days before departure).

This creates an opportunity to parlay your World of Hyatt elite status into benefits with both MGM and these two cruise lines with its status match offer. However note that the MGM Platinum and Noir cruise benefits are exclusive to members who earned their tier based on gameplay and other eligible spending; status earned by matching from another program won't cut it.

Caesars Rewards doesn't offer onboard benefits to its elite members but it does offer stateroom discounts as high as 30% on Norwegian Oceania and Regent Seven Seas cruises. Like with MGM and Hyatt you can match your Wyndham Rewards status to Caesars to access these savings.

Finally Carnival offers a chance to earn complimentary cruises and benefits when you show proof of loyalty status with other casinos via the Players Club Fun Match program. One cool aspect of this program is that Carnival considers status from any casino not just the big names so status you've earned at smaller local venues is worth entering.

I tested this myself by submitting proof of my Caesars Rewards Diamond and MGM Rewards Gold status. Within a few days I got an offer for a complimentary interior room with free drinks in the casino and onboard credit.

4 tips to help you play the game

Whatever your status level these suggestions can make your casino experience more rewarding.

Make friends with the casino host

If you plan to spend a lot of time on the gaming floor get acquainted with the casino host early on. While comps and tier benefits are generally prescribed based on your gameplay the casino host has some autonomy to offer perks at their discretion.

They may be able to comp select onboard purchases like meals and shopping expenses and they can always answer questions help you navigate the program and explain which benefits you have and haven't earned. Being on good terms with the host certainly won't hurt.

Look for enrollment and promotional bonuses

Cruise casinos frequently offer incentives to get you in the door such as free bets or matched play; inquire at the host desk if you don't see them advertised elsewhere.

Another common promotion is to load free slot credits to guests' accounts at the start of a trip but these typically expire after the first day or two so use them quickly or lose them.

Finally check whether your cruise offers a ""learn to play"" session which may come with complimentary drinks and casino chips for both novice and experienced gamblers.

You can play with credit — for a fee

Cash is king at the casino but if you're wary of traveling with a big stack of bills you may be able to play by charging your linked onboard account instead. That account settles at the end of your trip along with the rest of your folio using whatever credit card you have on file which means you can effectively earn credit card rewards for casino gaming.

Using a card that earns bonus points on travel purchases is a nice cherry on top of your wins if you come out ahead or it can at least lessen the sting of your losses if you don't. However the cruise line may add a convenience fee for such charges so confirm you're not paying extra before you complete the transaction.

Understand that the odds are against you (even more than usual)

Cruise ship casinos routinely offer game variants that favor the house more than is customary. After all you're a captive audience; it's not like you can go gamble next door instead!

Expect to see rules like blackjack that pays 6 to 5 (instead of 3 to 2) roulette with triple zeros and reduced payouts on slots and video poker machines. The bright side of this is that you'll generally encounter lower minimum bets than you would at brick-and-mortar casinos especially compared to the Las Vegas Strip.

Bottom line

While it's fun to earn perks casino play is not an efficient path to earning elite status. If you're earning 1 tier credit per $5 wagered on reel slots you'd need to bet $12500 or $25000 to reach first-tier status with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian respectively and a whopping $500000 to reach top-tier status in either program. Those figures refer to the amount wagered and not the amount won or lost but if you (generously) assume a payout rate of 90% then you can expect to lose about $50000 reaching the top tier. With that in mind the perks of status seem a lot less perky.

You could beat the odds and end up a winner with status to boot but ultimately playing in the casino solely to earn elite benefits is a losing proposition. Instead think of these programs as a way to get some extra rewards out of whatever gaming you already planned to do.

CPB,Campbell Soup Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9idXNpbmVzcy9hbmR5LXdhcmhvbC1jYW1wYmVsbC1zb3VwLXBhaW50aW5nL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL2FuZHktd2FyaG9sLWNhbXBiZWxsLXNvdXAtcGFpbnRpbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Campbell Soup hated then embraced Andy Warhol's soup can paintings,"New York CNN Business —

Sixty years ago today the pop artist Andy Warhol unveiled a wall of 32 Campbell Soup can paintings at a Los Angeles gallery one for each flavor of soup then in production.

Not long after the company sent over a lawyer.

Thus began a decades-long hate-love relationship between the artist and company. It started with immense skepticism but Campbell eventually grew to embrace the artwork and even sponsored a Warhol exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Campbell’s eventual partnership with the Warhol estate presaged the convergence of high art advertising branding and fashion that’s commonplace today.

‘Is this art?’

When the Campbell brand was featured in Warhol’s artwork back in 1962 then President and CEO William Beverly Murphy “indicated that he had some initial concern” about use of the company’s trademarks according to the company prompting the lawyer visit to Ferus Gallery.

A cease-and-desist order was considered. But in July of 1962 John T. Dorrance Jr. the son of the inventor of condensed soup had just taken over as chairman. He was a passionate art collector and well-established in the art world. As criticism of the show mounted – “Is this art?” – so did publicity. For whatever reasons the company passed on legal action.

Also the gallery show was doing badly with only five of the works selling for about $100 apiece although one went to Hollywood star Dennis Hopper.

Warhol born in 1928 in Pittsburgh the son of Slovakian immigrants was still better known as a commercial illustrator for shoe brands and department stores than as a fine artist. The gallery dealer Irving Blum decided the paintings might be worth more as a group someday and bought them all back. It would prove to be prescient.

Meanwhile Warhol’s next series was of celebrities and with Elvis and Marilyn replacing Onion and Tomato that show sold out.

Consumers send in their labels for a Warhol

By 1964 it was Campbell that reached out to the artist.

According to a letter in its archives a product marketing manager wrote to Warhol: “Your work has evoked a great deal of interest here at Campbell soup company.” A few cases of tomato soup supposedly the artist’s favorite were sent to his home in New York City in thanks.

The manager even hinted obliquely for a trade: “I had hoped to be able to acquire one of your Campbell soup can label paintings – but I am afraid you have gotten much too expensive for me” he wrote. There is no documentation of him getting free soup can art as a result. But Beth Jolly Campbell’s vice president of communications for meals & beverages noted the company did end up commissioning one for a retiring board member the same year.

By 1966 the partnership became official. Campbell invited consumers to send in a couple of can labels and $1.00 in exchange for a Warhol designed dress made of paper. The promotion was a hit. The dress is now selling for about $20000 at art galleries and online and is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute.

No Sale

But Campbell still wasn’t quite buying that paintings of its cans were art.

In 1970 when Sotheby’s auction house had its first-ever sale of contemporary art it featured a Warhol “Can with Peeling Label” with a suggested starting bid of $20000.

The auction house reached out to Campbell and the Dorrance family to see if they were interested in buying but “I was told they showed no interest” says David Nash who worked on that early sale and eventually became head of impressionist and modern art at the auctioneer.

(Ironically Nash went on to do much business with the family: in 1989 he oversaw John T. Dorrance Jr.’s estate sale of fine art and furniture. Chock full of Picassos and Matisses but still no Warhols it raised $124 million and broke the then-record for a collection.)

Meanwhile Warhol proved very brand loyal – he did not stray to Lipton although he did do some Coca-Cola bottle art – and Campbell soup cans and boxes made regular appearances in his productions and in his interviews and MTV show of the 1980s.

Warhol died unexpectedly in 1987 at the age of 58. His fame only increased.

It helped the soup artworks’ value that it became a hugely popular print series and that it had two warring interpretations by critics.

Some argued the work was an acrid but intelligent criticism of mass-production even of capitalism while others saw a more comforting wall of soup more about America and post-war options and prosperity.

In 1996 Blum sold the original set of 32 can paintings to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in a partial sale/gift valued at $15 million. (The auction record for any Warhol is $195 million set earlier this year for “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn.”)

In 2012 the soup company issued a promotional “limited-edition” series of soup cans with Warhol’s interpretation of the company’s labels in various colors. It also served as the education and events sponsor for the Met Museum’s “Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists Fifty Years” exhibition.

Today the company has a soup can painting hanging in its Camden New Jersey headquarters said Jolly and continues to work with the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in charitable ventures and most recently on licensed hoodies and other apparel.

But the Warhol estate has not escaped all trademark battles.

The Supreme Court in May said it would take up a case concerning whether the late painter infringed on a photographer’s copyright when he created a series of silkscreens of the musician Prince. They used an image by photographer Lynn Goldsmith as source material.

And while the Warhol foundation has argued almost always successfully in lower courts that Warhol’s use of work is “transformative” the case has big implications for artists who draw inspiration or appropriate from pre-existing images.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIyMTQ3LXNsaWRlc2hvdy1pdHMtYmFjay1wdW1wa2luLXNwaWNlLXJldHVybnMtdG8tc3RvcmUtc2hlbHZlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: It's back — pumpkin spice returns to store shelves,"KANSAS CITY — Although temperatures may remain high across much of the United States summer is coming to a close — at least as far as retail flavors are concerned. From energy drinks to cereals pumpkin spice flavored products are flooding shelves across the United States.

General Mills Inc. released a host of fall flavored products across a few of its brands including Cheerios and Pillsbury. The limited-edition Cheerios have been formulated with pumpkin puree as well as a blend of cinnamon cloves and nutmeg. Pumpkin-spiced products from Pillsbury include Grands! Pumpkin Spice Rolls and a ready-to-bake pumpkin cookie dough featuring cream cheese flavored chunks.

Pumpkin spice also may be found in the beverage aisle of grocery stores in varieties ranging from coffee creamers to energy drinks. Plant-based beverage brand Califia Farms added a Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista blend meant for making at-home pumpkin spice lattes according to the company.

“We’re thrilled to introduce our new Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista which gives oat milk fans an easy way to froth up their favorite seasonal oat lattes at home” said Suzanne Ginestro chief marketing officer at Califia Farms. “Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista will launch as a limited-edition item this fall alongside our ready-to-drink Pumpkin Spice Almondmilk Latte and Pumpkin Spice Almondmilk Creamer. With the launch of Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista Califia brings yet another reason to celebrate the season with a full variety of yummy plant-based options to make all types of seasonal coffee-house drinks at home.”

Taking pumpkin spice a different direction is plant-based energy brand Yerbaé which debuted Yerbaé Pumpkin Spice a zero-calorie energy drink flavored with natural caffeine from yerba mate and nutmeg cinnamon and ginger.

Pumpkin spice also may be found in the snack category where Campbell Soup Co. partnered with Dunkin’ Brands to launch Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Grahams. The fall snack combines notes of pumpkin donut glaze and warm spices according to Campbell Soup.

“We continue to take Goldfish to the next level with new delicious and unexpected partnerships” said Janda Lukin chief marketing officer of Campbell Snacks. “The new limited-edition Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Graham crackers bring together two fun and iconic brands to give pumpkin spice lovers a new way to experience the sweet side of their favorite snack. This is the first time Goldfish is tapping into the pumpkin spice season and we couldn’t be more excited to partner with the brand that knows pumpkin spice the best.”

The Nifty Smallcap 100 TRI the benchmark index for small-cap funds delivered stellar returns of 114 per cent in this period. However small-cap funds crashed in 2022 after the Russia-Ukraine crisis sent global and Indian stock markets into extreme volatility. In this bumpy ride of stock market systematic investment plan (SIP) investors are advised to avoid some common mistakes that a mutual funds SIP investor usually commit in such volatile market.

Here we list out top 5 mistakes that a small-cap mutual funds SIP investor needs to avoid:

1] Making small-cap funds a part of the core portfolio: An investor may follow the core and satellite portfolio strategy when investing in equity funds to attain vital financial goals. The core portfolio offers stability as it consists of large-cap index and other funds that are less risky assets than small-cap. The satellite portfolio is a tactical allocation where you take a comparatively higher risk to enhance overall portfolio returns. Small-cap mutual funds SIP should be a part of one's satellite portfolio.

""You may invest in small-cap funds through the systematic investment plan SIP as part of the satellite portfolio not the core portfolio. But these funds go through drastic up and down phases and are vulnerable to a stock market correction. If you make small-cap funds a part of your core portfolio in a weak market it could wipe out your investment if small-cap funds crash further"" said Archit Gupta Founder & CEO at Clear.

2] Waiting for right time to enter: For starting a mutual funds SIP one need not to wait for a right time as SIP gives average return given by the index during the investment period. So one can start a mutual fund SIP any time and need not to wait for the weak market to stabilize.

""Even now many investors wait for the right time to invest. This is like timing the market. The primary purpose of SIP is to invest across all market movements. According to Warren Buffet one of the most successful investor the right time to invest is now. Investing as early as possible allows more time for compounding to work its wonders"" said Abhinav Angirish Founder at Investonline.in.

3] Investing in small-cap funds that have crashed heavily: It's advisable for one time investor to invest in a small-cap fund that has corrected heavily during the bear market. However for a SIP investor such practice is suicidal because it pulls down one's average return at the time of maturity. One should look at those small-cap plans that have lost the least during weakness in the market as they have strong chances of recovery once the market gets stabilized.

""You may prefer investing in small-cap funds that have crashed heavily during a bear market. However when investing in small-cap funds through SIPs you may pick those with consistent performance over three to five years. Moreover you must check the performance of small-cap funds in previous bear markets. It helps to pick small-cap funds that have outperformed their benchmark and peers in a stock market downturn. If you pick small-cap funds which have crashed heavily in a weak market without paying attention to their track record you may not realise higher returns when the small-cap space outperforms"" said Archit Gupta of Clear.

4] Not increasing the SIP amount: A small increase leads to large increase in one's mutual funds maturity amount. So irrespective of the market mood a mutual funds SIP investor is advised to increase one's SIP amount at a regular interval without fail in any circumstances.

""Step-up your SIPs as your income increases. This will help you to amass larger corpus with a small increase in your SIPs every year. It might sound surprising but an SIP of just ₹5000 every month for 30 years can fetch you corpus of Rs. 1.74 crore. But if you increase your SIPs by just 10 per cent every year the same corpus amounts to ₹4.40 crore!"" said Abhinav Angirish of Investonline.in.

5] Discontinuing SIP when the market is weak: Many people invest in small-cap funds through SIPs when they are performing well and stop them in a weak market. If you panic and stop SIPs in small-cap funds when markets are volatile you may not have the risk appetite for the investment. Investing in small-cap funds through SIPs helps you average out the purchase price of your investment called Rupee Cost Averaging. For instance SIP enables you to invest a fixed amount at regular intervals in mutual funds irrespective of stock market levels.

""You will accumulate more units when stock markets are down and lesser units when markets rise. It helps average the unit's purchase price over time without timing the stock market. However if you stop SIPs in small-cap funds in a weak market you will lose the opportunity to average out the purchase price of units at lower market levels"" said Archit Gupta of Clear.

The assets in question are Bitcoin Cash Chainlink Litecoin Polkadot and Uniswap.

The statement from earlier this week informed that the largest digital asset manager had sold “certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings.”

Consequently Grayscale has removed BCH LINK LTC DOT and UNI from the Digital Large Cap Fund and will not add any replacements.

Bitcoin continues to have the largest share within the aforementioned fund with 68.88% followed by Ethereum 25.22% Cardano (2.71%) Solana (2.23%) and Avalanche (0.96%).

Grayscale has also removed Yearn Finance (YFI) from its DeFi Fund and will not replace it with another asset. Uniswap (56.35%) is the clear leader in this product MakerDAO (13.49%) Aave (12.44%) Curve DAO Token (7.48%) Amp (5.52%) and Compound (4.72%) are next.

Lastly the asset manager has delisted Stellar Lumens from the Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index where Cardano Solana and Polkadot have the largest shares.

These changes come at an intriguing time for Grayscale which has seen its AUM decreased considerably in the past year or so.

The company is mainly focused on converting its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF in the States which has seen little-to-no success. The SEC rejected Grayscale’s latest application which pushed the asset manager into pursuing legal action against the securities watchdog."

Colombo (Agenzia Fides) - Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith Archbishop of Colombo appealed to the international community to assist in providing Sri Lanka with medicines and equipment for hospitals amid its economic crisis and in recent days invoked once again also the help of the Holy See.

""We need to support the children’s hospital in Borella and the cancer hospital in Maharagama especially for medicines and equipment"" said the Cardinal touching on the issue of corruption: ""There will be investigations in the future into the disappearance of the national gold reserves: people have a right to know how they have squandered the country's wealth"". Due to poor management of the economy essential goods are scarce in Sri Lanka which is experiencing its worst economic crisis since 1948. ""Doctors working in hospitals find it difficult to come to hospitals on time due to the fuel crisis. We are with the people in their grief"" the Cardinal noted. Due to the disruption in the distribution of fuel across the country the government closed schools from June 27 to July 1 and other closures regarding universities government agencies and private institutions are expected due to the lack of fuel. Transport and distribution of vegetables to wholesale markets could also collapse.

According to the government it was not possible to announce the arrival dates of the ships carrying fuel for banking and logistical reasons.

In the midst of the crisis the Church does not forget the case of the Easter attacks three years ago: Cardinal Ranjith filed a written petition at the Court of Appeal asking for an order ordering the government to implement the recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the 2019 Easter Sunday Attacks. That report calls for investigations of gross negligence and errors by numerous public officials including officials serving in the Sri Lankan police and advocates disciplinary sanctions as well as the withdrawal of passports so that suspects do not flee abroad.

The incident occurred aboard Carnival Elation late on Wednesday July 6 as the ship was returning to its homeport in Jacksonville at the end of a 5-night sailing to The Bahamas.

Multiple Guests Injured

According to reports from passengers onboard who witnessed the incident at least eight guests were directly involved and several received injuries. Some of those injured had only been trying to intervene and stop the disruption but they were pushed aside instead.

Witnesses claimed the perpetrators knew one another and it is possible the incident was escalated by personal issues. Security was called and eventually broke up the disturbance.

Carnival Cruise Line released a brief statement to First Coast News about the incident which reads: “Our security team onboard Carnival Elation intervened in an altercation between guests. The matter was reported to law enforcement and an investigation is being completed. We won’t tolerate behavior that disrupts other guests’ vacations and those who instigated the altercation will no longer be able to sail on our ships.“

The Fantasy-class Carnival Elation which can host up to 2190 guests when fully booked was finishing a 5-night sailing that had departed Jacksonville on Saturday July 2.

The ship called on Nassau on Monday July 4 and on Princess Cays on Tuesday July 5. Wednesday the day of the incident was a Fun Day at Sea.

The ship returned to Jacksonville on schedule and there was no delay in the start of its next voyage a 4-night sailing to The Bahamas.

A Disturbing Trend

This is not the only incident reported on cruise ships in recent days. In late June an altercation involving dozens of passengers erupted aboard the Dream-class Carnival Magic as the ship was returning to New York City after an Eastern Caribbean sailing.

That altercation was apparently sparked by accusations of infidelity onboard the ship. It began at roughly 2 a.m. on Monday June 27 and ranged across several decks as those involved moved about pausing and resuming their argument at different times until ultimately security broke up the group.

After that event shoreside authorities were contacted to interview those involved as well as witnesses to begin an investigation.

Another disruptive episode was also reported recently aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Voyager-class Navigator of the Seas in early July. Roughly a dozen passengers were involved in that incident on deck 5 of the vessel near the Cafe Promenade. That incident was believed to have been between family members.

Navigator of the Seas is currently sailing 3-4 night cruises from Los Angeles to Catalina and Ensenada.

What Are the Consequences?

When such situations happen cruise lines are swift to offer consequences. If the incident is a violent one there is a brig available onboard or individuals may be moved to secure areas where they can be closely monitored at all times.

The cruise line may ban passengers from sailing in the future aboard one line or all a corporation’s family of cruise lines or the passengers could be disembarked at the next port of call with no refund and no assistance to return to the cruise embarkation port.

Shoreside authorities can be brought in and those involved may also face legal consequences for their poor behavior depending on the scope of the incident and whether any injuries were reported.

As the investigations for these recent incidents are still ongoing no information is yet available about the final consequences for those involved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRyb3dlc3RkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9mcmFtaW5naGFtLWhvbGxpc3Rvbi1tYXNzYWNodXNldHRzLWNhcm5pdmFsLWZhaXItcGxhbm5lZC1uZXh0LXdlZWsvMTAwMTIyMzkwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnivals are planned for next week in Framingham and Holliston,"Excited chatter cotton candy and thrilling rides. Some of the best summer memories are made at carnivals and there will soon be a chance for locals to create more.

Residents will get opportunities for some summer fun while donating to great causes this coming week at two summer carnivals hosted by the Rotary Club of Framingham and Holliston Lions Club.

“One of the reasons we enjoy doing this is because we love seeing the kids"" said Phil Reimann a member and former president of the Framingham Rotary. ""The kids are just jumping up and down out of sight they’re just so excited.""

Reimann said the club has hosted a summer carnival for about eight years.

“Once the Ferris wheel goes up everybody in town knows there’s a carnival” he said.

The carnival — to be held at Framingham State University’s parking lot off Route 9 — starts Wednesday and runs through Sunday.

All rides and carnival treats (including fried dough and flavor burst ice cream cones) are provided by Cushing Amusements. The Rotary has worked with the Wilmington amusement company since its first carnival.

Individual ride credits are available for purchase online and in person. The Rotary is also offering unlimited ride bracelets for $35 in person and $30 if you buy online. Carnival-goers can use these bracelets from 1-5 p.m. next Saturday and Sunday.

Because the Rotary was not able to host the event last year due to COVID-19 Reimann said people are “really looking forward to it” this summer.

All carnival proceeds and donations will go toward the club’s various charitable efforts and community projects such as educational funds food pantries and sending relief to the war in Ukraine.

“It’s been that way since our club was founded in 1922” said Reimann. “We’re all focused on the same thing: How do we service our community?”

Meanwhile the Holliston Lions Club’s 59th annual carnival will be held Wednesday through Saturday at Holliston High School. The club has been partnering with Fanelli Amusements of Greenville New Hampshire for more than 50 years to bring this event to town said Lions Club President Mike McKenna.

McKenna said there will be a “huge food tent” provided by local butcher Holliston Superette that will satisfy craving — cheeseburgers hot dogs chicken nuggets French fries nachos and a Holliston Superette sausage sub.

And “it wouldn't be a Lions carnival without Tom Merritt’s Famous Chili” he said.

For the first time in three years a fireworks show will close out the carnival at 10 p.m. Saturday. McKenna encourages attendees to find seats by 9:30 p.m.

To enjoy the various rides and games attendees can purchase either individual tickets or wristbands that offer unlimited rides during certain times of the day.

Wristband times and prices are: 5-10 p.m. Thursday $30; 9-11 p.m. Friday $15; and 1-5 p.m. Saturday $30.

All proceeds and donations will go toward funding the Lions Club’s High School Senior Scholarship Program supporting the Massachusetts Lions Eye Research Fund (MLERF) and other charities McKenna said.

“These local charities depend on us to help them so it gives us a great feeling to give back to those in need” he said.

Established in 1951 by the Lions of Massachusetts the MLERF is a nonprofit that works to find cures for a wide range of eye diseases and provides grants to researchers who are studying to develop these cures.

The Lions Club has donated about $300000 to the MLERF since its founding according to its website.

“In the Lions Club our motto is ‘We Serve’ and this is one way that we serve” McKenna said",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9jYXNpbm8tbG95YWx0eS1wcm9ncmFtLWZyZWUtcGVya3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casino loyalty programs on land and at sea,"Casino loyalty programs offer a variety of benefits to augment your experience both on and off the gaming floor but you don't have to be on solid ground to earn rewards when you gamble. Much like cruise line loyalty programs reward you for sailing cruise casinos offer additional perks for your shipboard gaming activity.

Each of the three largest cruise lines has its own casino rewards programs. Royal Caribbean has Club Royale Norwegian Cruise Line has Casinos at Sea and Carnival Cruise Line has Players Club. You'll need a players card with each program to earn status and rewards which is either your cruise card or a separate card you get once you sign up.

If you'd like to nab everything from free drinks to free cruises from your casino play you'll want to sign up for these cruise line casino rewards programs the next time you sail. For even greater benefits discover how to leverage onboard benefits from your elite status elsewhere and follow these tips to get the most out of your time on the gaming floor at sea.

Basics of cruise casino loyalty programs

Cruise-based casino programs operate similarly to their land-based counterparts but with a few crucial differences. You can earn rewards and status for your gaming activity on board a cruise ship and the more you wager the more you'll accrue of both. Like most loyalty programs you'll only earn rewards if your qualifying activity is tracked so remember to use your players card whenever you gamble.

Earning rates vary and aren't always disclosed but the industry standard is for players to earn 1 redeemable point and tier credit for every $5 wagered on reel slots and every $10 wagered on video poker machines. These rates are explicit on both Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line cruises.

Earning rates for table games depend on what you're playing how much you bet and how long you play but since the house edge is lower you can expect to earn less per dollar wagered than you would playing slots. Note that some games (like Texas Hold 'em and coin pushers) aren't eligible to earn rewards.

One major difference from many land-based casinos is that cruise ship casino programs reward you exclusively for gameplay; you won't earn points or benefits from dining shopping or any other onboard activities. Cruise lines instead offer separate loyalty programs that reward guests for sailing activity though some benefits overlap between the two programs.

You can typically redeem earned points for free play or credits to your onboard bill; specifics and minimum redemptions vary by loyalty program. The cruise lines are not transparent about the points-to-dollars conversion rate for credit.

Royal Caribbean Club Royale

(Photo courtesy of Royal Caribbean International)

Club Royale membership is open to guests 18 years or older on most sailings; you must be 21 or older to play on Alaska voyages. You can enroll by using your SeaPass card at an eligible slot machine or presenting it to casino management at a gaming table. You can also enroll before sailing by calling a casino representative at 888-561-2234 or (if you have sailed previously with Royal Caribbean) through the Crown & Anchor Society.

Club Royale offers four status tiers based on gaming activity during the program year which starts April 1 and ends March 31 of the following calendar year.

Choice (1 tier credit).

Prime (2500 tier credits).

Signature (25000 tier credits).

Masters (100000 tier credits).

Choice status lets you redeem points as free play or as credits to your onboard expense account (with a minimum redemption of 5000 points). You'll also begin earning Instant Cruise Rewards Certificates which range from a $100 discount to a complimentary cruise (minus port taxes and fees).

Prime status waives convenience fees up to 5% and gets you complimentary drinks in the casino. At this level you'll also get an annual complimentary cruise in an interior cabin on select sailings (again minus taxes and fees). Signature status gets you complimentary Wi-Fi for one device and upgrades the annual complimentary cruise to a balcony cabin.

Finally the top-tier Masters status adds a slew of perks like priority entertainment access and dining reservations an onboard credit of up to $100 luggage delivery access to exclusive events and a further upgrade to a grand suite on your annual complimentary cruise. You can view a full list of benefits with more details on the Club Royale site.

While you can accrue tier credits for the duration of the program year Royal Caribbean does not carry over redeemable points from one cruise to the next. Unredeemed points expire at the end of each voyage so don't miss the deadline to cash out (typically the night before debarkation).

Norwegian Cruise Line Casinos at Sea

Casinos at Sea is separate from Norwegian's Latitude Rewards program and is open to guests 18 years or older. You can enroll at the casino host desk (which is worth a visit anyway as I'll discuss later). Casinos at Sea offers five status tiers based on gaming activity during the program year which again runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.

Jade (0 points) .

Pearl (5000 points).

Sapphire (15000 points).

Ruby (35000 points).

Elite (100000 points).

Jade status allows you to redeem points as free play or toward onboard expenses like spa treatments specialty dinners and credits to your final bill. The minimum redemption is just 1000 points on sailings of four days or fewer and 2500 points on sailings of five days or more.

At the Pearl level you get a $100 onboard credit complimentary house drinks in the casino free play when sailing in your birth month and stateroom amenities like complimentary candies or dessert delivered to your cabin. At this level you'll start earning discounts on staterooms.

Mid-tier Sapphire status gets you waived convenience fees and priority disembarkation on top of a bump up to complimentary premium drinks a $200 onboard credit and better stateroom discounts. Ruby status adds another step up to larger stateroom discounts and complimentary Ultra drinks along with waived cash advance fees and a complimentary internet package of 400 minutes or 1250MB.

You'll find the high-end benefits when you earn top-tier Elite status which further augments some of the benefits already mentioned and adds a complimentary shore excursion (up to $300 per person for two guests) private transfers and waived service charges.

Note that while Casinos at Sea operates on Norwegian Cruise Line as well as sister cruise lines Oceania and Regent Seven Seas Cruises the benefits described above are specific to Norwegian only. Check the full list of benefits to see which ones apply to your trip.

One feature that sets Casinos at Sea apart from Club Royale is the option to carry points over from one cruise to the next. Points expire 18 months after they're earned rather than at the end of your trip so regular cruisers can build up a sizable balance over time. However if you'd like to redeem points for credit to your onboard bill Norwegian specifies a weirdly tight redemption window which is 6 to 9 p.m. on the last day of your cruise.

Carnival Cruise Line Players Club

The Players Club is available to guests 18 years or older. You can enroll when using your Sail & Sign card in the casino either by inserting it in a slot machine or presenting it to a dealer at a table game.

Unlike with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian (and even Carnival's own VIFP loyalty program) status tiers in the Carnival Players Club are not well defined. Carnival doesn't publish details of how casino perks are earned or redeemed specifying only that ""comps are extended on board based on your level of play.""

However Carnival does advertise four tiers of invitation-only cruise packages with rewards similar to what you'll find in other cruise casino programs so you can get a sense of the available benefits even if the threshold to unlock them is unclear.

At the lower end Getaway cruise packages offer extras like complimentary drinks in the casino premier boarding and special treats or gifts delivered to your room. The mid-tier Premier and Ultra packages come with added perks such as invitations to special events and priority debarkation while the top-tier Elite packages add luxury benefits like a complimentary airport transfer and shore excursion as well as VIFP Club Platinum status for the duration of your cruise.

Ultimately Carnival's path to status is less straightforward than in the other programs but the perks of playing are comparable.

How to leverage casino status for cruise benefits

Your existing status with land-based casino and hotel programs may also qualify you for perks on your next cruise.

The MGM Rewards program offers members a variety of benefits on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises. These range from discount offers and welcome amenities for Sapphire and Pearl members to onboard credits of up to $300 and annual complimentary cruises for Platinum and Noir members. You'll need to validate your MGM Rewards status and request these benefits at the time of cruise booking (at least 10 days before departure).

This creates an opportunity to parlay your World of Hyatt elite status into benefits with both MGM and these two cruise lines with its status match offer. However note that the MGM Platinum and Noir cruise benefits are exclusive to members who earned their tier based on gameplay and other eligible spending; status earned by matching from another program won't cut it.

Caesars Rewards doesn't offer onboard benefits to its elite members but it does offer stateroom discounts as high as 30% on Norwegian Oceania and Regent Seven Seas cruises. Like with MGM and Hyatt you can match your Wyndham Rewards status to Caesars to access these savings.

Finally Carnival offers a chance to earn complimentary cruises and benefits when you show proof of loyalty status with other casinos via the Players Club Fun Match program. One cool aspect of this program is that Carnival considers status from any casino not just the big names so status you've earned at smaller local venues is worth entering.

I tested this myself by submitting proof of my Caesars Rewards Diamond and MGM Rewards Gold status. Within a few days I got an offer for a complimentary interior room with free drinks in the casino and onboard credit.

4 tips to help you play the game

Whatever your status level these suggestions can make your casino experience more rewarding.

Make friends with the casino host

If you plan to spend a lot of time on the gaming floor get acquainted with the casino host early on. While comps and tier benefits are generally prescribed based on your gameplay the casino host has some autonomy to offer perks at their discretion.

They may be able to comp select onboard purchases like meals and shopping expenses and they can always answer questions help you navigate the program and explain which benefits you have and haven't earned. Being on good terms with the host certainly won't hurt.

Look for enrollment and promotional bonuses

Cruise casinos frequently offer incentives to get you in the door such as free bets or matched play; inquire at the host desk if you don't see them advertised elsewhere.

Another common promotion is to load free slot credits to guests' accounts at the start of a trip but these typically expire after the first day or two so use them quickly or lose them.

Finally check whether your cruise offers a ""learn to play"" session which may come with complimentary drinks and casino chips for both novice and experienced gamblers.

You can play with credit — for a fee

Cash is king at the casino but if you're wary of traveling with a big stack of bills you may be able to play by charging your linked onboard account instead. That account settles at the end of your trip along with the rest of your folio using whatever credit card you have on file which means you can effectively earn credit card rewards for casino gaming.

Using a card that earns bonus points on travel purchases is a nice cherry on top of your wins if you come out ahead or it can at least lessen the sting of your losses if you don't. However the cruise line may add a convenience fee for such charges so confirm you're not paying extra before you complete the transaction.

Understand that the odds are against you (even more than usual)

Cruise ship casinos routinely offer game variants that favor the house more than is customary. After all you're a captive audience; it's not like you can go gamble next door instead!

Expect to see rules like blackjack that pays 6 to 5 (instead of 3 to 2) roulette with triple zeros and reduced payouts on slots and video poker machines. The bright side of this is that you'll generally encounter lower minimum bets than you would at brick-and-mortar casinos especially compared to the Las Vegas Strip.

Bottom line

While it's fun to earn perks casino play is not an efficient path to earning elite status. If you're earning 1 tier credit per $5 wagered on reel slots you'd need to bet $12500 or $25000 to reach first-tier status with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian respectively and a whopping $500000 to reach top-tier status in either program. Those figures refer to the amount wagered and not the amount won or lost but if you (generously) assume a payout rate of 90% then you can expect to lose about $50000 reaching the top tier. With that in mind the perks of status seem a lot less perky.

You could beat the odds and end up a winner with status to boot but ultimately playing in the casino solely to earn elite benefits is a losing proposition. Instead think of these programs as a way to get some extra rewards out of whatever gaming you already planned to do.

Changes for ski season 2022-2023

American is making some notable changes to its domestic network ahead of the ski season.

The airline will launch new service between Austin (AUS) and Vail/Eagle (EGE) beginning on Dec. 15. Regional affiliate SkyWest Airlines will fly a 65-seat CRJ-700 on the 835-mile route.

American will also add a new route from its Miami (MIA) hub to Jackson Hole (JAC) beginning on Dec. 15. The airline will deploy a 128-seat Airbus A319 on the route.

Both new routes will operate daily between Dec. 15 and Jan. 9 weekly between Jan. 10 and Feb. 15 and then daily between Feb. 16 and April 3.

American will also extend the season for its daily service between Los Angeles (LAX) and Bozeman (BZN). The airline will fly the route during the peak holiday period from Dec. 15 through Jan. 2 and then from Feb. 16 through April 3.

At the same time the airline is canceling several routes that it was originally selling for the winter season including:

Perhaps most interesting is that American is continuing to expand in Austin a city that's seen explosive growth from the carrier during the pandemic.

The airline unveiled two major tranches of network expansions in the Texas state capital last year. It started in March 2021 when the carrier doubled down on the city with 10 new routes. Three months later American followed up with 14 additional new routes including a mix of domestic and international destinations to cities in Mexico Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

The carrier has continued to add additional service from Austin in smaller network updates and it also plans to open a brand-new Admirals Club in the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.

Shuffling service at New York-JFK

Separately American is making some notable adjustments to its international network from its hub at New York-JFK.

The airline is canceling service from JFK to Bogota (BOG) effective Nov. 3 due to ""reduced demand"" according to a statement from a carrier spokesperson. This route was originally added when the airline kicked off the Northeast Alliance with JetBlue back in mid-2021.

While American will no longer fly to Bogota from New York the airline will continue serving the Colombian capital from Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) and Miami.

In place of the Bogota route the airline will launch new service from JFK to Mexico City (MEX) on Nov. 3. The carrier will deploy a 172-seat Boeing 737 MAX 8 on the new daily flight.

The airline is seemingly hopeful that there'll be more demand to Mexico City than there was to Bogota. That said American will face stiff competition on the 2090-mile route: it'll go head-to-head with Mexican flag carrier Aeromexico ultra-low-cost discounter VivaAerobus and Delta Air Lines.

Interestingly American already canceled the two other new routes that it launched to Colombia as part of the Northeast Alliance. In May the carrier announced plans to terminate service between New York-JFK and both Cali (CLO) and Medellin (MDE) in Colombia.

Israel gets a big boost

Finally there's some good news for American's longest route from Miami. Starting on Oct. 29 the carrier will upgrade its MIA to Tel Aviv (TLV) flight to daily service.

The route first launched in June 2021 with a three-times-weekly frequency and it's clearly performed well enough for American to now upgrade it to daily service.

However the airline is downgauging the aircraft from a 273-seat Boeing 777-200 to a 234-seat Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner when daily service commences in October.

For premium passengers that'll mean 17 fewer business-class pods but four additional premium economy recliners. All but four of American's 787-8 Dreamliners are outfitted with the Safran Concept D business-class product which many flyers consider to be inferior to the Collins Aerospace Super Diamond ones that you can find on 28 of the airline's Boeing 777-200s. (The other 19 Boeing 777-200s feature the Concept D product.)

Before the pandemic American hadn't flown to Tel Aviv since January 2016. Now it serves Israel from two hubs — JFK and MIA; these routes were launched on May 6 2021 and June 4 2021 respectively.

The airline had plans to add a third Tel Aviv route three times weekly from its DFW mega-hub on Nov. 1 2021 but it was delayed multiple times before being scrapped altogether in May.

And now American is now making up for some of the capacity it lost when it canceled plans to launch the DFW to Tel Aviv flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbGFza2EtYWlybGluZXMtZmxlZXQtaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nearly 350 Narrowbodies: The Alaska Airlines Fleet In 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbGFza2EtYWlybGluZXMtZmxlZXQtaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9qdWwvMTEvcWFudGFzLWJhZ2dhZ2UtaGFuZGxlci1zYXlzLXRoZXJlcy1ub3QtZW5vdWdoLW9mLXVzLXRoZXJlLXRvLWdldC10by1hbGwtdGhlLWJhZ3PSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvanVsLzExL3FhbnRhcy1iYWdnYWdlLWhhbmRsZXItc2F5cy10aGVyZXMtbm90LWVub3VnaC1vZi11cy10aGVyZS10by1nZXQtdG8tYWxsLXRoZS1iYWdz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qantas: outsourced baggage handler says one in 10 bags not making flights at Sydney domestic terminal,"As many as one in 10 pieces of luggage on average are either getting lost or not being loaded onto Qantas domestic flights each day at Sydney airport according to a baggage handler who works for the company that the carrier outsourced jobs to.

Guardian Australia can separately reveal that Swissport – one of the main companies Qantas has outsourced to supply baggage handling services – has itself been forced to contract two separate labour hire firms to find workers for shifts that Qantas has contracted it to fill.

Amid widespread staff shortages across ground handling and aviation businesses as the beleaguered sector struggles to cope with a return to pre-pandemic travel demand attrition rates are soaring among new employees scarred by chaotic scenes and poor conditions – with Swissport now offering a $50 a day bonus to baggage handlers at Sydney airport simply for turning up to their shifts for the rest of the year.

While global and local carriers have long relied on third-party contractors to fulfil ground handling services away from their hubs Qantas and its budget carrier Jetstar’s dominance in Australia have meant the recent surge in lost luggage and its emergence as the airline with the worst on-time performance and cancellation rates in May have been significant contributors to the chaotic scenes at Australian airports this year.

Qantas has suffered a shortage of baggage handlers since its 2020 decision to outsource about 1700 jobs. That decision was found to be unlawful and in part motivated by anti-union sentiment and the airline is now attempting to challenge that finding in the high court.

In an interview with Guardian Australia one Swissport baggage handler in Sydney – who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution – raised concerns that those loading and transporting bags to and from Qantas and Jetstar flights were overworked poorly paid and unable to handle the increase in baggage in recent months as domestic travel had soared.

The worker said that of the roughly 100 barrows or trolleys seen by a typical baggage handler each day at the Sydney domestic airport “these days there are about 10 barrows each day that just don’t make it on”. Each barrow carries 30 to 40 pieces of luggage.

They said that during recent school holiday peaks office managers from Qantas and Swissport had rolled up their sleeves and helped move luggage alongside handlers however “there’s just still not enough of us there to get to all the bags”.

Qantas declined to give its own figures for how many bags were mishandled (lost or otherwise did not make it on to the correct flight) recently at Sydney domestic terminal but a spokesperson said in a statement after this article was first published such claims were “completely inaccurate”.

“Claims that one in 10 bags have been mishandled are wrong” they said. “The rate of mishandled baggage across the Qantas network over the past four weeks is less than one per cent and our teams are working hard to get this figure down further.”

In recent months Swissport has contracted labour hire firms Star Aviation and Workfast – the latter of which is not aviation-specific – to fill the shortages in its teams working on Qantas and Jetstar operations. Training and processes differ depending on the airline with the type of aircraft dictating how luggage is loaded.

The Swissport worker who spoke to the Guardian said about 25% of his colleagues each day were from labour hire firms many of which do not have specific training. As a result they said some were cutting corners or doing less thorough work.

“A lot of us get frustrated with them because they don’t do basic stuff properly. Sometimes they just move but don’t scan bags which is a necessity because it can mean we don’t know weight distribution in a plane or if a bag has arrived.

“They’ve also been dropping transfer bags on arrival carousels which is a reason why bags aren’t making it onto flights with passengers” they said.

The worker said staff attrition was becoming a bigger problem as the airport environment became busier and more demanding and said many of those who joined Swissport when they did as well as in subsequent months had left for jobs either in different industries as well as with other airlines and aviation businesses at Sydney airport that pay more than Swissport does.

They said that while staff were not complaining about the temporary $50 a day bonus for turning up to work they were still frustrated at conditions. “Swissport is offering anything except permanent wage increases.”

Additionally in jobs Swissport is advertising in cities such as Brisbane the company is stipulating new employees spend their first month at Sydney airport – billed as a “great opportunity to experience Sydney” – where it is also paying for their hotel accommodation.

At a recent jobs fair at Sydney airport Swissport was hiring part-time contracts but offering workers full-time hours under these contracts at $23.41 an hour.

The worker said recent coverage of Qantas’s big spends on new ultra-long-haul aircraft for direct flights to Europe had angered tired workers and Swissport employees were increasingly talking about union organising. “I can’t tell you how frustrating it is seeing Alan Joyce on TVs where we work showing off these shiny new flights.”

The worker also raised concern that during a busy shift recently when a colleague injured themselves both the supervisor and manager were busy helping out with other activities and with no on-site health and safety representative there was no one to report the injury to.

“I would tell everyone don’t check in bags when you fly with Qantas right now or even better if you can avoid it don’t fly Qantas at all” the worker said.

Staff shortages and attrition was an increasing problem for ground handler providers and the airlines that rely on them. One industry source told Guardian Australia that in recent weeks one company started 20 new employees at 9am on a Monday at one Australian airport. By 4pm that day eight of them had quit and by the Friday of that week just seven of the 20 employees remained.

“The young people coming into these roles they’re getting yelled at they’re getting paid poorly and now they’re saying ‘you know what bugger this I’m going to work in a cafe because I get paid as much or more than I do here and don’t have the stress’.”

“And those who got sacked during the pandemic are saying they don’t want to go back to the industry that shut on them overnight. So we’ve got this huge void of experience” the source said.

The Transport Workers Union has long been critical of Qantas’s outsourcing decision successfully challenging it in the federal court. The TWU’s national secretary Michael Kaine said Swissport had “no choice but to keep wages low because Qantas’s squeeze on contracts is neither sustainable nor safe”.

“It is no surprise that Swissport can’t recruit or retain staff. Swissport would rather pay workers an extra $50 a day to show up for work bring in interstate workers and outsource to companies like Star Aviation than pay proper wages.”

A Qantas spokesperson earlier told the Guardian “resourcing continues to be a challenge for the entire aviation industry” and its ground handling suppliers had “improved significantly since the holiday peak in April”.

“While there’s still a lot more to be done to improve our operational performance the rate of mishandled baggage has improved in recent months” the spokesperson said.

A Swissport spokesperson said the company had worked with Qantas to varying degrees for decades because “the scale of our operations means that we can deliver a cost-effective service that is safe and reliable”.

“The rapid rebound in travel demand has put pressure on resourcing across the entire aviation sector both here in Australia and around the world.”

This story was amended on 11 July 2022 to clarify that an individual baggage handler would see about 100 barrows a day at the airport. This is not the total number that go through the terminal each day as an earlier version implied.

At hangars in Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport  stand three aircraft of the country’s national carrier SriLankan Airlines . They are bereft of engines whose deliveries have been delayed due to production and logistics issues at the supplier’s end.Delays in plane and engine deliveries are giving airline CEOs across the world sleepless nights as they try to cope with a rapid bounceback in air travel demand after two years of the Covid-19 pandemic.But they are the least of Richard Nuttall ’s worries. Sri Lankan Airlines’ CEO of seven months has much graver issues to grapple with: where the airline will get fuel to fly its planes; whether there’s enough cash to run its operations for the next few weeks; and most critically with an economically crippled government unable to support it and hoping to privatise it how soon will the airline get a new owner?“At the moment it’s tight. We are managing cash flows month to month” Nuttall told ET in a recent interview.An Oxford graduate and Sloan masters degree holder Nuttall has 30 years of experience in various airlines across the world. He was named SriLankan’s acting CEO in January and confirmed in April.He is struggling to keep SriLankan Airlines flying even as its owner struggles to keep the country running. Sri Lanka’s government last funded its airline in March 2021 according to Nuttall.The carrier is now surviving on cash flows from its operations even as air travel continues to be hit by the country’s deep economic strife and instances of violent demonstrations by citizens. About 85% of the carrier’s revenue comes from sales outside Sri Lanka which is giving it the foreign currency to buy spares and fuel said Nuttall.About 2500 kilometres away in Karachi Amir Hayat has similar worries. The acting chief of the government-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is trying hard to convince its debtors and suppliers to defer payments and the government to restructure its debt. Air Vice Marshal Hayat was appointed acting CEO in April after his predecessor Arshad Malik completed his tenure and moved on. Hayat was advisor to Malik.PIA has 31 planes three of which are grounded two stuck with a lessor; and faces a global ban on flights to the West.The Pakistan government has said it has no plans to privatise it yet although the airline has been criticised for being ill-run and faces competition from smaller but profitable private rivals such as Airblue. Air India  a government airline in much worse shape than its neighbours nevertheless fared better. The Tata Group  which bought it from the Indian government for Rs 18000 crore ($2.4 billion) is now trying to revive it by increasing its operating efficiency cutting costs and buying new planes.Interestingly SriLankan which is in the worst predicament among the three airlines was recently doing better than both. This was despite an economic crisis in the country that began in 2019. “We recovered from Covid-19 very fast.We were breaking even in the six months between October 2021 and March 2022. We made a small net profit of $0.61 million compared to a loss of $147 million a year earlier. In fact we made $12 million in the last four months (till March ’22)” said Nuttall.SriLankan’s outstanding debt is about $855 million. For comparison Air India’s outstanding debt as on August 2021 was Rs 60562 crore ($7.6 billion) primarily on sovereign guarantees to fund its losses. As of 2021 SriLankan had accumulated losses of about LKR 36600 crore (over $1 billion). PIA’s accumulated loss and liabilities as of 2021 was PKR 50000 crore ($2.4 billion).The carriers posted losses of LKR 5000 crore ($137 million) and PKR 5000 crore ($241 million) respectively for 2021. In comparison Air India’s accumulated losses as of March 2021 were Rs 83916 crore ($10.4 billion).Nuttall said revenue started falling from May. In June Sri Lanka’s PM Ranil Wickremesinghe said the economy had collapsed. “Our country has no dollars” said Nuttall. “This means it’s very difficult for us to buy fuel abroad or borrow money.”Revenues are used up in operations. “Due to the situation in the country it has not been possible to obtain external financing for the airline since early 2021. This meant some restructuring with creditors and reductions in staff salaries to get through the challenges of Covid” said Nuttall admitting the company was often late in paying salaries and repaying debt.The airline recently announced that it was making use of a 30-day grace period to pay interest on its $175 million 7% 2024 bonds. SriLankan was majority owned by Gulf carrier Emirates between 1998 and 2008.Then the government bought back the shares and it now owns 99% of the airline. The carrier has been making annual net losses since 2008-09.Emirates’ CEO Tim Clark recently said the airline “did its job” turning SriLankan to profits. He said the airline could turn itself around but for the “pickle” the country has landed itself into. He didn’t say whether Emirates would again invest in the airline.Nuttall said it would not be difficult to find a buyer. “The airline has shown it can be profitable. There is a lot of debt. But if you can work out some way to restructure debt which is what usually happens when you privatise then there’s every chance that we have something here that is attractive to multiple parties” he said.SriLankan has 24 aircraft — 12 narrow bodied and 12 wide bodied planes — of which three are grounded. Nuttall said all of them would be well deployed as demand for travel increases in summer.PIA’s problem is different. It cannot exploit the opportunities arising from the world wanting to travel. For the last year and a half aviation authorities in the US UK and Europe have banned flights from Pakistan into those regions. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) banned it after a PIA flight PK8303 crashed in Karachi two years ago. Earlier this year the International Civil Aviation Organization satisfactorily completed an audit of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority. But the bans are yet to be lifted. An EASA audit scheduled for earlier this year has been delayed and is now expected in a month and a half Abdullah H. Khan PIA’s head of marketing and communications told ET. PIA flies charters to the UK and regular flights to Canada where it faces no ban.At home the Pakistani rupee has been weakening and foreign exchange reserves are at historic lows. “Recovery is a challenge. PIA is engaging all stakeholders including lessors and customer service providers to ensure financial liabilities are met. Though it will be very challenging as the fiscal situation of airlines is not idealistic — we are still in the phase of recovery while the liabilities are all of the normal times” said Hayat.Khan said the airline has been posting continuous losses since 2004. “The government doesn’t fund those losses. They are funded by advanced sales of tickets sovereign guarantees and asset-backed loans. The losses are on our balance sheet and along with liabilities have ballooned to an accumulated PKR 500 billion ($2.4 billion). Our assets are worth PKR 110 billion ($530 million) which means the worth of the airline’s equity is almost negative PKR 400 billion ($1.9 billion). We have been asking the government to restructure our debt and dues.”Like SriLankan PIA too is on the road to recovery. Both Hayat and Khan said the airline posted operating profits in the last quarter of the previous year and the first two quarters of this year.PIA is only flying 55% of its pre-Covid capacity of 550 flights a week said Khan. Hayat is pinning hopes on the ongoing Haj travel to buoy demand. He expects to operate 75% of pre-Covid flights by the year-end.Hayat also said he expects the government to announce incentives for the aviation sector in the upcoming budget. PIA has already added two narrowbodied aircraft to its fleet this year and will add two more this month.Both Sri Lanka and Pakistan are looking to the International Monetary Fund for support. Sri Lanka has got some credit lines from India. Both the airlines are waiting for fuel prices to cool demand to rise and for their governments to rejig their debts.“It’s a precarious situation. We have managed that way for 15 months. It’s got a bit more complicated in the last two months but we are coming to the summer season which should help us come back” said Nuttall.Nuttall insisted Sri Lanka is safe. He said he recently brought his 14 year old son and he is training for cricket there.But public anger over the economic crisis shows no sign of abating. On Saturday protesters stormed Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s residence forcing him to flee.On how long he gave the airline to survive before it got a new owner Nuttall signed off with a typical British expression. “How long is a piece of string? It depends on the fuel price. It depends on the situation in the country. That’s an impossible question to answer.”"

For answers turn to Ask an Expert an online question-and-answer tool from Oregon State University’s Extension Service. OSU Extension faculty and Master Gardeners reply to queries within two business days usually less. To ask a question simply go to the OSU Extension website type it in and include the county where you live. Here are some questions asked by other gardeners. What’s yours?

Q: Last weekend I found that a branch portion of my hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii) had been stripped of leaves and I saw caterpillars on the stems. I attempted to identify the caterpillars online but to no avail. I removed the branch from my tree and put it in an open container in my garage. They have since pupated into white hairy cocoons.

I am curious if they are invasive and should be destroyed or if they are native and should be allowed to complete their life cycle. Although I would rather not release them in my yard as I don’t want them denuding my trees. – Multnomah County

A: Those are larvae of primitive wasps called sawflies. I believe those are ones called mountain ash sawflies Pristiphora geniculata. Mountain ash sawflies are introduced from Europe but have been established in Washington state since 2009. I haven’t heard of them being in Oregon but they likely just dispersed here from our neighboring state to the north. Mountain ash sawfly larvae feed in groups and primarily feed on the leaves of mountain ash trees. They also feed on hawthorn leaves though. Here is a link to a photo of a mountain ash sawfly larva for comparison so you can see what you think. Although these larvae are voracious eaters and can almost completely defoliate healthy trees they very rarely kill trees even if they repeatedly eat all the leaves. If you do want to eliminate these sawflies you can just freeze the pupae to kill them.

If you encounter them again you can pick the larvae off the leaves and freeze them again or you can use various insecticides. Insecticides for control of larval sawflies recommended in the PNW Insect Management Handbook include acephate acetamiprid azadirachtin carbaryl esfenvalerate fluvalinate horticultural oils imidacloprid insecticidal soap pyrethrins pyrethroids spinosad and thiamethoxam.

Most of these are sprayed to kill on contact so good plant coverage is important and they work best when the larvae are young.

Move arugula to help in soil health

Q: I grow arugula and always let it bolt in the spring to provide flowers for pollinators. Eventually I take it out but the seeds replant themselves and new plants come back each year in the same place. I always add compost and mix up the soil well but given that this is a cruciferous plant is this harming the soil? – Yamhill County

A: You are correct to be concerned about arugula growing in the same area year after year. It does allow disease and pest pressure to increase. What you could do with a little more effort is to take the mature seed heads to a different part of the garden each year and shake the seeds out. That way you still get the self-seeded effect but with you directing where they grow. Here is a brief fact sheet from University of Wisconsin Extension on Using Crop Rotation in Home Vegetable Gardens. It will help you make sense of the process. – Anna Ashby OSU Extension Master Gardener

A black walnut tree. File photo. (Staten Island Advance/Bill Lyons)Staten Island Advance

Black walnut’s natural herbicide could damage nearby plants

Q: I have a red currant bush that’s been in a pot for years. We planted it today and discovered a small hazelnut growing in it and a black walnut (nut attached) growing in it also. All of the roots were intertwined. All of the plants are very healthy. I want to plant the black walnut but heard that they can damage other trees and plants especially fruits. We have a lot of fruit and berry and hazelnut on our property. Please advise.

A: Although the black walnut has many uses and benefits the tree does come with a caveat: The black walnut’s roots which may extend 50 feet or more from the trunk exude a natural herbicide known as juglone.

This substance is also found in the tree’s leaves and fruit husks. Juglone does serve a purpose though. It inhibits many plants’ growth under and around the tree thereby limiting the tree’s competition leaving more water and nutrients for itself. Vegetables apples pears and berries and some landscape plants such as rhododendron azaleas and lilac may be killed or stunted if grown in close proximity to black walnut roots or within the tree’s drip line (i.e. under the tree’s canopy). Plan your landscaping accordingly. – Douglas County

When’s the best time to kill off lawns for later ground cover planting?

Q: I’ve had such a great experience establishing hardy ground cover in a new terraced part of my back yard that I’m considering converting the grass I have in my front yard to ground cover as well.

When is the best time to cover/kill the current grass and plant the ground cover? Should we kill in summer/fall and plant late fall or cover and kill fall/winter and plant in spring?

I had success putting in the new ground cover (no previous grass) in late fall but wasn’t sure if the grass that needs to die plays any part in the equation. – Clackamas County

A: Beautiful! You can start the lasagna mulching now with the goal of depriving your of sun water and nutrients by fall. Then depending on the species you can start planting in the fall or wait until early spring. You might want to try a new mix or a commercial ecolawn. Here is a good Extension article with more specifics.

The spongy moth is back and dangerous as ever says one Vancouver Island arborist.

Formerly known as the gypsy moth the Lymantria dispar moth was introduced from Europe to the northeastern U.S. in 1869. The North American strain of the moth was first seen in B.C. in 1978. They’re a massive problem in Ontario and trying to become one here in B.C.

The damaging part of their life cycle is the larval stage as caterpillars will completely defoliate a tree Dan Sharp told Black Press Media.

“Trees are resilient they’re strong and adaptive but it does drain on their nutrients” said Sharp district manager for Davey Tree in Victoria.

The tree must dip into its energy resources and if that happens year after year it creates a stressed tree which becomes a target for other pathogens and insects. The tree likely won’t have the strength to fend off those attacks.

The spongy moth has been around a long time residents should be familiar with the provincial response and bid to eradicate it using aerial sprays.

This spring the Ministry of Forests sprayed 50 hectares in View Royal 402 hectares in Lake Cowichan and more than 1068 hectares in the Nanoose/Lantzville/Nanaimo area with insecticide to combat the invasive spongy moth citing its danger to food crops including apples and blueberries and trees including Garry oak arbutus red alder aspen cottonwood maple orchard fruit trees and nut trees.

Their population in the sprayed areas has increased drastically according to 2021 trapping and monitoring data from the province. Egg clusters are typically transported to B.C. on clothes and recreational vehicles from outside the province.

Spraying on Vancouver Island wrapped on June 21 and the next stage in the ongoing process is to monitor and assess trapping results over the summer and by late fall determine if this year’s efforts were successful and if treatments will be required in 2023.

If it becomes too established it will be impossible to control much like Ontario’s struggles Sharp said.

Now is a good time to monitor and report.

“The timing for treatment on the caterpillars is first thing in the spring” he said. That’s because they’re microscopic when born and will have heavily damaged a tree by the time they’re visible. He recommends watching for holes and to report to the province and local arborist if they’re spotted.

Residents should also watch for two other insect populations on the rise – the winter moth and the bronze birch borer.

The winter moth has a different life cycle and emerge as moths in late fall which puts them in the defoliation caterpillar phase in early spring.

The bronze birch borer is a native beetle but overly abundant. Much as the name implies it’s a brown bug that digs into birch flesh. When you see a birch dying from the top down it’s generally courtesy of the beetle Sharp said.

While it is native the bug feeds preferentially on the introduced white birch in the region – popular with homeowners and for streetscapes. Because it digs in there are few remedies at the moment.

Sharp says they’re working on attaining approval for an injectable pesticide with trials underway for new products to control them in a bid to keep urban trees healthy. They hope to see results in the next year or two. In the meantime arborists can only prune out the damage fertilize and mulch to keep the tree healthy and hopefully thriving.

Teachers in schools often use the evolution of the peppered moth as a good example of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.

The Peppered Moth is a small insect of merely a few inches that has tiny black spots on its wings. Hence the name Peppered Moth. It exists as the best example of evolution in the history of science. Researchers discovered a special gene whose presence in this moth turned its whole color black. This allowed them to study natural selection and helped in understanding evolution.

Peppered Moth Species Types and Scientific name

The peppered moth Biston betularia is a species of European moth in the family Geometridae and of the order Lepidoptera. There are only one known species Biston betularia of the Peppered Moth however there are a few subspecies.

The Peppered Moth may be found in three different colors pale grey dark black color and black with white spots coloration. This ultimately helped in learning about natural selection. But an unfortunate thing about their species is that they became very sparse in number during the 1980s but soon after they began to repopulate.

While there are a lot of moths in the world more than 160000 the exact number of the Peppered Moth population is not known yet. They are however found in various parts of Europe.

The seven subspecies of the Peppered Moth as described by scientists are as follows;

Biston betularia alexandrina Biston betularia cognataria Biston betularia contrasta Biston betularia fumosaria Biston betularia nepalensis Biston betularia parva Biston betularia vlachi

Appearance: How To Identify Peppered Moth?

The Peppered Moth is best identified because of the markings on its body. This helps them camouflage with their surroundings and protects them from unwanted dangers. Their habitat usually consists of tree bark which makes their camouflage perfect for protection.

It has a broad long and slender body that resembles a twig-like caterpillar. It is covered in fur and has long wings as narrow and straight that it prefers keeping on the outside. The wings also have brown bands on the frame and carry a wingspan of 1.5 – 2.5 inches. The color is usually white with black pepper-like spots but some of them have a completely black body.

If you take a deep look at their heads you will find a small cleft that makes it appear as a broken stem again which is great for camouflage. In addition their legs resemble that of long thorns that not only help in locomotion but also hide them completely in the tree bark. All in all the Peppered Moth is the perfect agent in camouflage.

The Peppered Moth has a very distinctive look and also shows similarities to a lichen. A lichen is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae that has a disoriented type structure found on many trees and plants. This unique characteristic makes the peppered moth look even more like a tree branch.

The Peppered Moth experience sexual dimorphism. The males have two thick antennae with a feathery nature and are clearly distinguishable from the females.

They are not found in groups. The Peppered Moth is solitary and can be found alone on top of tree bark. It makes sense for it to be unsociable as its whole life is part of a disguise in camouflage. However they may sometimes be found in pairs in the form of a female and male Peppered Moth. The male keeps close to the female to mark its paternity.

As for its behavior the Peppered Moth comes out at night and does most of its flying in the nighttime as well. It is safe to say that it is a nocturnal insect hiding from its predators in the morning under disguise and in locomotion at night.

Habitat: Where to find Peppered Moth?

They are found in various parts of the world but reside mainly in different parts of Europe. You can spot them in England Ireland Scotland and the Northern parts of America. They are mainly found in shrublands and parklands. But some of their species can also be found in woodland forests.

In these areas their main site is the tree barks. Since they resemble a tree branch they can easily disguise themselves as one of these tree barks.

The Peppered Moths are usually seen flying around at night but during the seasons of May and August they are seen together in pairs to mate and reproduce. The female can lay up to 2000 eggs in one reproductive cycle and these eggs can hatch into caterpillars within just two weeks.

Evolution: What is the Story of the Peppered Moth?

It all started in the 1800s when the population of the famous white-colored peppered moth suddenly started decreasing. In 1811 there was a black peppered moth with no spots discovered. In 1848 the population of this black type of the moth suddenly started surging at a high rate.

The number of these species increased so much that by 1895 there was a record hit by the black peppered moths that outnumbered the light-colored ones by 98%. Later it was realized that the sudden increase did not happen overnight but was a case of evolution.

In those times in England there was quite a high rate of air pollution. This caused drastic changes in the evolutionary processes of the peppered moth supporting Darwin’s theory of evolution. Although Darwin had died 14 years before this happened this example was presented in support of his theory.

The assumption made during those times is one that the white-colored moths would sit on top of the tree bark like they do in disguise. But because of the black soot in the atmosphere and the rising industrial pollution the lightish peppered moths became a victim of genetic mutation.

In the later years there was a decrease in the black peppered moths also known as melanic due to the genetic mutation. Again this decrease was not unexpected.

The black peppered moth is very vulnerable to its predators. It does not offer good camouflage and may be easily visible to the birds since it does not resemble any lichen. Hence its breed eventually got eaten up by its predators and there exist very few of them today.

After proving the point of evolution the peppered moth also supports the theory of natural selection. The black types were seen as larger in number in urban areas and cities. Since the tree barks were also affected by the air pollution they also became black offering the perfect disguise for the black peppered moths.

Similarly areas where the industries were not larger in number witnessed a higher rate of the population of the paler peppered moths. This is because the environment in these areas suited the whitish peppered moths more. All in all natural selection worked both ways. Hence proving that nature favored the best competitor respective of the environmental conditions.

Diet: What do Peppered Moths eat?

What does a Peppered Moth Eat?

The Peppered Moths are mainly herbivores. The caterpillars can be seen munching on tree bark and shrubs. In contrast the grown moths can eat fruit pulp leaves flower nectar and sometimes even plant seeds.

What Eats Peppered Moths?

Its predators are mainly flycatchers nuthatches and the European robin. The Peppered Moths protect themselves by hiding in the sunlight and traveling by night. They disguise themselves on the tree bark remaining in one position to avoid their predators.

The American e-commerce giant has reached a “binding commitment” with Malaysian listed developer IOI Properties Group to be one of the key tenants at the Marina Bay office building when it opens in the third quarter of 2023 said David McKellar co-head of office services and occupier at CBRE. The information from McKellar who was not involved in the deal confirms an earlier report in the Business Times.

Amazon has agreed to occupy two 70000 square foot podium levels in IOI Central Boulevard as well as nine office floors in the project’s 16-floor East Tower which average around 25480 square feet each according to the BT account.

“Singapore continues to be a thriving hub for tech and financial services supported by a strong talent pool world class digital infrastructure and a transparent tax regime” said Tricia Song research head for Southeast Asia at CBRE. “The recent tech market volatility may have raised concerns of demand cooling for office space in Singapore but we expect well established and financially-sound tech companies to continue to grow their footprint in Singapore as their long term prospects remain healthy.”

Early Bird Discount

Amazon is estimated to be paying gross effective rents of around S$10 ($7.13) per square foot per month at IOI Central Boulevard according to the BT account which would represent a discount from the developer’s target rates of S$12 to S$14 per square foot.

“Typically a first and early commitment to a new CBD development can attract a 15-30 percent discount in comparison to late stage commitments” McKellar said adding that the lease terms secured by similar sized occupiers over the past decade usually range from 6 to 10 years.

Based on independent calculations the reported rate translates to Jeff Bezos’ firm paying S$3.69 million ($2.63 million) in monthly rent for its new location. The rate also falls at least 13 percent below typical tariffs for grade A properties in Marina Bay where rents averaged S$11.50 to S$13.00 per square foot in the second quarter based on data from CBRE.

Amazon is taking up 29 percent of the 1.26 million square feet of grade A office space under construction in IOI Central Boulevard. In addition to the East Tower the project’s West Tower will reach 48 floors with the seven-level podium incorporating 30000 square feet of space for restaurants and other retail.

Located at the junction of Central Boulevard and Raffles Quay the property has direct underground access to the Downtown MRT station and is within 10 minutes’ walk of Marina Bay Raffles Place and Shenton Way MRT stations.

Amazon and JLL who is said to have brokered the lease declined to comment on the transaction and IOI had not replied to inquiries from Mingtiandi at the time of publication.

Amazon Loves Downtown

Amazon’s new lease is just steps away from a ​​100000 square foot office which it opened in tower one of Asia Square last October giving the tech giant an opportunity to consolidate its team into adjacent buildings.

Aside from the three floors it occupies at Asia Square the company also leases 45000 square feet of space at One George Street another 80000 square feet at Capital Square and some WeWork space at Manulife Tower – all in Raffles Place. The e-commerce player is expected to consolidate some of those team members into its new Marina Bay location.

Malaysia’s IOI is also a fan of the Marina Bay area with two major projects currently in progress in the neighbourhood.

IOI Central Boulevard is scheduled to obtain its temporary occupation permit by the third quarter of next year after the developer won the 1.1 hectare (2.7 acre) site with a S$2.6 billion bid via a public tender in 2016.

The Malaysian builder followed up in September last year by picking up a 0.78 hectare Marina View “white site” five minutes’ walk from IOI Central Boulevard at Shenton Lane and Union Street. IOI’s winning bid of S$1.51 billion bid in a government land sale entitles it to develop up to 1.1 million square feet of floor area primarily for residential and hotel use on that site with a limited portion available for office or retail development.

Marina Bay Vacancy Falls To 3%

CBRE’s McKellar said Marina Bay continues to attract “healthy demand” for office space from the tech sector and multinational asset management firms saying that other transactions are already in the “final stage of negotiations” without disclosing further details.

Amazon is one of a growing set of regional and global tech firms gobbling up office space in Singapore’s downtown core.

ByteDance is expected to move into CapitaLand’s Capital Tower in the Tanjong Pagar area where the parent company of TikTok will take up around 80000 square feet from a seven floor space which was previously occupied by banking giant JP Morgan.

Average office rents in Marina Bay rose by 2.8 percent during the second quarter compared to the preceding three months as “landlords have been emboldened to raise their rental expectations” amid tight vacancy rates said CBRE’s Song.

She added that at 3.1 percent vacancy in Marina Bay remained low compared to the 6.4 percent level across Singapore’s central business district with leasing enquiries potentially on the upswing as the city’s office market benefits from looser travel restrictions.

“While hybrid working could keep the overall office demand footprint below pre-pandemic levels rental growth should continue to remain positive in the short to medium term driven by expansionary demand from technology firms private wealth and asset managers and flexible workspace operators amidst very limited new supply” she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zZWF0dGxlL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9leHBlZGlhLTkwMC1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1jYW1wdXMtaXMtYS1iaWctYmV0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expedia's new $900M campus is a big bet - Puget Sound Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/07/10/expedia-900-million-dollar-campus-is-a-big-bet.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zZWF0dGxlL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9leHBlZGlhLTkwMC1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1jYW1wdXMtaXMtYS1iaWctYmV0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

CROSBY Texas — Thousands of Houston-are CenterPoint Energy customers were without power on Sunday as temperatures hit record levels. At one point more than 30000 customers were powerless.

One local family has a disabled son who has to stay cool in order to survive. Going without power isn't just an inconvenience it's also a serious health issue because David Anzaldua is a quadriplegic.

""It's miserable. It's hot"" David said. ""I was in a car accident ... severed my spinal cord and I don’t feel anything below (there). I don’t regulate my body temperature.""

David and his family live in Crosby and said they’re fed up due to the repeat power outages. The power has cut out during the hottest part of the day on Friday Saturday and Sunday. The family said the outages have been happening weekly.

“Two hours later and it's 90 degrees in the house. It gets hot quick” David said.

The extreme temperatures can cause David serious health problems.

“It causes my blood pressure to sky-rocket ... it’s been up in the 180s. It will go up and go down and brutal to the body” David said.

David's family said it happens way too often. His mother said she had to purchase a generator a few weeks ago to keep her son cool but even with it the house is still too hot.

While a KHOU 11 News crew was at the Anzaldua home on Sunday the family had to move David out because his body temperature was over 99 degrees. It was just too hot for him to handle.

In the end they just want CenterPoint to fix the problem because ultimately David’s life depends on it.

“That is not what you paid for ... hopefully they can find the solution to the problem” David said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjE0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9kaXNwYXRjaC1zZXZlcmFsLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMtcmVwb3J0ZWQtYWNyb3NzLWV2YW5zdmlsbGUv0gFraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuMTRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2Rpc3BhdGNoLXNldmVyYWwtcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlcy1yZXBvcnRlZC1hY3Jvc3MtZXZhbnN2aWxsZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dispatch: Several power outages reported across Evansville,"EVANSVILLE Ind.

However that amount changes depending on which city you live in. You'll need a net worth over $1 million to be considered financially comfortable by your peers in cities with a high cost of living like San Francisco or New York according to financial services company Charles Schwab's annual Modern Wealth Survey.

In San Francisco the threshold for what survey respondents consider financially comfortable is a net worth of $1.7 million. That's the highest total in the survey which examined 12 of the biggest metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Here's a look at what it takes to be seen as financially comfortable by city in 2022 as ranked by net worth thresholds:

San Francisco: $1.7 million New York City: $1.4 million Southern California (includes Los Angeles and San Diego): $1.3 million Seattle: $1.2 million Washington D.C.: $1.1 million Chicago: $956000 Houston: $919000 Boston: $892000 Dallas: $840000 Atlanta: $771000 Phoenix: $747000 Denver: $671000

The online survey was conducted in early February with a sample of 500 to 750 local residents for each metropolitan area between the ages of 21 and 75.

The term ""financially comfortable"" is a subjective term that will mean different things to different people. It could mean having a lot of disposable income or it could mean simply owning a house while having enough money left over each month to save for retirement.

To help put things into perspective the median net worth per household in 2019 was $121700 according to the Federal Reserve's most recent data.

Net worth is a measure of the value of the assets a person or corporation owns minus the liabilities they owe.

But since even the “two moms” claim falls apart it’s worth asking what Moms for Liberty really is.

I pay attention when a new “parents” or “moms” group bursts upon the education/politics scene. I exposed the millions in dark money behind Families for Excellent Schools during a 2016 charter schools ballot question campaign in Massachusetts. New groups like Moms for Liberty are just as transparently Astroturf — a group that claims to be grassroots but is actually artificial turf.

One of the best tools for analyzing phony education groups is a four-part test by Professor Daniel Katz. Let’s see how Moms for Liberty does.

Growth at a pace that only a corporation’s monetary resources could manage. Moms for Liberty incorporated as an Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4) organization a form that lends itself to dark money political shenanigans. It exploded on the scene with its leaders being guests on Fox News and breaking into the Washington Post. It has a well-developed website and extensive social media reach. Moms for Liberty has formed three federal and one state political action committees one of which is a SuperPAC able to accept unlimited donations. Its careers page is seeking state coordinators to work with the chapter chair coordinator and a communications officer. Here’s something I’ve noticed following Moms for Liberty and similar organizations: the “comms moms” — many of these groups’ leaders have backgrounds in marketing and communications. “At the top (Moms for Liberty) … are political strategists risk managers and communications professionals — high-powered women with connections to top state and national Republicans” reports the Florida Phoenix. Moms for Liberty’s press is being handled by Calvary Strategies whose CEO is a former campaign manager and chief of staff to Sen. (then-Gov.) Rick Scott.

Since its inception Moms for Liberty has managed a fund raiser with former Fox News celebrity Megyn Kelly (top ticket $20000) co-hosted The American Dream Conference featuring a keynote from former Trump Cabinet secretary Ben Carson and the upcoming national summit (presenting sponsorships for $50000 are sold out) featuring Gov. Ron DeSantis Carson Sen. Rick Scott and former Trump Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

Who is funding the group and for how much? Moms for Liberty’s leaders claim to get by on T-shirt sales. They’ve barely even heard of the Koch brothers! Yet perhaps they’ve heard of the Council for National Policy. Two of Moms for Liberty’s National Summit sponsors the Leadership Institute and Heritage Foundation are critical members of the Council for National Policy a secretive network of right wing billionaires and Christian fundamentalist leaders that underwrites and coordinates right wing politics.

Who is really running the operation? The two “founders” are former school committee member Tina Descovich a communications and marketing professional and Tiffany Justice also a former school committee member. But there was a third founder Bridget Ziegler. She is still a school committee member and her husband Christian Ziegler is vice chairman of the Florida Republican Party and the owner of a political marketing firm. He boasts that Moms for Liberty will provide crucial ground support for DeSantis’ re-election.

Then there’s the odd coincidence of so many grassroots parents organizations arising at the same time with similar missions. Parents Defending Education is Koch-connected. The Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council claims credit for the havoc wreaked by anti-Critical Race Theory legislation. The Council for National Policy’s Leadership Institute commenced its own program to take over school boards. The Council for National Policy-connected Turning Point USA initiated a School Board Watch List for reporting “woke” school boards.

Do its supposed grassroots members have even a clue what the organization is about? Upstart operations like Moms for Liberty according to a column in Forbes “are operated by professional communications folks and seasoned political operatives but that doesn’t mean they haven’t activated and harnessed actual anger and upset among people on the ground.” It also doesn’t mean those people understand that what they think is grassroots is actually manipulation from secretive puppeteers above.

Moms for Liberty could put such questions to rest by revealing its true financiers. But that would lead to a lot of uncomfortable inquiries questions perhaps even the comms moms can’t handle.

After the Hawaii U.S. District Court ruled against Shell Oil Company Chevron Corporation and other fossil fuel company defendants in Feb. 2021 the companies appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court to move the county’s case to from state court to federal court anticipating a “friendlier forum.” The 9th Circuit Court denied the appeal and the case will be heard in state court.

“Keeping this case in our state court is important because it means we will have our claims heard here in Hawaii where the damage is occurring” said County Corporation Counsel Moana Lutey. “We are looking forward to trying this case laying out the significant evidence that we have of the damage these companies knowingly created.”

Mayor Michael Victorino added “The constant reminders of climate change are all around us. We’re coping with another severe drought season creating ideal conditions for wildfires. Our rainy seasons have brought intense flooding. These changes came from using their products while they withheld information on the environmental damage they cause. We are grateful for this victory and Maui County will continue to pursue justice regardless of how long it takes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzFjZmQ2MzlkLWU1ZDktNDBmYy1iNTQ4LTYzNTczYjg5OGQ5ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shell takes to TikTok as oil groups try to boost credentials during energy crisis,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

This certainly seems to be the case for Watford with a host of eateries bars and entertainment venues opening particularly within the atria Watford shopping centre extension.

We know there's plenty more to come both in the town centre and a little further afield.

But while we wait in expectation for those venues to open here are some already trading for you to try out.

Chipotle

Arguably the biggest recent addition to Watford town centre is this Mexican fast food restaurant.

This is Chipotle's first branch in the UK outside of London.

It officially opened on June 30 and serves a range of Mexican Grill items including burritos tacos bowls and salads which are made to order in front of the customer.

Find Chipotle in the High Street next door to Barclays.

Honest Burgers

Another relatively new arrival for Watford is this burger restauarnt which opened in Market Street earlier this year.

Customers at Honest Burgers can expect a menu of signature burgers including the Tribute and the Honest along with a monthly-changing burger special.

Vegan and vegetarian diners are also catered for.

Jamaica Blue

One for coffee-lovers to try out is this cafe that has just opened inside atria Watford.

Jamaica Blue prides itself on serving its hot drinks using coffee beans from one of the ""best producing regions in the world"" - the Blue Mountains in Jamaica.

Find Jamaica Blue coffee shop and cafe inside the former Disney store at the shopping centre.

BloomsYard

Perhaps this is one for the commuters rather than town centre shoppers.

BloomsYard opened earlier this year at Watford Met Station in Cassiobury Park Avenue.

The first BloomsYard was founded at Atria Watford in 2020 and the owner has been looking to establish the business at more sites since.

The cafe serves coffee tea pastries cookies bread and more.

Moon Under Water

So this popular Wetherspoons pub is definitely not new to Watford - it has been a favourite for so many years.

But it's extended and revamped beer garden which opened last month is brand new and arrived just in time for the summer.

The area is now big enough to seat 150 people and will no doubt draw in many punters.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

Of course you do. Opened with that simple six-word question stories from John Thomas Brice always garnered an audience willing or otherwise and the story of John Thomas Brice is one to remember. Details make every story and details embody his life story. John Thomas Brice was born May 17 1951 at tiny stone-faced Lyons Hospital in Rogersville Tennessee and passed away at his home in Surgoinsville's Carters Valley July 8 2022 at precisely 1:38 p.m. He was surrounded by his best friend and wife of nearly 51 years Frances and the youngest of their four children Katie (Brice) Morris following his nearly year-long battle with inoperable pancreatic cancer. Born in rural East Tennessee before spending most of his formative years growing up in the Cincinnati Ohio suburb of Hamilton and then returning to East Tennessee with his parents the late Charmaine and Chalmer Brice as well as his only sibling his sister Judy R. Brice John T. Brice met his eventual bride Frances as she was neighbor to his grandmother Constance ""Connie"" Brice of Surgoinsville. Asked recently to retell that story he said simply ""Well it's a pretty easy one to tell as you probably know. She lived beside my grandmother and after a couple of days I said 'I've got to figure out a way to meet her.'"" The rest of course is history. Their inseparable history from their 1971 marriage in Kingsport Tennessee to their relocation to Morristown Tennessee where his career in the banking and finance industries that spanned parts of six decades would primarily unfold. From Hamilton Bank to Jefferson Federal to SunTrust Bank and for the final decade when retirement was an option but he wanted to continue to serve a fiercely loyal and dedicated client base as well as help provide for his family long after his time on Earth with his own franchise of Southern Heritage Financial Group. Morristown is of course where they would join Centenary United Methodist Church buy their first home together in 1982 and raise their four children from oldest daughter Kristi Melissa (Brice) Lovin to first son John David Brice to youngest son Thomas Clifton Brice and youngest daughter the most selfless caregiver of the quartet Katie Elizabeth (Brice) Morris. Upon his graduation from the University of Tennessee in the mid-1970s John T. continued his budding and passionate fandom of the Tennessee Vols holding football season tickets inside Neyland Stadium - south upper deck section JJ row 6 for so many years; finally treating his wife and himself to better tickets in section r on the lower west side a couple decades ago - from 1976 through 2021. Given his penchant for details he has the detailed ticket stub collection from this fandom - replete with rulered margins and where necessary hand-cut crisped ticket edges. Still for all those football streaks - and his last in-person Vols football game was last fall at Kentucky extending a consecutive games streak of some 50 years; his final in-person live sporting event an Atlanta Braves-Chicago Cubs game April 28 2022 in Atlanta to celebrate Frances' birthday - he took far more pride in the streaks of dedicated membership and service at Centenary; of being a worship leader with some of the worst ""Dad"" jokes of all-time - especially if he could link together a congregant's birthday with an area speed limit; and his steadfast devotion to the church to God the Bible and his family. See those are the details that matter the most about the life of John Thomas Brice. He is preceded in death by his parents Charmaine and Chalmer Brice; his mother-and-father-in-laws Ellen ""Susie"" and Ralph ""Rowdy"" Bennett; an infant brother William David; his brother-in-law Raymond Bennett. He is survived by his wife Frances; his brother-in-law Roger ""Butch"" Bennett; his and Frances' four children and their families: Kristi and Chris Lovin as well as oldest grandson and 2022 class valedictorian who scored a perfect 36 on his ACT Parker Brice Lovin; John David and Jessica (Jackman) Brice to whom his final words when told she was in the room to visit him in his final days were ""Can't beat that"" along with a wink; Thomas Clifton and wife Ashley as well as children: Hunter James (13) Savannah Grace (8) Sadie Elizabeth (7); Katie Elizabeth (Brice) Morris and husband Brent as well as youngest grandson John Bennett Morris who also was a fixture at his grandfather's side in his final months weeks and days as well as John Bennett's upcoming sibling a young boy due in January. He also is survived by his loving sister Judy R. Brice a retired elementary school teacher who shared a special bond with her brother and their partnership in the family's farming operations. Mayes Mortuary will be handling all arrangements with Minister Vivian Reed presiding. Services will be held at Centenary United Methodist Church in Morristown on Monday July 11th with visitation from 4:00 - 7:00pm and the funeral to begin at 7:00pm. Burial will be Tuesday morning at 11:00am on the Brice Family Farm.

According to the DOJ statement between 2014 and 2022 Customs and Border Protection seized 180 shipments of counterfeit Cisco devices being shipped to Pro Network. Under the alias of ""Dave Durden"" Aksoy falsely submitted paperwork to CBP to avoid investigation. In July 2021 federal agents obtained a warrant to search Aksoy's warehouse where they seized 1156 counterfeit Cisco hardware valued at over 7 million dollars.

ST. LOUIS — If the Phillies are able to finally make the playoffs they would pose a credible threat in a short series because of the two dominant pitchers atop their starting rotation.

Yet somehow neither Zack Wheeler nor Aaron Nola was named a National League All-Star.

There’s still time for either pitcher to be added as a replacement. But when the rosters were announced Sunday Kyle Schwarber was the lone Phillies player chosen to join Bryce Harper who was voted in by the fans as the NL’s designated hitter but won’t play in or travel to the July 19 All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium because of a fractured left thumb.

“It would’ve been a privilege but it is what it is” said Wheeler whose body language indicated disappointment as he walked out of the clubhouse at Busch Stadium after a 4-3 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. “I don’t care. I’ll spend time with my family.”

Asked if he would accept a fill-in spot for a pitcher who is injured or unable to pitch after starting Sunday Wheeler said “I wasn’t chosen. It is what it is.”

Schwarber an All-Star for the second year in a row has powered the Phillies back into playoff contention over the last six weeks. Including his solo home run in the fifth inning Sunday he leads the NL with 28 dingers 18 of which have come since Memorial Day.

The popular slugger was selected by his peers in player balloting finishing fourth among all reserves.

“It’s definitely an honor to be there and represent the Phillies” Schwarber said. “It [stinks] that Harp won’t be able to play. Hopefully I can represent the Phillies very well.”

Schwarber said he’s “up in the air” about whether he will compete in the Home Run Derby. He finished as the runner-up to Harper in the 2018 derby an experience that he has called “a bucket list thing.”

Major League Baseball almost certainly will ask Schwarber to compete again. New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso also named as an All-Star reserve has won the last two derbies. Schwarber said he expects to make a decision within the next few days.

“I’d probably say 50-50 right now” Schwarber said. “It’s more seeing how my body is right now. It’s definitely something that you want to attend. I’ve done it once. It’s fun but it’s also taxing. You weigh out the pros and cons.”

Schwarber attended last year’s All-Star Game despite being injured and unable to play. Harper said Friday that he won’t go to Dodger Stadium because he doesn’t want to disrupt his recovery after July 6 thumb surgery.

Six weeks ago Schwarber would have been a long shot for All-Star consideration. Through the end of May he was batting .185 with 11 homers and a .721 on-base plus slugging. Since then he’s batting .270 with 17 homers and a 1.037 OPS.

“I think it could’ve been better for myself” Schwarber said of his first half. “I wish I didn’t get off to that slow start. But I look at my coaching staff with [hitting coach Kevin Long and Jason Camilli) you look at [interim manager Rob Thomson] I wouldn’t be here without dudes around me. They’re pushing to get the best out of me.”

The omissions of Wheeler and Nola at least for now were glaring even in a deep field of NL starting pitchers.

Sandy Alcantara (Marlins) Max Fried (Braves) Corbin Burnes (Brewers) Tony Gonsolin (Dodgers) and Joe Musgrove (Padres) were selected in player balloting. Relief pitchers Josh Hader (Brewers) Edwin Díaz (Mets) and Ryan Helsley (Cardinals) were also chosen by the players.

With every team needing to be represented MLB filled the final six spots on the NL roster with Reds starter Luis Castillo Pirates closer David Bednar and Diamondbacks lefty reliever Joe Mantiply. Longtime Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw was also named to the team despite making only 11 starts five fewer than Wheeler.

Wheeler struggled in his first three starts after not facing major league hitters in spring training. But he has a 1.53 ERA since April 24 the lowest mark among 140 pitchers who have thrown at least 40 innings in that span. His last two starts — back-to-back seven scoreless innings against the Cardinals — should have clinched his spot and likely would have if St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol was filling out the roster.

But Wheeler also probably shouldn’t book vacation plans yet. Last year four pitchers on the initial All-Star roster wound up being replaced either because they were injured or they started the final game before the All-Star break.

Nola is lined up to do that for the Phillies next Sunday in Miami. His All-Star case wasn’t as airtight as Wheeler’s either. But Nola has a 3.15 ERA in 17 starts and ranked third in the league entering Sunday with 120 strikeouts.

“I think that there’s a lot more All-Stars in this room that are very deserving of it” Schwarber said citing Wheeler Nola reliever Seranthony Domínguez and first baseman Rhys Hoskins. “It’s kind of a shame. Hopefully these guys can get in some way.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTAvd2hhdC1vbGRlci13b3JrZXJzLXNob3VsZC1rbm93LWFib3V0LWZpbmRpbmctam9icy13aXRoLXRvcC1lbXBsb3llcnMuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA3LzEwL3doYXQtb2xkZXItd29ya2Vycy1zaG91bGQta25vdy1hYm91dC1maW5kaW5nLWpvYnMtd2l0aC10b3AtZW1wbG95ZXJzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over 50 and looking for a job? Here's what you need to know about age and work,"With the bear market hitting retirement portfolios hard bonds performing as poorly as stocks and inflation raging what seemed like a sure retirement income may be more of a pipe dream for many older Americans who had left the workforce or planned to soon retire. The economic situation is sending more retirement-age workers back into the labor force. A recent CNBC survey found a majority of retirees would consider returning to work. But finding the right job isn't always easy.

Many companies don't offer the flexibility that many older workers want later in life. Age discrimination is another factor with 78% of older workers claiming to have seen or experienced workplace age discrimination according to 2021 data from AARP. That's the highest level since 2003 when AARP began tracking the data.

Yet many companies are increasingly looking to attract mature workers and with good reason. For one the labor market is as tight as it's been in decades and there are now two open jobs for every worker in the nation and firms are struggling to recruit and retain talent. Research from employee scheduling company Homebase suggests that seniors are more engaged; more likely to look forward to work; more connected to their companies; and less likely to consider quitting. This makes older workers especially attractive in the currently tight labor market said Jason Greenberg head economist at Homebase.

Here are four tips to help older workers find an age-friendly employer.

1. Identify companies committed to hiring older workers

Start with those that have publicly pledged to level the playing field for older workers. More than 1000 companies including Humana Microsoft Marriott International and McDonald's have signed on to the AARP Employer Pledge program. Eligible companies can't have had discrimination lawsuits within the past five years. They must also agree to recruit across diverse age groups and consider all applications equally regardless of age. AARP also offers a jobs board to help match experienced candidates with companies who have committed to having an age-diverse employee base.

The Age-Friendly Institute also certifies companies that are considered best-in-class for workers aged 50 and above. Applicants go through an extensive review and certification process which includes committing to ""meaningful employment development opportunities and competitive pay and benefits for employees 50+."" The list last updated in April includes Aetna Home Depot Macy's Starbucks and Wells Fargo.

Just be aware that these lists can change and don't give you the whole picture so be sure to do your due diligence on any company you are considering said Lance Robertson a former U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Assistant Secretary for Aging who is now a director at Guidehouse a global consulting and IT services provider.

2. Looks for clues in job postings

Older job candidates should look at a company's job ads which can offer insights into the company's culture and if it's really age inclusive said Paul Lewis chief customer officer at Adzuna an online job search engine. Older job seekers should look for language that specifically states the company doesn't discriminate based on age he said.

Conversely seniors should be wary of companies that use the term ""digital native"" in a job description or set a cap on the number of years of experience as a job requirement said Karina Hertz strategic communications director of AARP.

Additionally websites like LinkedIn Facebook and Glassdoor can be helpful in finding resources and information about a company's employment practices including its commitment to older workers. And talking to current and former employees is also a good opportunity to gather information Robertson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3RiYXNlYmFsbC5jb20vbWxiL3VubGlrZWx5LWFsbC1zdGFyLWpvc2gtYmVsbC1lbmpveWluZy1jYXJlZXIteWVhci1pbi13YXNoaW5ndG9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Josh Bell Enjoying Best Season of His Career in Washington,"Since winning the World Series in 2019 the Washington Nationals have been one of the worst teams in all of MLB.

What is Phishing?

Phishing is a technique cyber criminals use to try and steal your personal information. They do it by sending you fake emails that look like they are from a legitimate company like your workplace bank or credit card provider. For example they may send you an email that looks like it’s from your bank asking you to click on a link or provide personal information.

How does Phishing work?

The goal of phishing is to trick you into providing your personal information such as your account password Social Security number or credit card details. They use fake emails or websites are used to lure people into revealing sensitive information. They also do phone phishing by calling from random numbers and trying to collect information during the conversation. While there are many types of phishing scams they all share one common goal – to steal your identity or money. If you’re not careful enough you can easily become a victim of Phishing.

Some Common Examples of Phishing

The most common types of Phishing are explained below:

Deceptive Phishing

Deceptive Phishing has been the most common phishing scam since the 1990s. It is an email scam where attackers try to steal victims’ confidential personal information or login details. They do it by impersonating an organization or person and sending emails with deceptive links. For example a fake email from your bank asks you to click on a link and verify your account details.

Spear Phishing

In spear phishing scammers target specific individuals instead of targeting a group of people. As a result these attacks are more customized and harder to trace. Attackers do thorough research on the victim’s social media workplace and other personal activities then use those against them to appear more authentic then trick victims into providing personal data.

According to SANS Institute 95% of the attacks on corporate networks are the result of successful spear phishing. Example: Someone asking you to fill out ”a new employee handbook”.

Whaling

Whaling is the method of going after CEOs or executives of an organization. Scammers steal their login credentials and access sensitive company information. Your reporting officer or a senior executive asking you to make a payment or pass some confidential data urgently can be an example of whaling.

Pharming

In Pharming attackers manipulate a website’s traffic or infect its DNS server to redirect users toward a fraudulent site. For example you are trying to do an online banking transaction but when you open the bank’s original website it directs you to a different domain.

What Is Vishing?

As mentioned earlier vishing attacks are a type of phishing scam where scammers make shady phone calls or leave voice messages to steal financial or personal information from people. It is also referred to as voice phishing. In vishing attackers often call impersonate a bank employee policeman or government officials. They use persuasive language and tone to lure victims into sharing sensitive information.

Phishing vs. Vishing vs. Smishing: What’s the Difference?

Though vishing and smishing fall under the umbrella of Phishing they share some subtle differences. Phishing vishing and smishing attacks have the same motto of stealing financial or personal information but the communication medium is different in each. Phishing scams are primarily email attacks while in vishing attackers use phone calls or voice messages to steal information and smishing is scamming through text messages.

Why are Seniors more Susceptible to phishing scams?

It is sad but true that older adults are one of the main victim groups of phishing scams. Though they might not outnumber the younger victims the losses are way higher for seniors. The most vulnerable groups are people in their 80s. They can incur individual losses up to $1700 on average which is four times higher than victims within the age range of 20-30.

Now let’s have a look at the reasons behind these phishing scams against elderly citizens:

Older people are perceived to be wealthier than younger ones.

Reports suggest seniors are less likely to report phishing scams.

Senior citizens may lack knowledge of digital security or different technologies.

They come from a more trustworthy and polite generation.

Seniors suffer from various health issues like Alzheimer’s or disabilities making them more vulnerable to phishing scams.

Many older adults lose their independence and rely on others to perform daily tasks. Unfortunately scammers take advantage of their vulnerability.

Very often seniors are left alone at home or senior care facilities leading to social isolation. So they might remain unaware of such crimes.

Why do fraudsters often target the elderly?

Older people are often deemed as a vulnerable group due to their physical and mental shortcomings due to age or related factors. That is one reason why fraudsters make them their target. Besides senior citizens are less likely to report Phishing or any form of scams. That also encourages attackers to exploit them.

What to do if a senior is being scammed?

If a senior is being scammed report to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Adult Protective Services (APS) to inform them about the fraud. They will investigate the matter and provide instructions you may need to follow.

Is scamming the elderly illegal?

Scamming the elderly is illegal and a punishable offense. Fraudsters can face fines or jail time depending on the nature of the scam.

Which act is considered financial abuse of an elder?

Acts that are considered financial abuse of an elder under the Federal Elder Justice Act 2010:

Illegal or improper use of money or property of an elderly or a person with a disability.

Theft misappropriation concealment misuse or fraudulent deprivation of finances or properties belonging to an older adult or disabled individual.

How to stop phishing emails?

To stop phishing emails install security software and an anti-virus system on your devices. Protect your social media information and keep the privacy to ‘only me’ for email addresses or phone numbers. Also add extensions on your browser to block unnecessary pop-ups.

What is vishing in cyber security?

Vishing is also referred to as voice fraud in cyber security where scammers use voice calls or phone calls to persuade people to share sensitive information.

What is the difference between vishing and smishing?

The main difference between these two types of Phishing is that in smishing victims receive fraudulent text messages while in vishing they get fraudulent phone calls. Example: can’t talk text me a scam or getting a call saying you have won a prize and need to share your account details to avail the money.

This has pushed up not just the electricity bill but the carbon footprints too. Amid concerns over the environment and outages due to inadequate coal stocks at thermal power plants  there have been questions on whether solar panels can be a suitable alternative for generating electricity.“Solar panels or photovoltaics (PV) capture the sun’s energy using photovoltaic cells and convert it into electricity. Fortunately for those of us living in Delhi-NCR the cells do not require direct sunlight all the time. It can still work on a cloudy morning although less electricity will be generated in that case” says Aviruch Bhatia an expert on energy efficiency and renewables at TERI . Solar PV cells are nestled between layers of semi-conducting material usually silicon. When light shines on them electrons collide and this creates a flow of electricity. “The panels should be exposed to as much light as possible. You should also ensure there is no shade from buildings or trees” he says.“The solar PV produces DC power which can be converted into AC through an inverter. We can also store power using batteries.” The electricity that we usually get is 60% coal and fossil fuel and 40% renewable energy. One unit of electricity – one kilowatt hour -- from the grid can emit 800 grams of CO2 into the atmosphere. “For instance if we use an AC of 1500 watts for 10 hours. 15000 KWH of electricity (multiplied by 10) will be consumed in a day. It will also emit 120kg of CO2 in the air. Here if we talk about solar PV it is a no carbon emission mode. It’s clean energy. But some emission will be there while extracting silicon and processing the material. This is 25gm per 1 KWH. This is 30 times less electricity than we normally consume” he adds.But how much space is required to set up a solar system? “We have a solar constant which is 1360 watt/square metre. This is the energy from the sun that will fall on 1sqm of area in the atmosphere. But on earth we have different altitudes and surfaces which affects radiation. Then we cannot generate everything into electricity. In DelhiNCR about 500 Watt/sqm fall daily on a roof on an average. So six hours of sunlight can generate about 3KWH/sqm of solar energy on the surface. Moreover the solar PV panels can convert around 15% of the solar energy” explains Bhatia. The biggest benefit of solar panels is lower electricity costs though installation costs are still on the higher side.People storing electricity in batteries can however sell the power to the discom. “It’s important to ensure the solar panel’s size is big enough to cover the house’s energy needs. You may also install a solar battery or an energy storage system that will store the electricity the panels generate. This will allow you to store electricity generated during the day for use at night.People can become more self-sufficient and reduce the amount of electricity” says Koshy Cherail programme director (renewable energy) at the Centre for Science and Environment. To save on electricity people should run washing machines and dishwashers during the day when the panels are most effective. The panels should also be cleaned regularly. “Its maintenance is easy compared to other renewable energy modes” says Cherail.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvdGVsZWNvbS9uZXdzL2FmdGVyLWVuZXJneS1tZWRpYS1hbmQtY29uc3VtZXItZ29vZHMtaXRzLWFkYW5pLXZzLWFtYmFuaS1pbi10ZWxlY29tL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyNzcyNDAzLmNtc9IBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vYnVzaW5lc3MvdGVsZWNvbS9uZXdzL2FmdGVyLWVuZXJneS1tZWRpYS1hbmQtY29uc3VtZXItZ29vZHMtaXRzLWFkYW5pLXZzLWFtYmFuaS1pbi10ZWxlY29tL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85Mjc3MjQwMy5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After energy media and consumer goods it's Adani vs Ambani in telecom,"Gautam Adani has thrown his hat in the 5G race taking on Mukesh Ambani  Sunil Mittal and Kumar Mangalam Birla .

Adani wants to use this towards his ₹60000 charity pledge

The competition between Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani could soon enter yet another space – telecom after India’s second richest person confirmed his participation in 5G spectrum auctions.The race for the crown of India’s richest person has been neck-to-neck this year with Gautam Adani blazing past Mukesh Ambani after an unprecedented surge in his wealth in the last one year . The two have regularly one-upped each other and now Gautam Adani could be pulling out another rabbit from his hat with his bid for 5G spectrum.Rumors have been flying thick and fast about the Adani group entering the 5G race and now the Gautam Adani-led giant has confirmed it. The Adani group is the fourth company besides the telco trio of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to have submitted its bid for 5G spectrum.“As India prepares to roll out next generation 5G services through this auction we are one of the many applicants participating in the open bidding process” the company said in a statement.However there is a twist in the tale before you get excited or annoyed at the prospect of– the company said in its statement that it is not interested in the consumer mobility space. And given the sort of competition already in this space thanks to Airtel and Vodafone Idea – and the deep pockets of Jio the Adani group probably does not find it lucrative enough.It sort of makes sense too given that experts think most of the money to be made in the 5G space will be in the enterprise segment not consumer.“India is a price sensitive market so the revenue which is going to come to anybody who provides 5G is from new segments opening up and those are machine to machine communications those are enterprise communications” COAI director general Dr SP Kochhar said in an exclusive interaction with Business Insider India He added that enterprise services will likely contribute to 70% of 5G revenues which will then be combined with the 30-40% revenue from consumer services to provide 5G services to consumers at almost the same rates as 5G.In what seems like a slightly weird definition of charity the statement by the Adani group says that if it wins 5G spectrum it will count towards the Adani Foundation’s ₹60000 crore pledge towards charity – this includes education healthcare and rural development in rural areas.However here’s what the statement also says: “We are participating in the 5G spectrum auction to provide private network solutions along with enhanced cyber security in the airport ports & logistics power generation transmission distribution and various manufacturing operations.”Essentially this covers the Adani group’s diversified business empire spread across all those industries.However it is not clear how the Adani group suggests this would also count towards its ₹60000 crore charity pledge – unless the group is counting a portion of its 5G spectrum spends being used for CSR activities as well. Even then it’s a very twisted logic at work here.Regardless it will be interesting to see how the Adani group’s 5G bid shapes up the telecom industry which has voiced its opposition to private 5G networks already.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3NtZS1zZWN0b3IvaXJlZGEtY29tbWl0dGVkLXRvLWluY3JlYXNpbmctcGFydGljaXBhdGlvbi1vZi1tc21lcy1pbi1yZS1ieS1vZmZlcmluZy1tb3JlLWxvYW5zL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyNzYxNzQxLmNtc9IBnwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3NtZS1zZWN0b3IvaXJlZGEtY29tbWl0dGVkLXRvLWluY3JlYXNpbmctcGFydGljaXBhdGlvbi1vZi1tc21lcy1pbi1yZS1ieS1vZmZlcmluZy1tb3JlLWxvYW5zL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85Mjc2MTc0MS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IREDA to increase MSME participation in renewable energy by offering more loans,NEW DELHI: The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) on Friday said it is committed to increasing participation of MSMEs in the green energy sector by offering more loans its Chairman and Managing Director Pradip Kumar Das said. He was speaking at the MSME Banking Conclave 2022.Addressing the conclave organised by MSME Business Forum India Minister of State for Finance Bhagwat Karad lauded the efforts of the IREDA for the overall development of the renewable energy sector.Das said while MSMEs only represent 1.86 per cent of the company's total loan assets of Rs 33884 crore (as of May 2022) the IREDA is attempting to address the issues of MSMEs in order to increase their participation in the renewable energy (RE) sector.He emphasised that the target of 500 GW of RE capacity by 2030 cannot be achieved without the considerable participation of MSMEs and therefore their efforts will be a crucial driver of Aatmnirbhar Bharat.He further said he is quite confident that India will easily achieve the target of 50 per cent share of energy from non-fossil fuels and also the 500 GW RE capacity before the deadline of 2030 set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.A major barrier for MSME entrepreneurs is the inability to get loans with reasonable interest rates but the IREDA has significantly improved the ease of doing business in terms of faceless loan sanctions and disbursements reduction in loan sanction documentation and disbursement cycle and increased geographical footprint in the country added Das.He also highlighted that despite the second and third waves of the pandemic the IREDA reported all-time high annual profit after tax of Rs 634 crore and profit before tax of Rs 834 crore in 2021-22 registering a massive growth of 82.88 per cent and 46.41 per cent respectively over 2020-21.He said the company is committed to addressing the adverse effects of climate change and reducing pollution levels through financing support for RE projects.,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green Hydrogen: What is green hydrogen why Reliance and Adani Group are investing in it and other queri,"How much is the demand for green hydrogen in India ?



To produce ammonia and methanol for industrial purposes including refineries and fertilisers more than 6 million tonnes of hydrogen is used by India every year. It is assumed that India's demand for hydrogen will increase five-fold and consumption of hydrogen is expected to surge by 28 million tonnes by 2050.





How can Indian industries adopt green hydrogen?



According to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) it costs $5-$6 in production of per kg of green hydrogen. This gets expensive for the industries like steel and fertilizers to adopt this source of clean energy. So at least $2 per kg might help these industries to come forth but reducing the cost is unlikely till India increases its electrolysers manufacturing.





What is the government's policy on green hydrogen?



The government launched the National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHEM) in 2021-22. This year the Ministry of Power notified Green Hydrogen Policy (GHP) and welcomed industry leaders. The policy will help meet the target of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030.





What is green hydrogen used for?



It is mainly used in the chemical industry for manufacturing of ammonia and fertilisers. It is also widely used in the petrochemical industry for the production of petroleum products.





What are the risks associated with green hydrogen?



Risks are associated with electrolysers which are used to produce green hydrogen. Other exposures like fracture of pressurised pipes or compartments freezing water in the stack and breakages in membranes.





What is the future of green hydrogen fuel?



Green hydrogen has the capability to help store intermittent renewable energy works for maritime shipping and aviation as a 'zero-emissions' fuel and it can be used in high-heat industrial procedures.





How is green hydrogen made?



Green hydrogen is hydrogen that is produced by splitting water by electrolysis. This process produces only hydrogen and oxygen. While we can use the green hydrogen and vent the oxygen to the atmosphere without any negative impact. To achieve electrolysis the electricity is required.





Who is the largest producer of green hydrogen?



China is the top country that consumes and produces hydrogen more than anyone else its current annual usage is over 24 million tonnes.



Looking at the extreme potential of green hydrogen there has been a sudden frenzy over hydrogen in recent times. Green hydrogen is considered as one of the best and cleaner alternative fuel options.Hydrogen that is produced using renewable energy through electrolysis is known as Green Hydrogen. In this process hydrogen is separated from oxygen in the water through an electric current.Renewable sources such as solar or wind are used in the requirement for electricity for electrolysis. Therefore no greenhouse gasses are emitted in this method of hydrogen production.At present less than 1 percent of hydrogen generated is green hydrogen. As per the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) hydrogen will make up 12 percent of the energy mix by the year 2050. It was further suggested that around 66 percent of this hydrogen used should come from water not natural gas.The Adani Group recently made an announcement that it has partnered with France's TotalEnergies to create a green hydrogen ecosystem. On the other side Reliance Industries will also invest Rs 75000 crore over the next three years to set up a new clean-energy business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kbC1nb29kcy9zdnMvbWV0YWxzLW1pbmluZy9ubWRjLWtlZW4tdG8taW52ZXN0LWluLWdyZWVuLWVuZXJneS1jYXBhY2l0aWVzLXNheXMtY21kLXN1bWl0LWRlYi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85Mjc4MDk2MC5jbXPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2luZGwtZ29vZHMvc3ZzL21ldGFscy1taW5pbmcvbm1kYy1rZWVuLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1ncmVlbi1lbmVyZ3ktY2FwYWNpdGllcy1zYXlzLWNtZC1zdW1pdC1kZWIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyNzgwOTYwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NMDC keen to invest in green energy capacities says CMD Sumit Deb,"

Mill Spring NC – July 9 2022 – Sharn Wordley (NZL) and Valentine Car floated to the win in Tryon Stadium claiming the $139000 Coca-Cola® Grand Prix CSI 3* win in a time of 31.42 seconds. Jacqueline Ruyle (USA) and her own San Chano 2011 Oldenburg gelding (Sandro Boy x Chacco-Blue) cleared the jump-off course in 32.14 to take the reserve ribbon while Luiz Francisco de Azevedo (BRA) and Nashville the 2011 Oldenburg gelding (Sandro Boy x Chacco-Blue) rounded out the podium in a time of 32.57 seconds.

Thirty entries filtered through the first-round course design set by Alan Wade (IRL) with eleven pairs qualifying for the jump off. Wordley and the 2009 Warmblood gelding (Son of Juan Car x Galiani CH) topped the class in style even with the partnership being fairly new. “He won the qualifier as well; he’s a fairly new horse for me. I got him in the winter from Fernando Cardenas who bred the horse. I just got him at the beginning of the year and I just got to know him now where I feel like we have a partnership.”

Wordley was extremely complimentary of Wade’s tough course “All of Wade’s courses are tough. I thought he did a very good job for the field; it wasn’t too big but it was technical so you got 11 clears. So I thought it was a good number and it was a fast jump off. I thought it was a great course he nailed it again!”

For his jump-off strategy Wordley said his goal was to simply go fast. “I saw Luiz go and he was quick; he did all the numbers I was going to do. So I had to at least go as fast as him. So I did the same numbers as him but my horse is just a bit of a faster mover. That was about all I could do; there was maybe one less to the last but I didn’t want to risk it.”

Jane Waddle was awarded the Equestrian Services International Groom’s Award for her care and dedication to Valentine Car alongside Emma Brunnell Brittni Raflowitz and Anders DeShields.

“It’s great to be here in Tryon as always” Wordley concluded “I jumped here at the very first show they ever did and I’ll be back again in two weeks time.”

SODA-SeCRET All the clues the Kardashian-Jenner family is secretly teaming up with MAJOR brand in multi-million dollar deal

FANS are thirsty for the truth after noticing several major moments of the Kardashian-Jenner lives have all seemingly taken place with or near a particular product placement.

Now followers of the reality show family are convinced there is a secret deal in place to plug the product pointing out clues scattered throughout the stars' TV shows and social media accounts.

Eagle-eye viewers kept noticing the same product strategically placed in and around the celebrity family members: Coca-Cola soda.

In various episodes of The Kardashians the sisters can be seen ordering and drinking Coke products.

Earlier this week Kylie took pictures and videos of all of the ingredients she used to make Travis a sandwich.

Her stories started out with the ingredients laid out on the counter with the caption ""bae I want a sandwich.""

In a later story the 24-year-old showcased her sandwich with a Coke and said ""This is so beautiful.""

The reality TV star then filmed herself eating as Travis and her daughter Stormi played in the background.

In June Kim flaunted her curvy figure in a nude outfit during a SKIMS photoshoot for her new sheer collection.

The only bit of color belonged to the can of Diet Coke she held in her hand - label facing out of course.

In the shots the SKIMS founder walked around on set with her toned abs and hourglass figure on full display.

She donned her company's newly dropped jelly sheer scoop bralette shoulder sleeves and footed leggings to give a complete visual of the shapewear.

Kim paired the look with nude sunglasses and her long blonde hair flowing down.

The beauty mogul kept a can of cola in hand including one moment when her glam squad was seen putting the finishing touches on her look.

The soda signage has secretly made its way into the background of several milestone moments.

When Kim and Pete Davidson were caught canoodling in a corner booth a can of Diet Coke was there.

Kourtney and Travis Barker made out in front of a Coca-Cola vending machine before the Grammys earlier this year.

And when Kim took a solo trip to Miami a few weeks ago she posed holding what looked to be a mini bottle of Diet Coke.

Fans online were curious what the deal was with the unannounced deal.

""There is no f**king way they put that into their bodies but yes def have a brand deal"" one follower posted on TikTok.

Another added: ""They are smart and know their value. They don't mention a brand name like that without them paying them.""

A third bluntly stated: ""Just them saying the name is an ad in itself.""

While a fourth connected the dots to another Kardashian conspiracy theory: ""There’s no way that was an accident. Same with all of Khloe’s food in the pantry photo that woman isn’t eating Progreso and Kraft.""

PASS THE BUCK

But the Kardashian's aren't the only celebs to feel things go better with Coca-Cola

Artists like Taylor Swift also have endorsement deals with the bubbly beverage - worth a reported $26 million.

And just this month former party animal Kate Moss lined up a job pushing Coke.

The supermodel 48 canned by fashion brands in 2005 after appearing to snort cocaine will now be a creative director for Diet Coke.

Kate has been brought in to add her “unique aesthetic and style” to its Love What You Love campaign.

The brand is celebrating its 40th anniversary.

She said: “The campaign connected with me instantly as I am a firm believer that with confidence and passion you can achieve your wildest dreams.

“I am thrilled to join the Diet Coke family – I love the past collaborations they’ve done with such incredible names in fashion.”

In this context trusting associations between the brand and the star play an important role - if Cristiano Ronaldo (or Azamat Musagaliyev) recommends this product then there is a chance that they will not be deceived.

For stars participation in advertising is an occasion to remind themselves once again in the information field and another way to earn money.

Coca-Cola and Pepsi

The rivalry for the attention of the audience of giants such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the media industry has been going on for decades.

Cola is one of the first global companies that thought of using Hollywood celebrities in advertising their drink. The company invited Marilyn Monroe Hugh Laurie (“House M.D.”) Aishwarya Rai Jared Leto Keanu Reeves and Kylie Minogue to shoot.

An equally impressive list of celebrities in Pepsi advertising is Michael Jackson Madonna Shakira the Spice Girls Cindy Crawford.

And the Pepsi commercial featuring Enrique Iglesias Britney Spears Beyonce and Pink for the song We Will Rock You by Queen must have cost incredible money but no doubt it was remembered by many. Interestingly that after this advertisement soda sales in the UK increased by 34% per year.

The struggle of competitors for football fans in the late 90s and early 2000s deserves special attention. Due to the fact that the Coca-Cola company became a sponsor of the 2002 World Cup PepsiCo began to invite football stars of the first magnitude to shoot commercials.

“It's Not Beckham's Day” (2001) is a classic video. In the story David Beckham after an unsuccessful match between “Manchester United” and “Juventus” descends under the stands and sees a boy drinking Pepsi. David asks for a soda the boy treats him having quenched his thirst the football player returns the can back and is about to leave. At the request of the child Beckham gives him a T-shirt with a smile but he wipes can of soda with it and leaves.

In the frame the viewer can see the back of a boy with the inscription “Juventus” everything becomes clear that he is not a fan of the “Red Devils”.

Another headliner of Pepsi ads is the Brazilian footballer Roberto Carlos. The contract with him was concluded for 5 years and for 2 million euros per year.

In 2002 Pepsi launched a large-scale advertising campaign with the slogan Dare for more (Decide on more) under which a football team was created. It included dozens of top players: David Beckham Roberto Carlos Gianluigi Buffon Edgar Davids Rui Costa Iker Casillas and many others.

Lipton Ice Tea

The world-famous brand of iced tea collaborated with “Wolverine” - Hugh Jackman for three years. In commercials the Australian actor received slaps in the face effectively got rid of an annoying fan kissed a beauty and of course danced incendiary.

The Turkmen brand of soda drinks and drinking water Buzly Dag from IE Täjir Ýyldyzy cannot yet boast of commercials with world celebrities but this does not affect the richness of their assortment.

The Buzly Dag product line includes drinks with flavors of lemon orange barberry pear Coca-Cola - only two dozen flavors and also purified drinking water with and without gas.

The capacity of the enterprise permits to produce up to 6 thousand glass and up to 10 thousand plastic bottles of drinks and water per hour. Buzly Dag plans to increase production output and gradually develop foreign markets.

Shocking images of a duck trapped in a Coca-Cola bottle in a Leith park have sparked fury online.

The heartbreaking pictures of the eider were taken around Leith Docks Edinburgh on Friday by a member of Save our Shore Leith (SOS Leith); a community group dedicated to cleaning up the areas around Leith docks.

The bird was snapped swimming in the water with a bright red Coca-Cola sleeve wrapped around its neck.

The duck in question has reportedly been spotted by a number of residents over the past few weeks reports Edinburgh Live.

This however is the first time pictures of the bird have been taken.

SOS Leith are concerned for the duck's welfare because they say the plastic could prove hazardous if it tightens.

They contacted the SSPCA but both parties were unable to catch the bird and were forced to restrict their wild bird admissions due to the surge in avian flu cases.

An SOS Leith representative Annette said the scenes were 'upsetting'

She said : “I hadn’t seen it before but my neighbours have. That particular eider has been around for a few weeks.

“Obviously the bottle was quite visible. Those ducks dive for their food so in doing so it has somehow got into that plastic.

“I live at the Albert dock at Leith one of the docks owned by Forth ports. I feed the birds they cost me an arm and a leg and they are always queuing for their breakfast and dinner.

“This was yesterday morning and I saw it it always makes me quite upset. You always see that kind of thing.

""My neighbour sent me a WhatsApp message that it was back and it was a bit tighter.""

Annette added: ""I’ve spoken to the SSPCA in the past and they are really good. But the problem for them is that this Eider duck isn't ill and isn’t injured plus it is impossible to get a hold of because the docks have a two-metre drop.

""When you have an adult duck that can dive or fly or swim they’re just not going to catch it.”

Scottish SPCA animal rescue officer Brian Todd confirmed the incident to Edinburgh Live on Saturday and warned of the 'devastating consequences' litter can have on wildlife.

He said: “We received a report yesterday (Friday) of a duck with a coke bottle label around its neck at Leith Docks. When we attended we were unable to access the bird but the label was loose and not an immediate cause for concern so the bird will be monitored.

“Litter can have devastating consequences on animals. Most commonly we see seals and birds caught up in fishing line or wire or wildlife visiting gardens becoming tangled in netting.

""Animals could also ingest small pieces of rubbish and choke or die. The majority of these injuries and deaths are entirely avoidable if people disposed of their rubbish responsibly.

""We continue to raise awareness around this subject as well as support Keep Scotland Beautiful and their mission to protect environments and habitats to ensure Scotland’s wildlife can thrive for years to come.""

He added: ""Sadly we have had to introduce a temporary policy to restrict wild bird admissions to our National Wildlife Rescue Centre in response to the current bird flu outbreak. With over 700 birds in our care combined with emerging evidence that bird flu may infect other wild animals we have to protect the animals at our centre.

""An outbreak could be devastating for our centre and our ability to continue to care for all types of wildlife. We will however continue to take reports of wild birds in need and attend to them.

""If you do find a sick or injured wild bird including if they have become hurt or distressed by litter please do not touch or pick up the bird. Call our free animal helpline on 03000 999 999 to report the bird describe what you see and we’ll give you advice and potentially send someone to assess the bird and do what we can to help them.

""If you have touched the bird wash your hands right away. Please do not bring birds to our National Wildlife Rescue Centre or any of our animal rescue and rehoming centres.

""We won’t be able to admit them to our care due to the potential risk they could pose to animals in our care.""

Several aides discreetly look out for Biden while he navigates the White House per the NYT.

""His energy level while impressive for a man of his age is not what it was and some aides quietly watch out for him"" per the report.

Biden has said he intends to run for reelection in 2024 with VP Kamala Harris as his running mate.

The rigors of the US presidency — anchored by a sprawling economy consequential world affairs and the necessity to remain in touch with millions of people — are a challenge for any individual who seeks to sit in the Oval Office.

President Joe Biden who represented Delaware in the Senate for 36 years before serving as vice president for eight knows the complexities of the office like few other people — owed to his years of lawmaking and current residency in the White House.

But as The New York Times recently reported several White House aides keep an eye on the 79-year-old commander-in-chief cognizant that he is attuned to official affairs while still remaining mindful of his vigor.

""His energy level while impressive for a man of his age is not what it was and some aides quietly watch out for him"" The Times reported.

The report stated that Biden sometimes ""shuffles when he walks"" with some aides concerned that he could potentially fall at times. It also noted that some aides ""hold their breath"" when the president speaks during public events hoping that he will get through his remarks without any major gaffes.

If Biden were to be reelected in 2024 he would be 82 years old at the time of his inauguration in January 2025 and he would be 86 at the end of his second term.

In recent months some Democratic voters have expressed concerns with Biden's age with more than a few pointing to his more moderate and congenial brand of politics which has fallen out of favor among the most fervent partisans who have been elected to Congress in recent years.

However Biden has said that he intends to run in 2024 which could potentially set up a rematch with his 2020 opponent former President Donald Trump.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L3RyZXktbXVsbGluYXgtY2x1YnMtdXNlZC10by13aW4tMjAyMi1iYXJiYXNvbC1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXDSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xmZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmV5LW11bGxpbmF4LWNsdWJzLXVzZWQtdG8td2luLTIwMjItYmFyYmFzb2wtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The clubs Trey Mullinax used to win the 2022 Barbasol Championship,The tournament which has had a delay every year since 2015 was a shootout with soft conditions allowing players to take dead aim and Mullinax did just that with eight birdies in the final round at Keene Trace G.C. to come back from three off the leaqd after 54 holes.

His chops are second nature his routines so well-rehearsed they can almost seem spontaneous his music catalog so extensive that Saturday night’s Detroit concert could have been a four-hour marathon with songs to spare.

And based on the evidence at Comerica Park where he finally dispatched with one of the most-awaited concert dates delayed by the pandemic he still gets a real kick out of it all.

So did the multigenerational fans who packed the sold-out ballpark 37000 strong treated to a crowd-pleasing show full of Las Vegas polish and Long Island moxie from the piano-pop maestro.

Taking the stage with his eight-piece band — right at 9 o’clock on a Saturday — Joel headed to his Steinway grand piano for a buoyant “My Life” launching a set that for 135 minutes had the concrete of downtown Detroit reverberating with one of the most successful bodies of work in American pop music.

He turned out to have a surprise befitting the big-league stadium occasion. The concert was an hour in when Joel abruptly welcomed out Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott and confused murmurs from the crowd soon turned to a roar of recognition. The British vocalist — in town for his band’s own Comerica Park show on Sunday — bounded onto the stage lighting into “Pour Some Sugar on Me” as Joel and his band backed him with proficient arena-rock sizzle.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Elliott and Def Leppard along with co-headliner Motley Crue will wrap up a busy Comerica Park music weekend that started Friday with Chris Stapleton. The stadium amps will rev up again when Elton John arrives next week for his final Detroit performance.

But Saturday was all about Billy Joel and it was a long time coming. The show initially set to happen two years ago this weekend was one of the longest-standing bookings on Detroit’s concert calendar delayed multiple times as COVID-19 ground on.

Saturday brought a gorgeous summer night downtown so maybe it was meant to be: On the evening of the original show date — July 10 2020 — Detroit got slammed with heavy thunderstorms.

Joel thanked fans who’d held onto their tickets during the long wait.

“Who the hell knew this was gonna happen?” he said of the pandemic.

Joel has been fine-tuning his crowd work for half a century now and there’s an easy winking familiarity in his approach a sense he’s engaging his audiences like old friends. There’s plenty of banter and good-natured shtick — like the ubiquitous flyswatter he had close at hand a routine at his outdoor dates.

He busted the chops of Tigers fans early in the night saying the team with a 36-48 record is “doing pretty good” to groans and laughs from the crowd.

And he had a little deprecation for himself lamenting it was “the first time I’m playing in Michigan while I’m in my ‘70s.” (Joel turned 73 in May.)

A gravely edge has made its way into Joel’s singing in recent years and he has lost control in spots (notably Saturday on the high notes of “She’s Always a Woman”). But he brought a familiar pleasing tone to Comerica Park still reliably calling on his falsetto and the old Ray Charles vocalisms embedded in numbers such as “Just the Way You Are” “Vienna” and “Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.”

For his first metro Detroit stop in eight years — and first stadium show here since the ‘90s — Joel served up enduring hits while digging a bit deeper into his catalog.

That included several ‘80s hits that have received little stage time in recent years: a galloping “I Go to Extremes” a chirpy “Keeping the Faith” a tempestuous “An Innocent Man.” Ahead of that last 1983 hit Joel warned the crowd it contained a high note that was harder than ever to hit. When he got to the chorus he more or less did it prompting cheers from the crowd — although because he has dropped the song’s key in concert the low notes now presented their own challenges.

His excavation of lesser-played stuff also included the barrelhouse Beatlesque romp “A Room of Our Own” a 1982 album cut he hardly performed live at the time.

It wouldn’t be a Billy Joel show in Detroit these days without some affectionate Motown covers. On Saturday as on his last visit in 2014 those Motor City chest were Marvin Gaye’s “I Heard it Through the Grapevine” and Martha & the Vandellas' “Dancing in the Street” the latter dropped into Joel’s “River of Dreams” with backing singer Crystal Taliefero on vocals.

At one point Joel toyed with the opening piano lick of Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock and Roll” before telling the band he was aborting it and moving on to his own “Only the Good Die Young.”

“A lot of great music came out of this town” Joel told the Detroit crowd. “We all grew up in bands playing those songs. So we’re mighty glad to be here.”

Later in the show powerfully voiced band member Mike DelGuidice got his own star turn with “Nessun Dorma” with Joel backing him at piano for the famous aria.

Cell phones and lighters were out for “Piano Man” which closed the regular set before a hot five-song encore that found Joel upfront for “We Didn’t Start the Fire” and a mic-twirling “It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me.” He was back to the piano to wrap it all up the bang-bang of “Big Shot” and “You May Be Right.”

Andrew McMahon who made his name as a piano pounder on the Southern California emo-punk scene kicked off the evening with a set drawing from his solo work and Jack’s Mannequin days — “opening for one of my heroes” as he told the arriving crowd.

Joel performed at the home of the Detroit Tigers on Saturday July 9 and as if more than two hours of mostly hits performed by the sixth best-selling recording artist of all time wasn’t enough the “Piano Man” gave fans a sweet surprise no one saw coming.

Joel took the stage just before 9:00 p.m. as the sun set over the packed stadium with fans who waited more than two years for this concert after it was announced in 2019 and pushed back two years due to COVID.

“I’d like to thank those of you who bought tickets two years ago to see the show” Joel told the crowd after kicking the show off with “My Life.” “Who the hell knew this was gonna happen? But this is a first for me too. This is the first time I’m playing in Michigan while I’m in my 70s. I had no idea I’d be able to do this.”

Joel performed for 2 hours and 20 minutes on stage while using a fly swatter throughout the night to try and swat away a few bugs which were hovering around his piano. He also kibitzed with the crowd a bit.

“This next song (”The Entertainer”) is from an album that came out in 1975. The album was called “Streetlife Serenade.” (Crowd cheers) “Don’t bull S@#^ me. You don’t have that album. Nobody bought that album. I don’t even have a copy of that album.”

Joel and his band which featured a guitarist bassist keyboardist backup singers and a horn section played around with the crowd periodically by starting to play songs they had no intention of completing like “I Heard it Through The Grapevine.”

Joel also started to perform a Doobie Brothers hit while telling a quick story about opening for them in the 70s. He also went into a Rolling Stones song for a hot second while jokingly comparing himself to Mick Jagger as Joel left his piano to stand and sing a song for the first time.

The biggest surprise of the night was Joel’s nonchalant introduction of rock singer Joe Elliott whose band Def Leppard plays Comerica Park the following night tonight with Joan Jett Poison and Motley Crue.

Joel and his band teamed up with Elliott for Def Leppard’s signature rock hit “Pour Some Sugar on Me” to a loud ovation afterwards. This may be the first and last time anyone in the crowd will ever see that combination on stage together. Billy Joel with Def Leppard. Fun times.

Joel who is now 73 showcased his still powerful vocals on songs like “Just The Way You Are” “Movin’ Out” “She’s Always A Woman” and “Innocent Man.” In case you’re wondering yes Joel hit the high notes in that song. In fact he hit every note in every song much to the joy of the crowd who waited so long to see him.

The 25-song setlist also featured plenty of more hits with “Keeping the Faith” “Allentown” “I Go To Extremes” “Only The Good Die Young” “River of Dreams” and “Piano Man.” Joel let his backup singer Crystal Taliefero show off her vocals with “Dancing in the Street“ as part of an interlude during River of Dreams.”

As if all of those hits weren’t enough the encore featured “We Didn’t Start The Fire” “Uptown Girl” “It’s Still Rock and Roll To Me” “Big Shot” and “You May Be Right.”

It took more than two years for this concert to take place and turned into a truly once in a century event for Michiganders.

Saturday's show at the Tigers' ballpark which unfolded on a picture-perfect summertime evening with temperatures in the upper 70s was announced way back in Nov. 2019 and was then twice-delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I would like to thank those of you who bought tickets two years ago"" Joel told the crowd early in the evening which touched on more than two dozen songs over its two-hour 15-minute run time. ""Who the hell knew that was going to happen?""

No one knew at the time but there was no complaining over the result least of all from the man at the center of the show.

The 73-year-old New Yorker who these days could pass for a grizzled ex-fighter who now runs an amateur boxing gym came out looking spiffy and professional in an all-black suit with a black shirt and a black tie. (He's on the short list of pop singers who wear suits on stage along with Pitbull and Michael Bublé.) His set connected those inescapable piano-rock classics (""Piano Man"" ""Uptown Girl"" ""Pressure"" ""Allentown"") with deep cuts from his catalog and a few welcome surprises.

The biggest of those surprises came when Joel following a performance of the 1982 non-single ""A Room of Our Own"" brought out Joe Elliott from Def Leppard to rip through a rendition of his band's fist-pumping stadium rocker ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" with Joel on backing vocal duties. Elliott is in town for Sunday's Def Leppard/Mötley Crüe extravaganza the third night in an unprecedented three-night run of shows at Comerica Park which kicked off Friday night with country superstar Chris Stapleton's show at the downtown ballpark.

There were several shout-outs to Detroit across the evening including shortened versions of Marvin Gaye's ""I Heard it Through the Grapevine"" and Martha and the Vandella's ""Dancing in the Street"" (sung by Joel's longtime multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero) along with a tease of the piano intro to Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock & Roll"" which acted as a lead-in to ""Only the Good Die Young.""

The Seger will-he-or-won't-he was was indicative of the show's loose vibe and Joel's relaxed demeanor as the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer never took anything too seriously least of all himself. He aped his way through cheesy front-man poses during ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"" and openly questioned his own ability to still hit the high notes in ""An Innocent Man.""

""If I don't hit it it's a real cringe fest"" Joel told the crowd ""so if I don't hit it I will accept your boos."" When he turned around and hit the notes clean the crowd awarded him with ample cheers; it was his ace in the bag all along.

The show unfolded on a massive stage with video screens on either side and eight fractured panels of video screens above the stage. Joel was joined by his eight-person backing band which included a pair of horn players and backing vocalist Mike DelGuidice a Joel soundalike (and lookalike) who once led a Billy Joel tribute band who capably handled a rendition of ""Nessun Dorma"" as Joel backed him.

The crowd was mostly 40s and up and was worked into doing a stadium-appropriate wave during the opening set by piano rocker Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness. Fans sang along and danced in place and all the way into the upper deck lit up in a glow of cell phones several times including during the ballad ""She's Always a Woman."" ""Piano Man"" meanwhile the emotional capper of the night prompted as many fans to record video on their phones as the crowd would at an Olivia Rodrigo concert. (Rodrigo coincidentally namechecks Joel on her 2021 hit ""Deja Vu."")

Joel — often wiping away a watering left eye — sipped from a white mug that was held in a cup holder built into his piano. But his favorite accessory was the Camouflage fly swatter he used to bat away the bugs buzzing around his head as he sat at his piano. ""You've got some funny bugs up here"" he said. ""I just don't want to swallow one.""

Talkative throughout the evening Joel told stories behind the songs like when he knew ""Just the Way You Are"" was going to be a hit judging by the way a crowd in Pittsburgh reacted to it when he performed it while opening a show for the Doobie Brothers. He was seated at his piano for most of the show but took the front-man position several times strapping on a guitar for an encore-opening ""We Didn't Start the Fire.""

""Fire"" is of course the 1989 listicle of Big Events in Joel's lifetime ticking off everything from Marilyn Monroe to the Bay of Pigs to those damned cola wars of the 1980s. A lot has happened since obviously and if any song in the Joel catalog demands a modern update it's ""We Didn't Start the Fire""; it's a bit odd to sing a song about the defining events of one's lifetime and leave out the last 30-plus years.

But Joel famously gave up pop songwriting in the early '90s so in essence his catalog is a time capsule preserved in amber stopped cold in 1993 after his final studio album ""River of Dreams."" So the songs don't change they're there forever and the demand for Joel to sing them is great enough that he's still filling stadiums with them. (Saturday was Joel's biggest-ever solo concert in Detroit.)

Through the years Joel has been critical of his friend Elton John who's continued to make new music throughout his career for maybe making too many songs. Joel quit when he felt the time was right for him so you can't begrudge the guy and even if you did he's got a song for that too.

""Keep it to yourself"" he sang in Saturday's opener. ""It's my life.""

The show — Joel’s first in the metro area since 2014 his first in Detroit proper since 1986 and his first stadium concert here as a solo artist after — was announced during early June of 2019 and was originally supposed to take place in July of 2020. It was delayed again last year. That’s 1025 days of waiting for the Piano Man faithful.

But Joel’s two-hour and 15-minute was more than well worth the wait.

As a great concert his tend to be low-hanging fruit. He has a Rock and Roll and Songwriters Halls of Fame career to draw on loaded with enduring hits and some album tracks that are nearly as well known. Hey may be an elder statesman at 73 but Joel’s sense of showmanship was as intact and sharp as ever quick-witted and good-humored — warding off bugs with a fly-swatter was a recurring gag — without becoming schticky.

And he packed a some surprises into the 26-songs too — the biggest being a surprise appearance by Def Leppard frontman Joe Elliott in town for his band’s show at Comerica on Sunday July 10 for a rendition of his band’s hit “Pour Some Sugar on Me.” For the acolytes meanwhile Joel pulled out the rocking rarely played “A Room of Our Own” a deep cut from his 1982 “The Nylon Curtain” album that was actually played live for the first time ever in Detroit on Nov. 10 1982 at Joe Louis Arena. He last performed the song during a half-dozen shows in 2014.

It wouldn’t be a Joel show without teases and snippets of other band’s songs of course. He and his eight-member band played a verse and chorus of Marvin Gaye’s Motown staple “I Heard it Through the Grapevine” after which he told the crowd of over 38000 that “a lot of great music came from this town. We all grew up in bands playing those songs. So we’re mighty glad to be here.” The Joel crew also tried out a bit of the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” and in another nod to Detroit Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock and Roll.”

And while sandwiching Martha & the Vandellas’ “Dancing in the Street” into “The River of Dreams” is something Joel and his band do at most of their shows the exercise felt a little more profound in Motown itself.

Amidst all that Joel rolled out a crowd-pleasing collection from his 52 years of recording frequently introducing songs with insightful and sometimes humorous stories. Referencing his 1974 album “Streetlife Serenade” before playing “The Entertainer” he told those applauding “Oh don’t bull*** me. You don’t have that album. Nobody bought that album. I don’t have that album!” “The Stranger” celebrating its 45th anniversary was the most represented of his oeuvre with six songs including “Just the Way You Are” “Only the Good Die Young” and a fiery “Scenes From an Italian Restaurant” that was preceded by Puccini’s “Nessun dorma” sung by guitarist Mike DeiGuidice.

“Piano Man” of course had the full stadium singing along while Joel played guitar during “We Didn’t Start the Fire” kicking off a breathless 25-minute encore that also tore through “Uptown Girl” “It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me” “Big Shot” and “You May Be Right” which featured a bit of Led Zeppelin’s “Rock and Roll” sung by DeiGuidice.

The Joel fans weren’t limited to the audience either. Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness voiced the feelings of many during the quartet’s well-received 33-minute set; Joel McMahon told the Comerica crowd was the first show he ever saw in Cleveland during 1994. “It is an honor to be on this stage with one of my heroes…a real dream come true” McMahon said and while the delays may have made Joel’s show seem like a distant dream its arrival lived up to that anticipation in every way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldHJvdGltZXMuY29tL2RldHJvaXQvcGhvdG9zLWZyb20tdGhlLWJpbGx5LWpvZWwtY29uY2VydC1hdC1kZXRyb2l0cy1jb21lcmljYS1wYXJrL1NsaWRlc2hvdy8zMDUzMDE1NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos from the Billy Joel concert at Detroit's Comerica Park,Singer and pianist Billy Joel performed his first-ever concert at Detroit's Comerica Park on Saturday.

The issues masked what otherwise was a positive quarter for the company.

During the quarter the company reorganized its reporting structure for certain brands within its Refrigerated and Frozen business unit. As part of the changes the company recorded a $386 million goodwill and brand impairment charge with $244 million associated with its Bird’s Eye business.

Adding to the pressure were supply chain disruptions in the Foodservice and canned chili businesses.

“In our Foodservice business we identified an off-spec finished good issue while producing product for a customer” said Sean M. Connolly president and chief executive officer during an Oct. 6 call to discuss first-quarter results. “We disposed of the product and lost manufacturing time during our diagnostic. This pulled sales and gross margin below where they should have been.”

The company also identified canned chili product that was off spec had to be disposed of and led to lost inventory.

“While production is now back up and running properly the lost inventory effect will linger into Q2 impacting volumes and margins” Mr. Connolly said. “The point is these types of challenges can result in downtime needed to determine and solve the root cause of the issue as well as proper testing to ramp production back up. That lost time can result in higher costs and less production.”

Mr. Connolly added that there is clear progress in Conagra’s supply chain as well as in the supply chains of the company’s peers with service levels improving and productivity tracking well. But they are “not flawless” and will remain “dynamic” for the foreseeable future

For the quarter ended Aug. 28 Conagra Brands recorded a loss of $78 million down significantly from the year before when the company earned $235 million equal to 49¢ per share on the common stock.

Quarterly sales rose to $2.9 billion from $2.7 billion the year prior.

“We continued to gain market share at the total portfolio level particularly within our strategic frozen and snacks domains and drove solid profit improvement during the quarter” Mr. Connolly said. “We also saw another strong performance from Ardent Mills as effective management enabled the joint venture to continue capitalizing on volatility in the wheat markets.”

Conagra’s adjusted net income increased 14% to $275 million or 57¢ per share according to the company. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in gross profit and the performance from the company's Ardent Mills joint venture.

The company raised prices in fiscal 2022 and continued to do so during the first quarter.

“As you would expect pricing has driven some volume elasticities both for Conagra and the overall industry” Mr. Connolly said. “This tends to be most acute in the immediate aftermath of new pricing and wanes over time as consumers adjust.”

He added that Conagra’s net elasticities have remained “nearly flat” over the past few quarters.

“What you should expect in a super cycle of pricing like we've seen right now is that there will be modest short-term impacts on household penetration as consumers defer purchases” Mr. Connolly said. “And that's kind of — you see it really show up in the shopping data when people — their big trips become smaller trips and they postpone purchases and their buying rate will drop a bit.”

Conagra Brands plans to continue raising prices in the second and third quarters.

“We continue to expect the inflationary environment to persist but moderate through calendar year '23 which will result in a low teens inflation rate for our fiscal year '23 weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year” said David S. Marberger chief financial officer. “We also expect previously communicated pricing actions in light of these costs to become effective early in the second quarter likely causing volume to decline.

“We recently communicated some additional pricing that will be effective in Q3. However the magnitude will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price as needed to manage future volatility.”

The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2023 guidance of organic net sales growth between 4% to 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 1% to 5% over fiscal 2022. But management is expecting continued supply chain inefficiencies and incremental volume weakness as prices are raised. It was also noted that despite the strong performance of the Ardent Mills joint venture during the quarter the elevated level is not expected to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.",,,,,,,,,,,,
COP,ConocoPhillips,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWRlbi1hbGFza2EtY29ub2NvcGhpbGxpcHMtb2lsLWRyaWxsaW5nLXdpbGxvdy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFbaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWRlbi1hbGFza2EtY29ub2NvcGhpbGxpcHMtb2lsLWRyaWxsaW5nLXdpbGxvdw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden administration takes key step in controversial Alaska oil drilling project angering environmental groups,"CNN —

The Biden administration has taken a key step forward on a controversial proposed oil drilling project in Alaska’s North Slope angering climate advocates who say the project would release tons of emissions and doom the President’s climate goals.

The US Department of Interior released a draft environmental impact statement for the ConocoPhillips oil drilling project known as Willow on Friday night. The statement does not represent a final decision and includes several potential scenarios for the project including no drilling. But it was a critical step the Biden administration needed to complete for the process to move forward – setting off alarm bells among environmental groups.

If approved and built the project would produce 629 million barrels of oil over the course of a 30-year life span and would release between 278 million and 284 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide according to the draft environmental impact statement.

ConocoPhillips is proposing five drilling sites on federal land in Alaska’s North Slope and the project would include a processing facility pipelines to transport oil gravel roads at least one airstrip and a gravel mine site the draft EIS report states.

The Biden administration has faced considerable pressure from congressional Republicans and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to spur domestic energy production to help bring down gasoline prices though this project would take years to complete.

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska cheered the administration’s move and said she would “continue to hold them accountable” in hopes the project would begin construction this winter.

“From day one I’ve elevated the Willow project to the Administration as my top priority” Murkowski said in a statement.

Environmental groups blasted the new development saying it would destroy Biden’s climate goals of slashing US greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade and accelerate the pace of climate change.

“This project is a climate disaster in waiting” Christy Goldfuss senior vice president for energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress said in a statement. “When approved it will define the country’s energy future for the next 30-plus years while having no impact on the pain that Americans are currently feeling at the pump.”

The groups also said the project would harm native wildlife including polar bears migratory birds and caribou.

“We cannot allow ConocoPhillips to destroy this pristine region – which is already warming three times faster than the rest of the world due to climate change” Alex Taurel conservation program director at the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

Willow was initially approved by the Trump administration but then temporarily blocked by a judge who said that the prior administration’s environmental analysis was not sufficient and did not fully consider the potential harm to wildlife or the further impact on climate change.

The Biden administration’s new draft EIS was needed for the project to proceed.

With the release of the draft a 45-day public comment period takes effect before the administration makes a final decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYWxhc2thLW5hdGl2ZS1uZXdzLmNvbS9hcmN0aWMtZHJpbGxpbmctcHJvcG9zYWwtdGVzdHMtYmlkZW5zLWNsaW1hdGUtY29tbWl0bWVudC82MjU2OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arctic Drilling Proposal Tests Biden’s Climate Commitment,"



ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project Incompatible with Biden Climate Pledge

Washington D.C. – Friday the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to analyze the impacts of ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (Reserve). Alaska Wilderness League expressed strong concerns about the climate and environmental impacts of the massive project during BLM’s public process earlier this year and in a letter sent by the leaders of 18 organizations to Secretary Haaland last week. More than 140 organizations and 200000 individuals from throughout Alaska and across America submitted comments last winter opposing the Willow project calling on President Biden to protect America’s Western Arctic.

“If approved the Willow project would be bigger than any other proposed oil and gas project on our nation’s public lands and it poses an unparalleled climate and biodiversity threat that puts President Biden’s climate legacy at risk” said Kristen Miller conservation director of the Alaska Wilderness League. “This project is proposed in America’s Western Arctic an area that is already being ravaged by climate change this project would put critical wildlife and subsistence resources in the crosshairs and it would lock us into decades of carbon-intensive oil and gas extraction.

“Willow is a legacy setting project that will test whether the Biden administration is righting America’s course from a dangerous climate path” Miller said. “We look forward to working with the agency on a plan that prioritizes this sensitive habitat for its immense ecological resources and as a one-of-a-kind climate opportunity to reverse course regarding fossil development on our nation’s public lands.”

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in Alaska’s Western Arctic is the largest single-unit of public land in the nation spanning approximately 23 million acres across Alaska’s western North Slope. The Western Arctic is home to some of our nation’s most vital natural resources — millions of acres of wilderness-quality lands with critical habitat for migratory birds brown bears caribou threatened polar bears walrus and more. The Alaska Native communities that live in and around the Reserve have maintained a subsistence lifestyle for thousands of years based on its living resources.

Born and raised in Manhattan N.Y. Mickey studied at the Woman’s College of University of North Carolina and then transferred to Hunter College in Manhattan earning a degree in biochemistry. She was predeceased by her husband Marvin Sands (1999) founder of Constellation Brands and daughter Dr. Laurie Sands (1995). Mickey and Marvin were married in the spring of 1947 at a ceremony in New York City and the couple settled in Canandaigua where they became fixtures in the community for many years. Mickey moved to Florida many years ago but always enjoyed her summer visits to Canandaigua where she enjoyed seeing family and friends. Mickey was a supportive wife loving mother grandmother and great- grandmother as well as a generous philanthropist. She is survived by two sons and daughters-in-law Richard and Jennifer Sands Rob and Pamela Sands; son-in-law Dr. Andy Stern; and many loving grandchildren and great-grandchildren who filled her life with joy and happiness. As one of her grandson’s noted: “Mickey exemplifies everything that's special about this family - she's experienced so much in her life extreme ups and downs and she has Buddha like perspective on what's important in this world. She exemplifies what's important by showing compassion humility grace and will always be brutally honest with you. A refreshing combination of attributes – as some people have a limit on how much love they can give to others - Mickey has no limits.” The family will celebrate the life of Mickey privately.

HoYoverse will introduce Travelers to the Sumeru region and the Dendro element in the 3.0 update with multiple leaks teasing possible Dendro characters. As previously discussed notable Genshin Impact dataminer Ubatcha speculated that the update would feature a Character Event Wish Banner with Tighnari and Collei as featured characters.

New information was brought to light for Tighnari and Collei as their Combat Kits were leaked online. We'll be looking at the details on their Combat Kits including their Constellations Ascension Passives and more.

Genshin Impact Combat Kits For Sumeru Characters Leaked

Recently another Genshin Impact dataminer YelanLover announced the Combat Kits for Tighnari and Collei which includes their Constellation and Ascension details. Interestingly Collei’s Combat Kit details shine a light on possible Dendro elemental reactions that have yet to be confirmed by HoYoverse.

Collei’s Combat Kit

According to the dataminer Collei’s Combat Kit is being described as the following:

Constellation Level 1 (C1): Collei’s Energy Recharge will increase by 20% when assigned to a party and not on the battlefield.

Collei’s Energy Recharge will increase by 20% when assigned to a party and not on the battlefield. Constellation Level 2 (C2): Requiring the Passive Talent to be unlocked the Floral Ring grants Collei a sprouting effect from the Passive which deals 40% of her ATK converted into Dendro DMG against enemies for three seconds. If any party members trigger an elemental reaction before the sprouting effect ends it prolongs its duration by three seconds.

Inside away from the elements Mr. Gaesser pondered what the coming year might bring for farmers.

As tractors and planters throughout the Midwest rolled into fields like the ones near his house earlier this year Mr. Gaesser 69 was hopeful that soaring grain prices and heightened global demand for food would translate into robust revenues. But he also expected that sharply higher costs for fuel fertilizer and other necessities would cut deeply into profits.

And then there is Big Food.

Companies like PepsiCo Cargill Walmart and General Mills are trying to convince farmers like Mr. Gaesser to adopt new climate-friendly agricultural techniques through a variety of financial incentives and programs. They have good reason. Together these companies have pledged that at least 70 million acres or roughly 18 percent of the nation’s total cropland an area about the size of Nevada will be operated using regenerative agriculture techniques by 2030.

Through photosynthesis plants — whether corn or trees — convert carbon dioxide from the air into energy that is stored in the soil. Regenerative farming techniques such as planting a cover crop during the fall allows that process to continue throughout the winter months when the soil would normally be bare.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2JwczEyOTM4ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Susan Wylie Carpenter Obituary - Elmira,"July 18 1949 - July 5 2022 - Susan passed away peacefully on July 5 2022 after a courageous battle with a brief illness.

The InterTech Group Inc. relinquished its long-held stake in a small Northeast utility last week when the sale of Corning Natural Gas Holdings Corp. was finalized.

The $24.75 per-share buyout returned about $10 million to the North Charleston-based company which held an 11.3 percent equity position and another $1.4 million in preferred stock through a trust controlled by CEO Anita Zucker.

""It was a fabulous investment"" said Robert Johnston InterTech's chief strategy officer who had been on the board of upstate New York-based Corning Natural Gas since 2014.

It required some patience to get to the finish line.

InterTech publicly disclosed its investment in the company about a decade ago when its ownership of the utility crossed the 5 percent threshold and triggered federal reporting requirements. At the time the stock was trading at around $15.

The recently closed transaction with privately owned Argus Infrastructure Partners was announced in January 2021 sending the stock price up about 50 percent. It was approved overwhelmingly by shareholders a few months later.

But investors would have to wait for their money. More than a year would pass before regulators in the two states that Corning serves signed off on the deal.

The July 6 sale marks InterTech's latest exit from a string of investments it's made in the energy industry since at least 2005 when it shelled out $17.5 million for 7 percent of the largest power provider in Vermont. That early deal was in large part a bet that a Depression-era law that restricted the sale of regulated utilities would be rolled back making small well-run electric and gas companies attractive acquisition targets.

Congress rescinded the outdated act later that year.

""That repeal ... opened the door to utilities growing by merging with other utilities that didn't have to be adjacent to them"" Johnston said last week. ""Up until then you had to be an adjacent utility.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdHdpc3RlZHNpZnRlci5jb20vdmlkZW9zL2hlcmVzLWhvdy1vbmUtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1jb21wYW55LWlzLXR1cm5pbmctcG9sbHV0aW9uLWludG8tcGFpbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's How One Innovative Company Is Turning Pollution into Paint,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2JwczEyOTQ0MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Allen McNaney Obituary - Elmira,"Paul Allen McNaney 64 of Elmira died on Thursday July 7 2022.

“The dynamic has changed totally” said Herron owner of Greenworks Flowers.

While her shop lives or dies by the same customers that drive any other retailer its location is not quite as ordinary: It’s built into an underground shopping center. The shop is part of Houston’s network of underground pedestrian tunnels and shopping plazas a prominent outpost in a subset of the North American retail landscape.

Underground shopping centers — a diverse collection of below-grade commercial spaces that can include an array of vendors such as newsstands bakeries restaurants galleries and even dentists’ offices — have been a popular fixture in developments from New York to Houston to Toronto offering business owners a captive audience of weekday commuters using expansive networks of tunnels to beat heat cold and traffic. The pandemic has disrupted that retail real estate balance.

Analysts designers and more than a dozen businesses in some of the most prominent underground developments in North America say their trade has been struck a double blow first by a pandemic that temporarily brought business to a halt then by the changed patterns of city life. The dependable vigor of workday crowds is gone. In its place the curated dependence of underground spaces on office workers above has become a burden as the reality of long-term hybrid work settles in.

“It is at the mercy of what the return of office workers looks like” said Grant Humes head of the Financial District Business Improvement Area in Toronto where more than 17 miles of tunnels connect shops in a below-ground network known as the PATH.

“The PATH is one of those places where unless you have a reason to be there you don’t have a reason to be there — and your reason to be there is usually that you’re going to work” he said.

In Houston that dependency stands out in stark terms. Data from security firm Kastle Systems which tracks office attendance using anonymous keycard data from clients’ properties has shown office use rates there hovering around 56% among the highest in the nation and yet returning workers aren’t filling the underground spaces the way they once did.

Instead Herron said she can clearly see the outcome of new hybrid work policies implemented by above-ground employers. On days when more workers happen to be in the office at once she estimates traffic by her shop reaches about 70% of its pre-pandemic level — but other days it drops without warning to a third of what it once was — or less.

“The companies are still not operating like before” Herron said. “I don’t think they ever will again.”

Locked In

The challenges facing underground retailers are a combination of shifting demand and the constraint on spaces that are by their very nature difficult to update said David Greensfelder a consultant who has taught planning for the Urban Land Institute a research and public policy group.

Invisible from the sidewalk they can’t pivot to catch the attention of casual passers-by when commuter traffic slows.

“If you’re looking for a newspaper and you’re already above ground you’re probably not going to go underground to buy that newspaper” Greensfelder said.

From her shop beneath Houston’s streets Herron put it even more bluntly: “The rhythm for somebody like me who has been in this same location for 30 years has to be reinvented.”

Houston’s 6 miles of tunnels are largely linked to the surface by entrances in the lobbies of office buildings above them and the fate of individual sections has hinged on the choices of the businesses overhead leaving parts of the system worse off than others according to Robert Pieroni director of economic development for Central Houston Inc. a downtown business association. That system can also provide a welcome relief in a Gulf Coast city plagued by high temperatures and humidity.

From his station as a cook at Treebeard’s restaurant under downtown Houston about a quarter-mile from Herron’s flower shop Wendell Malone watched as the pandemic emptied the tunnels. Now he estimates the restaurant serves about 400 people a day about two-thirds as many as it did before the pandemic.

In Chicago where five miles of tunnels connect transit stations to some of the city’s most prominent buildings and provide a respite from the frigid winter weather the picture is more dire.

The city’s main downtown business association said that through June traffic counts in the tunnels lingered near 40% of pre-pandemic levels even as monthly averages on above-ground streets have doubled that figure hitting 80% or more.

Canada’s two largest underground retail venues in Toronto and Montreal have fared better thanks to being integrated differently into the fabric of life in the cities above.

Largest Underground Retail Complex

With more than 17 miles of tunnels and 4 million square feet of retail space including convenience stores theaters and medical services the Toronto PATH network holds the Guinness World Record for largest underground shopping complex.

Fellow cold-climate city Montreal has an underground retail system that's likewise among the largest in the world.

But unlike many U.S. developments both systems connect not only transit and offices but convention centers multiple stadiums and residential buildings creating a user base more resilient to office attendance shifts.

Still fluctuating traffic has hit underground retail hard according to Bradley Jones head of retail for Toronto-based Oxford Property Group the largest commercial landlord in Toronto.

While Oxford doesn’t track PATH traffic specifically Jones said retailers in the food court connected to the underground network are only back to about 50% of their pre-pandemic top-line sales.

“Tuesday Wednesday Thursday — in some cases they're getting back to pre-COVID numbers but when you average it over the five days it’s less” he said.

With a hybrid work model appearing to be the norm for some time to come finding ways to flex with the crowds such as dynamic scheduling and inventorying will probably be required.

To meet the challenge Oxford is looking to leverage the convenience factor of the tunnels pivoting away from commuter dependency and toward lifestyle tenants such as medical and legal offices gyms and other fitness tenants.

Seeing the Light

The overall gloomy outlook for the subterranean segment comes with at least one bright spot: The newest underground developments seem to have come back stronger from the pandemic lows.

Typically built around a central often atrium-style core newer underground developments are generally designed with more external features in mind with all aspects of the project including the architecture and the leasing strategy designed to draw pedestrians from outside rather than simply serving as an amenity for the offices above.

MarketPlace 28 a four-story 200000-square-foot retail development retrofitted below the 28 Liberty building in New York by China-based owner Fosun in 2018 has large banks of windows lighting a vertical well that drops through all four stories. The below-grade development is anchored by a theater at its lowest level a move intended to draw users down and through the retail space said Gensler lead retail designer Jason Carney who worked on the project.

“It’s not dependent at all on commuters or commuter patterns” said Carney. “It’s an entertainment destination.”

In Houston one of the newest developments connected to city tunnels is Understory a two-story atrium beneath the Bank of America Tower completed by Skanska in 2019 with similar design principles: ample daylight carried downward through an atrium-style core and strong sightlines from street level.

The goal was to lure more visitors than the building’s office users said Matt Damborsky Skanska’s executive vice president for Houston who oversaw the design of the lower-level space.

“We wanted to say ‘Hey the tunnel’s down here’” said Damborsky. “We were hyper-focused on creating a space that not only people in the building could use but also people could come in off the street and use.”

Direct comparisons are hard to come by but Damborsky said his impression was that Understory fared better than other parts of Houston’s tunnel system during the pandemic. Seven of its nine storefronts are occupied.

For spaces that can’t be reoriented to include natural light and street-level visibility Gensler’s Carney said he thinks the key will be creating more abstract types of “visibility” to the above-ground world including using tech tools to draw shoppers and space enhancements such as art installations as well as a leasing strategy that prioritizes a destination-making tenant mix over simply pushing rents.

Especially for older tunnel-and-hub developments whether they survive may hang on whether other drivers are able to take the place of a five-day-a-week office crowd.

“Rent is a function of sales and sales is a function of being able to capture demand” the Urban Land Institute's Greensfelder said. “So if the demand has left you do the math.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9teS11bm9ydGhvZG94LWxpZmUtanVsaWEtaGFhcnQtc3Vlcy1lc3RyYW5nZWQtaHVzYmFuZC0yNTctbWlsbGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Julia Haart Files $275 Million Fraud Lawsuit Against Estranged Husband,"Julia Haart is taking Silvio Scaglia to court for more than $257 million amid their divorce.

The My Unorthodox Life star 51 filed a lawsuit Friday against her estranged husband business partner and costar on Friday claiming that Scaglia 63 is a ""liar and a fraud"" who defrauded her out of their businesses after she filed for divorce in February.

In court docs obtained by PEOPLE which also names Elite World Group's Group Chief Executive Officer Paolo Barbieri and Jeffrey Feinman from accounting firm DDK & Company as defendants Haart details an alleged plot on Scaglia's behalf to cheat her out of major stocks and earnings from their fashion talent management banner Elite World Group (EWG) and parent company Freedom Holding Inc. (FHI).

Scaglia's lawyer however countered her claims in a statement to PEOPLE that Haart's claims of 50 percent ownership have already been rejected by one court. Representatives for Feinman and Barbieri did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

The 45-page lawsuit which was filed in New York State Supreme Court claims Scaglia ""begged"" his then-fiancée Haart to serve as EWG's CEO in June 2019. Instead of taking a salary from the company she alleges that he convinced her EWG should pay a management fee of 2 percent of their annual revenue to the parent company over which they would be equal partners.

""Haart reasonably relied on Scaglia's representations. Not only had they worked together for a number of years but the two also were engaged to be married at the time"" the lawsuit reads. ""Haart agreed to this arrangement in part out of love for her fiancé who she knew needed cash on a day-to-day basis but also based on Scaglia's representation that the shares he was transferring would make her a full 50 percent owner of FHI.

Craig Barritt/Getty

""Haart would not have agreed to this arrangement had she known that Scaglia would later take the position that he had total control over the money in FHI's account. Haart has since learned that Scaglia's representations to her concerning her ownership and control of FHI were all a pack of lies and that he never intended for Haart to be his equal partner or to share equal ownership and control of FHI"" it continues.

Haart claims that Scaglia deceptively amended FHI's articles of incorporation to issue himself preferred shares of the company's stock before transferring 50 percent to Haart making her control ""purely illusory"" and giving her ""no ability to prevent Scaglia from taking all of the money paid by EWG for Haart's valuable services as CEO for himself.""

Noam Galai/Getty Images

""Haart's indentured servitude must be remedied"" the complaint argues. ""It cannot be that a man can convince his wife to give up millions in dollars in salary and benefits plus an employment contract at the peak of her career (along with the security and independence that come with those things) and then leave her with nothing when his bait-and-switch is revealed.""

Scaglia's attorney Lanny J. Davis of Davis Goldberg & Galper PLLC contests the claim in a statement to PEOPLE. ""She has refiled claims that have already been ruled on by a Delaware judge who rejected them — [who ruled] that she doesn't own 50 percent of Mr. Scalia or Freedom or any of the company's assets"" Davis says.

Shortly after filing for divorce in February following nearly three years of marriage Haart claimed that she was wrongfully terminated from her CEO position at EWG as part of his ""personal vendetta.""

The lawsuit accused Scaglia of ""egregious bullying unauthorized conduct"" by blocking her access to the EWG office cutting off her corporate cards shutting off phone service at their home and terminating her assistants in addition to using the press to plant false allegations about her.

Haart also alleged that he had ""become increasingly volatile abusive and unhinged"" toward her and her children in recent weeks.

Pros say Costco is gaining market share right now as shoppers consolidate trips and search for savings in bulk buying amid the period of high inflation. Costco is doing its part to feed that thesis.

On Thursday the warehouse retailer said that June same-store sales — excluding fuel sales — rose an impressive 13%. Store traffic surged 10.2% year over year and ""core"" U.S. sales improved 13.2% while e-commerce sales rose 13%.

Overall Costco notched sales increases in all of its merchandise departments led by a mid-teens percentage increase in its food business.

""Costco is the dominant leader in the attractive warehouse club channel"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in a note to clients. ""We see prospects for the company to deliver comparable sales 1-2 percentage above historical levels based on: 1) channel shift from traditional grocery department stores and specialty retail; 2) higher growth among Gen Y/Z demos w/ stronger skew toward club offerings; and 3) bigger baskets as customers increasingly shop categories beyond food.""

Tarlowe maintained a buy rating on Costco's stock with a price target of $580. The retailer's shares rose more than 1.5% to $502 as of 2:41 p.m. ET during Friday's trading session.

Suffice to say the news in retail over the past month or so has been anything but Costco-like.

Discounter Target kicked off the concerns about the sector's health with a shocking decision to liquidate massive amounts of slow-moving inventory (notably in home goods) and take a more cautious view on near-term profits.

Since then retailers such as RH Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl's issued financial warnings for the second quarter. Bed Bath & Beyond's outlook was so dire it prompted one analyst to tell Yahoo Finance Live the company may go out of business.

Nike took a more measured approach to its full-year financial outlook when it reported quarterly earnings.

Retail stocks — as measured by the SPDR S&P Retail ETF — have tanked 32% year-to-date compared to an 18% decline for the S&P 500.

The warnings have many retail analysts bracing for a stretch of bad earnings reports and share price reactions.

""We remain downbeat on the near-term fundamental prospects in our space"" Wells Fargo retail analyst Ike Boruchow wrote in a note to clients. ""On top of that our recent channel work suggests the space continues to soften: 1) foot traffic trends slowing further to end June and; 2) a promotional cadence that continues to worsen (especially in the mid-tier apparel space).""

Ever since the company first opened a Seattle warehouse in 1983 bulk shopping has never been easier—or cheaper. While retailers such as Amazon have done their best to encroach on the bulk product market Costco still has a few things that the online retailer lacks namely a food court and some fan-favorite foods.

Costco's beloved food court began in 1992 in tandem with Kirkland Signature (their private label brand) in an effort to offer quality products at discounted prices. To this day the supermarket offers Costco members great deals on ready-made food and many fans are enamored by their offerings which include perfectly twisted churros incredibly cheap pizza and beef chili with beans. However few Costco food court items hit the spot like the Costco hot dogs which at $1.50 each remain a fan-favorite for both the taste and the price tag.

Even better? The Costco hot dog and 20-ounce drink combo has remained $1.50 since 1985—and that includes refills. According to Mental Floss the price is here to stay: When W. Craig Jelinek the company's current CEO approached Costco co-founder and previous CEO Jim Sinegal with the idea of raising the price of the signature hot dog. The former CEO responded ""If you raise (the price of the) effing hot dog I will kill you. Figure it out.""

100% Pure-Beef Hot Dogs

In fact while the price hasn't changed the Costco hot dog is about 10 percent thicker than the original quarter-pound version in 1984. And the dogs are 100% beef—In fact in 2008 Costco stopped advertising Hebrew National as the supplier and began featuring Kirkland Brand beef hot dogs in Costco food court.

Apart from being a 100% pure beef hot dog Costco's hot dogs don't have by-products corn syrup phosphates fillers or artificial colors or flavors. One could say that they can get away with using less additives because they sell so many each year but really it just proves the quality of Kirkland Signature.

It's All About Volume

While the dollar dogs don't do Costco any favors with the low price tag it pays dividends by adding to the foot traffic in the store. In an increasingly online world the food court of Costco is one of the major draws that helps shoppers and membership holders justify the expense.

In 2015 alone Costco sold 128 million hot dogs. They tend to sell on average 100 million hot dogs yearly. That's more than four times the number of hot dogs than all of those sold at MLB stadiums each years. That's a mouthful so let's break it down: If you combined yearly hot dog sales from every Major League Baseball stadium in the U.S. Costco will have outsold them four times over.

The dollar dogs don't do Costco any favors with the low price tag but it pays dividends by adding to the foot traffic in the store. In an increasingly online world the food court of Costco is one of the major draws that helps shoppers and membership holders justify the expense.

Before the food court there was a hot dog cart

Jay de Geus ran the hot dog cart outside of the San Diego California warehouse for a number of years before it moved to include food courts in its design. The hot dog cart was gifted to Costco from Hebrew National.

Today the hot-dog-and-soda combo is by far the food court's most popular buy followed by the pizza frozen yogurt and sandwiches. And many fans swear that the steamed buns make the difference: Costco chefs from the food court steam the bun (and the dog!) which results in a soggier dog when wrapped in foil and handed over. However many feel that's one of the benefits of the Costco hot dog.

If you're ordering a dog today don't be fools by the lack of condiment dispensers: Some stores may have phased out the communal onion and sauerkraut you can still ask for these toppings on your hot dog at the counter. They come free of charge too.

While the warehouse store might not make any money on your dollar dog but it's certainly luring you in with the promise of a dirt-cheap lunch or family dinner that'll keep the kids satisfied while you browse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpc3R2LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzEwL3JlY2FsbC05LWRyYXdlci1jaGVzdHMtc29sZC1jb3N0Y28tcmVjYWxsZWQtYWZ0ZXItdGlwLW92ZXItaW5jaWRlbnQtaW52b2x2aW5nLWNoaWxkL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXN0di5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9yZWNhbGwtOS1kcmF3ZXItY2hlc3RzLXNvbGQtY29zdGNvLXJlY2FsbGVkLWFmdGVyLXRpcC1vdmVyLWluY2lkZW50LWludm9sdmluZy1jaGlsZC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recall: 9-drawer chests sold at Costco recalled after tip-over incident involving child,"(Gray News) - Thousands of nine-drawer chests sold at Costco stores are being recalled due to tip-over and entrapment hazards.

According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Samson International is recalling about 5400 of its Universal Broadmoore Cayden Gentleman’s nine-drawer chests after a report of a tip-over incident involving a 10-year-old child.

According to the recall alert the chests can be unstable if not anchored to the wall posing tip-over and entrapment hazards that can result in death or serious injuries to consumers.

The chests included in the recall are brown and are about 49 inches tall with model/item number M71C3180 and the Costco customer item number 1335751.

The items were sold at Costco stores nationwide from December 2019 to April 2020 for about $700.

Consumers were advised to immediately stop using the recalled chests if they are not properly anchored to the wall and place them in an area where children could not access the item.

The recall notice said owners of the chests can contact Samson at 800-357-0701 for a full refund or for a free tip-over restraint kit. Consumers can also return the item to Costco warehouses for a full refund.

Business Insider reports the warehouse store will be raising the price of two popular items. The chicken bake will go from costing two-99 to three-99 and soda will jump from 59 cents to 69 cents. The famous hot dog and soda combo will remain at a dollar-50 the price it's been since being added to the menu in 1985.

On an earnings call in May a senior vice president for the company said Costco has no plans to raise the price of the hot dog combo. The price hikes come as inflation has caused the price of food to increase just under 12-percent compared to a year ago."

As a result you probably ran towards the window reaching out in hopes of grabbing one or two extra bars of service to make a phone call send one more text message or (lets be honest) watch one more video. At times it seems like wherever we are in a building always ends up being in a dead zone. Due to the way that building materials block the waves needed for cellular communication there’s little chance that this will change in the near future leaving you with very limited bandwidth—unless the building owner utilizes small cell technology.

Smart cells are small fiber-connected antennas that are traditionally affixed to existing public infrastructure like city street lights and network utility towers and work by increasing wireless coverage and capacity. These cells are a critical part of smart city technology as they are able to handle high-density data while providing internet speeds that are up to 50 times faster than existing 4G LTE networks making them also the perfect choice for the newly rolled out 5G networks.

Back when offices had dedicated desks we relied on ethernet telecoms but now with the more transient nature of workers in a building occupiers are thinking about the increase of data transfers through individual mobile phones. As more cellular devices that require more high-speed connectivity come online in a building the need for small cells will continue to increase. It’s estimated that in the next three years each smartphone in North America will use 45 GB of data per month. To support this consumption and the expansion of 5G networks we will need to install nearly one million new small cells in the next three years.

When understanding the importance of small cells the need for additional data can be broken down into two concepts: coverage vs capacity. Coverage is the area that a type of communication infrastructure spans or how far a signal can reach. In dense areas with tall buildings coverage can lessen and cause signals to drop. Capacity describes having coverage but for a variety of reasons the data is not transmitted as quickly as expected.

Issues arise due to the like wireless density or the ability of the existing towers in the coverage area to be able to transmit enough data to supply the requests. The more data that people use in a network the slower everyone’s connections become. The solution is to add more data infrastructure and for indoor spaces that means small cells. A small cell system would consist of a network of small powered antennas and nodes that can give as much coverage and capacity as a tower with a few technology caveats. The signals that small cells emit communicate wirelessly through radio waves and then send signals to the internet and phone systems. Because they are connected with fiber cables they are able to process immense amounts of data at lightning-fast speeds.

This has created a new opportunity for building owners and operators as tenants expect to be “always-on” in an increasingly connected world. Promised strong data coverage coupled with strong data capacity is just another way that landlords can charge a premium per square foot for their building leases. But this is no easy feat as data usage is designed for outdoor use and signals only weaken as they are forced to pass through facades and interior partition walls. Even more so more than 90 percent of cell phone calls originate from inside creating a need for a solution that can support connectivity as users move around and between spaces.

While there’s a range of solutions that have come on to the market in the last decade many landlords are agreeing that this can be a major differentiator when a tenant is considering a 10-year commercial office lease or when a hotel guest is checking out and debating whether they’ll ever book another night. Solutions for buildings range based on the total square feet due to the need for technology to be flexible to support the infrastructure that a building itself requires. Ideally the infrastructure for the small cells should be a single backbone that can support multiple commercial cellular networks.

So what does it take to install a small cell on a property? First building owners will need to obtain a permit to comply with federal state and local ordinances that will allow for the installation of the small cells. It’s also important to consider a building’s aesthetics and how to maintain its design integrity when selecting a location to install small cells in a way that will allow them to blend in with the existing structure. Small cells should be located on the exterior of buildings and are most commonly placed around existing antennae and other building infrastructure found in the mechanical areas on roofs. The average small cell is about the size of a pizza box allowing them to be easily located almost anywhere.

The number of cells per building depends on the density of where it’s located. Crown Castle’s SVP of sales and Chief Commercial Officer Mike Kavanaugh recently said in an interview that while some areas like tier 2 markets only require 2 to 4 small cells per mile some more urban cities might need 7 to 12 cells per mile. This number may even continue to grow as more advanced 5G networks come online in the coming years. Not only do the building’s tenants themselves benefit but it also increases broadband in the general area with the ability to extend with a radius of about 100 yards or the length of a football field. Most small cells operate on a shared model meaning that their network is designed so that multiple carriers can use it creating a highly accessible network.

Building owners themselves are not responsible for the installation but instead can be installed through third-party vendors such as Crown Castle Corning Nokia and Samsung who will both provide the technology identify ideal locations for smart cells install them and also assist with maintenance and upkeep. The average cost to install a small cell is between $35000 and $65000 depending on the location and the type of cell that is installed.

Small cell coverage is quickly becoming a standard requirement for tenants in high-density areas. As we continue to increase our global connectivity being online any time and anywhere has become more important than ever. In the not-so-distant future you may not need to press your phone against the window in hopes of picking up an additional bar of cellphone service because the smart cells in your building may be providing you with the highest data speeds on the market. Dead zones in buildings may soon be a thing of the past all thanks to small cell technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amtrak is seeking to resume passenger service along a Gulf Coast route between New Orleans and Mobile Ala. (Photo for The Washington Post by Emily Kask)

Months after Washington approved billions to significantly expand Amtrak's footprint across the country an early attempt at growth has reached an impasse in a test case that could define the American rail network for a generation.

The escalating clash is playing out on the Gulf Coast where Amtrak wants to restore service 17 years after Hurricane Katrina flooded the region's rail infrastructure. Amid fanfare over federal money as a president nicknamed ""Amtrak Joe"" watches from the White House the passenger rail and the freight railroads that control the tracks are in mediation to resolve disputes over Amtrak's proposed service levels.

At the core of the conflict is a mandate that requires freight railroads to give passenger trains access to rail track and preference over other rail traffic. A federal board is weighing the fate of Gulf Coast passenger service in a triallike process pitting Amtrak against freight railroads. Because Amtrak operates mostly on tracks owned by others the case could set precedent as the passenger railroad embarks on a $75 billion expansion with bipartisan support.

""This is the bellwether case for the expansion of any passenger rail in this country"" said John Robert Smith chairman of the policy organization Transportation for America. ""If the freights manage to kill this proposed service it will send a chill through the rest of the nation aspiring for passenger rail.""

Amtrak's plan for the 140-mile from New Orleans to Mobile Ala. is one of 39 new routes the railroad is pursuing as part of its plan announced last year to reach dozens more cities and towns. The aspirations coincide with Washington's priorities for more rail and alternate modes of transportation supported by the bipartisan infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed last year. The measure includes $66 billion for the nation's ailing rail network.

But any expansion in Amtrak's territory which has remained nearly unchanged during its five decades would boost pressure on freight companies and add trains to shared tracks at a time when the industry is under scrutiny over supply chain disruptions.

""We figured out the money piece"" said Amtrak chief executive Stephen J. Gardner. ""We've solved one-half of the problem and now that puts sort of the spotlight on this relationship with the [host railroads] and how do we find a productive path forward.""

Amtrak's federal aid lessens the financial barriers to launching new train service abating Amtrak's biggest impediment to growth. Negotiating track access is the next hurdle.

- - -

Outside its busy Northeast Corridor Amtrak mostly operates on tracks owned by private railroads. Under federal law it pays the companies to use the tracks -- a sum that according to Amtrak totaled $135 million last fiscal year. The arrangement dates to 1970 when Congress created Amtrak relieving private railroads from their obligation at the time to provide intercity passenger rail service.

Fifty-two years later tension continues to plague that tenant-owner relationship. Amtrak argues the railroads disregard preference for passenger trains saying freight trains caused nearly 900000 minutes of passenger delays last year. The freight industry has countered over the years that Amtrak oversteps its authority.

The two sides occasionally strike accords on service increases and new routes. Some agreements have been transformative as in Virginia where Amtrak and CSX partnered with the state last year on a $3.7 billion rail expansion.

But along the Gulf Coast six years of talks have led nowhere. The Southern Rail Commission -- a panel of state-appointed members from Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama -- has pushed for a decade to bring trains back helping to secure $66 million for improvements. The federal government in 2015 convened a group to evaluate the restoration of service bringing together railroads and the three states that would be served by the line.

Negotiations stalled as Amtrak introduced a service plan that was different than before Katrina with more trains using the corridor during peak hours. The two sides couldn't agree on the capital investment needed to restore service: The Federal Railroad Administration estimated the price tag at $118 million while CSX said it would take $440 million.

CSX which owns most of the track between New Orleans and Mobile said it wouldn't oppose Amtrak resuming pre-Katrina service when long-distance trains arrived overnight three times a week. But the company says more study is needed before Amtrak brings two daily round trips between the port cities including stops in the Mississippi cities of Bay St. Louis Gulfport Biloxi and Pascagoula.

CSX said eight to 10 freight trains traverse the full route daily while other local trains and mechanical equipment use stretches of the line. Officials with the Port of Mobile the city of Mobile and Alabama have raised objections to Amtrak's proposal citing possible effects to the port which city leaders say moves more than 58 million tons of cargo annually.

But Amtrak calls the rail ""a lightly used mainline"" that is far less complicated than Amtrak's Washington-to-Boston tracks which handle about 2200 trains daily.

""Most of the route [in the Gulf Coast] is single track but so is the vast majority of Amtrak's route network"" Gardner said to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) in February. ""Yes it has drawbridges but not as many per mile as Amtrak's Northeast Corridor in Connecticut. Yet somehow we still accommodate 68 trains a day over that route.""

Because the railroads have not agreed to give Amtrak access federal statute tasks the STB an independent federal agency that regulates freight rail with determining whether more passenger trains would ""impair unreasonably freight transportation.""

The Biden administration has taken a prominent seat at pushing Amtrak's petition saying a resolution along the Gulf Coast is key to the future development of intercity passenger rail across the nation. At stake it says is Americans' access to adequate transportation.

""Service delayed is service denied"" Amit Bose head of the Federal Railroad Administration said in February while urging the panel to ensure the ""railroads fulfill their fundamental statutory obligations to allow the expansion and improvement of intercity passenger rail services.""

In a May letter to the STB John E. Putnam acting general counsel at the Transportation Department said efforts such as restoring Gulf Coast rail passenger service are critical to the administration's transportation goals of ""combating climate change ensuring equity in personal mobility and driving economic growth and vitality.""

""Unfortunately despite an extended period of examination and the investment of significant funds Amtrak has been unable to obtain the agreement of the host freight railroads and there is no clear or imminent path to the restoration of this service absent the Board's intercession"" Putnam wrote.

Support for Amtrak is widespread in Louisiana -- home to a terminus stop in New Orleans -- and across Mississippi where four of the six stations would be located. Local officials tout the return of Amtrak as an economic asset to boost tourism and an alternative to traffic-clogged highways.

Alabama leaders however say their port shippers and freight customers would suffer from disruptions to a tightly managed schedule of freight trains. Alabama House leader Mac McCutcheon (R) told the STB he is also concerned the state might have to foot the cost of Amtrak's passenger operations.

The office of Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson declined to comment for this story.

In testimony to the STB Stimpson said it would be premature to grant Amtrak's petition without more study and infrastructure improvements warning that ""any action that stands in the way of the continued efficient and productive operation of the Port of Mobile must be treated with microscopic scrutiny.""

The dispute has sent shock waves among rail advocates where supporters of intercity train service and local leaders who want Amtrak in their communities fear the Gulf Coast dispute could translate into freight companies rejecting passenger rail proposals. Several mayors have made pleas before the board on Amtrak's behalf.

""People literally stop me on the street and tell me how excited they are that we might get passenger rail here in Madison"" Satya Rhodes-Conway mayor of the Wisconsin city said in testimony to the board. ""However our ability to implement Amtrak service here would be imperiled by the precedent set in this decision.""

In the meantime Amtrak is still easing into other markets. Trains will return to Burlington Vt. in July for the first time since 1953. Plans are advancing for more trains between Washington and Virginia's Norfolk and Roanoke areas using tracks owned by CSX and Norfolk Southern. Amtrak is also negotiating with Canadian Pacific to add service between Chicago Milwaukee and the Minneapolis area.

But back on the Gulf Coast the STB in June ordered mediation eventually giving Amtrak CSX and Norfolk Southern a month to reach a settlement after the process begins. The five-member panel has listened to more than 80 hours of sworn testimony examination and cross examination since February. More hearings are expected this summer as the railroads file evidence by a July 13 deadline.

Board members have questioned the transparency of Amtrak and the railroads while admonishing their lack of candor with each other.

""Part of me wants to say both sides should lose but that's really not possible"" Board Chairman Martin J. Oberman said in May. ""I can't make you play nice but I think it would be much more productive if you did.""

In Bay St. Louis a city of white sand beaches an hour east of New Orleans a century-old train depot across from shops and restaurants has been restored to include a Mardi Gras museum. Still missing are the passengers.

In 2005 Hurricane Katrina brought down homes and buildings piers and the marina. As the city recovered a new harbor and a $19 million sea wall were built a decade ago. Antique shops art galleries and restaurants popped up in downtown. The train depot is now the visitor's welcome center and a space for city festivals and events.

""We built back better"" said Nikki Moon a longtime resident of Bay St. Louis whose home and business were destroyed during Katrina. She said the city's comeback is missing an important piece: trains.

""Having this train would show that there is a lot for people to come and see a lot for them to enjoy in the bay"" said Moon a retired innkeeper and regional tourism leader. ""Amtrak coming in would be a game changer for our town and I believe for the entire coast.""

Bay St. Louis population about 10000 relies heavily on tourism. Its small-town feel has been a draw for urbanites in the South fueling growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

City officials say tourists arriving in cruise ships in New Orleans or Mobile could hop on a train to visit the Mississippi coast's beaches and casinos. Nondriving visitors including the international tourists who come to New Orleans would be able to plan a day trip or an overnight stay.

In a corridor where flying between New Orleans and Mobile requires a layover in Atlanta transportation advocates say a three-hour train ride would be competitive with driving.

Amtrak's pre-Katrina service did not offer that choice during daylight hours. The route was so long -- from Florida to California -- that the train arrived in Mississippi during the overnight hours. Proponents say the shorter route during daylight would give roughly 2 million nearby residents an option to commute by train while offering more reliable and frequent service.

""When a train comes through in the middle of the night three days a week people don't really buy into it"" said Kay Kell a member of the Southern Rail Commission. ""This is an area that has been unserved for quite a while and we know a large population would use the train.""

- - -

Regardless of whether an agreement between Amtrak and freight railroads is reached through mediation the board could deliver a verdict by the end of summer. Some railroad experts say the case highlights a growing hostility.

""Reasonable people should be able to come to an agreement"" said Robert VanderClute a private consultant who spent 26 years working at Amtrak. ""Collaboration is critical and we had it at one point. I don't know where it went astray.""

Amtrak set up cameras along the route as hearings were carried out this spring live-streaming empty tracks and birds singing in the background under the title ""CSX's Very Busy Gulf Coast Corridor.""

Days earlier Amtrak had argued that freight companies wanted unreasonable investments from the passenger rail and for taxpayers to subsidize infrastructure for the benefit of their shareholders. CSX and Norfolk Southern leaders blasted Amtrak as trying to force itself onto their rails without consideration for the effects on freight customers.

The case is about more than a New Orleans-to-Mobile passenger route CSX president and chief executive James M. Foote said at an STB hearing.

""It's about a new national agenda and Amtrak's desire to change the law and create a new road map proposing new passenger service without working with most carriers or local communities to first add necessary capacity"" he said.

Amtrak's Gardner said the case represents a turning point for American passenger rail. Amtrak's network today he said is smaller than in 1971 even as the nation added 120 million people.

""We need to serve more places serve more people with more trains"" he said. ""We can't let -- as in the case of the Gulf Coast -- years and years go by where the public's will and where the federal government's investment is stymied.""

GLENDALE Ky. — Authorities say some roads in Glendale will be closed as crews work to cleanup the aftermath of a collision between a train and a semi-truck Saturday morning.

According to Hardin County Sheriff John Ward the semi-truck's trailer had gotten stuck on the tracks that cross over Kentucky Highway 222.

The driver of the semi contacted police Ward said and Hardin County Dispatch let freight transportation company CSX know the crossing was blocked.

The train's operator attempted to come to a full stop but was only able to slow the train down a little before colliding with the semi's trailer.

""If it had hit it full speed it could have been a mess"" Ward said.

Ward says the train then dragged the semi-truck and trailer down the tracks a short distance before coming to a stop. In the process the crossing gates over Highway 222 were damaged.

No injuries were reported but some residents' cars were damaged along the tracks as the train and semi continued to move after the collision.

New Glendale Road will be closed today as crews unbuckle some of the train's cars and a secondary engine comes to remove those cars Ward said. He added that although the train didn't derail some of the wheels did come off the track so CSX will need to bring in heavy machinery to lift it back up.

The sheriff's office posted the incident on Facebook advising residents to avoid the area as crews work.

Ward says the train crossing over Highway 222 will remain closed for a few days as crews repair the crossing gates that had been damaged.

Caution: Road work ahead -- and probably a few traffic headaches too.

CSX Railroad will have busy Woodbourne Road in Middletown closed during the week through Saturday night for railroad crossing replacement according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

During the 24/7 closure Woodbourne Road motorists will be directed to use Route 213 (Maple Avenue) Route 413 (Pine Street) Winchester Avenue and Langhorne Yardley Road. Local access will be maintained up to the construction zone.

CSX Railroad will complete this project under a PennDOT Highway Occupancy Permit.

Monday morning motorists were met with backups and delays as they worked their way around the closure.

In addition Woodbourne Road is scheduled to be closed between Yardley Road and Wood Lane from Monday July 11 through Friday July 15 from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. each day for resurfacing operations PennDOT said.

During the closure Woodbourne Road motorists will be directed to use Langhorne Yardley Road and Wood Lane. Local access will be maintained officials said.

Northbound Route 1 will be reduced to a single lane on Monday July 11 through Friday July 15 from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. between Old Lincoln Highway and the Neshaminy Exit in Bensalem for construction activities PennDOT said.

Crews will be removing construction barrier and completing other activities for a final traffic shift of northbound vehicles onto the reconstructed and widened northbound side of Route 1.

In addition southbound Old Lincoln Highway will be closed for approximately two months beginning Monday July 18 from the ramp to southbound Route 1 to Bristol Road in Middletown for reconstruction. Motorists will be detoured south on Route 1 exit at the Neshaminy Interchange then turn right onto Rockhill Drive to access Old Lincoln Highway.

The work is part of the major overhaul PennDOT has been working on for the past couple years. PennDOT is reconstructing and widening almost three miles of Route 1 improving the interchanges and constructing several new bridges — including new structures over the Neshaminy Creek and over rail lines near the Penndel exit— under two contracts to rebuild widen and improve the busy road.

The second $111.5 million phases will be completed by mid-2026 according to PennDOT. The first section of the project which cost $95 million is expected to be finished this summer.

CMI,Cummins,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIyL2p1bC8wOS96ZW5pdGgtY2hpZWYtZXhlY3V0aXZlLW5hdGFsaWUtY3VtbWlucy1nZXR0aW5nLWFoZWFkLWZsZXhpYmx50gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMjIvanVsLzA5L3plbml0aC1jaGllZi1leGVjdXRpdmUtbmF0YWxpZS1jdW1taW5zLWdldHRpbmctYWhlYWQtZmxleGlibHk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zenith chief executive Natalie Cummins: getting ahead flexibly,"Brightly coloured printouts cover the walls in a meeting room at Zenith UK’s London headquarters left behind from preparation for the previous week’s pitch which saw the media agency battle it out against two rivals to win the business of a fast-food client.

Now the wait is on laughs its chief executive Natalie Cummins: “We now have a week or two of agonising over the follow-up communications and trying to read into anything they say to you so you can endlessly speculate.”

She is hoping the company will become the 84th client at Zenith joining what she calls an “eclectic mix” that ranges from young upstarts such as social media app TikTok to more traditional companies such as Reckitt Benckiser maker of Dettol and Durex.

If you’ve seen an advert on television in the pages of the newspapers or on a billboard for companies including Lloyds Bank Carpetright or Nestlé Zenith will have played a major role in getting it in front of your eyeballs.

Cummins has led the media agency – part of the French advertising giant Publicis – since 2018 helping it achieve £418m of billings last year alone according to Nielsen’s annual league table. Those figures are all the more impressive given she has juggled her role with being a lone parent to three children under 13 a factor that influenced her company’s full embrace of flexible working even before the pandemic.

So what exactly does Zenith do? “We plan and buy advertising on behalf of major clients” says Cummins sitting in its offices in the fashionable building in White City that was once BBC Television Centre. “I say planning and buying because you can’t just go out and buy a load of stuff: you have to work out what you are trying to do with this ad. Are you trying to get young people to reappraise the brand or are you trying to get everyone to know there is a new orange version of such and such?”

While creative agencies make the actual adverts media companies such as Zenith handle a client’s whole media budget “which is much much much bigger than what it cost to make the ad”. As little as 2% of a company’s budget could go on the creation of an advert Cummins says. “The rest of it is what we do.”

A clear and direct communicator Cummins talks enthusiastically about the media buying industry – where she has spent her entire career nearly all of it at Zenith – which she says is “so much fun”.

Best advice she has been given “Be good at something that’s not just your job” – wise words from a former boss. Cummins adds that it’s important to “be good at something and have a skill not everyone has”.

Biggest career mistake “For a year I worked at a creative agency. I could have sat at home watching telly for all I learned. It was a good agency but I should have stayed in my lane.”

Words she overuses “‘Ace’ and ‘what’s the grabber?’ when doing a pitch. It’s the opening slide that allows you to talk about the theme in a more abstract way.”

How she relaxes “Trash novels” by authors such as Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper. She also goes for a daily run and watches Love Island.

The agency was launched in 1988 as the media arm of advertising heavyweight Saatchi & Saatchi in London. It merged with Optimedia following Publicis’s acquisition of its parent in 2000 and relaunched as Zenith in 2016.

In a world often dominated by suits the 47-year-old stands out in her bright yellow polo shirt dark shorts and sandals. And as adverts go Cummins herself is an inspiring example of career progression.

She joined Zenith fresh from Cambridge University – she was the first person from her south-east London comprehensive to win a place – and within two decades had worked her way up from planning team assistant to the top job.

Cummins had been chief executive for less than a year when the pandemic took hold throwing the whole economy into a tailspin. Now rising inflation is fuelling fears about the economic outlook. Despite this Zenith remains positive and recently forecast that the ad market would remain strong this year in the UK and beyond: it predicts growth of 8% despite the economic headwinds and cost of living crisis.

Late last year under Cummins’s leadership Zenith made waves when it won the Lloyds Banking Group account from larger competitor MediaCom. This was a significant win for the “small team” behind Zenith’s pitch and Cummins’s proudest moment at the company: advertising insiders report that Lloyds – the UK’s largest mortgage lender – invests about £80m per year on media while its annual report shows it spent £161m on advertising and promotion in 2021.

If going for a run is your thing and it makes sense for you to do that at 11am not 12:30pm just do that Natalie Cummins

When Covid hit Cummins and the rest of her 550-strong workforce had to switch like most of the nation’s office-based employees to working from home. But this was less of an upheaval for Zenith and other Publicis companies than it might have been as they had already launched a flexible working model in 2018.

“We used to talk about work-life balance and we started to talk about work-life blend” Cummins says. “Actually you should mesh the two things around each other.”

Many suggestions about how to implement these sweeping changes – which included no set days in the office – came from a panel of the business’s rising stars. One of their main suggestions was for all staff to be given a laptop to enable remote working. These decisions paid dividends during the pandemic.

Cummins adds: “It felt ridiculous even in 2018 to be saying you can do things that help your mental and physical health only at certain times. If going for a run is your thing and it makes most sense for you to do that at 11am not 12.30pm just do that.”

Zenith says this flexibility has been well received resulting in a churn rate – the proportion of workers who decide to leave – that is lower than the industry average.

Since becoming boss Cummins has been a vocal advocate for the importance of workplace flexibility as a lone parent to two sons and a daughter. “I know what it’s like to be juggling loads of things: if you’ve got parents’ evening or an assembly and your daughter really wants you to be there. If I’m not there no one’s there so for me it’s really important that I have that balance.”

“It’s not just about kids” Cummins adds. “Everyone has shit going on and people generally do their jobs better if they are not feeling under shitloads of stress all the time. That’s just a fact.”

Cummins’s approach is far from second nature to many chief executives or indeed many employers but she sees it as a “no-brainer”. “If you help people find ways to make life better they are probably going to be happier at work and be better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcmV0LmNvbS91dGFoLzIwMjIvNy85LzIzMTg0OTYzL3V0YWhzLWFib3J0aW9uLWJhbi1pbXBhY3Qtb2JneW4tc2hvcnRhZ2UtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1vZi11dGFoLXJvZS12LXdhZGUtdHJpZ2dlci1sYXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah's abortion ban could decrease the number of OB-GYNs who study work in the state,"Heather Cummins a University of Utah medical student is photographed at the U. hospital in Salt Lake City on Wednesday July 6 2022. With new abortion restrictions in Utah comes concern about how it will affect training for OB-GYNs and how many will ultimately choose to practice in the state.

With new abortion restrictions in Utah comes concern about how it will affect training for OB-GYNs and how many will ultimately choose to practice in the state.

University of Utah Health has one of the top OB-GYN residency programs in the West with Doximity an online network of medical professionals ranking it third in reputation.

But Utah’s abortion law will put the university’s OB-GYN residency program “in jeopardy” said David Turok professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the U. and licensed OB-GYN.

“We’ve had an incredible program for a very long time” Turok said.

According to Turok medical students wanting to pursue a career in the field want to get experience with the full range of training and care and “when there are limitations placed on that the volume and the quality of the resident applicants diminishes.”

Attracting and retaining residents factors into how many physicians practice in the state as 55% of residents remain where they did their training according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.

OB-GYNs are particularly in demand in Utah which has the fifth-highest fertility rate in the country with 64.1 births per 1000 women ages 15 to 44. Compared to other cities in the country Salt Lake City is at the second-highest risk for an OB-GYN shortage according to a study by Doximity.

OB-GYN residents need to be competent in abortion procedures Turok said because the same techniques and medications are used to treat nonviable pregnancies when a miscarriage happens.

“People have to learn how to safely evacuate a uterus” Turok said.

Forty-four percent of OB-GYN residency programs in the U.S. are in states that will or are likely to implement strict abortion laws Bloomberg Law reported.

When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24 a trigger law in Utah went into effect banning abortion with limited exceptions. The law was placed temporarily on hold ahead of a July 11 hearing after Planned Parenthood of Utah filed a lawsuit challenging it.

If the hold on the trigger law is lifted abortion in Utah will only be legal in cases of the mother’s life being at risk severe fetal abnormalities and rape and incest cases that have been reported to the police.

Texas provides an example of local abortion restriction deterring medical students from applying to OB-GYN residency programs Turok said. In September Texas passed a six week abortion ban which then discouraged some students from applying to OB-GYN residency programs in the state according to Fortune.

Heather Cummins a medical student at the University of Utah said she started medical school with dreams of completing an OB-GYN residency in Utah. Specifically Cummins said she had hopes of working for Planned Parenthood in Utah but now doesn’t know if her goals will “ever come to fruition.”

“It is absolutely concerning to have this trigger law in effect that limits a really important in my mind scope of practice for OB-GYN that allows them to practice every aspect of their training” Cummins said.

Accredited programs are required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to provide routine access to abortion training. Some students are allowed to opt out for religious or moral objections.

After the Supreme Court issued its ruling the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has proposed adjusting the requirement to require programs to provide access to training in a jurisdiction without legal restrictions on abortion.

Despite Utah state law Cummins said the OB-GYN residency program at the University of Utah is still one of her top picks. She said she is confident those leading the program are committed to ensuring residents are properly trained.

“What’s unfortunate is the fact that they have to go to such leaps and bounds to ensure (residents are trained)” Cummins said. “It just makes it harder. It puts more strain on the whole system.”

Turok said the department is working to get the residents the “absolute best and most comprehensive training that we can.”

That training may involve simulation and maximizing opportunities for residents to care for people experiencing miscarriages and nonviable pregnancies Turok said.

Courtney Kenyon a second-year medical student at the U. said the new law hasn’t deterred her from wanting to do her residency and eventually practice in Utah.

To her leaving Utah to practice elsewhere would mean “abandoning patients” in Utah who need medical professionals willing to advocate for them and their bodily autonomy.

She added leaving the state would only worsen the injustices she feels patients will be facing.

“The end goal of a career in medicine for me is not merely to perform procedures” Kenyon said. “It’s truly about improving people’s lives and helping them navigate through some of the most difficult and vulnerable moments of their lives regardless of the political landscape.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L3ZhdGljYW4tZGVmcm9ja3MtcHJpZXN0LXdoby1zY29sZGVkLW9ha2xhbmQtZGlvY2VzZS1vdmVyLXNleC1hYnVzZS_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXJjdXJ5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS92YXRpY2FuLWRlZnJvY2tzLXByaWVzdC13aG8tc2NvbGRlZC1vYWtsYW5kLWRpb2Nlc2Utb3Zlci1zZXgtYWJ1c2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vatican defrocks priest who scolded Oakland Diocese over sex abuse,"Tim Stier figured it was only a matter of time. Since 2005 he’s refused parish assignments as an Oakland Diocese priest over its handling of clerical sex abuse claims and spent more than a decade outside its cathedral on Sundays calling for church accountability and justice for the victims.

He had no plans to end his self-imposed exile and resume work as a parish priest. But when the Vatican finally came for his collar a few months ago removing him from the Roman Catholic priesthood Stier said it still felt like a blow.

“It hit me harder than I’d expected” said Stier 73 whose removal was disclosed this week. “I felt sad and angry. If I’d been raping kids I wouldn’t be thrown out of the club.”

The Diocese of Oakland said in a statement Friday only that “we wish Mr. Stier all the best in this new chapter of his life.”

But Stier as he has been for the last 17 years remains unsparing in his criticism of the diocese over the scandal that has rocked the Roman Catholic church locally and around the world since it first came to light in the 1980s and 1990s through criminal prosecutions of priests and lawsuits.

The scandal gained wider attention after a 2002 Boston Globe expose that led to criminal prosecutions of five priests won a Pulitzer Prize and was retold in the Academy Award-winning 2015 film “Spotlight.”

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2002 acknowledged the problem calling for the protection of children and young people and zero tolerance for sexual abuse.

But critics have since accused church leaders around the country of failing to fully account for their role in enabling abuse. A 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report found more than 300 priests had abused more than 1000 kids in six of the state’s eight Catholic dioceses. The report found church leaders “brushed aside” victims’ claims and “preferred to protect the abusers and their institution above all” by “concealing the truth.”

The report prompted similar probes in other states including California where it remains ongoing. It also led many dioceses including Oakland and San Jose to publish or expand their lists of credibly accused clergy.

Still critics including SNAP the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests and Stier who is close with that group’s leaders have said the dioceses’ disclosures were incomplete and failed to address bishops’ roles in perpetuating the abuse.

In his May 31 farewell letter to some 60 Oakland Diocese priests Stier wrote of his dismay that Oakland Bishop Michael C. Barber hasn’t held retired Bishop emeritus John S. Cummins accountable for his role in allegedly enabling the abuse by credibly accused priests the diocese has named.

Stier’s letter which he said only one priest responded to said Cummins bishop from 1977 to 2003 failed to prevent abuse by Vincent Breen Don Broderson James Clark George Francis Robert Ponciroli Gary Tollner and Stephen Kiesle. All eventually were taken out of ministry and Broderson Kiesle and Ponciroli were removed from the priesthood. Only Kiesle is still alive.

The diocese did not comment on Stier’s accusations and Cummins 93 could not be reached.

Stier whom Cummins ordained in 1978 had served at St. Bede in Hayward under Francis who died in 1998 and was accused of sexually abusing at least six kids. The diocese paid a $3 million settlement in 2004 to one of Francis’ victims whose father Stier knew.

Stier later served at St. John Vianney in Walnut Creek St. Raymond in Dublin and finally for 12 years at Corpus Christi in Fremont. He wasn’t shy there about confronting the sex abuse scandal at one point removing the name of Clark accused of abuse from 1971 to 1973 and who died in 1989 from the parish hall.

But Stier grew increasingly frustrated by what he felt was a church that was lowering its standards for priests to fill vacancies while refusing to reconsider policies and teachings he believes contribute to the problem – priestly celibacy refusal to ordain women and opposition to homosexuality.

The final straw Stier said was a 2004 meeting with Dan McNevin a former altar boy who said he’d been sexually abused by Clark. He later received part of a $56.4 million settlement with 56 accusers and is now SNAP’s treasurer. After a sabbatical Stier told then-bishop Allen H. Vigneron in 2005 that he could no longer serve as a parish priest.

Two years ago he said he received a notice from the diocese that the bishop wanted to remove him from the priesthood in a process known as laicization. He refused to cooperate and the diocese told him in May that the Vatican had laicized him March 19.

SNAP said in response that “when many in Oakland were silent about this ongoing problem Tim Stier chose not to be. In response he has been punished.”

Franky Mann | 12:20am BST 10 July 2022

Is there anything more exciting in cricket than fast bowlers? Sure batters that can hit for six are great but fast bowlers are truly breath-taking as they aim for the wicket. Fast bowling is an art form and it continues to evolve. The technique and style of fast bowlers continues to change with every new bowler that picks up the ball. The top bowlers each have their own style and technique making for exciting wickets.

The cricket world is talking about the upcoming ODI series featuring England South Africa and India this summer. Cricket bettors can bet on bet365 app and explore the latest odds and markets for the matches.

Cricket isn’t dominated by batsman as it is often believed. The fast bowlers on this list show just how important the art of bowling is. As the old cliche goes “good bowling will beat good batting any day of the week”.

1. Mitchell Starc 160.4 kph

Australian Mitchell Starc strikes fear in the hearts of batsman around the world. The left-hander holds the record as the current fastest bowler with an incredible 160.4 kph. He achieved that fantastic speed against New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor in 2015. Starc recently played in the 2021-22 Ashes Series and starred with the ball and bat for the Aussies.

2. Wahab Riaz 149.6 kph

Pakistan’s Wahab Riaz clocked in at 149.6 kph against India during a Champions Trophy Match at Edgbaston in 2011. Pakistan and India have one of cricket’s fiercest rivalries and it brought out the best in Riaz on the day. Riaz is also a left-headed bowler and can get some serious speed on the ball. The fast bowler currently plays for Peshawar Zalmi. Riaz has an average speed of 138.7 kph.

3. Pat Cummins 149.2 kph

Australia’s right-handed fast bowler Pat Cummings hit 149.2 kph with a delivery versus England at Edgbaston for a Champions Trophy match. It seems that the top speeds have all be achieved at the Champions Trophy at Egbaston. The 29-year-old has had a brilliant career playing in multiple tournaments around the globe. Cummins currently stars for the IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders.

4. Tymal Mills 149 kph

Veteran cricket Tymal Mills can fire a cricket ball with some velocity. Now 29 Mills set a bowling record at the age of 25 when he fired a ball at 149 kph. The left-hander has an average speed of 131.5 kph. Mills achieved his top speed of 149 kph versus India during a T20I fixture. Mills has played in tournaments across the world and currently plays for Sussex in English County Cricket.

5. Shannon Gabriel 148.2 kph

Right-handed fast bowler Shannon Gabriel is 34-years-old but he is still hurling the ball at fast speeds. Gabriel’s fastest delivery was 148.2 kph and he achieved the pace during Trinidad and Tobago’s third test match against Pakistan. Gabriel picked up two wickets in the same fixture. The right-handed fast bowler still plays for Trinidad and Tobago and is a major part of the international team thanks to his fast bowling. Gabriel has an average speed of 137.9 kph.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2F1c3RyYWxpYS10ZXN0LXNraXBwZXItY3VtbWlucy11cmdlcy1wZW9wbGUtZG9uYXRlLWNyaXNpcy1oaXQtc3JpLWxhbmthLTE1MDMwODg2MzguaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2F1c3RyYWxpYS10ZXN0LXNraXBwZXItY3VtbWlucy11cmdlcy1wZW9wbGUtZG9uYXRlLWNyaXNpcy1oaXQtc3JpLWxhbmthLTE1MDMwODg2MzguaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australia Test skipper Cummins urges people to donate to crisis-hit Sri Lanka,"Australia Test captain Pat Cummins on Saturday urged the world to donate wholeheartedly to Sri Lanka which is in the midst of a massive economic crisis.

The pace-bowling stalwart posted a video on social media and listed the hardships being faced by the island’s people many of whom are not able to get two square meals a day.

Cummins Unicef’s Australia ambassador who is in Sri Lanka playing a two-Test series tweeted “Sri Lanka is facing its worst humanitarian crisis in decades. I recently sat down with Kowsala and Sathuja (two local girls) in Sri Lanka to speak about their experience and learn more about what’s happening on the ground.”

“I have to say it’s an incredible country with fantastic people. However day to day life here in Sri Lanka is tough at the moment and children are at the very heart of it” said Cummins in a two-minute video on Saturday.

“I recently spoke to Kowsala and Sathuja who live here in Sri Lanka and are a part of Unicef’s Sport for Development Programme.”

The two girls narrated the hardships being faced by children in the country with many forced to skip school due to the fuel shortage.

“Due to the current economic and fuel crisis it’s been a challenge for us to go to the ground to engage fully with cricket. Because of the fuel crisis transportation is a problem now. It’s very difficult for use to get the bus” said Kowsala the captain of her school’s women’s cricket team.

“The teachers are travelling from far and away but due to the fuel crisis they aren’t coming to school regularly. Because of this we have been struggling to learn.

""He said 'Well I have to verify if you're on any contraceptives to prevent pregnancy.' ""

""The hell you do"" she recalled thinking.

Melissa who is in her early 40s and asked to be identified only by her first name for fear that speaking out might affect her livelihood then called her doctor who succeeded in having the pharmacy in the Southern U.S. state release the medicine.

""I picked it up a couple hours later but I felt violated"" she told AFP. She said that she'd had a hysterectomy six years ago and that her lack of recent contraceptive history might have led the pharmacist to suspect she was pregnant.

Consequence of court ruling

Stories of people facing similar struggles have come to light in the weeks since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade on June 24 highlighting an overlooked consequence of new state-level bans or severe restrictions on abortion.

It's not yet clear how widespread the cases are but national organizations including the Lupus Foundation of America and the American College of Rheumatology said they were aware of such concerns and were asking people affected to come forward.

""The Arthritis Foundation supports unencumbered access to and coverage of FDA-approved drugs for managing arthritis in alignment with scientific and clinical guidelines as well as evidence-based medical recommendations"" the organization said.

The issue centers on methotrexate a drug that tempers inflammation and is commonly used against autoimmune conditions including inflammatory arthritis psoriasis and lupus.

Methotrexate stops cell division and is given in higher doses as a cancer drug.

It can also sometimes be used in medical abortions though not as frequently as the Food and Drug Administration-approved combination of two other drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.

Nevertheless many states have passed laws carrying threats of legal action against health care workers and pharmacies providing methotrexate.

Another woman contacted by AFP a 20-year-old university student from Ohio said she has had a methotrexate prescription since 2020 to treat her lupus which affects her kidneys and liver and causes joint pain.

A pharmacist at a national chain told her they were ""no longer accepting prescriptions for methotrexate unless it was for the FDA-approved use of [treating] breast cancer or the patient was not presumably fertile"" she said.

She tried again without success to fill her prescription at a family-owned pharmacy and this week got a letter from her doctor's office stating the practice would no longer be prescribing methotrexate because of the number of patients having difficulty accessing it.

Though the first pharmacy later changed its position the experience left her ""annoyed and angry"" she said.

'Provider approval' needed

A third woman Jennifer Crow 48 a writer and produce gardener in Tellico Plains Tennessee told AFP she'd received an automated call from CVS Pharmacy saying her methotrexate refill had been declined ""pending provider approval.""

Crow said methotrexate had helped her enormously in managing her inflammatory arthritis allowing her to roll out of bed and get dressed without severe pain and walk without a cane for the first time in years.

Though her doctor was able to resolve the situation Crow who has also had a hysterectomy said she was worried for others with chronic illnesses who don't have the same access to resources that she does.

In statements to AFP national pharmacy chains CVS and Walmart confirmed they were working to adhere to new state regulations in light of the high court's decision to revoke the constitutional right to an abortion.

""We encourage providers to include their diagnosis on the prescriptions they write to help ensure patients have quick and easy access to medications"" CVS added.

Alisa Vidulich policy director of the Arthritis Foundation told AFP she was hopeful the situation might be remedied quickly as medical professionals and pharmacies developed new guidelines.

""But that may not actually be the case in all states and it may in fact turn into a longer-term issue"" she said.

Melissa the nurse said she was incensed at the double standard that allowed one of her best friends who is a man to get his methotrexate prescription filled right away with no questions asked.

""We're headed in the wrong direction and it's terrifying. I have two daughters. I don't want to see this"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9nd2VuLXN0ZWZhbmktc2hvd3Mtb2ZmLWhlci0xOTAxNTQ5OTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gwen Stefani Shows Off Her Signature Red Lipstick With a Black and White Checkered Coat and Nameplate Jewelry,"Gwen Stefani snapped a quick selfie to show off her signature bold red lip.

Abortion services are coming to an end in Texas but Texans still have access to a range of birth control and reproductive health care services through most health insurance plans and government-funded programs.

Access and confidentiality vary based on the type of birth control insurance and whether funding comes from the state or federal government. Here’s a rundown of how you can access birth control emergency contraception and other services.

Under the Affordable Care Act most health insurance plans must provide contraception options and family planning counseling at no out-of-pocket cost according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

This includes FDA-approved options prescribed by a doctor such as birth control pills vaginal rings implants like IUDs barrier methods sterilization procedures and emergency contraception like Plan B and Ella. You can learn more about contraception methods here.

However insurance providers may not cover all contraception options and brands especially if they are newer.

“Overall insurers needed to provide at least one method in a specific class of methods” said Kari White an associate professor of sociology and social work at the University of Texas at Austin and the lead investigator of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project which is a collaborative group of researchers who study the impact of contraception and abortion policy in the state.

Insurance providers are also not required to cover abortion-inducing medications or vasectomies for men.

Religious institutions like churches are exempt from the requirement to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraception and family planning counseling but you may still be able to access free services if your insurance plan is sponsored or arranged by a religious nonprofit such as a hospital or higher education institution. Private companies in which five or fewer people own more than half of the company can also object to covering contraception if it conflicts with the owners’ religious beliefs under a 2014 Supreme Court ruling in favor of retailer Hobby Lobby.

Read more about general health insurance coverage guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services here.

Most insurance plans are also required to cover preventive health services such as Pap tests breast and cervical cancer screenings prenatal care testing for sexually transmitted infections and screening and counseling for interpersonal violence.

Texas has more uninsured people than any other state and it’s the largest of a dozen states that have opted to not use additional federal funds to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income people. That left more than half a million Texans in a coverage gap because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private health insurance.

If you can’t access insurance through an employer or the federal marketplace you can get contraception and preventive services at government-funded clinics.

Clinics that receive funding through the federal Title X Family Planning Program offer contraception breast and cervical cancer screenings and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.

There are more than 175 Title X clinics across Texas according to Every Body Texas which oversees the federal grants in the state. The clinics are meant to help teens and people who can’t afford health care are uninsured or may not have a government-issued identification but White of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project said they are open to anyone.

Services for men and women are provided on a sliding scale based on income and may be free for people who fall under federal poverty guidelines she added. You can find Title X clinics on Every Body Texas’ website.

Texas also funds certain birth control methods and other preventive services for low-income women through two programs called Healthy Texas Women and the Family Planning Program.

Under the Healthy Texas Women program people can access birth control pills and other forms of contraception for free. The program is open to women in Texas between the ages of 15 to 44 years old who are not pregnant are U.S. citizens or qualified immigrants and meet low-income standards. A single person can earn only up to $2313 per month to qualify. Women under 18 must apply through a parent or guardian.

The state’s Family Planning Program offers similar free or low-cost services. It is open to men and women in Texas who are 64 or younger and who earn an income of up to 250% of the federal poverty guidelines for their household’s size. This year the maximum for a household of one person is $33975.

Under both state-run programs a person is granted services for a year unless their income or qualification status changes. The person can reapply for benefits if they still meet qualifications.

Some clinics work with both Title X and state funding so staff there can help you figure out under which program you may be covered White said.

Immigrants without legal status can receive care at Title X clinics and may qualify for Texas’ Family Planning Program.

Teens can access contraception without parental consent at Title X clinics and at other approved providers if they have Medicaid. But the nonprofit Jane’s Due Process which runs a helpline for teen reproductive care warns Medicaid may send an explanation of benefits or follow-up letter to your address so it may not be completely confidential.

Texas is one of just two states that does not cover birth control at all — with or without parental consent — on the state-run Children’s Health Insurance Program.



Texas also bars people from using Medicaid to pay for services outside of abortion like birth control at clinics associated with abortion services such as Planned Parenthood. This also applies to women covered under the Healthy Texas Women program White said. But it is unclear how this restriction will apply if these providers stop providing abortions she added. Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas did not immediately respond to a request for comment but its website still says Texans who rely on Medicaid plans are blocked from seeking care at its health centers.



The restriction does not comply with federal Medicaid guidelines White said but Texas spent about a decade fighting to remove Planned Parenthood from any state-funded programs. By 2014 82 family planning clinics in Texas had shuttered and only a third were from Planned Parenthood.



People with commercial insurance can access birth control and other services through abortion providers like Planned Parenthood and Whole Woman’s Health if they are in their insurer’s network White said. People can also opt to pay out of pocket and some providers may have philanthropic support to serve people who can’t afford to pay she said.



Through the Planned Parenthood Direct mobile app people can also order birth control and emergency contraception. But for those 17 and younger it would require parental consent in Texas White said.



How can I get emergency contraception?



Plan B which can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex if taken within 72 hours is available for anyone to buy over the counter. Pricing can range from about $17 to $50 without insurance depending on the brand and pharmacy. It must be prescribed by a doctor for it to be covered by insurance. Emergency contraception including Plan B may also be available through places that receive Title X funding such as clinics and local public health departments White said.



Ella another emergency contraception pill that works up to five days after sex requires a prescription but it can also be prescribed and ordered online through an online pharmacy according to the online resource Bedsider which is informed by medical professionals. This option is also more effective than Plan B for people over 165 pounds.

What are the options for vasectomies and tubal ligation?

Permanent forms of birth control like vasectomies for men and tubal ligation for women which is also known as getting one’s “tubes tied” can be options under Title X clinics and Texas’ Family Planning Program but they can be harder to obtain because they may require specialists outside of a clinic and some providers may not take lower reimbursements from government programs White said.

“So it can be difficult for health care providers to work with an outside agency like an ambulatory surgical center or hospital to pay for that procedure” she said.

Some commercial insurers may cover only part of the cost for a vasectomy or require patients to first pay a deductible White added.

Are there any other resources?

The nonprofit Jane’s Due Process has guides to teen access to birth control and runs a hotline that teens can call if they run into issues navigating clinics and providers. You can call or text (866) 999-5263. The nonprofit also has a list of organizations that provide free emergency contraception in Texas.

Bedsider offers guides informed by medical professionals on birth control and other reproductive health topics.

NPR’s Life Kit podcast has episodes and online guides on finding the right birth control for you how to know when you’re ready to have kids and on navigating reproductive health care after the reversal of Roe v. Wade.

The casual dining restaurant chain known for its unlimited soup salad and breadsticks has its sights set on 1585 N. State St. in Greenfield where Ponderosa Steakhouse operated up until two years ago.

Greg Tuzzio director of operations for Olive Garden who runs 10 other locations in the area said the plan is to demolish the former Ponderosa structure and build anew.

“Our new Olive Gardens are beautiful farmhouses” Tuzzio said. “They’re really nice.”

He said the eatery is drawn to Greenfield for its growth in recent years and a desire to give residents in and around the city a closer option than the otherwise nearest opportunities on East Washington Street and in Castleton in Indianapolis.

“For one Greenfield’s growing but the other thing too is that it’s such a great brand we want to be able to expand it to areas that may have a further drive to get to Olive Garden” Tuzzio said.

The local board of the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission approved an alcoholic beverage permit for the restaurant on Thursday.

The new restaurant is expected to employ between 100 to 125 depending on the size of the building Tuzzio said adding the 10 other locations he oversees all employ over 100.

“Although staffing’s tough” he said during Thursday’s hearing over the alcoholic beverage permit referring to the widespread struggles businesses have been facing to secure workers since the COVID-19 pandemic. “But we’ll get it. It’s everywhere.”

Joanie Fitzwater Greenfield planning director told the Daily Reporter in an email that the city is working with Olive Garden on preliminary design considerations for its building.

Ponderosa Steakhouse’s Greenfield location closed in July 2020 amid the immediate economic challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.

It won't deliver a filet mignon to you anytime soon

A lot of restaurants turned to delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic to make up for lost foot traffic. But if you want your food delivered from LongHorn steakhouse you're out of luck. Darden the parent company of the restaurant chain said on an earnings call in late 2022 that despite customer demand for delivery its decision to not offer it has been positive for the company. The Darden brands—including Olive Garden—don't offer any form of small-scale delivery and thus aren't susceptible to swings in delivery demand or the costs associated with it.

But your steak might be larger on your next visit

As the demand for steak grew after the pandemic LongHorn made an effort to increase steak sizes to compete with other chains. The chain has been investing in the quality of its food including increasing the size of its steaks. ""Consumers see the value in what we put on the plate"" said CEO Ricardo Cardenas in an analyst call in June of last year as reported by CNN. ""For every dollar they spend at a steakhouse they get more food.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

A select number of its employees are named ""Grill Master Legends""

Only 14 employees have ever earned the title of ""Grill Master Legend."" To gain the illustrious title a grill master needs to have grilled over one million steaks for the company. In 2022 Gayle Dudley who has worked for the chain for over 20 years earned the title plus a $5000 check and a special gold chef's coat that comes along with the honor.

The chain has hosted a hotline for Memorial Day grilling questions

For many years the chain ran a special hotline over Memorial Day weekend to kick off summer. Fans could call a special hotline text or ask a question on Facebook and be connected to a grill master that would help answer burning steak cooking questions. Hopefully it returns again this year!

The founder also started another meaty restaurant

After moving on from LongHorn founder George McKerrow partnered with media mogul Ted Turner to launch Ted's Montana Grill. The focus of Ted's isn't beef but bison with an emphasis on sustainability. McKerrow admitted he found it ""ironic"" that serving diners bison—a species that had once been hovering on the brink of extinction—had ""actually increased the population several-fold and we've done so sustainably"" according to Mashed.

You can get a free appetizer for your email

If you join the Longhorn Steakhouse Email Club you can get a free appetizer like steakhouse wings with the purchase of a meal the next time you go. You'll get regular emails from the restaurant with other deals as well (like a free dessert on your birthday!).

Your steak is never frozen

If you thought you were getting a frozen hunk of meat you're wrong according to a LongHorn cook who explained ""We actually do not freeze our meat. It's all kept in the walk-in fridge. It gets hand-cut every morning and placed on a rack covered with wrap."" Why is this important? Frozen steak contains ice crystals which will make the steak less juicy when cooked.

The company is being sued for underpaying employees

In not great news according to ClassAction.org LongHorn Steakhouse was accused of underpaying their tipped staff (meaning servers and bartenders) by having them perform tasks outside of their job description—work they should have been paid a higher wage for as they weren't earning tips. A class-action suit is pending.

You can save money at lunch

Many Longhorns are open for lunch and they have a pretty similar menu (albeit with smaller portions) at lower prices during lunchtime. If you're on a budget and want a steakhouse treat head over at lunch for great deals and shorter lines.

The menu is low-carb and keto-friendly

All of LongHorn's nutritional information is available on its website and it includes carb counts so you can easily plan a low-carb meal. Some ideas include chicken wings without blue cheese dressing just about any of its fire-grilled steaks and a side salad (hold the croutons) or a veggie side with cheese. Yum!

Seven months after a Florida man jumped into a Panhandle swamp to avoid being arrested he was taken into custody after trying to outrun law enforcement on a riding lawnmower.

In January deputies met up with Dusty Mobley 40 of Holt along the Yellow River to serve warrants and talk with him about a $40000 stolen boat according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office.

Investigators say Mobley had used heavy machinery cutting a hole in a metal building to steal the vessel from a business in Baker Florida.

Deputies say that Mobley was on the stolen boat when they arrived but he dove off the side and disappeared into the swamp to avoid going to jail.

Plus: WNBA viewership is up slightly at the All-Star break; the PGA Tour John Deere Classic hit a viewership high; and more.

NHL Draft hits high in debut on ESPN flagship

Thursday’s first round of the NHL Draft averaged 457000 viewers on ESPN peaking at 673000 — up 70% from last year on ESPN2 and the largest audience for the event on record (dates back to 1994). This year marked the first time that the Draft has aired on the flagship ESPN network. During the NBCSN era the high water mark was 374000 in 2016. Draft coverage ranked third for the day among ESPN programs behind the Wimbledon women’s semifinals (533K) and “Pardon the Interruption” (484K) and ahead of its NBA Summer League lead-out (Rockets-Magic: 248K).

WNBA viewership sees uptick at All-Star break

Entering the All-Star break WNBA games have averaged 317000 viewers across the ESPN family of networks — up 5% from the same point last season. Last Sunday’s Washington-Connecticut game averaged 392000 viewers on ESPN the most-watched game of the season on cable and the network’s most-watched regular season game in two years. ESPN also drew 305000 for Phoenix-Chicago the previous day and 285000 for Phoenix-Los Angeles on Monday.

PGA Tour John Deere Classic hits high

Final round coverage of the PGA Tour John Deere Classic averaged a 1.2 rating and 1.91 million viewers on CBS last Sunday peaking at 2.50 million — up 23% in ratings and 25% in viewership from last year and the largest audience for the tournament since 2015 (3.37M). The tournament was not played two years ago but the replacement event at Muirfield Village was considerably higher at a 1.7 and 2.52 million. Third round action the previous day drew a 1.0 and 1.53 million the best for third round coverage of the event since ’15 (1.2 1.70M).

Plus: Hot Dog contest MLB SRX IndyCar

Taped coverage of the annual Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest averaged 1.03 million viewers on ESPN Monday down double-digits from last year when coverage aired live (1.35M pending revision). … Last weekend’s editions of MLB on FOX (1.1 1.89M) and ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball (Cardinals-Phillies: 0.7 1.22M) declined from last year when both windows featured the Mets-Yankees “Subway Series.” In other action TBS chipped in 267000 viewers for Rays-Red Sox this past Tuesday and FS1 405000 for a special Thursday night Padres-Dodgers game June 30. … Last weekend’s edition of the SRX racing series on CBS averaged a 0.6 rating and 975000 viewers marking the third-straight race under the million viewer mark. All six races last season had at least one million. … IndyCar Series racing from Mid-Ohio drew a 0.6 and 877000 on NBC last Sunday down sharply from last year (0.9 1.30M).

He feels “restricted” when he does he says. We also found out that he’s heard a few stories about the now-mysterious Anthony Kim. Both played their college golf at Oklahoma.

If you’ve been following the pro game over the past month you also may know that Gotterup is flirting with the top of leaderboards. At the U.S. Open last month he tied for a respectable 43rd. A week later at the Travelers Championship Gotterup was eight spots better. Last week at the John Deere Classic he was better still tying for fourth. Of course if you know your college golf you’re maybe aware that he’s in familiar territory. At OU this past season he won both the Jack Nicklaus Award and the Haskins Award.

All of the details above are notable. As is this which may line him up for more success:

Gotterup can pop it. Like really really pop it.

“You know in talking to one of your assistant coaches Bill Allcorn he was talking to me a little bit about your game says if you want you can get it up to around 200 mph ball speed. True?” Subpar co-host Colt Knost asked Gotterup on the podcast.

“Yeah I’ve hit 200” Gotterup said.

“That’s fast” Subpar co-host Drew Stoltz said tongue-in-cheek. “That’s good good job.”

Indeed. For perspective the PGA Tour’s leader in ball speed Cameron Champ has a high of 194 mph this season. Knost then looked into another speed story.

“And he [Allcorn] said also you’ve cracked a 2-iron” Knost said. “I’ve heard of cracking drivers. Now you’ve cracked a 2-iron?”

“I just cracked one last week at the Open actually so TaylorMade had to build me a new one” Gotterup said. “Yeah the one I use they got the like I don’t know what it is like the Speed Foam or whatever and the face — I hit it so much that the face just kind of curves a little bit on me so when it starts getting really squirrelly I know it’s probably not me so if they start going left they’ve probably caved in.”

“How far does a 2-iron carry for you?” Knost said.

“Uh like 265 probably” Gotterup said.

That’s far. For perspective here that number would compete with the driving average of some of the shortest hitters on Tour.

Knost then wondered if Gotterup has “always since junior golf and everything just smashed it.”

“Yeah I used to have a crazy long swing like a little John Daly-esque like it would go down to my hip on the other side” he said. “So I’ve kind of always had speed and I played lacrosse for a while so that was kind of where I think my speed came from. Just kind of quick rips.

“And I think that’s kind of translated into golf and yeah I’ve always had speed but then once I started hitting the gym I got a little faster for sure.”

Delta flight 1073 had just left for Minneapolis when an issue with an engine happened. The flight landed safely back in Salt Lake City.

“It had some engine issues” said Nancy Volmer spokesperson for Salt Lake City International to KSL. “What those were I don’t know.”

On Saturday Delta Air Lines issued a statement regarding the incident.

“Delta flight 1073 from Salt Lake City to Minneapolis on Friday July 8 returned safely to Salt Lake City shortly after departure to address an engine performance issue with one of the engines” a statement from a Delta spokesman read. “While we apologize to our customers for the delay in their travels the safety of our customers and people remains Delta’s most important priority.”

The flight continued onto Minneapolis Saturday morning. Delta says that all the passengers were accommodated.

The answer was a disaster,"Can't answer the simplest questions? (A screenshot from a Delta ad.) A screenshot from a Delta ad

The airlines survived the latest holiday weekend likely better than some of their customers.

The airlines are almost getting bullish now.

Why Delta and United both insist that problems with flight delays are largely the fault of Air Traffic Control rather than say the fact that airlines let far too many competent people leave during the COVID-19 pandemic while they trousered billions of taxpayer dollars.

Now they're furiously hiring. The question some might ask is: who exactly is taking these airline jobs?

I only mutter the thought after seeing the angst of a Delta Air Lines passenger who tried to ask a simple question.

No it wasn't. ""Does my plane have a pilot today?"" It wasn't even ""Will my plane take off at some point today within ten hours of its scheduled time?""

It was merely this: ""Hi there. Please can you confirm whether or not Premium Select passengers at Heathrow have access to Fast Track security?""

FlightRadar24's Jason Rabinowitz asked the question and it's a question many business flyers might be asking as they hurtle through airports on the way to doing something important. Fast Track security saves time.

Rabinowitz posted his text exchange with Delta's customer service on Twitter. It's an exchange that flew swiftly sideways.

It started well though. Delta's customer service responded: ""Sure. I would be happy to do that; please allow me a few minutes to check.""

""OK"" replied Rabinowitz. But then came Delta's response.

""I am sorry but I am not sure about it. Could you please elaborate"" said the airline.

This is what you might call a warning sign. To whom are you talking? And perhaps most importantly how long has this person been working for the airline?

Rabinowitz was clearly patient. He explained: ""Sure. European airports have Fast Track security that comes with certain tickets. I am asking if Premium Select includes Fast Track security for use at Heathrow T3.""

Also: I always thought Delta was reliable. Then came these five disastrous flights

Delta had not prepared its cabin for landing. For the airline replied: ""I am sorry but this of things [sic] not come with Delta tickets.""

Was this a human? Was this a bot? Or was this just a complete mess?

Once Rabinowitz had posted the exchange to Twitter Delta tweeted a response with more coherence. Somewhat. It explained that sadly Premium Select passengers weren't availed of the Fast Track privilege.

Rabinowitz pointed out that the airline's website suggests something different. Delta promised it would report it so that it could be updated.

Yet Rabinowitz accurately expressed his frustration like this: ""I just want to know if I should expect a 20-minute wait for [sic] 3-hour wait for security and nobody can tell me for sure.""

That's one thing passengers wish they had from airlines right now. A certain certainty. For their part airlines certainly fail too often certainly apologize and certainly have their pilots picketing for a new contract.

For Delta customers what's saddest is that the airline was for so long known for its reliability -- something for which customers were prepared to pay more.

Now the airline looks the same as the rest.

It must be Air Traffic Control's fault right?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1sYXRhbS1kb3Qtam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS1jb25kaXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta & LATAM Accept All DOT Joint Venture Conditions,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1sYXRhbS1kb3Qtam9pbnQtdmVudHVyZS1jb25kaXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlybGluZS1waWxvdHMtcGF5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airline Pilots Seek Big Raises and Broader Changes (Published 2022),"Staffing shortages bad weather high fuel prices and runaway inflation — airlines face plenty of challenges as they seek to benefit from a strong travel rebound. But there’s at least one other complication in the mix: negotiating new pilot contracts.

Each of the nation’s largest carriers is in the process of trying to strike a deal with pilots. In some cases airlines appear ready to pay substantially higher wages with two major airlines recently offering to raise pay more than 14 percent in the next year and a half.

But money alone may not be enough. Pilot unions are also demanding changes that they say would improve operations and their members’ quality of life particularly as flight disruptions throughout the recovery have left pilots feeling frustrated and overworked.

They may be well positioned to get what they want industry analysts say. A brewing pilot shortage was worsened during the pandemic when airlines encouraged thousands of pilots and other workers to accept buyouts and early-retirement offers. Now with the industry hiring pilots at record numbers but struggling to attract train and retain them their unions are pushing hard for broader changes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvZGVsdGEtYWlybGluZXMtZW1wbG95ZWUtY3VzdG9tZXItaW50ZXJhY3Rpb24tZGViYXRlL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvZGVsdGEtYWlybGluZXMtZW1wbG95ZWUtY3VzdG9tZXItaW50ZXJhY3Rpb24tZGViYXRlLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Customer is NOT ALWAYS Right!!’: Passenger claims Delta employee ignored him when he asked for help—but viewers disagree,"A viral TikTok shows a customer’s interaction with a Delta employee claiming that the worker ignored him when he asked for help. He isn’t the only airline customer with gripes.

Ever since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic where airlines laid off or furloughed tons of employees it appears that the consumer flight industry has had a difficult time keeping promised flight itineraries leaving many customers frustrated and left scrambling to re-book travel plans and process their refunds in a satisfactory time frame.

2022 has seen a massive number of cancellations in spite of COVID-19 protocols being either severely decreased or almost entirely lifted. These cancellations have led to increased levels of stress on airline employees who must dedicate resources to assisting customers who’ve had their flights moved which then leads to longer wait times for other passengers and spikes in consumer dissatisfaction with airlines as a whole.

While many are facing issues with airlines the TikToker @travelTMZ sparked a debate about whether or not his interaction is an example of a valid customer gripe or someone attempting to gratuitously put an employee on blast.

The video received over 476000 views as of Sunday.

In the clip a Delta Airlines employee working at a computer is being recorded presumably not by the owner of the TikTok account as it appears to be a page that aggregates travel content from various sources. The caption for the video reads “Has Delta’s quality of service dropped?”

The customer says “You can keep ignoring me I already missed my flight.”

The airline employee then looks up from his computer seemingly surprised to see the customer. “Sir not at one point did you ask me for help” he claims.

“I did…and you were like oh there’s a screen up and you just ignored me” the customer responds. “You know I’m complaining here you just ignored me…I’m a priority member right.”

The Delta employee then grabs what appears to be a bagging ticket and stands up to hand over documentation to another passenger and affixes the ticket to their luggage. “Give me one sec” the employee says to the other customer.

“Funny how videos make you work” the person behind the camera says. The employee looks at him and then says “Oh I’m taking a break now boss” and then walks away.

TikTokers in the comments section of the video had a variety of different responses to the situation but almost everyone seemed to side with the Delta Airlines worker. Some thought that the employee was in the right and the way that the customer was addressing them was out of line.

“He was helping someone not playing a video game making something out of nothing” one viewer wrote.

“good for the employee! who cares if u are a priority member!” another said.

“I m taking a break boss employee of the month please” a third suggested.

“+1 to the Employee. He’s already helping someone” a fourth noted.

Others while acknowledging that traveling is stressful said that taking it out on employees is definitely not an option.

“Travel is stressful. Don’t take it out on the employees” a TikToker commented.

“The passenger thought they did something” another wrote.

Throughout the years there have been several pieces published about the “awfulness” of American consumers with entitled attitudes. In 1994 Tom Sorell published a piece in the Journal of Business Ethics titled “The Customer is Not Always Right” which “presents cases where deference to the consumer is variously unwarranted [and] cases that may prompt second thoughts about some kinds of consumerism.”

Other industries have also rallied against this “deferential” attitude towards abusive customers. Food & Wine published a piece with an identical title that states “restaurant workers are at a breaking point” when it comes to dealing with “customer entitlement.” The article quotes chef Angie Mar of The Beatrice Inn who says rude patrons expect to receive perfect service despite failing to show respect to workers. “We are expected to provide them with above-and-beyond service even if they are abusive” Mar said. “It makes us feel like we are not allowed to have the expectation of being treated like a person.”

That’s why it’s so strange that Texas crude producers are facing a sand shortage of more than 1 million tons and prices that have jumped 150%.

Frack sand which gets blasted through shale rocks to unlock oil and natural gas is averaging $55 a ton up from $22 at the end of 2021 data from energy-research firm Lium show. Demand is climbing as oil explorers turn the taps back on after Covid-driven cutbacks.

But like in so many pockets of the economy the recovery is sparking a mismatch. Sand suppliers have seen disruptions labor shortages and trucking bottlenecks. The chief executive officer of U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. the largest publicly traded frack-sand miner has dubbed the tight market “sandemonium” and said his company is sold out.

That’s where Steve Brock and his upstart sand-mining operation Nomad Proppant come in. Since the early days of the shale revolution more than a decade ago fracking operators have relied on mined sand that’s delivered to their sites by truck - across distances as long as 100 miles. Brock Nomad’s chief commercial officer wants to turn that model on its head.

Advertisement

His idea: Why not just use the sand that’s right under your feet?

Nomad has developed machinery that can go directly to the frack wells (give or take 10 to 20 miles) vastly reducing the burden of freight costs and the time-consuming process of trucking.

“We’re not brain surgeons here - all we’re doing is finding the best spots and washing and delivering the sand” said Brock 34. “Frankly that it took us this long to get here is pretty wild.”

Brock left his job at Covia one of the world’s biggest frack-sand miners in February 2020 to help start Nomad. It launched its first mobile sand mine in West Texas last month after the huge surge in prices. He calls the timing “very lucky.”

It’s sand scarcity even more than price that’s the big hurdle for oil drillers. Irving-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co. the Permian’s biggest producer said it expected oil and natural gas output would take a hit last quarter because of sand issues. Things are so extreme that some oil companies are shipping sand in by train from Wisconsin at almost double the cost.

Whether Nomad and rivals like Hi-Crush Inc. one of the original frack-sand pioneers that’s now also introduced mobile units can help solve the sand squeeze could play a significant role in the global energy markets.

While drillers in the Permian have shown restraint in ramping up oil production the last thing the world needs is for sand problems to place even more limitations on their output. The U.S. the world’s top oil producer and among the biggest liquefied natural gas exporters has become an even more important supplier in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s struggles to meet production targets. Meanwhile deficits in energy supplies - and the resulting surge in prices - are among the biggest drivers of the dramatic rise in inflation across the planet.

Advertisement

“You cannot take sand for granted” said Chris Wright CEO of Liberty Energy Inc. the second-biggest frack-services provider. Without enough “I’m quite concerned about global balances for oil gas and food - those are intimately tied.”

Total U.S. demand for frack sand is currently about 5% higher than the roughly 25 million tons being produced according to industry consultant Enverus which estimates a shortfall of roughly 1.3 million tons.

Brock of Nomad says that by carving into the earth about 15 feet deep across 40 acres one of his mobile units can produce about 1 million tons. And since the units are mobile Nomad doesn’t need to limit itself to the huge dusty dunes of traditional mines.

“We can find deposits that previously wouldn’t make sense if you thought you’re stationary because maybe this deposit only has 3 million tons” Brock said. “That can give me two years’ worth of work and then I can move over 2 miles to the next spot.”

The rebound for sand prices is emblematic of the inflation spreading across the Permian. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase estimate costs for U.S. shale companies are soaring at a rate of 25% or almost triple the headline inflation rate.

A lot of that’s driven by shortages. There aren’t enough steel pipes not enough drilling rigs not enough bulldozers - and critically not enough people. Occidental Petroleum Corp. CEO Vicki Hollub has said worker shortages along with supply-chain snarls explain some of why US oil drillers aren’t significantly expanding production.

Turning sand into a mobile business tackles another area of supply-chain bottlenecks: trucking.

Because Nomad can dig up sand close to where it’s needed a single 18-wheeler can make multiple trips back and forth from the mobile mine to the well in one day. That means as few as 10 trucks total are needed down from the roughly 70 used in traditional deliveries from mines. That brings a significant drop in freight costs. But even more critically in the Permian where labor is extremely tight and the unemployment rate is hovering just above 3% it means needing fewer truck drivers.

As Brock puts it: “You solve that issue you solve a lot of problems.”

Devon Energy Corp. one of the region’s biggest explorers is among those already turning to mobile mines. The company is working with Hi-Crush to develop its unit. The pilot project will sit on a roughly 5-acre pad site and account for a quarter of Devon’s total sand needs in the Delaware Basin in the western half of the Permian.

“It gives us a sense of security with our supply” said John Raines vice president of Devon’s Delaware Basin business unit.

Advertisement

It’s also helping to spark a revival for companies like Hi-Crush which went into bankruptcy during the sand-bust days of 2020.

“It’s definitely our growth engine” Hi-Crush CEO Dirk Hallen said of the company’s three mobile units and plans to roll out more later this year. With fracking operators now consuming almost three times as much sand each month as they did five years ago Hallen said demand is likely to stay strong.

And Brock of Nomad points out that mobile units will be able to meet demand faster than traditional mines because not having to truck as far also means eliminating the time-consuming step of drying.

After sand is dug up it gets washed and then left to air dry in piles for a few days. At stationary mines it then gets blasted in giant drying machines. That way when trucks are loaded they’re carrying as much sand as possible. But Brock says since his trucks only go a short distance he can skip the machine drying eliminating pricey equipment.

The cost savings were a key part of Nomad’s pitch as the company was getting off the ground during the depths of the pandemic when Brock says prices were so low that sand was a “four-letter word” and not just literally.

“When you get crunched and you need to start saving some money” he said “you start getting creative.”

With the first compatible processors just months away one has to wonder: what will happen to the likes of GigaIO Fungible or Liqid when CXL finally arrives?

Will these composable infrastructure outfits adapt and thrive or be relegated to the scrap pile of tech vendors that had the right idea before the market was ready for it? And by composable infrastructure we mean rethinking your IT resources as pools of compute storage networking and accelerators and allocating these to workloads in the most efficient way on the fly as needed.

“For some of them” Gartner analyst Tony Harvey told The Register ""it’s not going to make a lot of practical difference. If you’re a GigaIO for example you’re doing a PCIe switch and you’re going to have to upgrade to PCIe 5.0 and you’re going to support CXL.""

While CXL may force these vendors to change and adapt their investments in PCIe switching puts them in a unique position to lead a new market segment for CXL switches he added.

The idea being that eventually CXL switches will replace Ethernet switches for in-rack communications. This will enable customers to interface any number of disaggregated compute memory or storage appliances within the rack. In other words the dream of multivendor composable infrastructure fully realized.

However CXL-based composable infrastructure remains years away. While CXL version 1.1 will make its debut with Intel’s Sapphire Rapids and AMD’s Genoa later this year the switching and fabric capabilities required to realize these composable infrastructure use cases won’t arrive until the launch of CXL 2.0 and CXL 3.0-based silicon.

The imminent birth of a CXL switching ecosystem?

In many respects CXL represents more of an opportunity for vendors like Liqid GigaIO and Fungible than a threat. However the technology will undoubtedly drive competition in the niche composable infrastructure market as major OEMs such as Dell HPE and Lenovo begin introducing their own CXL-based infrastructure.

As a result Harvey predicts that many composable infrastructure vendors could find themselves the target of acquisitions by OEMs looking to bolster their PCIe switching capabilities.

Alternatively he said PCIe switching could follow the path taken by Ethernet with these composable infrastructure vendors eventually becoming the CXL equivalents to Arista Juniper or Cisco.

This route isn’t without challenges of its own and will depend heavily on whether the vendors are willing to open their platforms up to the kind of Ethernet-style standardization required for interoperability.

“To create that open market for PCIe switches you're going to have to be vendor independent and vendor neutral and also create this Ethernet-style world where people expect everything to work with everything else” Harvey said. “I don’t care who made my network card or my switch. I plug them in and they work.”

On the flip side some vendors may double down on their proprietary architectures and create the CXL equivalent of Infiniband.

A disaggregated future

CXL switching is likely to have a much wider appeal than composable infrastructure according to a recent Gartner report which predicted the segment would account for less than 10 percent of enterprise server spend through 2025.

“There are bits of the market where it fits and bits of market where it doesn’t” Harvey said. “In the high-performance compute space and managed service providers or cloud providers it’s a beautiful solution.”

They compose once and then use it for five years and then shut it down

Most customers that are buying composable infrastructure today aren’t actually taking advantage of that composability in their day-to-day operation he explained. “You talk to anybody and they’ll tell you what they actually do is compose once and then use it for five years and then shut it down.”

Part of this is because many enterprise applications simply aren’t designed to take advantage of composability.

“Is anyone really going to take their Oracle ERP system shut it down resize the service it's running on then restart that ERP system in order to take advantage of composability” he said. “The answer to that question is no.”

But that’s not to say there isn’t value in the modularity unlocked by these technologies.

“CXL has the opportunity to completely change the way we architect servers. That’s going to be really interesting in the market because we’ve not seen a server re-architecture for years. We’re all still building 1U or 2U rack servers that look identical” Harvey said. “CXL can change all of that.”

So while enterprises might not recompose their infrastructure on the fly the ability to deploy large pools of memory or other accelerators in a disaggregated fashion still has its appeal and presents an opportunity for the likes of GigaIO Liqid Fungible and any number of other vendors to tie them all together. ®",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's why it's everywhere,"New York CNN Business —

“Unexpected item in the bagging area.”

“Please place item in the bag.”

“Please wait for assistance.”

If you’ve encountered these irritating alerts at the self-checkout machine you’re not alone.

According to a survey last year of 1000 shoppers 67% said they’d experienced a failure at the self-checkout lane. Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.

“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all” said Sylvain Charlebois director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.

Customers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it too.

The machines are expensive to install often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.

Despite the headaches self-checkout is growing.

In 2020 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout up from 23% the year prior according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.

This raises the question: why is this often problematic unloved technology taking over retail?

Making customers do the work

The introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.

Instead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work the model promised lower prices.

Self-checkout however was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66% according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.

The first modern self-checkout system which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.

Customers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.

The technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.

But self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.

It took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.

Walmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images

“The rationale was economics based and not focused on the customer” Charlebois said. “From the get go customers detested them.”

A 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”

The mixed response led some grocery chains including Costco (COST) Albertsons and others to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.

“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes coupons payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.

The move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.

Retailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision said Christopher Andrews a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”

Although self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs he said.

Self-checkout Andrews added “delivers none of what it promises.”

In the biggest headache for store owners self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.

“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout losses would be 77% higher” than average according to Adrian Beck an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.

Customers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.

Some products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce including fruit and meat typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.

“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”

Other customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak) scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.

Stores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors requiring store employees to intervene.

“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience” Beck said.

Self-checkout is here to stay

Despite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners the trend is only growing.

Walmart (WMT) Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.

It may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.

Stores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers even though there’s little evidence to support that. But because customers are doing the work rather than waiting in line the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.

Store owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.

“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it you look like an idiot if you don’t have it” said David D’Arezzo a former executive at Dollar General Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”

Covid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.

During the pandemic many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers. And challenges hiring and retaining workers have led stores to rely on the machines more heavily to get customers through the door.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdG50cmlidW5lLmNvbS9kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC1vcGVucy1uZXctY2xhcmtzdmlsbGUtcGlrZS1sb2NhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar General Opens New Clarksville Pike Location,"GOODLETTSVILLE Tenn. – July 11 2022 – Dollar General is excited to announce its store at 4201 Clarksville Pike in Nashville is now open!

Market research firm eMarketer reports that consumer attitudes about private brands have done an about-face in the past few years.

The eMarketer survey found that consumers look for values against rising product costs and out-of-stocks. More shoppers see private brands as a viable option in categories like fashion and home decor. Retailers from Walmart to Dollar General and Bed Bath & Beyond are investing more into private brands in higher-margin categories like apparel and home decor.

“Retailers have been ramping up quality creating enticing packaging and enhancing marketing for their in-house brands. Together these developments make private label offerings a more important part of retailers’ strategies” the report notes.

Charles Redfield the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S. recently said the retail giant’s foray into more chic fashion private label offerings is different from past efforts.

“Walmart will always be a place where shoppers can buy basics but we believe Walmart can also provide fashion at a value whether it’s for date night or a home makeover” Redfield said during a recent media tour during the company’s shareholder week.

He said this time Walmart surveyed customers and took their feedback to heart. Then the retailer sought the best partners to help achieve top-notch private brands that resonate with today’s value-conscious consumers.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Mary Ruth Proffitt received her heavenly wings on the morning of July 3rd 2022.

She was born on February 2nd 1943 to Sheridan and Zella Kring. She was born and raised in Harriman TN. She worked retail for many years. Over 25 years spent with Service Merchandise and over 15 years with Dollar General. She loved working with people and mentioned very often how it kept her going strong.

After retirement she soon fell in love with her dog Ava. They could be seen walking almost daily around Oak Ridge.

In addition to her parents she is preceded in death by her sister Ann Seals of Chattanooga brother Leonard Ladd (late wife Audrey Ladd) of Harriman and Johanna Kring (late wife of brother Albert Kring.)

She is survived by her two daughters Debra Proffitt of Oak Ridge and Deidra Cowell (husband Churchill Cowell) of Maryland. Granddaughters Julie Fields of Oak Ridge and Deanna Hensley of San Diego California. Great granddaughter Lea Ratnikova of San Diego California. Also her sister Helen Qualls (husband Thomas Qualls) of Townsend sister Sue Farmer (husband Chuck Farmer) of Clinton sister Dorothy Turpin (husband Ronnie Turpin) of Oliver Springs sister Irene Qualls of Claxton brother Albert Kring of Harriman brother Bud Kring (wife Shirley Kring) of Harriman brother Johnny Ladd of Harriman (wife Edith Ladd.)

You decide,"GREENSBORO N.C. – The change in consumer buying behavior during the pandemic served to draw a number of new players into the home décor competition. Even Dollar General took the plunge recently unveiling Popshelf an eclectic and slightly more upscale concept offering home décor kitchenware arts and crafts and bath and beauty.

After years of flirting with furnishings the pandemic finally appears to have lured Lowe’s into the fray with the home center giant adding home décor aisles to go along with home improvement and repair supplies. Cited adjacent to paint supplies the home center has devoted approximately six bays to various home décor categories each one measuring eight feet.

Like so many other retailers today Lowes is also now playing in the boxed bed business devoting a full eight-foot bay with prime aisle entry positioning to Serta boxed beds. Prices range from $314.10 for an 8-inch memory foam twin to $599 for a 10-inch Premier king-sized hybrid.

The focus is clearly on portability and impulse shopping with furniture offerings focused on end and accent tables and a few small chests all priced below $200 all under Lowes’ proprietary Allen & Roth brand. Décor offerings are narrow and clearly focused on helping the broadest swath of consumers finish a recently painted or renovated room.

A full 8-foot bay is devoted to decorative accessories wall art and just to tie it together a wall clock. A separate 8-foot bay is devoted almost exclusively to wall clocks. Again the focus is on giving consumers options at a range of affordable price points. The bulk of the in-store assortment is ranges from $20.99 to $49.99 with a few sub-$20 pieces sprinkled in for bargain hunters.

As you might expect with such a small assortment color offerings are few and centered on neutrals. Other than an occasional nod to farmhouse the bulk of the in-store mix is transitional and clearly aimed at reaching a mass audience.

It’s important to note that assortments and space allocation vary by type of store and location. However it’s clear the retailer has recognized that value of targeting consumers’ drive to decorate.

AP

Inflation could spark sharp rises in theft burglary and even murder a criminologist said.

Richard Rosenfeld said high inflation was creating more demand for stolen goods.

Retailers fear police are now focusing more on violent crime than on burglary and theft.

Soaring inflation threaten to trigger a crime wave a criminologist says and your purchases might get caught up along the way.

Richard Rosenfeld a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis told Insider that property crime would jump this year as rising prices push consumers into the black market.

The average price of goods and services in the US rose by 8.6% in May a 41-year high brought on by tight supply chains and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Rosenfeld who has been researching the link between crime and macroeconomic variables for years said inflation acts as a much better indicator of crime than unemployment or a recession.

Trading down

Rosenfeld said inflation forces customers to shop at cheaper stores. While some will switch from Target to Dollar Tree for example he said that Dollar Tree and Goodwill shoppers will be more susceptible to the black market.

""As retail prices rise we see people trading down to the underground market and stolen goods. That generates higher demand in those markets to supply them with goods acquired through robbery and property crime and we see robbery and property crime rates increase"" he said.

Rosenfeld thinks it's more likely that demand for non-essential illicit goods will rise as consumers won't have anything left over after spending on food which is also suffering big price rises.

Jason Straczewski of the National Retail Federation told Insider that organized crime had been rising in recent years even before inflation began soaring.

Data published by the trade body last year showed about $700000 for every $1 billion in sales annually is lost by retailers to organised crime. Designer clothes laundry detergent and allergy medicine were top of the list and Straczewski expected the top items stolen this year to be broadly similar.

Straczewski said some members also reported rising theft of perishable goods including shoppers walking into supermarkets and stealing shopping carts full of fresh meat to sell on.

""I don't think there's a willingness among people to go actively seek out stolen merchandise to purchase"" Straczewski said. ""If you're a consumer and there's products you need to take care of your family and your household you're going to look for the best possible deal.""

Straczewski said police attention being diverted towards violent crime and away from burglaries had emboldened some.







Crime rates have not yet risen according to quarterly FBI data but Rosenfeld expected that to change by the end of this year.

Violent crime fears

More violent crime could also be on the horizon. As the shadow economy grows so too do the number of disputes that would ordinarily be settled in court. Rosenfeld says with that option gone violent crime including murder can increase.

""The work that's been done on violent crime tends to suggest that high levels of inflation really produce reduced sizeable reductions in institutional legitimacy"" he says.

""That is the perception on the part of the population that social institutions are simply not operating properly. And that decline in institutional legitimacy has from a variety of perspectives been linked to increases in violent crime.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xMC91cy9maXZlLXRoaW5ncy1qdWx5LTEwLXRybmQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDcvMTAvdXMvZml2ZS10aGluZ3MtanVseS0xMC10cm5k?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Start your week smart: South Africa Japan Sri Lanka Roe v.

Kentucky Lake is where you can find me in the summertime. I love boating wake surfing and water skiing but my favorite activity is floating. Bobbing in the water with a cold drink in my hand and some tunes playing is my recipe for fun in the sun.

I consider myself a float connoisseur. I’ve tried your basic inflatable from the dollar store saddles a giant peacock float and the Lily Pad floating mat. They all have their pros and cons but I recently discovered an inflatable pool float that really floats my boat — and it only costs $13!

Whether you prefer the pool the lake or the ocean the Aqua Original 4-in-1 Monterey Hammock Pool Float and Water Hammock is a total summer game-changer. Here’s why you’ll love it too.

Why This Pool Float Is The GOAT

What makes this Aqua brand float the greatest of all time? Let us count the ways:

The box the float was delivered in

1. It’s Compact

The float was so compact before it had air in it that it was delivered to my mailbox. Once it does have air in it it is still much more compact than other floats because just the two armrests are inflated; the rest is just mesh.

2. It’s Easy To Inflate

It is super easy to inflate this float using just your lungs. My husband and I each grabbed a side and had it ready to go in no time. Not having to use any kind of air pump to blow up the float was a big plus for me.

3. Use It In Several Positions

There are four ways to use this versatile pool float: Lay in it as a hammock sit in it like a saddle use the floats as armrests and sit in it like a chair or just hang on to it in front of you.

4. Easy To Get On And Off

It seems there is no graceful way to mount or dismount a float but it is pretty easy to get into this floating hammock. The mesh hangs lower than the inflated floats so you can easily swing a leg over. To dismount simply swing your legs around from a hammock position to a sitting position and slide out.

5. It Is Stable

It’s just like sitting in a chair in the water. Unlike other floats you don’t have to worry about falling off. If you sit up in it you don’t even have to get your hair wet!

6. It’s Super Affordable

No one will have to float you a loan for this pool float! The Aqua Original 4-in-1 Monterey Hammock Pool Float can be yours for just $13!

7. Choose From A Variety Of Sizes And Colors

A variety of colors are available including burgundy yellow light blue lime green orange pink and navy. The hammock pool float is also available in extra-large which is 30 percent longer and wider than the standard Monterey and designed for people 5’8″ to 7’4″ feet tall. The regular Monterey Hammock Pool Float is perfect for people up to 6 feet tall but I ordered the extra-large one for my extra-tall husband. If you want to float with your honey there is also a double size called the Catalina that lets you float together side-by-side.

8. It’s Made To Last

With a weight capacity of up to 250 pounds the Aqua 4-in-1 Monterey Hammock is made of mesh and sturdy non-stick PVC material which is 50 to 70 percent thicker than most other “sticky PVC” hammock pool floats. It will definitely last longer than one of those dollar store inflatables! It also comes with a 60-day limited warranty.

9. It’s Easy To Store And Transport

The Aqua 4-in-1 Monterey Hammock is perfect for travel. Let it dry so it doesn’t get moldy then roll it up and store it away or let the air out if you want to pack it up in a tote bag. I love that you can leave the float inflated to store since it doesn’t take up much space. It is definitely more compact than my peacock float or Lily Pad!

“Mesh very soft and comfortable. We just used ours in Mexico last week. Best pool floats we’ve ever owned. Easy to inflate and deflate. Easy to pack and takes up almost no space in the suitcase. Very pleased with this item.” John Smith 2018 Amazon review

Make A Splash With This Awesome Pool Float

I took my new float out for the Fourth of July and all of my friends wanted to know where to get one. Everyone also loved my Drink Float — a floating can cooler my hubby picked up at Walmart for six bucks. I made fun of it until I saw how handy it was in the water!

With the Aqua 4-in-1 Monterey Hammock you’ll be the envy of any pool party!"

It would be the most expensive in the country critics ...,"State regulators have approved a $55.10 minimum bill for a new Dominion Energy shared solar program which critics contend would be the highest such charge in the country and make the program too expensive to attract developers and customers.

The State Corporation Commission approved the minimum bill as part of an order released Thursday that also set bill credit rates and a mechanism for the company Virginia’s largest utility to recoup costs associated with allowing low-income customers to participate in the program since they are exempt from the minimum bill. Community or shared solar programs involve multiple households agreeing jointly to purchase a portion of the electricity generated by a solar array. It’s useful for apartment dwellers or other settings in which rooftop panels aren’t feasible.

“The commission has established pursuant to its delegated discretion under this statute a minimum bill that reasonably includes costs the commission deems relevant to ensure subscribing customers pay a fair share of the generation transmission distribution and fixed costs of providing electric service” the SCC judges wrote.

But a trio of state lawmakers — Sens. Emmett Hanger R-Augusta Scott Surovell D-Fairfax and Del. Rip Sullivan D-Fairfax — said in a letter to the commission in April that the high minimum bill recommended by the SCC hearing examiner undermined the legislation passed in 2020 that created the program which was intended to allow third-party groups to develop community solar facilities sign up interested customers and sell the power to the utility with a bill credit for participating customers for the power generated.

“We did not pass legislation to create a program that exists in name only” the lawmakers wrote. “The minimum bill is required to help alleviate potential cost shifts associated with the shared solar program but should be implemented with an underlying assumption that the program needs to work. A competitive shared solar program is a new and exciting frontier for Virginia and we recommend taking serious consideration of the input provided by industry and advocates with regards to what has proven successful in other markets.”

Dominion had argued that the high minimum bill was necessary to avoid burdening customers who choose not to participate but as opponents and the SCC hearing examiner himself noted the company failed to produce any evidence that quantified how much of a cost shift would be borne by nonparticipating customers.

“It is correct that the record does not include evidence that specifies exactly what cost shift would occur under Dominion’s proposed minimum bill or any of the other proposed minimum bills ” wrote SCC Hearing Examiner Mathias Roussy who nevertheless recommended the $55 minimum charge. Dominion had pushed for an even higher minimum bill of $75.10.

The company sought a $75.10 minimum bill.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xM25ld3Nub3cuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2VhdGhlci9wb3dlci1vdXRhZ2VzLWZyb20tc3Rvcm15LXdlYXRoZXItYWZmZWN0LXRob3VzYW5kcy8yOTEtMGU5OGM4ZGMtNWUwYS00NzJkLWFmMDMtMzQwMDMzMzEwMmMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power outages from stormy weather affect thousands in region,"Dominion Energy has crews deployed throughout the area.

REMINGTON Va. — For years there’s been a cardinal rule for flying civilian drones: Keep them within your line of sight. Not just because it’s a good idea — it’s also the law.

But some drones have recently gotten permission to soar out of their pilots’ sight. They can now inspect high-voltage power lines across the forested Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia. They’re tracking endangered sea turtles off Florida’s coast and monitoring seaports in the Netherlands and railroads from New Jersey to the rural West.

Aviation authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere are preparing to relax some of the safeguards they imposed to regulate a boom in off-the-shelf consumer drones over the past decade. Businesses want simpler rules that could open your neighborhood’s skies to new commercial applications of these low-flying machines although privacy advocates and some airplane and balloon pilots remain wary.

For now a small but growing group of power companies railways and delivery services like Amazon are leading the way with special permission to fly drones “beyond visual line of sight.” As of early July the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had approved 230 such waivers — one of them to Virginia-based Dominion Energy for inspecting its network of power plants and transmission lines.

“This is the first step of what everybody’s expecting with drones” said Adam Lee Dominion’s chief security officer. “The first time in our nation’s history where we’ve now moved out into what I think everyone’s expecting is coming.”

That expectation — of small drones with little human oversight delivering packages assessing home insurance claims or buzzing around on nighttime security patrols — has driven the FAA’s work this year to craft new safety guidelines meant to further integrate drones into the national airspace.

The FAA said it is still reviewing how it will roll out routine operations enabling some drones to fly beyond visual line of sight although it has signaled that the permissions will be reserved for commercial applications not hobbyists.

“Our ultimate goal is you shouldn’t need a waiver for this process at all. It becomes an accepted practice” said Adam Bry CEO of California drone-maker Skydio which is supplying its drones to Dominion railroad company BNSF and other customers with permission to fly beyond line of sight.

“The more autonomous the drones become the more they can just be instantly available anywhere they could possibly be useful” Bry said.

Part of that involves deciding how much to trust that drones won’t crash into people or other aircraft when their operators aren’t looking. Other new rules will require drones to carry remote identification — like an electronic license plate — to track their whereabouts. And in the aftermath of Russia’s war in Ukraine — where both sides have used small consumer drones to target attacks — the White House has been pushing a parallel effort to counter the potential malicious use of drones in the U.S.

At a gas-fired plant in Remington Va. which helps power some of Washington’s suburbs a reporter with The Associated Press watched in June as Dominion Energy drone pilots briefly lost visual line of sight of their inspection drone as it flew around the backside of a large fuel tank and the top of a smoke stack.

That wouldn’t have been legally possible without Dominion’s recently approved FAA waiver. And it wouldn’t have been technically possible without advancements in collision-avoidance technology that are enabling drones to fly closer to buildings.

Previously “you would have to erect scaffolding or have people go in with a bucket truck” said Nate Robie who directs the drone program at Dominion. “Now you can go in on a 20-minute flight.”

Not everyone is enthused about the pending rules. Pilots of hot air balloons and other lightweight aircraft warn that crashes will follow if the FAA allows largely autonomous delivery drones the right of way at low altitudes.

“These drones cannot see where they are flying and are blind to us” said a June call to action from the Balloon Federation of America.

Broader concerns come from civil liberties groups that say protecting people’s privacy should be a bigger priority.

“There is a greater chance that you’ll have drones flying over your house or your backyard as these beyond-visual-line-of-sight drone operations increase” said Jeramie Scott a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center who sat on the FAA’s advisory group working to craft new drone rules. “It’ll be much harder to know who to complain to.”

EPIC and other groups dissented from the advisory group’s early recommendations and are calling for stronger privacy and transparency requirements — such as an app that could help people identify the drones above them and what data they are collecting.

“If you want to fly beyond visual line of sight especially if you are commercial the public has a right to know what you’re flying what data you are collecting” said Andrés Arrieta director of consumer privacy engineering at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “It seems like such a low bar.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZwbS5vcmcvMjAyMi0wNy0xMC9hcnRzbGluZS1lbmpveS1yaWNobW9uZHMtc3VtbWVydGltZS1tdXNpYy10aGVhdHJlLWRhbmNlLWFuZC1tb3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artsline - Enjoy Richmond's summertime music theatre dance and more!,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.vpm.org/2022-07-10/artsline-enjoy-richmonds-summertime-music-theatre-dance-and-more on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZwbS5vcmcvMjAyMi0wNy0xMC9hcnRzbGluZS1lbmpveS1yaWNobW9uZHMtc3VtbWVydGltZS1tdXNpYy10aGVhdHJlLWRhbmNlLWFuZC1tb3Jl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

“Turn at this flag on an unmarked driveway and keep going until you reach a gate.” These were the directions that designers Kate Hayes and Krista Sharif of Hayes Little Studio were given for their client’s new northeastern Georgia getaway. So it’s not surprising that they missed a turn—and that was just the first visit. “We would drive by it every time” Hayes recalls with a laugh. The pair would regularly have to loop back to the closest town to consult locals for a better route a tactic even delivery truck drivers have had to pick up when struggling to find the way (the bad cell service certainly didn’t help either).

That middle-of-nowhere feeling was pretty much the point. Atlanta-based neurologists Amy and Taylor Harrison had picked out the wooded location accessible only via a dirt road with disconnecting in mind. They didn’t want distractions—not a single screen—in their off-the-beaten path family-friendly escape on the banks of the Soque River. Their mantra? “More outside less inside.”

Hayes refers to the Harrisons as frients—friend clients so to speak. The quartet worked together on redesigning the family’s home in midtown Atlanta a few years prior and she was the first person they called after buying the nearly 2000-square-foot riverside house. “It was a classic pandemic situation” the designer shares. “They were like: We have to get out here but it needs to be drivable.”

The property located just steps away from the water is near one of the Southeast’s best fishing spots—and since Taylor is an avid fly fisherman something in the area was a natural choice. But the structure was a total 1970s joint complete with wall-to-wall carpet (the shaggy kind even in the bathroom). At first Amy was just looking for partial treatment enough to make it enjoyable to be there. “I remember we did the walk-through and her telling us they might not even keep the house” says Sharif. “They were originally planning on tearing it down but have it nice for a couple years.”

While plans were being drawn up and one cosmetic issue after the other was uncovered—especially in the three bathrooms and bedrooms—the light refresh slowly transformed into a full-blown renovation. And at some point along the way (perhaps when a fresh coat of paint breathed new life into the outdated kitchen cabinets) they all realized it felt good enough to keep.

Letting in light also helped. Once the carpet—bonus: fuzzy toilet covers—and frilly blue curtains were removed it was all about opening up the main area. (Initially the greatest source of natural light came from a curvy old-school sunroom but it was blocked off by a pair of doors.) “It was incredibly dark in the front rooms” notes Sharif of the constant presence of shade. “Widening the openings was a game changer. It was a little oppressive because of all the wood; it felt like it was all coming down on you a bit.”

With the ceilings popped up Hayes argued for something to fill up the extra space. An oversize fixture was the perfect fit to anchor the living room—where you could post up by the fire with a glass of bourbon—and connect it to the entrance side music room and glass-surround sunroom.

“As a big house we didn’t just need ample lighting but warm lighting on a larger scale” Hayes points out and hanging the 45-inch round Noguchi paper lantern actually took more convincing than keeping the original cedar-paneled walls. Knowing that the couple definitely wanted to retain all the wood and original stone fireplace the designers had to brighten everything else.

They removed the dangerous-looking fans (as in scarily close to your head) in the sunroom and re-stained the floors a saturated forest green recommended by their contractor Jeffrey Thompson. They placed comfy leather armchairs from Anthropologie opposite a wood beer hall–style table and matching benches long enough to seat multiple kids (including their own 9- and 10-year-old). “The house is very indoor-outdoor; the atrium is the stepping stone between the two” says Hayes.

In fact natural elements were the main source of inspiration for nearly every piece of furniture or fabric the pair sourced whether it was the rattan sconces or a dialed-back paint palette. “She’s a bit cool transitional historic” Sharif says of Amy’s style noting that it took a few tries to find just the right style. The designers landed on a modern retreat–meets–cozy mountain cabin look in the end selecting plaids and leathers that would wear well over time; a wood stove; stone wall hooks; and a farm sink in the mustard yellow bathroom. Livable comfort was really what Hayes and Sharif were going for—and with groups of fishermen traipsing through the house in waders or children returning from a day spent in old-growth woods and swinging above the water it’s what the tranquil hideaway was calling for.

In the now-viral series user Tiffany (@mrs.belgard22) describes a culture at Domino’s of being overworked and underpaid frequently working beyond her set hours as a manager for just $13 per hour. She has been employed at Domino’s for nearly four years.

“Domino’s you need to learn how to do better” she says in the first video.

Tiffany says she reached her breaking point when her sole driver did not show up for work on his Fourth of July shift. After going through the proper procedure for trying to get the driver to come in she attempted to find a new driver. When none of the employees responded she went up the chain of command to seek help.

Instead of receiving help Tiffany says she was interrogated about her procedures with both of her managers opting to question her about her practices and tell her she should have “done more” rather than come in themselves. This led Tiffany to question her role at the company—and eventually tell the manager to “go get fucked in the nicest way possible.”

The first video currently has over 1.8 million views.

Across the videos Tiffany lays out her situation saying that she has been a consistent and strong worker for nearly four years. This success in the role led to her being promoted to AM4 one step below General Manager.

Despite her success Tiffany says her store is frequently understaffed. She says she often assumes the jobs of multiple people and does not complain. The incident on the Fourth of July is the first time she claims she’s asked for help.

After her driver did not show up she says she tried to contact all of the employees through the company’s crew app. When no one responded she went up the chain of command to try to find a replacement.

No one took her up on the offer and neither of the managers she contacted wanted to come in on the Fourth of July to work.

Instead according to Tiffany the managers told her she was not doing enough to find someone to replace the absent driver.

All this time Tiffany says she was preparing the store for opening managing incoming orders and trying to deal with the backlash of not having a delivery driver on Independence Day.

This led her to turn on her General Manager.

“[I] literally told my GM ‘Hey I’m tired of getting treated like this and I’m tired of getting bitched at for doing my job’” she recalls. “‘Because if I didn’t have prep and all of that finished and I would have sat there and literally called everybody I would have been bitched at for not having prep and stuff done!’”

In conclusion Tiffany says that this mental and physical effort is not worth the payment.

“$13 an hour to put up with the shit that we have to put up with is not worth it” she states.

She then posted a video providing evidence of her attempts to contact employees and managers to replace the lost driver.

Domino’s has not had a good track record on TikTok. Recently a video went viral showing a single young employee running the entire store. In March another TikTok showing two employees quitting mid-rush also went viral with many of their complaints echoing those of Tiffany.

Tiffany later shouted out those employees in a TikTok.

Commenters supported Tiffany and encouraged Domino’s to treat her and her fellow employees better.

“Yeah you did nothing wrong  not your fault the other managers didn’t fulfill there job duties. and your gm knows if nobody comes in they need to” one user wrote.

“Had this problem at Papa John’s” another added. “Food industry just doesn’t care about their employees.”

We’ve reached out to Tiffany via TikTok comment and Domino’s via email.

With extreme occurrences of melting glaciers severe droughts frequent storms and deadly wildfires climate change is leaving a long-lasting and devastating mark on our environment.

While environmental changes may be easy to notice how climate change affects human health remains mostly unnoticeable.

Eye health has become a major concern due to the rising levels of air pollution and environmental degradation. Global warming is contributing to the early outset and progression of cataracts as the ozone layer gradually depletes and the harmful UV rays cause ocular damage.





The change in rainfall pattern is causing droughts and floods affecting the growth of crops. This is expected to increase food security and cause Vitamin A deficiency leading to a rise in trachoma infection. Similarly rising levels of air pollution are significantly increasing the burden of eye-related diseases like age-related macular degeneration glaucoma dry eyes and allergic eye diseases.





As climate change accelerates it becomes all the more important to take appropriate measures and shield the eyes from environmental damage.

How environmental change can impact eyes

The eyes are one of the most unique organs of the body susceptible to developing diseases resulting from environmental factors. Since the organ is exposed directly to the environment any changes in weather climate dry conditions and pollution can affect it.





Many of us are aware of the fact that increasing levels of greenhouse gases are depleting the ozone layer. As a result ultraviolet (UV) radiation is increasingly creating adverse impacts on the eyes. A 2003 WHO report revealed that increased ultraviolet radiation levels can lead to eye snow blindness (sunburn on the eye) lesions (such as cataracts) pterygium acute photokeratitis and photo conjunctivitis macular degeneration acute solar retinopathy (solar burn to the retina) and various other serious conditions.

Overexposure to UV rays can also result in premature ageing of the natural lens of the eyes causing early-onset presbyopia. The condition is most prevalent in areas that are closer to the equator where the sun's rays are naturally stronger.

UV rays can also be associated with squamous cell carcinomas cutaneous melanoma and basal cell carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma not just can affect the skin but also the conjunctiva and spread to the cornea and inside of the eyes. In certain cases it may necessitate the removal of the whole eye.





Climatic change can also lead to erratic weather patterns with both decrease and increase in typical temperatures. In areas where the temperatures are extremely high people are often seen suffering from conditions like dry eyes. What’s more significant is that traffic-related pollution of air exposes people to ambient carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide which can increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A study of eleven years involving 40000 Taiwanese residents showed that AMD can cause severe and at times permanent vision loss usually in people who are 60 years or above.

Importance of patient education

There is an immediate need to appreciate and understand the urgency of climatic changes and how they can be detrimental to eye health. It is crucial to communicate this urgency to change the behaviour of people and prevent a catastrophic onset of eye diseases in the future.





Efficiently communicating the ill effects of climate change on eye health within communities can lead to better knowledge and improved service uptake. To deliver promotion and education within integrated eyecare healthcare providers can utilise more community-centred or people-centred design approaches understanding that people are the co-producers of health in a nation not just beneficiaries users or choosers.

Eye health programmes in schools carried out by training teachers to impart knowledge about the adverse effect of climate change on eye health can also go a long way in making people aware.

The solution to tackle the rising number of eye health issues resulting from climate change lies in increasing awareness and utilising the simple available and safe services that exist. One in three people in India suffers from vision issues simply due to the lack of awareness and access to quality eye care. It is critical to break down these barriers and encourage people to seek good eye care and periodically get their eyesight checked.





While economies around the world including India commit to making the future more sustainable and greener for the coming generations through various initiatives the negative effects of climate change on eye health shouldn’t be ignored. If we are to stop eye diseases from becoming the next big concern a cohesive effort is required from every stakeholder to prevent the progression of eye diseases across the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9ub21hZC1hdC1ob21lLWJvb2stZXhjZXJwdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Wall in This Roman Apartment Is Covered in Art From Flea Market Finds to Cubist Paintings,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

That age-old phrase tells us “home is where the heart is” but what if your heart is in multiple places at once? In her new book Nomad at Home: Designing the Home More Traveled (out July 12) interior stylist and creative director Hilary Robertson explores how investing in many houses not just simply the one where you spend the most time can lead to a fuller life experience—and a more well-designed primary home. Although if that’s not in the cards simply picking up tchotchkes from that small town you’re passing through or pulling a color palette from a scenic view will do. Each chapter explores what happens when a certain kind of nomad designs their home base.

In her introduction to artist Liselotte Watkins’s space in Rome for instance Robertson says: “Nothing but full immersion will do. If you don’t speak the language learn it fast. Open up! Join in! Make a fool of yourself!” And from Sweden to Texas New York to Paris and then on to Italy Liselotte has done just that. In an excerpt we get a peek into Liselotte’s gallery-like apartment and how her journeys have influenced the semi-final destination (a home renovation in Tuscany is next on the list).

The kitchen dining room and sitting room are separate spaces but they are all connected on one side of the apartment. The galley kitchen is brightly accessorized with Liselotte’s illustrated plates combined with monochromatic Fornasetti and other vintage ceramics on the wall.

Liselotte Watkins’s nomad story is one that I have heard many times. It’s the “leaving early” story of a youthful iconoclast a “throws-caution-to-the-wind” type of gypsy who picks up their bags and follows something or someone without a backward glance too young to question the sagacity of such a move. Imagine leaving Sweden for Texas at 17 with “no money no plan.” “The worst-case scenario was going back” says Liselotte. “I was a sponge ready to soak it all up.” A full-immersion nomad indeed.

Chrome yellow is the predominant “happy” color in Liselotte’s decorating palette. She appreciates the hue for its sunny vibe which provokes fond memories of her grandmother’s summer house in Sweden.

Quitting Texas she headed to NYC while her then boyfriend went back to Sweden promising to return. She landed at the YWCA on 14th Street opposite the Chelsea Hotel a hip-adjacent address ideal for a neophyte New Yorker. Chance meetings surviving from day to day from gig to gig meant operating in the present tense. “Days went by and you were a winner for still being there” she says.

In the entrance hall a console table is used to display books and objects.

After making friends with an art director who worked for Barneys the temple of New York chic Liselotte turned her hand to illustrating the store’s weekly beauty ads for The New York Times. The boyfriend did not return but fashion illustration stuck. Liselotte met another Swede now her husband who whisked her to Paris where she had her first child and then another in quick succession. But before she could settle into a Parisian life they moved to Milan and her Italian odyssey began.

A patchwork quilt in the master bedroom extends the theme of Liselotte’s graphic paintings which ﬂank the masculine iron bedstead. She eschews bedside storage in favor of chairs stacked high with bedtime reading matter.

In terms of color temperature I think of Sweden as monochrome and Italy as a rainbow. Considering Liselotte’s Rome apartment which throbs with citrus yellow and tangerine it’s clear that she feels exuberantly at home in her Roman setting. She has a wardrobe full of La DoubleJ maximalist patterned silk dresses in shades of everything. Her distinctive palette fizzes through all her work from the bold vessels on which she paints stylized female characters and Cubist patterns to the recent larger-scale paintings in soft sherbet shades painted during the pandemic for a solo show at the Swedish Millesgården gallery. These depict detailed interiors inhabited by voluptuous female figures: mothers goddesses and their offspring imaginary characters drawn from her observations of Italy and the Italian way of life. Liselotte the outsider celebrates the obsessions and rituals of her chosen country; the Italian predilection for routine tradition craft food and of course style.

A collage of inﬂuences and ideas: Illustrations works in progress and signature plates gathered on the hexagonal tiles of Liselotte’s living room ﬂoor.

Unsurprisingly the tender domestic scenes are in sync with her 19th-century apartment where a centrally located dining room connects on one side with a wedge-shaped sitting room singing with sunshine yellow and on the other to a simple white kitchen where Liselotte’s colorful ceramics add a decorative flourish. “Homemaking or nesting is my coping mechanism” she explains. It’s a feeling that she wants to create rather than a particular style aiming for a sunny vibe that reminds her of her grandmother’s Swedish summer house. Even in this discreetly bourgeois neighborhood (the apartment looks onto the grand facades of embassies) Liselotte will shout “Buongiorno!” to locals as protocol demands. “Community is important here” she says. “You have to make the effort.”

Hundis the dachshund relaxes on a mid-century chair.

Her roots may have grown in Rome but recent events have allowed the family to spend time in the Tuscan countryside near Siena where they are renovating a house. Like many others temporarily set free from metropolitan life due to the pandemic they have thrived in a bucolic setting; Liselotte’s daughter is able to ride horses there and she paints in her spacious studio easing the transition of her work from commercial fashion illustration to fine art. In fact the family has adapted so easily to country life that they plan to give up city living for this version of la dolce vita another colorful full immersion.

When you really stop to think about it our hands are capable of extraordinary powers. They can heal us and they can hurt us. Hands can welcome and then with the flick of a wrist they can turn someone away. Holding hands is a symbol of love. High-fives equal teamwork. But for designer John Sohn maker of covetable five-finger cushions a 75-pound hand pillow is a soft cradle upon which he can unwind.

“After a long day I drop all my bags and plop on the hand for a second” says Sohn who sews his artwork as a side hustle to his day job as head of design at Rosetta Getty. “It’s just so inviting and low to the ground.”

The pillows which he makes in much smaller versions and are for sale on his website (and also at Beverly’s NYC where they often sell out) were a pandemic project born from the Korean translation of his last name which means “hand” and inspired by pop artist Nicola L and her iconic foot sofa. Now they have become his signature popping up in the homes of Domino contributing editor Jordan Ferney and illustrator Naomi Otsu.

In his own place a studio in Williamsburg Brooklyn the hand pillow is just one part of his carefully carved-out space which includes a bedroom living area dining area and workspace—all within 500 square feet. “It took a lot of planning” says Sohn who turned down an apartment double the size to stay in the same neighborhood and remain within budget. “I don’t know how many times I laid out the apartment with sketches and my measurements to see where my bed would go.”

Eventually he tucked his bed into a brick-walled nook and partitioned it off with an antique Japanese tansu step chest he found on eBay that he calls a mix between a junk drawer and medicine cabinet for the way it corrals cords and extra candles. From there he was able to map out the rest of the apartment putting the living room at the end of the bed and dividing the two spaces with a Samsung TV on a stand. (That way he can Netflix binge from the sofa or the bed.)

Speaking of the sofa it’s from Owl a Spanish brand and the style name La Pepino fittingly translates to “cucumber.” When he couldn’t find the perfect low-profile vintage piece Sohn had this one custom-made which sucked up his budget and required a 12-week wait—but both were well worth it. “It felt like it was something I could have for a long time and see myself getting upholstered later in life” he says. But for now it sits upon a rug he bought on a trip to Morocco and provides a fun place for friends to lounge.

Nearby is his workspace where vivid yellow filing cabinets stack to his desk’s exact height a lucky accident and around the corner a similarly hued vintage dresser ties the look together. “I’m drawn to yellow as an accent color” he says though he admits it’s a great neutral when surrounded by other shades.

Though the space is teeny everything has its place especially in the kitchen where a metal pegboard over the stove provides easy access to his cooking and baking tools. (Sohn has been known to make a mean olive oil cake: “It’s perfect because it’s not too sweet so you can have it for dessert and you can have it for breakfast.”)

Everything else is corralled inside his cabinets which spill out into the dining area where a large table provides seating for friends—but also for Sohn when he needs a break from his desk. Or when he’s really mentally stuck he just walks over to the living space and cuddles up inside his extra-large hand.

Jeff Cowin president of the Virginia Park block club and leader of the restoration project rallied volunteers over three days to move the donated bricks for transport to Virginia Park Street where after 115 years of wear and tear the original brick pavers are full of cracks potholes and suspension-destroying ruts.

The 10-pound bricks which date back to 1904 were removed from a street near Vernor and Charlevoix to make way for a new substation going in on the city’s east side in a joint venture between ITC Holdings and DTE Energy.

Once the bricks have been gathered and transported to the Virginia Park neighborhood residents hope to raise additional funding to complete the restoration efforts Cowin said.

""This was a wild card. Where do you even find bricks that are worthy?"" Cowin said on Saturday as volunteers dug out bricks from piles of dirt around him. ""The root of this project is preserving the value that’s already there in the road. There are no modern substitutes for these materials...We don’t want to lose the value in this neighborhood. People moved into houses that are just as old as these bricks""

Cowin said the city's Department of Public Works and Midtown Detroit Inc. are working on estimates for engineering and contractor work.

Volunteer Tim Soboleski a Virginia Park resident said the three blocks of brick road outside his home are in bad shape for several reasons.

""One block — the block between third and the Lodge during the Riots — a M-60 tank and armored personnel carrier rolled down the street. You can see the damage now and see the tracks"" Sobileski said. ""When GM was redoing the neighborhoods they diverted traffic through there. It got way more traffic and there are massive ruts there now. People use it as a cut through.""

Soboleski says Virginia Park is the farthest north brick street in Detroit.

""These brick streets were put in before cars were. One thing that pushed it was bicyclists. Before there were cars bicycling was a big thing in Detroit. They wanted smoother more navigable roads. To improve roads they laid brick. It's been there for years"" he said.

The donated bricks 8-inches wide by 4-inches deep are high-end salt-glazed Nelsonville bricks fired in individual salt kilns Soboleski said.

""Very labor intensive more durable. A modern brick won't last"" Soboleski said.

Soboleski estimates to repair all three blocks in Virginia Park the group will need more than the 20000 bricks they hope to recover.

""The thing is it shows the effort on the part of the people that are there who want the street fixed. They are going out. They found the brick. They are bringing it back over there. No one is paying us for this"" he said.

Volunteers like Cathy Fitzpatrick spent Saturday morning hand-digging through a piles of dirt for bricks. Fitzpatrick 33 of Sterling Heights wore work gloves and jeans and kneeled in the dirt to search by hand for her next brick to examine.

""I saw this on Facebook and I saw a need. I love history and saw someone with a dream and a passion and I'm glad I can help"" she said.

Volunteers are still needed to move bricks and can find information via Facebook Cowin said.

Goshen and Miami Township (Clermont County) Ohio – A EF2 tornado with winds at 135 mph touched down along a 4.5 mile path in Goshen Township and a EF1 tornado touched down in the Bell Meade Farms neighborhood in Miami Township on Thursday July 6 leaving physical scars and trauma that will last lifetimes.

Goshen Township Administrator Steve Pegram said he doesn’t believe the outdoor warning sirens sounded and a tornado watch had not been declared. It was the alert he received on his smart phone that first indicated trouble was brewing. He said in a news conference that the outdoor siren at the township fire station did not “go off”. He said they activate the siren after receiving a weather alert and that the storm hit about 30-seconds after receiving an alert on his phone. He continued “So there probably wasn’t even time to push the button” which would activate the siren. The station and administration building almost immediately took a direct hit from the storm resulting in extensive damage and it could not be used for emergency operations. “The building the siren was on was destroyed and I can’t speak to any other sirens”

Pegram said. He began coordinating emergency responsesusing using only his smart phone to coordinate emergency responses until the Hamilton County fire chiefs provided them with a portable command vehicle an RV to operate from. In the early hours of the storm Pegram used the Township FaceBook page to give regular updates to residents and the media. It’s all he had.

Pegram was in his office when the storm hit and windows had already started blowing out as he and staff were on the steps leading to the basement.

Pegram encourages people to install a weather alert app on their smart-phone and to check with the county Homeland Security websites for more information about alert systems.

In the end about one-third of the administration and police building was on the ground and had a gas leak that lasted for about five hours according to Pegram.

On July 6 Goshen Township reported only 2 confirmed injuries. A state of emergency was declared at 5:43 PM. It has since been reported there were three injuries two residents hit by falling debris and one firefighter injured while using a chainsaw. There were no fatalities either in Goshen or Miami Township. Between 150 to 200 structures were damaged in Goshen Township.

A Red Cross emergency shelter was established at Goshen High School at 6707 Goshen Road where emergency oxygen equipment was also available for people’s medical needs. Shelter bottled water and food were available. Food donations can also be delivered to the high school.

An emergency hotline has been established – 513-735-8500. The non-emergency number is 513-732-2231. Call 911 in an emergency.

Pegram said that each and every structure with damage was being inspected by the Township as well as the Clermont County Building Department and the County Emergency Management Agency. He said that perhaps 25% of the homes in the township had significant damage. He said the Duke Energy estimated that more than one-hundred “power poles” would need to be replaced before they could begin stringing new wires and it will “take days”.

In a news conference Pegram spoke about Goshen being a tight-knit community and said that by the time he made it home to check on his own house neighbors had already cleared his street of tree limbs.

There are two 40 Yard Rumpke dumpsters provided by Clermont County Solid Waste available at the old Green School property on Goshen Road across from McDonald’s and available for residents to dump trash and debris.

“Woody” debris should not go in the trash tree limbs brush etc should be pulled to the curb for pick up which will start Monday morning and continue most of the week.

The Township asks “Please cut tree debris into small manageable pieces – 4’ is preferred”.

Township Service Director Chad Meadows looked out his office window to see the tornado already on the ground.

“Administrative personnel made it halfway down the stairs as windows exploded” said Chief of Police Bob Rose on FaceBook. “Officers in the police department didn’t have time to get to the basement taking cover in rooms with no windows and a closet. Firefighter/medics at Station 18 took cover in a bathroom as a portion of their firehouse collapsed.” Rose continued “I put out ‘an all’ call on the radio for any available unit to respond and officers came from everywhere racing to the many different streets and neighborhoods affected. All of our neighbors that were not dealing with their own storm-related calls responded as well as agencies from much further away. I heard or saw police officers from as far away as Bethel Batavia Amberly Village and many more. The Ohio State Highway Patrol sent troopers from all surrounding counties. The story is the same for fire departments. Engines and ambulances from all over responded.”

From the Goshen Township FaceBook page “We have a lot of clean up activities scheduled for Saturday including hundreds of volunteers and dozens of Police Fire Public Works and Utility companies. The basic message is if you don’t live in Goshen work here or have ‘official’ business please stay away.” It is a rural community with an urban traffic problem. A lot of roads will be closed either temporarily or most of the day to help facilitate clean-up and recovery efforts.

WAYS TO HELP

• Donations can be taken to Goshen High School at 6707 Goshen Road.

• Stay away: Emergency services road crews Duke Energy the many tree companies and more respectfully request sightseers avoid the area.

NEWS FROM MIAMI TOWNSHIP

Due to the significant storm event that occurred in parts of Miami Township on July 6th the

Township Service Department will begin limited curbside brush pickup. Due to the large

volume involved and the time required to get back to normal the weekly duties of the Service

Department the curbside pickup will occur in those neighborhoods that had the storm damage

and are not intended for general pruning of trees that residents may take advantage of in other

parts of the Township. The areas of the Township that will receive the brush pickup will be the

neighborhoods along the Branch Hill-Guinea Pike corridor as far north as approximately the

Belle Meade neighborhood to the east as far as the State Route 48/Smith Road area and

extending down to SR 28. The areas impacted that will have curbside brush pickup are shown

approximately in the area in red on the map below.

The items will be limited to only tree limbs and brush not construction materials or trash.

Property owners will need to have the brush placed along the edge of the road or back of the curb

outside of any lanes of travel.

As always all Township residents may also utilize the Township’s brush voucher program by

picking up free brush vouchers at the Miami Township Civic Center or the Miami Township

Police Department and then drop off tree limbs and brush at the Bzak Landscaping located at

931 Round Bottom Road.

For additional information please contact the Service Department at 513-248-3728 or the

Township Administration at 513-248-3725.

CIVIC CENTER OPEN

Reminder to residents that the Township Civic Center is open and has power and public WiFi. Feel free to come up to charge phones or cool off. Please stay safe!

An officer found 46-year-old Joshua Michael Mollica of Gainesville in the wee hours Thursday “passed out in the driver seat slumped over the center console” according to an arrest report from the Lady Lake Police Department. An officer approached the truck and knocked on the window waking up Mollica.

A check revealed that Mollica’s driver’s license is suspended. The prescription sleep aid Ramelteon was found in the truck and it appeared Mollica did not have a prescription for the pills. He claimed he was unaware they had been in the truck. Also found in the truck were 1.6 grams of methamphetamine and a glass pipe.

The New Jersey native was initially taken to UF Health-Leesburg Hospital for a medical evaluation. He was later booked at the Lake County Jail on charges of driving while license suspended possession of methamphetamine possession of Ramelteon without a prescription and possession of drug paraphernalia. Bond was set at $5500.",,,,,,

Community Bank’s President of Banking Barb Maculloch along with professional golf pro and Pittston Area alum Brandon Matthews take questions Community Bank’s private customer golf tournament at Glenmaura National Golf Club Moosic.

Mark Tryniski Community Bank president/CEO gets a few tips from golf touring pro Brandon Matthews at Glenmaura National Golf Club on Thursday July 7. Community Bank is a corporate sponsor of Matthews.

MOOSIC — A mix of awe stunned silence and a few chuckles filled the air as Brandon Matthews hit shot after shot from the Glenmaura practice range with his gallery of spectators shaking their heads as each ball carried out toward the flagsticks.

All at the country club for the annual Community Bank Summer Classic golf tournament the golfers were treated to a clinic led by Matthews the Pittston Area graduate who has played his way from Dupont to Temple University to all the way to last month’s U.S. Open in Boston.

With a weekend off from the Korn Ferry Tour — where he currently sits in fourth place in the tour’s points standings and has played well enough to earn a PGA Tour card for the 2022-23 season — Matthews made his way back home to Northeastern Pennsylvania to take part in the Summer Classic.

“To be back home it’s really special” Matthews said Thursday after arriving at Glenmaura with his fiancee Danielle and their dog Biggie. “I don’t get to do it as much anymore unfortunately but every time I’m able to come home is pretty fun.”

Before hitting the range for some practice Matthews was greeted outside the club by Barbara Maculloch the president of Pennsylvania Banking for Community Bank N.A. who proudly pointed the out the bank’s patch on Matthew’s left shirt sleeve.

Matthews who reached a sponsorship deal with Community Bank back in May said he was proud to be able to represent the local brand.

“I couldn’t ask for a better partner” Matthews said of Community Bank. “I’m very thankful for them to be a partner of mine and I wear this logo proudly.”

The bank and all of the folks back home who have followed Matthews throughout his career since turning pro in 2016 have plenty to be proud about too.

Matthews has played his way through the pro system from the PGA Tour Latinoamérica (where he won three tournaments) to his current spot with the Korn Ferry Tour.

This season Matthews has three top-10 finishes on the Korn Ferry tour including a win as February’s Astara Golf Championship and he officially locked up a 2022-23 PGA Tour card last month.

“I think we’re in a really good spot I think every week that I play in a golf tournament I compete no matter what event I’m playing in” he said.

“I’m looking forward to the challenge of playing on the PGA Tour on a weekly basis now.”

Just three weekends ago at The Country Club in Brookline Mass. Matthews got a taste of the highest level of competition the PGA Tour has to offer when he played in the U.S. Open.

Not only did Matthews make the field but he also made the cut and played the weekend in a tournament that sent many of the world’s best golfers home early.

“It made me realize that I can compete in majors. I played fairly well over the first two days” Matthews said. “I kind of ran out of gas on the weekend but I think it shows me that I feel like I belong there and belong playing in those events.”

Matthews still has a few more Korn Ferry events left on the schedule this season (his most recent finish was tied for third at The Ascendant tournament) before joining the PGA Tour and he said that he’s largely working to make sure his game is as solid and steady as it can be.

“What I’m doing right now is preparing my game to make sure it’s ready to compete on a weekly basis out there” Matthews said.

At Glenmaura on Thursday mixed that preparation with a little bit of fun hosting a mini-clinic for club members and golfers getting set to play in the Summer Classic tournament.

Despite an airline mishap that left him without a driver in his bag Matthews brought out a number of clubs and demonstrated for the group hitting a wide variety of shots and talking through his approach with each one.

Later when the tournament began with a 1 p.m. shotgun start Matthews stationed himself at the 11th hole for a “Beat the Pro” challenge where he took on each golfer to see if they could put their tee shot closer to the pin on the par-3 hole than Matthews could with donations to charity on the line.

In the way that Matthews was gracious with his time and shaking hands with so many old friends and acquaintances it was easy to tell that he was happy to be home as happy as the crowd was to see a native son return home after all his success.

He’ll be hitting the road once more to resume play on the Korn Ferry Tour but while he’s in town Matthews said he’s excited to see some friends eat some pizza — he mentioned that he pledged to his fiancee to set aside some time for a stop at Colarusso’s in Avoca — and enjoy his home.

“I’m very proud to be from this area. … It’s very special for me to be back here even if it’s for a few days” Matthews said. “The support system that I have here is nothing short of amazing.

“I couldn’t ask for a better place to grow up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzEwL3RoZS1vcmlnaW4tb2YtdGhlc2UtaGlnaGx5LXRveGljLW1hbi1tYWRlLWNoZW1pY2Fscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The origin of these highly toxic man-made chemicals,"PFAS are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances highly toxic man-made chemicals used in industrial and consumer products since the 1950s.

The chemicals have been added to nonstick cookware water-repellent clothing stain-resistant fabrics and carpets cosmetics firefighting foams food packaging and other products that resist grease oil and water.

PFAS persist in the environment and accumulate in people animals and aquatic life. These “forever chemicals” are in the blood of nearly every American including newborn babies.

Industry records show 3M and DuPont the chief manufacturers of PFAS hid what they knew about the dangers for decades. Beginning in the mid-2000s independent studies linked exposure to very small concentrations of certain PFAS to cancer birth defects reproductive and immune system harm high cholesterol and obesity.

Yet PFAS still aren’t regulated by the federal government.

The sun sets behind the control tower of the former Loring Air Force Base on July 18 2020 in Limestone Maine. The Air Force planned to test multiple sites at the former Loring Air Force Base for contamination by forever chemicals. Officials were concerned about PFAS contamination from firefighting foam used on Loring’s runway.

1938: A DuPont scientist inadvertently discovers polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE. Eight years later the company begins selling commercial products with PFTE under the Teflon brand.

1947: 3M begins mass producing PFOA a PFAS chemical DuPont starts buying from its rival four years later to prevent Teflon powder from clumping during production.

1950: 3M mice study reveals PFAS build up in blood.

1953: A 3M chemist spills another PFAS called PFOS on a tennis shoe. The chemical repels oil and water prompting the company to create the Scotchgard brand of anti-stain products.

1960: Food and Drug Administration approves Teflon nonstick cookware.

1961: DuPont confirms PFOA is toxic in animals and causes observable changes in organ functions.

1966: Working with 3M the U.S. Navy secures a patent for aqueous firefighting foam a PFAS-containing product. 3M sells it to fire departments in 5-gallon buckets.

1967: Food and Drug Administration approves Zonyl a PFAS coating DuPont sells for food packaging.

1970: A company that purchased 3M’s firefighting foam finds it kills fish prompting the abrupt halt of a pilot study.

1973: DuPont study documents liver damage from exposure to PFAS in food packaging.

1975: University of Florida researcher asks 3M whether Scotchgard and Teflon products are source of fluorinated chemicals detected in samples from New York and Texas blood banks. 3M executives “plead ignorance” but secretly confirm the findings.

1978: 3M concludes PFOA and PFOS “should be regarded as toxic.” DuPont worries PFOA might be causing ”toxic effects” among employees at its Teflon plant in West Virginia but does not share the information outside the company.

1980s: DuPont and 3M reassign female workers after children of Teflon plant employees are born with facial disfigurations and other birth defects. DuPont discovers high levels of the chemical in drinking water outside the Teflon plant. None of this is shared outside the company.

Early to mid-1990s: DuPont discovers increased rates of cancer among PFAS workers three years after 3M found a similar pattern among its workers.

1998: 3M scientist Richard Purdy tells his bosses PFOS moves throughout the food chain. The company warns the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the first time that PFOS accumulates in human blood.

1999: Purdy quits 3M in protest calling PFOS more damaging than banned PCBs.

2000: U.S. EPA pressures 3M to phase out the Scotchgard and Teflon chemicals PFOS and PFOA five months before DuPont settles a lawsuit that began unraveling the secret history of PFAS.

2002: U.S. EPA concludes that cancerous tumors in rats exposed to PFOA “are relevant to humans.”

2004: DuPont settles a class-action lawsuit and agrees to finance a study of PFOA’s effects on people living near the company’s Teflon plant in Parkersburg West Virginia.

2005-2006: DuPont fined $10.2 million and 3M $1.5 million for failing to report PFAS studies to U.S. EPA.

2007: Study estimates PFOA and PFOS are in the blood of more than 98% of Americans.

2009: During the last month of President George W. Bush’s administration U.S. EPA announces “health advisory” limits of 400 parts per trillion for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS in drinking water. But the agency declines to regulate the chemicals.

2009: Chicago Department of Water Management finds PFOS in treated Lake Michigan water distributed to more than 5 million Illinoisans shortly after testing commissioned by the Chicago Tribune first revealed that PFOA and PFOS contaminate local drinking water.

2012: Landmark study of 70000 people living near DuPont’s Teflon plant links PFOA exposure to six diseases: testicular and kidney cancer high cholesterol ulcerative colitis thyroid disease and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

2013-14: During a nationwide study of select water systems U.S. EPA finds high levels of PFOA and PFOS in the drinking water of Freeport a small industrial city west of Rockford. Neither federal nor state officials look for the chemicals throughout the rest of Illinois.

A new water well will replace PFAS-contaminated wells near the old water treatment plant in Freeport Illinois Aug. 24 2021. Freeport is one of the Illinois cities where PFAS chemicals were tested for and detected in drinking water.

2016: U.S. EPA issues a more stringent health advisory for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water: 70 parts per trillion. President Barack Obama’s administration does not regulate the chemicals though.

2017: After losing three personal injury lawsuits in federal court DuPont settles dozens of others accusing the company of responsibility for PFOA-related health problems. DuPont agrees to pay $671 million to more than 3500 people harmed. Three years later the company settles 100 additional claims for $81 million.

2017: GenX a Teflon PFAS that DuPont vowed was safer than PFOA is detected for the first time in drinking water 100 miles downstream from the company’s Fayetteville North Carolina factory. The North Carolina State University researcher who found the chemical estimates at least 250000 people are at risk.

2018: 3M agrees to pay $850 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota after high levels of PFAS are detected in drinking water near one of the company’s manufacturing plants in Cottage Grove a Minneapolis suburb.

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson speaks during an interview at the State Capitol in St. Paul Minnesota on March 12 2018. Swanson said she’s particularly proud of the $850 million settlement she reached with 3M last month in a lawsuit alleging the manufacturer’s chemicals contaminated groundwater in the eastern Twin Cities metro area. It’s the largest environmental settlement in Minnesota history and the third-largest natural resource damage settlement in U.S. history.

2019: PFAS contaminate drinking water or groundwater at nearly 400 military bases that used firefighting foam the nonprofit Environmental Working Group finds. The number of bases with confirmed PFAS contamination jumps to 679 by July 2021.

2020: The Illinois EPA launches long-delayed statewide investigation of PFAS in drinking water.

2021: President Joe Biden’s administration announces a “strategic road map” to address PFAS pollution nationwide. Illinois EPA proposes PFAS limits in groundwater and vows to limit the chemicals in drinking water.

2022: Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul accuses 3M of failing to control PFAS pollution from a manufacturing plant on the Mississippi River upstream from the Quad Cities.

2022: U.S. EPA issues new exponentially more stringent health advisories for PFOA and PFOS concluding after a review of the latest research that there is essentially no safe level of exposure in drinking water. The agency also issues its first health advisories for Gen X and PFBS chemicals that replaced PFOA and PFOS in many products. None of the advisories are enforceable but the Biden administration promises to announce legal standards later in 2022.

Billy Kemper and Annie Reickert took home the 'Biggest Paddle of the Year' and Mason Barnes joined Justine Dupont as the winners of the 'Biggest Tow of the Year'.

The 2022 Red Bull Wave Award winners have finally been announced. Francisco Porcella and Justine Dupont won the ‘Ride of the Year’. Billy Kemper and Annie Reickert took home the ‘Biggest Paddle of the Year’ and Mason Barnes joined Justine Dupont as the winners of the ‘Biggest Tow of the Year’.

Ride of the Year

The ‘Ride of the Year’ is awarded to the surfer who illustrated the most difficult advances and creative level of surfing. The ride has to be completed and be a success to be recognised.

For example if a surfer is able to put together the most advanced and difficult routine but fails to pull it off he could not be recognised as a nominee.

The successful ride is then judged by the footage on offer. What most people don’t know is that while the raw size of the wave is taken into consideration it is all about the performance not the size of the wave.

Biggest Paddle of the Year

The ‘Biggest Paddle of the Year’ award goes to any surfer who paddled into a wave and the rode the biggest wave. Just like the other awards the surfer has to successfully ride it and not fall of their board.

Both winners achieved their winning wave from Jaws in Maui Hawaii. These waves are known as the heaviest and fastest in the whole Pacific Ocean as they range from anywhere between 10-25 metres long.

It is a well-known fact that the Jaws waves can be heard from miles away as you can hear the waves breaking over the reef under the water.

Biggest Tow of the Year

The ‘Biggest Tow of the Year’ award goes to the surfer that catches and successfully rides the biggest wave using any means necessary.

This year both winners caught their wave from Nazaré Portugal. The Nazaré waves are iconic and are a must-do for any professional surfer or daredevil. They are known for having the biggest waves in the world.

This is due to a submarine canyon causing the unpredictability of the waves. The canyon is 200km long and 5km deep. Described by surfers as a “freakshow” Nazaré will continually provide surfers with big waves.

ADVERTISEMENT

When a group of friends realised they could hack one of the most popular video games ever invented it wasn’t long before serious money started rolling in.

In 2013 23-year-old programmer Anthony Clark and three of his friends found a way to generate huge amounts of in-game currency from EA Sports’ FIFA game.

Anthony described as the ‘mastermind’ of the operation had devised a hack which tricked EA Sports’ servers into thinking a game had been completed. They would then automatically award a coin – for games that had never been played.

Once this process was scaled up the group were able to create vast amounts of the coins which they then sold on to gamers around the world to the incredible tune of sixteen million dollars.

Anthony and his friends were suddenly rich beyond their wildest dreams making dizzying amounts of money on a daily basis.

Eaton Zveare purchased a Mercedes AMG CLA 45 Hacker Hunter

Rich beyond their wildest dreams

Eaton Zveare one of the group of programmers said: “At its peak it could have been like $500000 a day. One of the first things I bought was a car. I purchased a Mercedes AMG CLA 45. I paid in cash.”

As for Anthony he reportedly showered his family with gifts not least a house for his mother. For him as a school friend said this was “the accomplishment of all accomplishments.”

But the group’s soaring earnings had not gone unnoticed by the FBI. Unbeknown to Anthony and his friends the agency had approached Electronic Arts the company behind the game.

Federal prosecutor Brian Poe said: “What drew us to this case was the amount of money that these kids were able to make – there’s $16 million. There’s Lamborghinis and Mercedes.”

“On September the 17th of 2015 we executed search warrants simultaneously. They had no idea that the federal agents were going to show up at their home.” he continued.

To their shock the FBI raided the friends’ homes early that morning armed and ready to seize assets.

According to Anthony’s aunt Shawn Burgess “At six in the morning they basically just pounded at the doors and then [the boys] were greeted with shotguns in their faces.”

Brian said: “We found a treasure trove of information especially Eaton Zvare’s computer because he had every one of the chats that these guys had had. I didn’t have this goal of sending them to prison. What I wanted was to send a message out there “Hey guys this is illegal.”

The case for wire fraud

But was it? Anthony’s three collaborators including Eaton Zveare pleaded guilty and forfeited all the money they’d made in order to avoid jail time. But Anthony and his lawyers were convinced that he had done nothing wrong and decided to fight the case – a move that Anthony understood was extremely high-risk. If he was convicted he was looking at several years of jail time.

Scott Gilbert one of Anthony’s lawyers said: “For the government to bring a wire mail fraud prosecution they had to prove that Anthony obtained money or property. In the terms of service it literally says FIFA Coins are neither money or property and that was a really big thing to us because we didn’t believe they were going to be able to meet their burden of proof and so we just began to prepare for a trial.”

If this was not money or property that they were obtaining then what were they getting paid $16 million for? Brian Poe Federal prosecutor

Anthony’s team took the position that the coins were not valuable as EA Sports could create infinite amounts of them while EA Sports and the government maintained that the coins did have worth as evidenced by their resale online.

As Brian put it: “If this was not money or property that they were obtaining then what were they getting paid $16 million for?”

In the end the trial did not go as Anthony’s team had hoped and a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

Flood had just retired from a 25-year career in education at Olivet schools. He retired in 2019 but found he missed being surrounded by people all day.

Flood now 54 had spent his entire life serving the community — from his time in the military to being a teacher and principal for 25 years — and he wasn't content relaxing at home. So he enrolled in a six-month EMT course at LCC which ended up being mostly virtual because of COVID-19.

""I did not ever picture this"" Flood said. ""I thought if I could get a job working a day or two a week I'd be happy. But that's not my personality. I have to be out and active. I have to be out doing something.""

A year and a half after starting work at Eaton Area EMS Flood is the manager of the service. Flood started at the Sparrow Eaton Hospital EMS service in February 2021 in the midst of the pandemic. COVID made it a difficult job but that was the only world he knew as an EMT. Now he looks back and sees COVID helped him become a better EMT.

In addition to Eaton Area EMS he also works as a medical responder at the Olivet Fire Department which allows him to get out into his community. He taught in Olivet for 15 years was a principal for four years then moved back to teaching after he met his wife.

He misses his students but now he gets to see them in a different role whether it be at football games or out in the community. It's been eye-opening going on difficult calls and seeing people he knows injured or sick.

""Trying to help community members is a difficult experience but it's rewarding at the same time"" Flood said. ""I think it's a sense of comfort to know (the person) driving them to the hospital or riding in back with them"" Flood said.

Joe Clayton works with Flood at Eaton Area EMS. He said Flood is patient logical and knowledgeable and while he's new to the world of pre-hospital care he has the common sense to be good at the job.

Part of what Flood said he loves about being an EMT is the fast pace. He's a self-described adrenaline junkie and enjoys mountain climbing and is a professional cyclist.

""I still get excited when the phones go off I still get excited to go on calls and be around people"" Flood said. ""I really love my job now. ... The rush I get working as an EMT and volunteer fireman is a lot like the one I get when I'm rock climbing.""

He doesn't see a second retirement coming anytime soon though his wife Suzie Flood said she hopes ""maybe someday"" her husband will settle down for a relaxing retirement.

""It's just in him to want to be busy"" Suzie said. ""I think he likes the adrenaline that comes along with being a first responder.""

She wasn't surprised when Michael went back to work. Even before he retired he'd spend his lunch breaks at work researching how to become an EMT she said.

Suzie was a teacher in Olivet when Michael was the principal and she said the staff loved that he was always the first one on-scene if there was an emergency. He dropped everything to get there to see how he could help whether that be through comforting students and parents or problem solving.

""Under pressure he's great at problem solving"" Suzie said. ""He thought it was his responsibility to make sure everyone is OK. ... Anywhere he senses someone that needs help he’s right there.""

That’s where he’d been the past three weeks hiking up 23 different peaks each at least 14000 feet high.

The dream vacation was ending last week. He contacted his mother late Wednesday afternoon and told her he would reach her home near Abilene in a few hours. But first he was planning to take a short nap at Oasis State Park near Portales.

Family members never heard from Eaton again. His body and his pickup truck were found late Thursday night at the park said his longtime friend Douglas Branch.

New Mexico State Police late Friday afternoon issued a news release that stated Eaton was found deceased from an apparent gunshot wound to his head inside a parked vehicle. “At this time it appears the gunshot was self-inflicted and there was no foul play involved” the release stated. “The investigation remains ongoing. ... Mr. Eaton’s body was transported ... for an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death. “

Branch said he does not believe Eaton would have killed himself. “There’s no way it was suicide” Branch said. “I hope (investigators) do their due diligence.”

Branch said he’s known Eaton 36 since they were childhood friends in McKinney Texas. Eaton had moved to Sherman Texas and Branch to Galveston Texas but they still kept in touch regularly. They’d texted just a few days ago.

“I have a group message with him and another best friend” Branch said. “He was in Colorado (where a sister lives) and he’d just finished his last mountain. He was spending the day there and then headed back home.

“I just know he was doing what he called 14ers. He’s a rock-climbing enthusiast and he would go to all these different peaks. He hadn’t been able to do it for a long time because he has two small kids 7 and 5. So this was a (special) vacation for him.”

Branch said Eaton’s girlfriend “made him keep an active tracker on him” in case he got hurt on a mountain.

“We all understood this is what he liked doing but we know it’s a dangerous hobby” Branch said. “He promised it was safe.”

Eaton’s body was located using a tracking device attached to his black Chevy truck Branch said",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYWNvYXN0b25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3BwcnQwMjUwNjc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patricia Staples Obituary,"Patricia (Dow) Staples 86 of Seabrook passed away on July 8 2022 after a lengthy illness.

Toys from the film phenomenon Toy Story are up for sale on ebay for quite literally hundreds of pounds. You never know you could have a fortune boxed up and languishing in your roof space.

Stars of the mid 90s film franchise that started fans on a journey to the secret world of toys may have entertained a generation or two on the big screen - while the franchise grossed more than $3.2 billion worldwide in the process - but now Buzz Woody Bullseye Little Bo-peep and crew are turning a profit for the public in the form of the spin off merch.

Currently listed on ebay for a whopping £500 or best offer is a ""vintage 1996 Toy Story 12"" Chrome"" Buzz Lightyear figure. Brand new and still in its box 42 people are currently watching the sale. While no-one has yet had the pleasure of playing with the toy a sale at this price is sure to make the selling smile.

Loveable cowboy Woody is next up - and while he's been out of the box - he's still being sold with a price tag of £149.99. The pre-owned toy is listed as a ""Toy Story Woody Figure"" an original 90s ""Singing Figure Toy"" with guitar that is ""fully working"". The seller adds that it's a : ""Lovely condition Woody with Guitar - now rare. ( accessories not included)"".

The once coveted and queued for Woody cowboy doll with pull string - allowing you to hear phrases such as ""there's a snake in my boot' and 'I'm sheriff Woody..."" also makes the list. One used and unboxed toy is listed for £149.99.

And of course we couldn't have Woody without Bullseye. Marginally cheaper at £149.94 for a Disney 15"" soft poseable toy which is up for grabs. Not all Toy Story memorabilia is being listed or indeed fetching such high prices. A used 1998 Slinky Dog listed on a 'buy it now' basis is priced at £29.99.

While the first Toy Story film hit cinemas in the UK in March 1996 and three more movies followed the love for the Toy Story franchise continues. A quick look on social media channels will bring up TikTok's featuring the characters memes and of course the latest drama continues with Disney Pixar's 'Lightyear' a spinoff now in cinemas. However while you may still enjoy the sound of Tim Allen voicing the space ranger in the previous films or merchandise Buzz isn't brought to life using the vocal of the actor and comedian. Taking his place is Tim Allen - Christ Evans the actor who took the role of Captain America get the job. But that's another story.

ADVERTISEMENT

When a group of friends realised they could hack one of the most popular video games ever invented it wasn’t long before serious money started rolling in.

In 2013 23-year-old programmer Anthony Clark and three of his friends found a way to generate huge amounts of in-game currency from EA Sports’ FIFA game.

Anthony described as the ‘mastermind’ of the operation had devised a hack which tricked EA Sports’ servers into thinking a game had been completed. They would then automatically award a coin – for games that had never been played.

Once this process was scaled up the group were able to create vast amounts of the coins which they then sold on to gamers around the world to the incredible tune of sixteen million dollars.

Anthony and his friends were suddenly rich beyond their wildest dreams making dizzying amounts of money on a daily basis.

Eaton Zveare purchased a Mercedes AMG CLA 45 Hacker Hunter

Rich beyond their wildest dreams

Eaton Zveare one of the group of programmers said: “At its peak it could have been like $500000 a day. One of the first things I bought was a car. I purchased a Mercedes AMG CLA 45. I paid in cash.”

As for Anthony he reportedly showered his family with gifts not least a house for his mother. For him as a school friend said this was “the accomplishment of all accomplishments.”

But the group’s soaring earnings had not gone unnoticed by the FBI. Unbeknown to Anthony and his friends the agency had approached Electronic Arts the company behind the game.

Federal prosecutor Brian Poe said: “What drew us to this case was the amount of money that these kids were able to make – there’s $16 million. There’s Lamborghinis and Mercedes.”

“On September the 17th of 2015 we executed search warrants simultaneously. They had no idea that the federal agents were going to show up at their home.” he continued.

To their shock the FBI raided the friends’ homes early that morning armed and ready to seize assets.

According to Anthony’s aunt Shawn Burgess “At six in the morning they basically just pounded at the doors and then [the boys] were greeted with shotguns in their faces.”

Brian said: “We found a treasure trove of information especially Eaton Zvare’s computer because he had every one of the chats that these guys had had. I didn’t have this goal of sending them to prison. What I wanted was to send a message out there “Hey guys this is illegal.”

The case for wire fraud

But was it? Anthony’s three collaborators including Eaton Zveare pleaded guilty and forfeited all the money they’d made in order to avoid jail time. But Anthony and his lawyers were convinced that he had done nothing wrong and decided to fight the case – a move that Anthony understood was extremely high-risk. If he was convicted he was looking at several years of jail time.

Scott Gilbert one of Anthony’s lawyers said: “For the government to bring a wire mail fraud prosecution they had to prove that Anthony obtained money or property. In the terms of service it literally says FIFA Coins are neither money or property and that was a really big thing to us because we didn’t believe they were going to be able to meet their burden of proof and so we just began to prepare for a trial.”

If this was not money or property that they were obtaining then what were they getting paid $16 million for? Brian Poe Federal prosecutor

Anthony’s team took the position that the coins were not valuable as EA Sports could create infinite amounts of them while EA Sports and the government maintained that the coins did have worth as evidenced by their resale online.

As Brian put it: “If this was not money or property that they were obtaining then what were they getting paid $16 million for?”

In the end the trial did not go as Anthony’s team had hoped and a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

According to Anthony’s friends and family he wasn’t shocked by the outcome remaining positive about the possibility of an appeal. He told friends that if he did have to serve time he would do it and then return to normal life and a career in software creation.

A devastating end

Tragically that wasn’t to be. That February as he awaited sentencing Anthony went out partying with his friends to celebrate his birthday. According to his aunt he was drinking heavily knowing it was likely to be his last birthday as a free man for a long time. He had also been taking medication.

Shawn said: “My sister called me that morning and said “Shawn something’s wrong with Anthony he’s not breathing” and I got there and she said “oh Shawn he’s gone. He’s dead.”

Anthony passed away in his sleep a few days after his birthday from what was officially ruled an accidental drug overdose.

He died maintaining that he had not committed a crime and would never plead guilty to something he believed that he had not done. Years later his lawyers still support his views.

It doesn’t make sense to me either. If you missed the whole debacle EA essentially demonstrated how to kill a meme.

Developed by Respawn Entertainment Apex Legends bounced on the scene back in 2019. Set within the same universe as Titanfall Apex Legends is one of the most played video games of all time. Despite that as EA’s disastrous tweet proved multiplayer isn’t for everyone and if that’s you you’re in luck as a single-player Apex Legends title appears to be in development.

Take a look at some of our favourite Apex Legends wins and fails below.

As spotted by Dexerto several jobs have been listed by Respawn pertaining to the development of this game which they currently refer to as an ‘Apex universe FPS incubation project.’ Available roles include a senior systems engineer and a hard surface artist and the game itself is described as a “developer’s dream playground”.

Advert

The listing states “This new single-player title is a developer’s dream playground with the freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits. Our critically acclaimed multi-platform games have always established a ‘fun comes first’ sensibility created with the notion that great ideas can come from anyone which allows creativity to shine and individuals to shape the game in meaningful ways.”

Admittedly this doesn’t give much away but we do know that this game is coming … at some point … probably in the far distant future. The listing emphasises the fact that this is a “brand new” venture so it’s unlikely to be Titanfall 3. Earlier this year industry insider Jeff Grub teased that Respawn were working on a new AAA FPS which fits in with what we’re now seeing.

As much as I love multiplayer games I do spend most of my time in the single-player realm so I’m definitely looking forward to seeing how this game develops.

WHO IS RHAPSODY?

According to an EA release the best way to understand Rhapsody is through her music. The droning pulse speaks of her childhood in Kómma where the tech giant Pythas Inc. controls all. The steady rhythm reflects her supportive mother a brilliant AI engineer. And the booming bass resembles Rowdy the robot companion her mother created to amplify her daughter’s voice. Life was good but good times in Kómma never last long. When her mother was fired from Pythas Inc. for discovering company secrets her family was buried in false debt and forced into the dangerous nightlife district: Neon Dunes. There Rhapsody honed her art. The unrest around her inspired groundbreaking music with a rebellious heart capturing the passion of its people.

It’s still unsure if Rhapsody will ultimately arrive in Apex Legends (mobile or console version) although Video Games Chronicles assures she eventually will.

Now that the newest installment of the mobile game is almost here Respawn and Electronic Arts have given us a preview of what it will have to offer. The next season update in Apex Legends Mobile named Distortion will launch on July 12th and it’ll bring both a new map and a new playable Legend.

The game has fewer features than the other BR games because it was simply published for mobile devices. The creators will fix some of the key issues that players have been having and introduce a few new features with this update.

Introducing Rhapsody the new legend

Through her music Rhapsody can best be understood. The monotonous pulse reminds her of her early years in Kómma where everything is ruled by the tech oligarchy Pythas Inc. The constant beat is a reflection of her devoted mother a talented AI engineer. Additionally Rowdy the mechanical companion her mother built to amplify her daughter’s voice can be heard in the rumbling bass. The happy days were there but in Kómma they never last.

Her family was dragged into the risky nightlife area of Neon Dunes after her mother was sacked from Pythas Inc. for learning about company secrets. Rhapsody developed her craft there. The turbulence in her neighborhood sparked innovative music with a rebellious heart that tapped into the fervor of its people.

Rhapsody received a request to play on the affluent side of town as a result of her growing fame. Instead of using this chance to improve her profession she used it as a ruse to implant a virus that her mother had created to erase the family’s debt. The virus nevertheless turned out to be too potent and ruined the district’s finances as a whole.

Rhapsody forged an agreement with them to participate in the Apex Games under their flag in order to avert Pythas’s fury. However that’s only her cover. Rhapsody intends to maintain her position at the top of the Apex charts until she has enough money to pay her way out of this “sponsorship contract” and reclaim her family’s lives. Here are the special abilities of the new hero – Rhapsody

Global Switch based in Westminster with a price tag of £8.3billion also has major information storage facilities across Europe and looks after data for corporations and governments.

Chinese steel conglomerate Jiangsu Shagang Group – chaired by tycoon Shen Wenrong who built up the business – has quietly increased its shareholding to more than 50 per cent in the past two years giving it a controlling stake.

Kingpin: Shen Wenrong is selling Global Switch which has two major data storage centres in London's Docklands (pictured)

Wenrong one of China's first 'red capitalists' has become a prominent figure in the Chinese Communist Party which runs the country amid tight surveillance of its population.

Shagang is now seeking to sell its entire 51 per cent holding in Global Switch alongside the remaining Chinese investors in the business according to City sources. Management meetings with interested investors started last week they said.

The Mail on Sunday has learnt that Australian Super one of the country's largest pension funds is eyeing Global Switch.

Others said to be interested include Stockholm-based EQT one of the world's largest private equity companies and Florida-based DigitalBridge Group.

The sale revelations have raised fresh fears about the security of Britain's most sensitive infrastructure at a time when the Government is reviewing Chinese investment in strategic assets.

The National Security and Investment Act which came into force earlier this year gives Ministers enhanced powers to intervene on takeovers across a number of sectors including data centres.

Global Switch is Europe's largest data centre operator and has two major facilities in London's Docklands with a third in development.

These store vast amounts of highly sensitive data for banks governments and telecom companies such as BT.

Tory grandee and MP David Davis told The Mail on Sunday: 'In the modern age the Government should be incredibly sensitive about any foreign ownership of major databases particularly when they cover sensitive personal and financial data.

'This is doubly so when the share holders are Chinese and even more so when they are leading Communist Party members.

'Simple common sense dictates that the Government should not allow British citizens or British companies to be exposed to the attitudes of surveillance that are commonplace in China.'

In 2015 then-Chancellor George Osborne heralded a 'golden decade' of Sino-British relations during a visit to Beijing.

But by 2020 under pressure from US President Donald Trump Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Chinese telecoms giant Huawei would be banned from inclusion in Britain's high-tech 5G mobile communications network.

MI5 director-general Ken McCallum last week warned business leaders that Beijing is determined to steal their technology for competitive gain.

Conservative MP Bob Seely a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee said: 'We should be wary in principle of Chinese taking control of critical infrastructure given the amount of IP [Intellectual Property] theft because of spying and espionage.'

Global Switch insists it has no access to any customer data and says it merely provides secure sites where firms and governments can locate their own computer servers.

The move to sell the group comes after the Australian Government agreed to move most of its data and applications out of Global Switch's data centre in Sydney by July 2022 and into facilities owned by other providers amid national security concerns.

The Chinese owners are partly selling over fears of losing more tenants in Europe and elsewhere as governments become increasingly nervous about their critical infrastructure in the hands of foreign owners sources said. 'They fear more is to come as European countries don't want Chinese conglomerates owning government data centres' one source said. Another source insisted that the sale process is in response to 'strong inbound international investor interest' and high valuations fetched by data centre assets.

Global Switch scrapped plans for an initial public offering in Hong Kong in 2019 after business performance was hurt by the loss of key customers one source added.

The company increased profit before interest tax and exceptional costs by 6 per cent last year to £251.4million and revenues by 2 per cent to £419million.

Last month it appointed JPMorgan Morgan Stanley UBS and CITIC Securities as joint financial advisers to explore strategic options.

Last night the company declined to comment on the ongoing sale process.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The nursing home in Riverstick is one of three nursing homes launched by Silver Stream Healthcare Group one of the largest providers of residential care for older people in Ireland that will see its current bed count double to 750 and the number of homes within the group grow to 11.

The announcement was made at the Riverstick home by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and CEO of Silver Stream Healthcare Tom Finn.

The nursing home comprises 92 single and two double ensuite bedrooms spanning almost 4500m2 In addition Silver Stream announced the opening of a state-of-the-art transitional step-down care centre at Riverstick to help alleviate the demand on Cork University Hospital (CUH) as it provides an extension to the acute bed capacity.

Speaking at the event Mr Finn said that the nursing home is designed to be “a home away from home” but is also a home designed to be a transitional care service for the HSE and CUH.

He said that following discussions with the Chief Executive Officer of the South/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) and CUH it was decided that this was how new care centres would look.

“Yes we have long term care dementia care palliative care but we also have a different type of care which is where nursing homes are going. We’re not going to have people in nursing homes for 10 years anymore we’re going to have them in for 18 months maybe two years maximum and that’s what this building is designed to cater for.

“So we’re very excited that we can create a home from home.” “It’s that our residents feel at home here and feel safe here” he said.

Echoing Mr Finn’s comments Taoiseach Micheál Martin said:

People want to be cared for in their own homes for as long as possible so what we have to do is provide for what we call a continuum of care.

He said that maybe that has been “too demarcated” in the past.

Mr Martin said that there will always be a need for long term residential care at some stage in the journey of life and that the good news in Ireland is that people are living longer and said that the Programme for Government commits to creating an Age Friendly Ireland while Sláintecare aims to provide the right care in the right place at the right time.

Speaking to The Echo about the importance of the residents’ wellbeing particularly during the pandemic Chairman of Gabriel Scientific David Woolfson whose filtered bedding products Silver Stream have invested in said: “We have very innovative mattresses pillows and duvets and they’re filtered.

They are a proven barrier to coronavirus so it can’t get in or out of the pillow and mattress but in general it’s more hygienic and it’s really important for wellbeing and will immediately benefit the residents as part of the holistic approach to improve personal care.

The group is currently recruiting for roles in Nursing Physiotherapy Housekeeping kitchen Facilities and for Care Assistants and Activity Coordinators.",,,,,,,,,,,,

An image of Mclean taken by photographer Michael Bradley was then stolen by a German artist who reproduced a copy of the photo to sell on the art website Etsy.

""My mataora has my whakapapa. My Tūhoe side my Ngāti Porou side and my Waikato/Maniapoto.""

Matua Rangi says it is an issue of tika and pono.

""All those issues are sacred to us. If they had gotten in touch with me I could have explained to them and warned them against using my image.""

But under international law wearers of tāmoko have few protections.



Imagery theft of Māori culture continues.

Photo rights

Lawyer Sarah Chapman who has been working on behalf of Mclean says the photo has more rights than the person whose image is being used. Etsy for its part has taken down the painting.

""Any use of an image you could argue appeared to be endorsed authorised or otherwise approved by Rangi Mclean himself when that's not the case. So we can use the Fair Trading Act in that way. But otherwise there is no image rights protection in New Zealand.""

""Tāmoko and Māori rights are particular to New Zealand and Aotearoa so they may not be understood overseas or in other jurisdictions and it doesn't have extra-territorial effect if the rights did apply.""

Photographer horrified

German artist Gerd Strizel painted the image of Rangi Mclean from a photo which he then tried to sell on the art website Etsy.

Mclean says he was horrified when he found out about the art piece.

""My wairua has been trampled when it was made known to me that this has been done to me by someone in Germany.""

The photo of Mclean was part of an art exhibition Puaki by photographer Michael Bradley an exhibition that highlights mataora and moko kauae.

""Using an old style of photography and what I thought would happen it would appear that their tāmoko would disappear"" Bradley said. ""But then I obviously needed to balance that with a modern-day digital photograph to see how they truly looked at the moment.""

Bradley says he went to great lengths to ensure he had buy-in from the wearers of tāmoko.

""It's pretty upsetting because I have worked so long to gain the trust to talk to people about the work to say this is what I am wanting to do and they gave me that trust.""

The history of the Baby on Board sign

It's a well-known car accessory but what does the Baby on Board sign actually do? And where did it come from? We investigate.

They are the instantly recognisable sign that you have grown up seeing and no doubt maybe even roll your eyes at these days.

They may not be as commonplace in 2022 but the OG ‘Baby on Board’ sign has spurred on a series of new takes like this Moira Rose from TV series Schitt's Creek ‘Bebe On Board’ inspired sign (carsales even had its own version in the 2010s) and there is an interesting back story on how these signs rose to popularity.

Image: Etsy

Recently I read the signs were meant to alert emergency services should there be an accident so they would know that there would be a little one in the vehicle who may need assistance. NSW Police however have previously confirmed that this is not the case and that they are more to make other drivers aware which isn’t too far from the origins of the signs.

Where it all began

First produced in 1984 the idea originated from Michael Lerner a former real estate investor from Massachusetts USA who had the desire and vision to keep children safe during car trips. Michael had this stroke of genius after driving his 18-month-old nephew home for the first time and was met with busy traffic and other drivers tailgating or cutting him off unexpectedly. “For the first time I felt like a parent feels when they have a kid in the car” he has been quoted as saying. Around this time Michael was introduced to Patricia and Helen Bradley two sisters who had seen similar safety signs in car windows while in Europe but had been unlucky in their attempts to market the idea in the US.

Seeing a business opportunity Michael and the Bradley sisters agreed on a licensing deal for the rights to the signs. Shortly after he founded the company Safety 1st and started pitching the idea to the big US department stores. The first production run of the “Baby on Board” signs were so popular that they sold 10000 signs within the first month. Demand grew quickly and was so high that within nine months the company was selling 500000 Baby on Board signs a month! According to Safety 1st the company wanted to “encourage drivers to use caution when approaching cars with younger passengers”.

Millions of first-time (or multiple time) parents have since purchased the sign across the world since it was first produced in the '80s and the original signs are still in production today despite there being no shortage of copies and imitations. And it seems safety sells with the company reaching US$158 million in sales by 1999 and even earned Michael US$38 million when it was bought by Canadian company Dorel Industries in 2000!

So do they actually work?

But is it making our car trips safer? According to some reports the sign is nothing more than a novelty these days and could be more likely to distract drivers rather than keeping everybody safe. Some argue the signs may increase the likelihood of accidents and are slowing down the emergency intervention should one happen. Drivers have also admitted to displaying the signs when there are no babies or children on board meaning emergency services may waste time looking for little ones when they are not there instead of going to the aid of the adults.

In pop culture

One of the most famous examples of Baby on Board comes from the iconic TV series The Simpsons in an episode when Homer starts a barbershop quartet and rises to fame with a song called Baby on Board. Homer had the idea for the song after Marge had shown him a Baby On Board sign she was going to put in their car ""Now people will stop intentionally ramming our car"".

They do not want jobs they want autonomy and purpose in their career. Therefore instead of finding power in pre-existing social structures they are creating new ones online” said Utkarsh Amitabh CEO of Capital Ventures and author of Passion Economy and the Side Hustle Revolution . He explains how Gen Z now aged between 18 and 25 years old has been able to monetise doing what they love rather than chasing paychecks.

And they run their businesses doing what they do best – sharing chilling and creating Reels.

New Delhi: Gen Z has often been called the ‘irresponsible’ generation one that will choose fun over fortitude. But the pandemic has birthed a whole new army of Indian Gen Z entrepreneurs and small business owners on social media – selling everything from handmade letters to cakes to thrift clothes.

It’s about creating communities and then monetising them. “The magic of their business lies in the interaction of commerce culture and community.”

It’s not as if this young generation of urban entrepreneurs is giving veteran startups and business moguls a run for their money. Not yet anyway. For the most part these ‘businesses’ are a hobby or a way to make extra income on the side while they get on with life.

Crochet and customer base

Eighteen-year-old Nishma Soni from Ahmedabad for instance monetises her love for painting on Instagram and offers customised designs on everything from plates and mugs to T-shirts under the brand name Urrban Flowers. Expanding the business or making profit is not her end game as she wants to focus on her acting career and theatre. But Urrban Flowers offers her the space to paint and showcase her talent. Most of the products on sale are priced between Rs 250 and Rs 1000 depending on the medium size and customisation required. “Through my sales I get back just a little over what I spend but it just makes me happy to create things for people” she said.

Many of these small ventures took shape during the pandemic and lockdown years of 2020-21 when college and school students found themselves with plenty of free time and nowhere to go. They were living their lives on social media and tapping into that extensive and active network was the next logical step. Instagram Etsy and even Facebook have levelled the playing field. Personal connections on social media are transformed into a consumer base.

It’s how Ayaan Shariq 19 from Dehradun started his small business Lilacs in the Closet in May 2021. During the pandemic Ayaan and his mother took to crocheting as a way to spend time productively. Gradually they became confident in their artwork and they decided to sell some of the crochet work on Instagram. The most expensive product currently on sale for Rs 850 is a cute green ‘froggie bucket’ hat complete with crocheted black and white googly eyes. Daisy keychains sunflower earrings bookmarks and crocheted lavender stems are some of the products that Ayaan and his mother make and sell online.

His online business took a hit when he returned to college Ashoka University in Haryana’s Sonepat.

“But I put a stall during the Spring Haat a one-day haat in the university itself a marketplace for people to show their products to see the response from my target customer base women between 18-24 years. Everything I put on the table—from bookmarks to keychains—was sold long before the day ended” he said.

In today’s age of mass production and consumption buyers are on the hunt for something unique that cannot be bought off the racks of fast fashion outlets. Soni’s customised art and Shariq’s crocheted jewellery tick all the right boxes.

A market for hand-written letters

Not every venture remains a side hobby. Some like Ahmedabad’s Soumyaa 19 realised the potential of her business. She started Dessertelier to promote baking and eggless desserts via online platforms. “It’s already a small business which we’re now working towards expanding to a cloud kitchen setup. We’re also aiming for physical outlets” she says. She has been baking since childhood and professionally forayed into the field over a year ago.

Shariq however finds business on social media to be more efficient than brick-and-mortar stores. On Instagram algorithms help your content reach those already interested in it. “You don’t need to have an inventory that is at the risk of being wasted deadstock is reduced and the social media algorithm helps you with your market research as well” he said.

Gen Z ventures are less traditional and instead focus on experiences and feelings. Using social media to express their thoughts build stories and reels around their products helps them make a more personal connection with both their brand as well as their buyers.

Shraddha 21 used her experience of getting out of a toxic relationship to market the power of affirmation and the written word. She realised there must be so many people like her around the world seeking some sort of affirmation but not getting it from their loved ones. That was the genesis of Letters By Shraddha which came into being in July 2020 right after the first lockdown.

She offers customers a chance to put their thoughts into words. She provides the handmade paper and theme. “I have always wanted to receive a handmade letter” she says “I still have not received one but instead sent almost 2100 letters.”

The letters are priced between Rs 500 and Rs 700 based on the length of the content the paper selected (plain burnt edges coffee or golden edged) and the packaging – rose petal seal or normal wax seal with an envelope. She has started marketing DIY kits which include paper seals and other tools that a buyer can use to pen a letter.

Letters By Shraddha has over 16oooo followers who are hooked to the ‘stories’ that she creates on her handle.

Money money reels

A product no matter how innovative it is can take a brand only so far. So Gen Z entrepreneurs have mastered the art of content creation. From aesthetics photoshoots to Instagram and Facebook reels they keep thinking of ways to use graphics and media formats to create new stories for their products.

Shraddha’s handmade letter business saw a sudden boom when three of her reels went viral in November 2020. She hit her first profit mark earning Rs 1 lakh in February 2021 after Valentine’s Day. So far she’s been able to sustain sales; her gross profit was Rs 40000-80000 per month she said.

Kamiya Arya 19 a student at Jay Hind College Mumbai studying financial markets finds this fascinating. She explains how the aestheticisation of social media has become a way for small businesses to operate – Gen Z or not. “They spend a lot of time developing perfect content based on the aesthetics of their product. The consistency of their posts and the nature of their graphics then start to reflect on how audiences perceive them as and this gets them orders from people yonder and beyond” says Kamiya.

Juwairya Siddiqui an Economics and Psychology student at Ashoka University who follows various small businesses talks about how her friends and acquaintances realised that their hobbies and art can fetch them appreciation and money.

“People always think that if you are interested in something you can get it for free” she says.

Gen Z businesses are upending this belief. Your graphic designer friend will not always edit your reel for free and your BFF who makes the most amazing brownies does not have to give you an endless supply of baked goods. But you can order it on Instagram."

• An extensive catalogue of Ford Genuine and Ford Licensed accessories for the next-gen Ranger and Everest has been released.

• Customers can choose from a growing list of factory-backed accessories that won't impact their warranty.

• Ford and aftermarket brands collaborated on designing developing and testing a range of accessories to ensure they're fully integrated into the next-gen Ranger and Everest.

When you buy a brand new vehicle most people are pretty happy with what their cars look like. But perhaps you want a bull-bar bigger wheels or different accessories to make your vehicle stand out from the crowd. However make changes to your new car and you risk losing your warranty.

I once visited a friend who owns an exhaust workshop and a customer drove his brand-new Mustang into his shop as he came from just buying the vehicle off a showroom floor. The car's warranty was null and void just then even though the new owner did not seem to mind at all.

But now Ford has made it easier for next-gen Ranger and Everest customers to personalise their vehicles from an extensive catalogue of factory-backed work accessories.

All automakers have optional goodies you could add to your car so what's the big deal? The Blue Oval brand says in addition to Ford Genuine accessories the company has collaborated with aftermarket companies to offer a range of Ford Licensed Accessories designed and developed from the get-go to integrate with next-gen Ranger and Everest seamlessly.

Michael Karageorgiou vehicle personalisation director International Markets Group Ford says: ""Our goal was to create the most comprehensive factory-backed accessory catalogue we've ever had – expanding the versatility of Ranger and Everest for our customers and allowing them to work play and explore with the family.""

Close collaboration between Ford and leading aftermarket brands to co-develop accessories that carry a factory warranty when fitted by Ford dealers means customers can confidently personalise their vehicle.





The automaker says parts have been designed for easy integration. In contrast the Ford design studio worked closely with companies to ensure accessories complemented the look and function of the next-gen Ranger and Everest.

""We've made it extremely convenient to have Ford Genuine and Licensed accessories fitted by your Ford dealer"" said Karageorgiou. ""You no longer have to search all across the aftermarket to get what you need. You can get your personalised vehicle straight out of the box from your Ford dealer or afterward once you've had a chance to work out what you want and you have the peace of mind that it is all backed by Ford.""

""We're also working on expanding the catalogue beyond launch for off-road and touring. And we'll continue to expand our comprehensive range of tough work accessories"" he said.

More choices to personalise

Collaborating with the aftermarket was vital in helping Ford customers tap into the full potential of the next-gen Ranger and Everest according to Dave Burn performance customisation and special vehicle chief programme engineer Ford.

""You only need to look around your local shopping mall carpark to see just how many bakkies or pick-ups and SUVs have aftermarket bullbars wheels and lift kits fitted"" Burn said. ""Many people significantly accessorise their vehicles to suit their personal and work needs – so we needed to engage with these enthusiasts to see what we could do to help.

""We've traditionally engineered everything ourselves to ensure quality and performance standards were up to our expectations"" he added. ""But we also recognised that there were aftermarket companies out there that our customers were passionate about that had excellent brand recognition and reputation for quality in their fields – and that we could collaborate with through the Ford Licensed Accessory programme.""



To ensure accessories worked precisely the way customers expected extensive computer-aided engineering (CAE) work was carried out exploring durability safety and airflow. Once prototype products were crafted a comprehensive real-world test programme began.

Personalisation ready

For example specific next-gen Rangers come standard with six upfitter switches on the overhead console to make aftermarket customisation easy. The pre-wired switches are connected to the power distribution box. Each circuit is individually fused from 10A to 30A with circuits placed in locations around the vehicle commonly used for the fitment of aftermarket equipment with two sets of blunt-cut sealed circuits under the bonnet (near the radiator support and the fuse box) and one at the rear of the bakkie close to the trailer hitch. A five auxiliary switch bank accessory will also be available for other models with similar capacity to support installation of various accessories customers may desire.







There's also a dedicated space under the bonnet of specific models of both Ranger and Everest for installing a second battery when you fit a Ford Licensed auxiliary battery kit for use as a power source to keep accessories running such as fridges or camp lighting.



Next-gen Ranger and Everest customers will have an enormous catalogue of accessories to choose from to personalise their vehicle. They can have these fitted at the time of purchase or can build their dream vehicle in stages over time via their Ford dealership*.

""The outcome is a suite of accessories fully integrated with the vehicle that enables our customers the lifestyle and the experience they want with the peace of mind that they are backed by a factory warranty and service from Ford's comprehensive dealer network"" said Karageorgiou.

""Due to some last-minute things that are out of our control the carnival will not be coming this year"" said 2022 Fiesta Mexicana coordinating committee chair Alicia Guerrero-Chavez.

Other changes include the event's being shortened to three days from July 14 through 16 and offering one musical stage instead of two said Guerrero-Chavez.

Shuttle buses also won't be available but regular Topeka Metro buses from downtown to the area will be available.

""One reason was that we were just coming back from being off from COVID"" she said. ""We scaled it back a little bit just to kind of do a soft welcome back.

""And then also having the (Country Stampede) at the same time as fiesta is great for the city in terms of having two big events going on but it really taps the resources and so makes that more difficult to kind of plan and utilize what the city has to make these events happen.""

Many traditions of the long-running event remain with food a staple.

""We are still going to have all the amazing foods that people are used to"" Guerrero-Chavez said. ""I know they've been missing that the last couple of years so we are ready and prepared to feed the city.

""I would remind people if they just want to come get the food to come early so they don't have to fight the crowds.""

Grupo Control will headline kickoff teaser on Saturday July 9

The teaser to this year's events will begin at 4:30 p.m. Saturday at Evergy Plaza 630 S. Kansas Ave.

Warming up for the band with Hispanic dance will be Ministerio de Danza Folklorica Sublime KC. Pre-concert music will be provided by DJ Hawk and DJ Khadi.

Grupo Control will tease audiences with cumbia a style of music similar to salsa.

""Cumbia is originally a style of dance from Colombia"" said Jorge Alvarez who is in charge of entertainment for the fiesta. ""Then it arrived to Mexico and the genre hit hard in Mexico. It's like an upbeat kind of dancing.""

This is not the first time Grupo Control has been part of Fiesta Mexicana.

""They came in five years ago"" Alvarez said. ""We had a really good response to them.""

Another plus to the music is that audience members are likely to get up and dance a popular part of festivities.

Plenty of room to dance will be a part of all other musical events which will take place July 14 through 16 on a stage in Our Lady of Guadalupe's parking lot at 201 N.E. Chandler. A beer garden will also be nearby.

This story has been updated. It was originally published on January 15 2018.

Just because you prefer the curved aesthetics of the iPhone doesn’t mean you want to go all-in on the Apple software ecosystem. After all Google and Microsoft make iOS apps that are just as good as Apple’s defaults.

While some apps will require a few extra steps to replace the built-in versions you can make the switch relatively easily especially if you already use Google or Microsoft for your email and other cloud services. And although you can always go back to the Apple versions you may find you simply don’t want to.

How to switch to Microsoft apps

If your computer runs Windows you own a Surface laptop or tablet or you simply like Microsoft products you’ll probably enjoy the company’s iOS apps.

Email calendar and contacts

Start with your email client by downloading Outlook for iOS. In addition to email it can handle your calendars and contacts and works with both Microsoft and non-Microsoft (like say Apple) user accounts. To import any emails calendars or contacts into the app enter your email address when the app prompts you. If you want to add more tap the menu button in the top left then the settings button (the cog icon) choose Add account and then hit Add Email Account.

Calls and messaging

Skype for iOS can take care of all your video calling voice calling and messaging needs. However Apple’s mobile platform doesn’t allow any app to take over SMS duties so you’re stuck with its Messages app. Still the Skype app has a clean look and a comprehensive set of features that includes group chats and group video calls. Your only problem might be getting your friends to use it.

Cloud storage

You can also replace Apple’s cloud storage program iCloud with Microsoft’s OneDrive. When you install the app for iOS it will sync files between your phone and any computer—Windows or macOS—that has the OneDrive desktop client installed. OneDrive also backs up all the photos and videos on your phone though you will have to pay for storage space if you’ve got a lot of files. Prices start at $2 a month.

Digital assistant

When you press and hold your iPhone’s Home or side button Siri is the digital assistant that will launch. You used to be able to install Microsoft’s Cortana on iOS and launch it manually but the company has discontinued its AI’s mobile apps.

Office suite

For your work needs you’ll need to create documents spreadsheets and presentations. Swap Apple’s free Pages Numbers and KeyNote apps for respectively Microsoft’s free Word Excel and PowerPoint apps.

If you’ve already created documents in the Apple apps you’ll need to convert them to a format that Microsoft’s versions can understand. To do so open a file then tap the menu button (three dots in the top right) choose Export and pick the appropriate Microsoft format (Word Excel or PowerPoint). You can also choose how to export the file either sending it via email or saving it to your iPhone’s local storage.

Web browser

If you install the Microsoft Edge web browser on your iPhone you’ll be able to sync bookmarks passwords browsing history and more with an Edge browser you use on a Windows PC. To set Edge as your default browser go to your Settings app tap Edge choose Default Browser App and make sure the check mark is next to Edge not Safari. So when you tap on links in other apps such as Facebook they’ll automatically open in Safari instead of Edge.

Maps

Your iPhone should be fairly well Microsoft-ized by now but for the finishing touch install Microsoft Bing Search which acts as a stripped-down web browser. We prefer Edge for navigating the internet but the Bing app includes a basic map-search feature. That’s as close as you’ll get to replacing Apple Maps with a Microsoft product though because there’s no Bing Maps app for iOS.

How to switch to Google apps

If you’ve decided to take the Google route rather than the Microsoft one start with its signature feature: the Google search app. In addition to searching the internet and Google Maps it provides a feed of news and other information that Google curates based on your previous activity such as your Chrome browsing history. For a more natural conversational approach to Google search install the Google Assistant as well.

Email and contacts

Next install Gmail for iOS. You can pick up your Gmail activity right where you left off on any of your other devices. Alternatively connect Gmail to your Apple email address: Tap your avatar in the top right then Add another account and choose iCloud from the list.

Calls and messaging

Again Apple won’t let you replace Messages as the default SMS app. But you can still manually use Google apps for the same purposes. Try Duo for video calling and Google Chat for messaging phone calls and video chats. While Google Chat remains the most comprehensive option Google continues to add new features to Duo making it a great alternative to FaceTime.

Cloud storage

To back up your data look no further than Google Drive which will sync all your files with computers other mobile devices and your Google cloud locker. For larger files specifically your iPhone photos and videos Google Photos makes backing up a breeze. When you first install the app it’ll ask if you want to back up photos and videos. Keep in mind that everything you save on Google Photos also eats away at the free 15GB of storage space you get from the big G when you sign up. If you need more room you can pay Google for extra space in the cloud which starts at prices of $3 a month.

Office suite

Google has its own office apps for iOS in the form of Docs Sheets and Slides. They interface seamlessly with the web versions so you can keep creating and editing from anywhere.

If you’ve already created documents in the equivalent iOS apps you may need to reformat them to open them with Google’s apps. Launch the appropriate Apple app—Pages Numbers or Keynote—and then open the file you want to transfer. Next tap the menu button (three dots in the top right) choose Export and select Word Excel or PowerPoint. Once you’ve exported the file the appropriate Google app will be able to open it up.

Web browser

Google Chrome for iOS isn’t as full-featured as it is on non-Apple products but you can download it and set it as your default browser: go to your Settings app tap Chrome choose Default Browser App and make sure the check mark is next to Chrome not Safari. Sign into the web browser with your Google account (it should prompt you to do so when you first open the app) and Chrome will carry over all of your bookmarks passwords browsing history and other data from your computer. You can also make sure Gmail links open in Chrome: Open Gmail tap the menu button (three lines) select Settings hit Default apps and check under the Browser heading to ensure the check mark is next to Chrome (tap Chrome’s icon if it’s not).

Maps

Google offers some types of iOS apps that Microsoft doesn’t. For example you can rely on Google Maps to get from A to B quickly and safely and find places of note nearby. If you use the app online or on an Android device you know you’ll also get features such as live traffic updates and a list of favorite “starred” locations. If you need live directions try it in full-screen turn-by-turn navigation mode.

Music and video players

Finally there’s YouTube Music and Google Play Movies & TV which can effectively replace everything that iTunes and Apple Music usually do on an iPhone. They let you stream music films and television shows and even download content for offline access. What you can’t do is purchase new content right from iOS so if you’re buying or renting something new you’ll need to pay up on a computer or other device before the content shows up on your iPhone.",,,,,,,,,
XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzEwLzEtZ3JlZW4tZmxhZy1mb3ItZXh4b25tb2JpbC1pbi0yMDIyLWFuZC0xLXJlZC1mbGFnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 Green Flag for ExxonMobil in 2022 and 1 Red Flag,"ExxonMobil has benefited from the massive run-up in oil prices but not everything is positive at this energy giant.

ExxonMobil (XOM -0.50%) is probably the most widely recognized energy company in the U.S. That's both a good thing and a bad thing as this bellwether tries to navigate an industry that is known for its volatility and dirty image. Halfway through 2022 it is pretty clear that there's a big tailwind here. But it is equally obvious that there's also a lingering problem that management is trying to deal with. Here's what you need to know.

A lofty green flag

Oil and natural gas prices are notoriously volatile and prone to swift and dramatic swings. In 2020 which was just two years ago the price of West Texas Intermediate crude actually fell below zero for a brief moment. That was during the coronavirus pandemic and there were other technical factors involved but it was a dramatic and historic event. And yet in mid-2022 oil is trading around $100 per barrel.

Although that could clearly change (see: the recent one-day oil price drop of nearly 10%) right now relatively high prices are a huge benefit for Exxon. To put some numbers on that the company lost $0.33 per share in 2020. As oil prices rebounded it earned $5.38 per share in 2021. In the first quarter of 2022 meanwhile the company posted adjusted earnings of $2.07 per share up from $0.65 in the same period of 2021.

Simply put if oil prices remain elevated 2022 is going to be a very good year for the global energy giant. Equally important the big earnings numbers here will help Exxon fund its capital spending plans -- which brings us to the negative news.

The long-term red flag

In the first quarter Exxon spent $4.9 billion on capital investments most of which was in the oil and gas exploration space. The full-year 2022 spending goal is between $21 billion and $24 billion so there's a lot more cash set to be deployed as the year progresses.

The worry here shows up when you compare Exxon's capital expenditure history to that of its closest peer Chevron (CVX 0.23%). Essentially Chevron spent heavily on new investments in the last decade and now it is benefiting from that spending. Exxon didn't put as much cash to work and now it is spending more heavily to keep its oil production up. It is not uncommon to see an oil company in a position like this noting that Exxon tends to invest counter-cyclically. But that doesn't change the fact that Exxon is dealing with a sizable production issue.

To put some numbers on that Chevron's oil equivalent production increased slightly each year between 2019 and 2021 while Exxon's fell in each of those three years. Over the span Exxon's production was off by around 6% which is a pretty notable drop. To be fair Exxon's spending is easy to do right now with oil prices high but if oil prices were to fall the costs would be more difficult to cover.

That's not to suggest that Exxon can't spend its way to better days. It has a strong balance sheet with low leverage so there's really not much reason to worry about these expenses over the long term. However in the near term the need for elevated capital investment does pose a risk relative to other investment options in the energy patch. It really boils down to owning a company that is positioned well today (Chevron) and one that is still trying to stem a longer term production decline (Exxon).

This too shall pass

Exxon is using the good news of high energy prices to help it deal with the bad news of elevated capital spending needs. It should get past that red flag over time. The problem is that while this is happening the energy sector is increasingly dealing with investor demands for a shift toward a greener future. That costs money too and makes life harder for Exxon as there's only so much money to go around. It is a well-run oil company but right now it looks like other oil names such as Chevron might be better positioned for the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvam9obmh5YXR0LzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvd2h5LXRoaXMtYmFzZWJhbGwtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtaXMtYmV0dGluZy1vbi1hbWF6b24tYXR0LWFuZC1qcC1tb3JnYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why This Baseball Billionaire Is Betting On Amazon AT&T And J.P.

The development comes on the heels of a dispute concerning oil extraction near Nigeria’s coastline.

The affiliates are Esso Exploration and Production Company Nigeria Limited and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited.

The dispute arose from a 1993 contract for Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company to invest billions of dollars to develop the Erha oil field in the Gulf of Guinea and share profits with NNPC.

Extraction began in 2006. However disagreements soon arose and Exxon and Shell said that by late 2007 NNPC was at the government’s instruction “lifting” more oil than the contract allowed depriving them of billions of dollars.

Following the arbitration ruling Exxon and Shell sought to enforce their award in Manhattan while NNPC sought to set it aside in Nigeria.

In a new development on Friday the 2nd US circuit court of appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in rejecting the entire October 2011 award which by 2018 had grown to $2.67 billion including interest against the NNPC.

It said the judge should have determined which parts of the award had been deemed enforceable by a Nigerian appeals court.

Lawyers for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Susan Carney circuit judge for the US court of appeals said ExxonMobil and Shell did not prove that setting aside part of the award violated public policy and said US courts should not second-guess Nigerian courts’ substantive views on Nigerian law.

But she said the Nigerian judgments were “ambiguous” as to how much of the award was set aside and more fact-finding was needed.

The decision partially reversed a September 2019 ruling by William Pauley US district judge in Manhattan. Pauley died last July and another judge will take over the case the Reuters report added.

The case is marked Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd et al v Nigerian National Petroleum Corp 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Nos. 19-3159 19-3361.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9zcG9ydHMvb3V0LW9mLXRvd24tYWxsLXN0YXJzLXRlYW1zLXRyaXVtcGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Out-of-Town All Stars teams triumph,"Out-of-Town All-Stars teams swept the senior boys U16 and girls divisions when the ExxonMobil National School Basketball Festival (NSBF) All-Stars Series concluded Friday evening at the Cliff Anderson Sports Hall Homestretch Avenue.

Juggling metric and imperial measurements have always been a struggle. And converting pounds to a weight us Brits understand is by far the trickiest. The only reference we have to something being weighed in ‘lbs’ is a baby. And with my rough maths John Hennessey has just ordered an average-sized new-borns worth of sausages some heavyweight triplets of brisket ribs and chicken and enough sides to feed a small-to-midsized army. We’re in Hinze's BBQ a taxidermy and stained glassed smokehouse in Sealey Texas where the food is delicious but the lemonade furs your teeth to the point you think you’ve drunk a Pomeranian. Here – more than anywhere – felt appropriate to grill (or should it be grille?) the incredibly hospitable and enthusiastic John Hennessey on the Venom F5 and his plans for the future.

TG: You announced F5 to the world in 2014. The car landscape has changed massively since then. Have the project's intentions changed?

JH: No… And yes. No it hasn’t changed as the original concept was to be the fastest car in the world – we’re still intent on that. I feel under pressure that I must beat Bugatti and I want the F5 to complete a two-way average of over 300mph. Some customers care about that others don’t. But we said we’d do it and it’s part of our DNA. So we’re going to do it. That’s the no. The yes is that we’ve changed course slightly and made the decision to make the Roadster as we had so much interest. And there are possibly other variants coming in the future. TG: When will we see the F5 do big big 300mph-ish kinda speeds?

Advertisement - Page continues below

JH: I think some perspective is useful to answer that. I believe Bugatti showed the Chiron in 2015 delivered a customer car in 2016 but they didn’t break 300mph until September 2019. So from the first car to a top speed was three years. We’ve only just delivered our first car so we don’t need to deliver some top speed news at the same time. But we’re consistently going fast in testing. TG: With Venom you had years duking it out with Wolfgang Dürheimer and Christian von Koenigsegg – it felt like heavyweight boxing. But just like Anthony Joshua Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury the top speed race has slowed down. JH: Top speed only becomes relevant when there’s rivalry. I wish Bugatti ran two directions but I understand why they didn’t. For us there’s less impetus and urgency as we want the whole SSC thing to blow over. To some people the perception is we’re in the same camp as we’re American but we are building and delivering 12-14 cars this year – I have no idea what SSC is doing it’s not my business. TG: Are you happy with the F5?

5 Mad Men Created A Boom In Sales For Don Draper’s Cigarette Brand Short of mandating that all the actors show up to set half-drunk after waking up in a stranger’s apartment Mad Men strived in many other ways to create a sense of authenticity. Obviously there was a lot of period-accurate detail but they also used real brand names on the show – because it sure would have been distracting if Don Draper was pitching ads for Coxa-Crola or Eastern Union. This also meant that the cigarette brand most prominently featured on the show was totally real; Don Draper’s smoke of choice and one of Sterling Cooper’s top clients was Lucky Strike. And while a number of companies paid for product placement on Mad Men others such as Lucky Strike didn’t but still reaped the benefits. Reportedly during the duration of the show sales of Lucky Strike went from 23 billion in 2007 to 33 billion in 2012 – which is a lot – concerning anti-smoking advocates who speculated that the show could be glamorizing tobacco use for some viewers by showing “successful men in sharp suits” who “chain smoke throughout the programme.” Although to be fair Mad Men wasn’t exactly pro-Lucky Strike; the very first episode of the show featured a scene in which the brand was scrambling to find a way to trick the public into consuming their cancer-causing product. And if that wasn’t enough later the company’s head the fictional Lee Garner Jr. was revealed to be a serial harasser who had one of the most beloved characters on the show fired and even ruined Christmas one year. So it sure never seemed like the show was endorsing the cigarette brand even though they may have sold like terrible-smelling hotcakes as a result.

4 The Fast And The Furious Movies Seemingly Lead To An Increase In Speeding Humans are highly-suggestible creatures; a statement we have no evidence to back up other than the fact that you just accepted it without question. It turns out that one popular action franchise may have had more of an influence on the public than you might have thought: the Fast and the Furious series. In addition to increasing sales of Corona and presumably sales of any product containing the word “family” these movies may actually change the way people drive. After all after two hours of watching Vin Diesel and his pals Tokyo Drifting all over the goddamn place why wouldn’t moviegoers put the pedal to the metal on the way home from the multiplex? Cops have reportedly been “stepping up traffic patrols” near theaters playing the Fast movies out of concerns that amateurs will attempt crazy stunts. And a New York Times study found that when examining “traffic violation data” there was a “large increase in the average speed of drivers who received speeding tickets on the weekends after Fast and Furious releases'' – also “ rates of extreme speeding increased” on those same weekends. So maybe we should just be thankful that David Cronenberg's Crash never inspired a major blockbuster franchise.

3 Wall Street Inspired Stockbrokers To Imitate The Villain Oliver Stone’s Wall Street tells the story of a young stockbroker who goes to work for slimy business titan Gordon Gekko – it was basically The Devil Wears Prada but for ‘80s creeps. Or maybe it was Star Wars for people who did cocaine off of $25 REO Kenny Loggins CDs. The movie became a “cult phenomenon on business school campuses” and despite the fact that Gekko played by Michael Douglas was clearly supposed to be the villain of the story stockbrokers began to emulate his style. While Douglas’ appearance was based on a handful of prominent real-life financial workers after the movie came out suddenly on “trading floors there was a proliferation of suspenders slicked-back hair and Sun Tzu’s The Art of War” – which was Gekko’s favorite book. More recently The Wolf of Wall Street a movie about a literal convicted fraudster spawned a similar phenomenon creating a “spike in the number of searches for stockbroker positions” – probably from people who only watched the first 45 minutes of the movie.

2 The Program – Fans Imitated A Deadly Stunt 1993’s The Program found the late James Caan coaching a college football team in a story most of us probably forgot all about because we were all still thinking about Jurassic Park. The film went from “a forgettable sports drama to one of the most controversial movies of all time” because of one scene in which the young players show off their badassery by lying down in the middle of a busy street. For reasons we’ll explain we’re not going to share any clips of the scene so in its place here’s a soothing video of some monkeys soaking in a hot spring. The scene inspired “two separate incidents” in the U.S. in which “a teenage boy was killed and two others seriously injured” recreating the stunt. Initially the Disney-owned studio defensively stated that: “The scene in The Program clearly depicts this adolescent action as an irresponsible and dangerous stunt by a troubled and heavily intoxicated individual.” But later they “reconsidered” and yanked the scene from home video – and according to rumor even burned the negatives AKA the Star Wars Holiday Special treatment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL2FsYWJhbWEvYmFtYWNlbnRyYWwvdHJleS1tdWxsaW5heC13aW5zLTIwMjItYmFyYmFzb2wtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLWJsYWNrd2VsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trey Mullinax Wins 2022 Barbasol Championship,"The win puts Mullinax in the final spot of next week's Open Championship.

Former Alabama golfer Trey Mullinax recorded his first PGA title on Sunday afternoon birdying on the 18th hole to finish 25-under par and win the Barbasol Championship.

Mullinax posted back-to-back 7-under par 65s in Rounds 1 and 2 on the first two days of the tournament. On Saturday in Round 3 of play he posted a 5-under par 67.

On Sunday Mullinax headed into the final round with a three-day total of 19-under par 297 — good enough for him to best then-tournament leader and teammate Kevin Streelman by one stroke for the title.

Mullinax entered the day in third place but his 6-under par 66 on the final day of play boosted him into first on the final hole.

With the win Mullinax takes home $666000 in prize winnings and earned the final spot in next week's Open Championship. He entered the week at 140th in FedEx Cup points and was likely of either making conditional status in 2023 or going through KFT playoff for full status. With the win he's now exempt through the 2023-24 season.

Plans for the three-story office building at 36 E. Eighth St. remain unclear. The sale included two additional parcels behind the building which hold a parking lot and a drive-thru that exits on Ninth Street according to reporting from MiBiz.

The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs shows Holland Lakeview Holdings is owned by Corporation Service Company. The president treasurer secretary and director of Corporation Service Company is Bruce C. Young a partner at the firm.

The historic property was listed in October 2021 by NorthStar Commercial LLC. The listing was removed from the company's online property inventory by February.

The decision to list came after years of consideration by Fifth Third Bank over what to do with the space. The building is known as one of Holland's architectural gems.

The space began its life as People's State Bank which opened two days before Christmas in 1905 at 29 E. Eighth St. before moving to its permanent location in 1928. The ornate building ""reflected the lavishness of an Italian palace with an Art Deco-style"" according to research by local historian and Holland resident Steve VanderVeen.

The founding directors of the bank were W.C. Walsh John H. Kleinheksel George P. Hummer Douwe B. Yntema Arend Visscher C.J. Lokker and Bastian D. Keppel.

The building is listed by the city as a landmark property.

MATCH INFORMATION

Saturday July 9 | ONEOK Field | 8:30 p.m. ET

ATL UTD 2 (4-12-3 15 points) vs. FC Tulsa (5-10-4 19 points)

Stream: ESPN+

ATL UTD 2 played to a 3-3 draw in its last match against Birmingham Legion on Wednesday. The scoresheet included three different goal scorers for the first time this season as Luke Brennan Tristan Trager and Nick Firmino scored in the midweek fixture. Firmino headed in a Robbie Mertz free kick in stoppage time to steal a late point at Fifth Third Bank Stadium.

TRISTAN TRAGER

The reigning USL Championship Player of the Week is on an incredible run of form becoming the first player in club history to score in four-straight matches in his last appearance.

Trager earned that distinction with his 67th-minute equalizer against Birmingham Legion touching down an over-the-top ball from Mertz before rounding the goalkeeper and finding the open net.

In the Air Force Academy alumnus’ 486 minutes played he’s taken 11 shots; of those 11 shots nine were on target and six were goals.

LUKE BRENNAN

Brought on as a substitute with Atlanta down 2-0 in the 61st minute it took Brennan only four minutes on the pitch to head his side back into the game against Birmingham.

Erik Centeno created an opening to force a cross through sending a ball into the Legion FC six-yard box toward Brennan. The 17-year-old leapt through the air and directed the Centeno cross into the back of the net becoming the youngest player to score for ATL UTD 2 this season.

ROBBIE MERTZ

The Atlanta captain has registered four assists across his last two games becoming the first player in the squad to register two multi-assist matches in a row.

Mertz’s recent performances have vaulted him to the top of the USL Championship’s assist leaderboard as he now sits in a tie for first place with six assists.

The Pennsylvania boasts the highest total of goal and assist contributions on ATL UTD 2 adding three goals to his impressive assist tally.

FC TULSA IN 2022

FC Tulsa currently sit in ninth place in the USL Championship’s Eastern Conference having drawn its last match with Loudoun United 2-2.

Brazilian midfielder Rodrigo da Costa scored the 30th USLC goal of his career in the dying seconds of the match to secure a point for Tulsa; Da Costa leads the club all-time in goals assists and appearances.",,,,,,,,,

The Kela photovoltaic power station is the first phase of the world's largest hydro-solar complementary power station the Yalong River Lianghekou hydro-solar integrated power plant that is located on the Yalong River in the Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Garze Sichuan province.

With a total investment of more than 5.3 billion yuan ($790 million) and an installed capacity of one million kilowatts the Kela photovoltaic power station is expected to be put into operation by 2023 with an average annual power generation capacity of 2 billion kilowatt-hours said Yalong River Hydropower Development Co Ltd a subsidiary of State Development& Investment Corp Ltd.

The power station is built at an altitude of around 4000 meters to 4600 meters and is among the highest one of its kind in China.

Large-scale photovoltaic power generation usually happens during the middle of the day whereas its generation capacity drops to zero at night which will affect the steady operation of a grid network. However the hydropower station can help suppress the volatility and unpredictability of photovoltaic power generation providing an innovative model of new energy generation and consumption.

The Lianghekou hydropower plant with a total installed capacity of 3 million kW is the largest reservoir hydropower station in Sichuan province with a total storage capacity of 10.8 billion cubic meters. Regulation storage capacity is around 6.6 billion cubic meters and can play a key role in regulation and adjusting.

Additionally solar power plays a complementary role for the hydropower station as hydropower sees a much better generation capacity during the high flow period in the summer but much less during the drought period in the winter.

According to Li Sheng deputy head of the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute the complementary development model will further boost the consumption of new energy in the country.

""By complementing the two clean energy power generation characteristics we can also lift the utilization of power transmission and increase power generation benefits"" he said.

The Yalong River basin is one of China's clean energy bases. The operation of the Lianghekou hydropower plant will help ease imbalanced power generation in Sichuan and promote high-quality development of the Yangtze Economic Belt and the Chengdu-Chongqing economic circle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2Vkb3JtaW5leS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L3JhcmUtbWV0ZW9yaXRlcy1yZXZlYWwtZGV0YWlscy1vZi0tc29sYXItc3lzdGVtcy1hbmNpZW50LW5lYnVsYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Meteorites Reveal Details Of Solar System's Ancient Nebula,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2022/07/09/rare-meteorites-reveal-details-of--solar-systems-ancient-nebula/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ1Y2Vkb3JtaW5leS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L3JhcmUtbWV0ZW9yaXRlcy1yZXZlYWwtZGV0YWlscy1vZi0tc29sYXItc3lzdGVtcy1hbmNpZW50LW5lYnVsYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2VsZWN0cmljLWJ1c2VzLXRyYW5zaXQtbWFyeWxhbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electric buses to tap solar power using microgrid,"correction

Iowa State University’s PrISUm solar car got the green flag and crossed the starting line at approximately 9:08 a.m. as they began their eight-day 1470-mile trek from Independence Mo. to Twin Falls Idaho.

The car affectionately dubbed “Eliana” experienced a motor issue shortly after crossing the Kansas state line. After troubleshooting the issue the team decided mid-afternoon when temperatures were hovering the 80s that their best strategy was to trailer the car to Grand Island Neb. the first stage stop of the race.

“We’ll take a hit distance-wise during the first leg of the race but our hope is we can fully resolve the issue so that we can make up those miles in later legs” said Andrew Bowen the team’s project director and a senior in cyber security engineering. “We suspect the issue is with Eliana’s driver-side motor.”

The team spent Saturday night in a hotel which was the first time many members slept somewhere other than a tent since the event began on July 1.

“It was great sleeping in a real bed in the air conditioning after spending the past week camping” said Jake Hafele a senior in electrical engineering.

Preceding the race the team spent almost a week at the Heartland Motorsports Park in Topeka Kan. where they underwent scrutineering to ensure the car was in line with the race’s regulations and then spent three days driving on the track to determine pole position. During the qualifying event the team racked up 530 track miles with an average speed of 32.6 miles per hour. They also recorded a fastest lap time of 3:32 which was second best in their class. Eliana started in fourth place in the multi-occupant vehicle (MOV) class.

The team will spend Sunday in Grand Island working on the car and they plan to hit the road again Monday morning as they head for Scotts Bluff National Monument in Gering Neb.

“We have done a lot of driving every weekend this summer to prepare for the competition and we’ve noticed a trend of bad days being followed by good days” said Austin Beinder a senior in electrical engineering with also serves as the team’s strategy lead. “We think that by getting some rest we will be fresh and ready to go to resolve this issue today and get back on the road tomorrow.”

The American Solar Challenge is an annual competition where college solar car teams from all over the world compete with each other. The 2022 race is 1470 miles and roughly follows the historic Oregon Trail beginning in Independence Mo. and ending in Idaho Falls Idaho. You can track Eliana as it progresses throughout the race here."

It's also expanding an earlier recall of Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs because of a different problem that can cause under-hood fires even when those vehicles are parked and turned off.

Some 2020 through 2022 model year Escapes Lincoln Corsairs and Mavericks with 2.5-liter hybrid or plug-in hybrid powertrains are affected by the recall. If the engine fails in these cars fuel and oil vapor can leak onto hot parts and catch fire according to media reports Friday.

Ford will reportedly notify owners of the affected Escapes Lincoln Corsairs and Mavericks beginning Aug. 8 and Ford dealers will address the problem by making alterations that lower under-hood temperatures to a safe level. Globally there have been 23 reports of fires while engines were on but no injuries the company reportedly said about the new recall.

Ford also expanded an earlier recall of Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs saying in a release Friday that owners should park them outside and away from structures. The company said it's gotten 21 reports of under-hood fires including five since the earlier recall. It said it was aware of one reported injury.

Both Ford and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have pages where you can check to see if your vehicle is affected by a recall.

The expansion of the earlier recall covers just over 66000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the United States manufactured between July 27 2020 and Aug. 31 2021. The earlier Ford SUV recall in May applied to just over 39000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigators with a 2021 model year and build dates between Dec. 1 2020 and April 30 2021.

Ford said it thinks it's identified the source of the problem with the Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators.

The company ""believes the cause of these vehicle fires can be traced to a change in manufacturing location by a supplier during the COVID-19 pandemic"" it said in its release. ""Printed circuit boards produced at this facility are uniquely susceptible to a high-current short and were supplied to Ford and installed in Expedition and Navigator SUVs produced during the recall window.""

The company said it expects parts to be available for a repair beginning in early September. It said it began contacting customers on Friday about the repair.

As in Steve Saleen the American tuner of Ford Mustangs? Yes even he ended up doing business in China. And it’s a story of lots of promises strange decisions and money went missing. The only Saleen ever sold in China was a two-seater (so far so good) that reached just over 100 kph (hmm…). Probably not the car Jason Statham would choose for his daily commute. Confused by this introduction? Keep reading and dots will be connected. Just don’t expect a happy ending.

Steve Saleen

California-born Steve Saleen worked in his father’s manufacturing business and graduated with a business degree from the University of South California before he was bitten by the racing virus. He joined the Porsche Owners Club with his father’s Porsche and learned the ropes. At the age of 31 in 1980 he decided to become a professional race car driver and entered Formula Atlantic. Two years later he raced a Ford Mustang in the SCCA Trans-Am series. There he developed a passion for the fast Ford.

Saleen decided to build his own racecars and formed Saleen Autosport in 1983. His cars were modified Ford Mustangs and he entered the racing scene with great success. He also offered his creations to the general public for road-going Mustangs. He offered supercharged engines body kits and suspension enhancements. His cars were well-loved and successful both in the real world and on the racetrack.

With the income from his business he started two new adventures. With actor Tim Allen he set up the Saleen-Allen Speedlab race team and he embarked on the development of his own sports car. In the late 1990s he restructured the company into Saleen Inc. and brought in outside investors for the necessary cash. In 2000 Saleen presented the S7 sports car. The car looked the business and performed on the track. Still sales were disappointing. Saleen hoped for 35 to 50 cars per year but he built 13 8 14 and 16 units in the years 2003 to 2006.

To reverse the negative cash flow Saleen turned his hand to modifying Ford F-150 pickup trucks and did a deal with Ford Motor Company. Saleen would produce several parts and be responsible for the paint shop of the Ford GT supercar. This required a second factory far from Saleen’s Californian operations. The Mustangs continued to sell well the trucks didn’t catch on and Saleen got in some trouble with regulations. He was fined for fitting an illegal nitrous system on the Ford Focus and lost a court case against an S7-owners whose engine kept blowing up.

On top of that Steve Saleen fell out with the outside investors (who by now had a majority of shares) and resigned from the company in 2007. He quickly set up a new one SMS Supercars (SMS = Stephen Mark Saleen) making modified road cars again but couldn’t sell them under his own name. That was still owned by the old Saleen Inc which kept deteriorating without its spiritual leader. It would take five years to resolve the situation. In 2011 Steve bought back Saleen Inc and merged it with SMS. The new company name became Saleen Automotive Inc.

Saleen returned to his trusted business making modified Mustangs. This time around competition is a bit harder with similar offerings from Shelby of Jack Roush on the market. Saleen also sells the Sportruck (F-150 derivative) and the GTX sedan a tuned Tesla Model S. In 2017 it showed a new self-developed sports car the S1. The car appeared in a one-make race series in 2019 but has yet to be sold in the general market.

Wang Xiaolin

How unlikely it may seem Steve Saleen is not the main character of our story. We turn our attention to Wang Xiaolin who started to work at the Changsha People’s Court after graduating from Xiangtan University in 1989. He held a major in law but had his eyes set on a bigger future than just being a civil servant. After two years in court Wang moved to the USA. There he completed a master’s degree in international development (Ohio University) and then a doctorate in law (Duke University).

After his formal education Wang went to work as a securities lawyer. He made his career by advancing through evermore prestigious firms and finally making partner with prominent law firm Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. He was the lead lawyer on several big cases sometimes related to Chinese enterprises operating in the American market. In 2007 his legal career came to an end when he suddenly resigned from Cadwalader without a reason being specified. Allegedly his dismissal was the result of Wang forcing a Chinese businessman to sell his electronics business to one of his American clients.

Besides being a lawyer Wang had also set up his own private equity investment fund called Capital Wealth Holdings. This holding would become the focus of his attention.

Yang Rong

There he is again. Around the turn of the century Yang Rong was still the owner and CEO of Brilliance Automotive. At the time he tried to acquire MG Rover which found itself in great financial difficulty. Yang and Brilliance weren’t the only Chinese company interested in the British automaker. SAIC Nanjing Auto Geely’s Li Shufu and Youngman Auto were also interested. To up his chances Yang enlisted the help of Wang Xiaolin as his legal adviser. In the end Brilliance missed out on MG Rover but Yang and Wang had made their acquaintance.

In 2002 the governor of Liaoning wrestled control over Brilliance from Yang and nationalized the automaker. Yang was accused of financial fraud and fled to the United States to escape prosecution. He started several lawsuits in an attempt to get Brilliance back. In several of these cases Wang served as his legal representation. All these lawsuits failed and in early 2008 Yang started a new venture. He called it Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Holdings (HKAH). The company was both a financial engineering and an automotive technology company.

In October of the same year Yang established Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Company (HKAC) as the operational vehicle for the automotive part. He asked Wang to become the CEO. What started as seemingly friendly cooperation turned sour very quickly. Unbeknownst to Yang Wang re-issued the shares of HKAC and placed them under control of Capital Wealth Holdings his own fund. Yang was obviously not pleased when he found out and started a lawsuit. During the case both men accused each other of fraudulent behavior. The court ruling was slightly in favor of Wang although the court called his actions a ‘corporate coup’. Wang could keep control of HKAC but had to pay Yang $15 million in compensation and could not use the Hybrid Kinetic name.

Terry McAuliffe

There was a good reason why Wang wanted to get rid of Yang. In early 2009 Wang organized a dinner party for potential investors in Hong Kong flying in former US president Bill Clinton as a keynote speaker. A Chinese newspaper published an editorial about the event asking how a “wanted criminal” can openly try to seduce Chinese citizens into investing in his company. The criminal was Yang who still had an outstanding arrest warrant against him due to the Brilliance affair. Wang decided then that his business partner was a potential liability.

The appearance of Bill Clinton at the event was not entirely coincidental. This brings us to Terry McAuliffe. He was a fundraiser for several Clinton campaigns (both Bill and Hillary) a serial entrepreneur one-time chairman of the Democratic Party and had political aspirations of his own (running for Virginia governor). McAuliffe had a Rolodex the size of a Ferris wheel. Wang was on one of the cards the two having met during Wang’s lawyer days.

When Wang gained control of HKAC he teamed up with McAuliffe. He merged HKAC with a shell company owned by the politician called GreenTech. The merger company was called GreenTech Automotive (GTA) and 75/25 owned by Wang and McAuliffe. Wang choose McAuliffe for his large Rolodex and and the American delivered in two ways.

First Wang wanted to finance GTA through the EB-5 Immigration Investor program. That program issued foreign nationals a permanent green card if they invested $05 or $1 million in an American enterprise that would create a certain number of new jobs within two years. A company needed state approval for entry into the program. McAuliffe arranged that a committee chaired by Anthony Rodham (Hillary Clinton’s brother) granted that approval.

Secondly McAuliffe utilized his vast network to arrange cheap loans tax breaks government subsidies and cheap land deals for a GTA car factory to be built in Tunica County in Mississippi. Construction started in 2014 and the factory was finished three years later. Job potential at the factory was the main reason for allowing the EB-5 investors. Wang brought in about over one hundred Chinese investors who all gained a green card but a later audit revealed GTA never fulfilled the employment requirements.

In 2012 Terry McAuliffe quietly resigned as director of GTA. He kept his shareholding for a few more years but in 2016 GTA was wholly owned by Wang Xiaolin.

Chung Sin-ling

In 2003 Giorgetto Giugiaro then still employed by Pininfarina designed a two-seater low-speed city car. The car didn’t generate much attention but it turned up six years later in Hong Kong. Chung Sin-ling ran a small EV startup called EuAuto Technology. He had acquired the design and turned it into a low-speed electric vehicle. Fitted with a bunch of lead-acid batteries the MyCar (as the vehicle was called) could reach a top speed of 60 kph.

Chung had designed the MyCar as an ‘environmentally friendly vehicle for global markets but sold exclusively in the Hong Kong market. A few hundred were made in the first year but in May 2010 GreenTech acquired EuAuto.

Wang wanted to produce the MyCar in his Mississippi factory. He promised the local authorities 30.000 cars annually starting in 2014. Already in 2011 GTA wanted to assemble the car in a hired facility in Horn Lake Mississippi. The company never released sales or production numbers because they were probably very close to zero. If any production took place it certainly ended in 2017. GTA went bankrupt a year later and the factory in Tunica County is now owned by Mullen Technologies.

Pang Qingnian

By then Wang already changed some of his attention to his homeland. China offered friendly policies for electric car manufacturers and many cities wanted a part of the growing industry. Wang announced deals with the city of Ordos in 2011 Changsha in 2014 and a manufacturing cooperation with JAC Group in between but none of these deals led to anything. He passed on the Ordos deal to an old acquaintance Pang Qingnian. Pang was the founder and CEO of Youngman Auto which started as a bus manufacturer and also enjoyed a short foray into the passenger car market with Lotus-branded Proton cars. Both men met during the MG Rover takeover negotiations as Pang’s Youngman had been one of the interested parties.

Wang figured he needed a recognizable brand name to have a better chance in China. So in 2014 he set up a new company owned by his Capital Wealth Holding under the name of Saleen Motors International (SMI). Steve Saleen had just regained control of his car brand but he was still short on money. This opened the door for SMI. Both companies entered into two related agreements. The ‘distribution agreement’ gave SMI all distribution rights for Saleen products outside the USA and the ‘licensing agreement’ gave the right to the Saleen trademark and access to technology and patents.

And so in early 2016 SMI Youngman Auto and the city of Rugao (Jiangsu province) signed a preliminary joint venture deal. Youngman pulled out (due to lack of cash) before the final contracts were signed in December. That left just SMI and Rugao City which operated through an investment fund called Nantong Jiahe. Note that Saleen Automotive (from Steve Saleen) is no party to the deal but Steve was named vice-chairman of the new joint venture Jiangsu Saleen Automotive Technology (JSAT).

Wang got a very favorable deal. Nantong Jiahe would invest RMB 3.3 billion ($500 million) in cash and the same amount as a low-interest loan for 33.4% of the shares. SMI and Wang got 66.6% for bringing technology and future investments. JSAT quickly built two factories in Rugao. One large one for 150000 mainstream passenger cars and a smaller one for 50000 sports cars. The headquarters were in a new office block in Shanghai and a brand store across the street from the Tesla and Polestar stores in Beijing.

Pang Qingnian’s Youngman empire collapsed in 2019 ending in bankruptcy. However just before the inevitable end of his company he sold the production permit for passenger cars to JSAT.

Jason Statham

Saleen is a rather well-known brand among American sports car enthusiasts but holds no pedigree in China. Wang realized this and organized one of the plushest brand launches in automotive history. The day was July 20 2019 the place Beijing’s Olympic Stadium also known as the ‘Bird’s Nest’. Wang was present and he took the stage alongside Steve Saleen Hollywood actor Jason Statham (who appeared alongside a Saleen S7 in the Fast & Furious movies) and Chinese pop star Wu Yifan.

Jason Statham again shared the stage with a Saleen S7. JSAT brought back the 20-year-old design for a final production run. The brand also showed the Saleen S1 another mid-engined sports car which Saleen Automotive had first presented in 2017. During the presentation Wang said he wanted to make a sports car for everyone. Next up was a new SUV called the Saleen MAC announced with a 400 hp petrol engine. So it should be quite sporty as well. The last car was a light small 2-seater coupe that connoisseurs immediately recognized as a slightly updated MyCar.

Saleen MAC at the launch event Saleen MAC in MIIT announcement

From all the cars on stage only the Mycar now called Saleen Maimai made it to production. It was no longer a low-speed car as the top speed now was 100 kph. But for a brand wanting to put everyone in sports cars it was quite a humble beginning. The Saleen MAC also appeared in the MIIT announcements of new cars powered by a Great Wall engine of 230 hp and not the 400 promised at the Bird’s Nest event. The big show drew quite some attention and was the highlight of Saleen in China.

Qiao Yudong

I already told you that this story is not about Steve Saleen. By now you may have concluded that Wang Xiaolin is the main protagonist and I won’t contradict you on that observation. But the most important person is probably Qiao Yudong. He was the manager of the legal department of JSAT and until April 2020 no one has heard of him. But then Qiao puts a message on his Weibo social media account.

In this message Qiao accused Wang of embezzling large sums of public money and making false technology contributions. The report spurred Nantong Jiahe (the state-owned part of the joint venture) into action and they conducted an audit and investigation. The report concluded that Qiao’s accusations were basically correct. Which led to a raft of media publications all digging up some details about the practices of JSAT. A small selection.

Formally the joint venture was between SMI and Nantong Jiahe but Wang had introduced four intermediate companies. These all held between 10 and 15% of the shares and were in the name of his wife or his secretary. The four companies were allegedly used for shady money transactions moving Nantong Jiahe’s millions into Wang’s bank account.

Wang’s contribution to his shareholding was technology transfer. He entered the intellectual property into JSAT but at a much-inflated rate. He once bought EuAuto/Mycar for $16 million but he valued it more than ten times higher in JSAT accounts. A media publication claimed that of all the patents Wang brought in about a quarter had nothing to do with automotive technology but were related to the fashion industry.

The Saleen Maimai was sold online through Alibaba’s Tmall website. The Maimai was available for order in November and December of 2019 and sold a total of nine times. Some different amounts are circulating for the total production number but I haven’t seen anything higher than 35. There is no record of actual deliveries.

In May 2020 the police raided the factory and headquarters. Two people were arrested and interrogated for some time but Wang had by then left China. Like Yang Rong 20 years earlier he fled to the United States. The Covid outbreak served as a convenient excuse for his failure to return to China at the request of the authorities. Obviously JSAT halted its operations and salaries were no longer paid. Rugao City tried to regain as much of its investment as it could but there wasn’t much left. There was some social plan for the employees and then the company was declared bankrupt. The latest chapter in the saga was the May 2022 announcement that JSAT’s factory in Rugao is up for auction.

Steve Saleen reprise

Happier times

In a Wall Street Journal interview in mid-2020 Steve Saleen offered an entirely different view on the downfall of JSAT. He claimed it was all a predetermined plot by the Chinese authorities. First they had illegally taken control of his intellectual property and then they hijacked or nationalized the company for their own benefit. Remember that Saleen held no equity in JSAT and that he had licensed the patents and technology to Wang who entered it into JSAT.

Saleen’s interview came at the time that Xi Jinping and Donald Trump were at the heights of their trade war. Saleen also referenced the human-rights situation by insinuating some people had been illegally detained and even gone missing. The missing person Wang’s secretary Xu Yin had been jailed for a month during the police investigation but was actually released at the time of the interview. Wang later made statements along the same lines but it didn’t help. His image was certainly in China permanently damaged.

This concludes a long story with very few cars in it. And all that’s left at the end are a bunch of tarnished reputations. Just as I warned you in the opening paragraph I can’t turn this into a happy ending.

A message from your author

This is the 49th Automaker Story if I counted correctly. A little over a year ago I started writing these stories and I’ve released a new episode pretty much every week. I hope you enjoyed reading the stories just as much as I enjoyed writing them.

As you may imagine these stories rely on quite a bit of research time consuming research. When I started a year ago I already had a lot of data available to me but it was just unorganised. All it needed was a proper write-up. Now time has eventually caught up with me. I’ve used up most of the stuff I had available. This means that I can’t come up with a new story every week anymore.

So for the time being I’m going to take a short break recharge the batteries and then dive back in again. Because 49 stories is not enough to cover all of the current car manufacturers in China. I hope to be back later in the year with the remainder of the stories and I hope you’ll be joining me then again. For now many thanks for taking an interest and reading my stories and I’ll hope to see you again soon."

""Rozena is a backdoor malware that is capable of injecting a remote shell connection back to the attacker's machine"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin said in a report this week.

Tracked as CVE-2022-30190 the now-patched Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) remote code execution vulnerability has come under heavy exploitation in recent weeks ever since it came to light in late May 2022.

The starting point for the latest attack chain observed by Fortinet is a weaponized Office document that when opened connects to a Discord CDN URL to retrieve an HTML file (""index.htm"") that in turn invokes the diagnostic utility using a PowerShell command to download next-stage payloads from the same CDN attachment space.

This includes the Rozena implant (""Word.exe"") and a batch file (""cd.bat"") that's designed to terminate MSDT processes establish the backdoor's persistence by means of Windows Registry modification and download a harmless Word document as a decoy.

The malware's core function is to inject shellcode that launches a reverse shell to the attacker's host (""microsofto.duckdns[.]org"") ultimately allowing the attacker to take control of the system required to monitor and capture information while also maintaining a backdoor to the compromised system.

The exploitation of the Follina flaw to distribute malware through malicious Word documents comes as social engineering attacks are relying on Microsoft Excel Windows shortcut (LNK) and ISO image files as droppers to deploy malware such as Emotet QBot IcedID and Bumblebee to a victim's device.

The droppers are said to be distributed through emails that contain directly the dropper or a password-protected ZIP as an attachment an HTML file that extracts the dropper when opened or a link to download the dropper in the body of the email.

While attacks spotted in early April prominently featured Excel files with XLM macros Microsoft's decision to block macros by default around the same time is said to have forced the threat actors to pivot to alternative methods like HTML smuggling as well as .LNK and .ISO files.

Last month Cyble disclosed details of a malware tool called Quantum that's being sold on underground forums so as to equip cybercriminal actors with capabilities to build malicious .LNK and .ISO files.

It's worth noting that macros have been a tried-and-tested attack vector for adversaries looking to drop ransomware and other malware on Windows systems whether it be through phishing emails or other means.

Microsoft has since temporarily paused its plans to disable Office macros in files downloaded from the internet with the company telling The Hacker News that it's taking the time to make ""additional changes to enhance usability.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24vMjAyMi8wNy84MTIzMTYvc2FiYWgtYWltcy1iZWNvbWUtY3liZXItc2VjdXJpdHktY2VudHJlLWV4Y2VsbGVuY2XSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5uc3QuY29tLm15L2FtcC9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi8yMDIyLzA3LzgxMjMxNi9zYWJhaC1haW1zLWJlY29tZS1jeWJlci1zZWN1cml0eS1jZW50cmUtZXhjZWxsZW5jZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sabah aims to become cyber-security centre of excellence,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTAvc2FiYWgtbmV0LWFpbXMtdG8tYmUtY2VudHJlLW9mLWV4Y2VsbGVuY2UtZm9yLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sabah Net aims to be centre of excellence for cybersecurity,"KOTA KINABALU (July 10): Sabah government’s information communication technology company Sabah Net Sdn Bhd aims to become the state’s centre of excellence for cybersecurity.

Sabah Net chairman Datuk Mohamed Razali Mohamed Razi said that by gaining necessary skillsets the company could create more cybersecurity professionals and job opportunities in Sabah.

During the Covid-19 pandemic Mohamed Razali said that the technology had bloomed for the past two years.

He said it was reported that cybercrime rose by 600 per cent due to the pandemic.

By 2025 worldwide cybercrime is estimated to cost USD$10.5 trillion (RM46.47 trillion) annually whereas the global annual cost of cybercrime is estimated to be USD$6 trillion (RM26.55 trillion) per year.

In Malaysia the Malaysian Computer Emergency Response Team or MyCERT reported 10016 cybersecurity related cases last year. As for this year up to May there were 3057 cases.

“Based on the exorbitant estimated cost it cannot be denied that the importance of cybersecurity is enormous.

“Thus we must stay alert and anticipate the possible incoming attacks from external elements and be ready with all the possible solutions for utmost protection” he said in a statement.

Mohamed Razali said as an organisation that believes in continuous improvement Sabah Net is taking a proactive approach to cybersecurity by using a combination of industry leading tools designed to provide extremely high levels of protection for its customers’ data and systems.

“I wish to thank award-winning security solutions company Fortinet Malaysia for allowing limitless opportunities in bringing positive impacts to East Malaysia through smart partnership with Sabah Net.

“We appreciate your commitment in elevating the state’s cybersecurity defences amid rapid global cyber threats happening around us” he said adding Sabah Net has been working with Fortinet for more than 10 years.

Mohamed Razali added that for over 20 years Fortinet has been a driving force behind cybersecurity innovations with their ability to detect threats and provide effective cyber security prevention and remediation solutions.

“As such we will continue to adopt Fortinet solutions into our Managed Security Services.”

On July 7 Sabah Net and Fortinet formalised the smart partnership at the Sabah International Convention Centre here.

Also present were the state Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation Permanent Secretary Zainudin Aman Sabah Net Chief Executive Officer Chin Kah Yi and Fortinet Malaysia Sales Director Abdul Aziz Ali.

Zainudin said the smart partnership is crucial to address the shortage of professional cybersecurity and create more local jobs besides providing continuous guidance on best cybersecurity practices.

As for the state government having a centre of excellence for cybersecurity will help to further protect sensitive data.

“It is to enable government digital services to operate without disruptions.

“It is also to help the government’s ICT infrastructure to provide trustable services for the people.”

Meanwhile Chin said Sabah Net looks forward to nurturing at least 100 certified Fortinet engineers in the next three to five years.

The Fortinet Network Security Expert Certification Program is an eight-level training and assessment program designed for customers partners and employees to help close the cybersecurity skills gap.

“These engineers shall not only come from Sabah Net’s in-house talents but also engineers from customers and local Fortinet partners in the state.”",,,

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan was “sobbing” as he watched the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol unfold on television a new book reports.

Ryan who has criticized former President Donald Trump and his hold on the Republican Party “found himself sobbing” during the insurrection journalist Mark Leibovich writes in his forthcoming book “Thank You For Your Servitude” a copy of which was obtained by CNN.

“I spent my whole adult life in that building” Ryan who served as a Republican congressman from Wisconsin for two decades later told Leibovich according to the book. “And I saw my friends a lot of cops some of my old security detail – I’m still friends with a bunch of those guys. It really disturbed me foundationally.”

Leibovich writes that Ryan told him he’s not much of a crier but “something snapped in him” as he watched the Capitol attack.

CNN has reached out to a senior adviser at Ryan’s American Idea Foundation for comment.

Ryan has kept a relatively low profile since leaving Congress in 2019. He was seen as a rising star in the GOP – he was the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee and was elected speaker at age 45 – before facing a high level of scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike over his relationship with Trump with whom he occasionally clashed but also partnered on Republican legislative priorities.

His departure from Congress was seen as a blow to GOP members who saw Ryan as a stable and policy-oriented leader in a party shaken by Trump’s tumultuous presidency.

The Wisconsin Republican has previously decried the “horrifying” end to Trump’s time in office but Leibovich writes that Ryan never thought Trump’s unfounded election grievances “would come to” the violence on January 6 2021.

“Ryan figured the president would bitch and moan and maybe make a big show of ‘fighting’ for his supporters for a while. Everyone could feel good and victimized. But eventually Trump would just leave; hopefully he would know to do this on his own. And everyone could then just get on with their lives” Leibovich writes in the book.

The president’s nominee to fill the fifth and final FCC commissioner’s spot longtime public-interest advocate and former FCC adviser Gigi Sohn has been in limbo awaiting Senate confirmation — leaving the agency without the vote it needs to break partisan deadlocks on crucial policies that impact the ways Americans connect and communicate.

The power to return the FCC to full strength rests with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer but so far he’s refused to use it. That’s harming millions of people especially working people trying to pay their rising monthly bills and those in Black Latino and other communities long underserved by the biggest phone and cable companies.

The FCC’s job is to regulate the public airwaves that bring us broadcast TV and mobile-phone service and the wires that bring the internet to our fingertips. Without a full slate of commissioners the agency can’t move forward on meaningful votes to make internet access more affordable for everyone curb runaway media consolidation or restore vital rules designed to protect the open internet which the Trump administration repealed. Restoring those net neutrality rules is incredibly popular with voters supported by 82% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans according to a recent survey.

Of course the broadcast cable and phone companies don’t want the FCC to function so they’ve launched a smear campaign against Sohn misrepresenting her record repeatedly and dispatching an army of lobbyists to disparage her. Instead of confronting the dishonest attacks on their nominee Democratic leaders have dithered and delayed.

Gigi Sohn testifies before the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee Feb. 9 2022 during her nomination hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.

While the obstructionism from industry and Republicans is as deplorable as it is predictable the reality is that the Democratic Party still controls the gavel and the legislative calendar in the Senate. Anything worth doing in this closely divided Senate is likely to require a 51–50 vote with the vice president breaking the tie.

Schumer may be reluctant to call a vote for Sohn without clear commitments from 50 senators. But a small set of holdouts won’t commit unless a vote is called. And so Sohn waits as the midterm elections inch closer and the Democrats risk losing power in Congress.

The Democratic delays are hurting both the party and the American people. According to recent polling by Reuters/Ipsos a growing percentage of Democrats say their party was unable to get things done lacked resolve or failed to follow through on its promises in 2021. A Morning Consult/Politico poll found that enthusiasm for Democratic politicians is flagging among the party’s rank and file.

The party’s perpetual foot-dragging isn’t just having political consequences. Sohn who hails from Long Island and would be the agency’s first LGBTQ commissioner is a seasoned public-interest champion who’s devoted her career to building consensus on important issues in media and telecommunications policy.

Lacking her decisive vote at the FCC the agency leadership has been unable to fulfill its commitment to diversify local media ownership — a pressing need in light of a 2019 agency survey that counted fewer than 2% of local TV stations as Black-owned and just 4% as Latino-owned.

A deadlocked FCC also can’t restore open internet safeguards or adopt policies that ensure broadband is affordable for all. And the lack of FCC oversight means that people everywhere are subject to the whims of big corporations like AT&T Comcast Fox Corp. and Sinclair Broadcasting that often put profits before people.

In short Sohn is exactly the type of leader the Democratic Party should enthusiastically support. She has stood strong on behalf of everyday consumers and users of new and old media alike. Hundreds of organizations from every corner of the country — including leading civil-rights community-media and consumer-advocacy groups along with unions trade associations and tribal governments — have lined up to support her. As longtime advocates for the Latino community (one of us a former FCC commissioner) we know Sohn has both the political acumen and commitment to civil rights that the FCC needs.

The absence of a fully functional FCC is a profound liability for the party at a time of multiple crises when people rely on an internet connection to learn about job opportunities seek vital healthcare and engage in civic affairs. If Sen. Schumer doesn’t call a vote now Sohn may never get confirmed.

That would not just be a loss for the tens of millions of people whose lives Sohn would improve as an FCC commissioner. It would be an unforgivable failure for a Democratic Party that can’t seem to get out of its own way to serve the public.

But since even the “two moms” claim falls apart it’s worth asking what Moms for Liberty really is.

I pay attention when a new “parents” or “moms” group bursts upon the education/politics scene. I exposed the millions in dark money behind Families for Excellent Schools during a 2016 charter schools ballot question campaign in Massachusetts. New groups like Moms for Liberty are just as transparently Astroturf — a group that claims to be grassroots but is actually artificial turf.

One of the best tools for analyzing phony education groups is a four-part test by Professor Daniel Katz. Let’s see how Moms for Liberty does.

Growth at a pace that only a corporation’s monetary resources could manage. Moms for Liberty incorporated as an Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4) organization a form that lends itself to dark money political shenanigans. It exploded on the scene with its leaders being guests on Fox News and breaking into the Washington Post. It has a well-developed website and extensive social media reach. Moms for Liberty has formed three federal and one state political action committees one of which is a SuperPAC able to accept unlimited donations. Its careers page is seeking state coordinators to work with the chapter chair coordinator and a communications officer. Here’s something I’ve noticed following Moms for Liberty and similar organizations: the “comms moms” — many of these groups’ leaders have backgrounds in marketing and communications. “At the top (Moms for Liberty) … are political strategists risk managers and communications professionals — high-powered women with connections to top state and national Republicans” reports the Florida Phoenix. Moms for Liberty’s press is being handled by Calvary Strategies whose CEO is a former campaign manager and chief of staff to Sen. (then-Gov.) Rick Scott.

Since its inception Moms for Liberty has managed a fund raiser with former Fox News celebrity Megyn Kelly (top ticket $20000) co-hosted The American Dream Conference featuring a keynote from former Trump Cabinet secretary Ben Carson and the upcoming national summit (presenting sponsorships for $50000 are sold out) featuring Gov. Ron DeSantis Carson Sen. Rick Scott and former Trump Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

Who is funding the group and for how much? Moms for Liberty’s leaders claim to get by on T-shirt sales. They’ve barely even heard of the Koch brothers! Yet perhaps they’ve heard of the Council for National Policy. Two of Moms for Liberty’s National Summit sponsors the Leadership Institute and Heritage Foundation are critical members of the Council for National Policy a secretive network of right wing billionaires and Christian fundamentalist leaders that underwrites and coordinates right wing politics.

Who is really running the operation? The two “founders” are former school committee member Tina Descovich a communications and marketing professional and Tiffany Justice also a former school committee member. But there was a third founder Bridget Ziegler. She is still a school committee member and her husband Christian Ziegler is vice chairman of the Florida Republican Party and the owner of a political marketing firm. He boasts that Moms for Liberty will provide crucial ground support for DeSantis’ re-election.

Then there’s the odd coincidence of so many grassroots parents organizations arising at the same time with similar missions. Parents Defending Education is Koch-connected. The Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council claims credit for the havoc wreaked by anti-Critical Race Theory legislation. The Council for National Policy’s Leadership Institute commenced its own program to take over school boards. The Council for National Policy-connected Turning Point USA initiated a School Board Watch List for reporting “woke” school boards.

Do its supposed grassroots members have even a clue what the organization is about? Upstart operations like Moms for Liberty according to a column in Forbes “are operated by professional communications folks and seasoned political operatives but that doesn’t mean they haven’t activated and harnessed actual anger and upset among people on the ground.” It also doesn’t mean those people understand that what they think is grassroots is actually manipulation from secretive puppeteers above.

Moms for Liberty could put such questions to rest by revealing its true financiers. But that would lead to a lot of uncomfortable inquiries questions perhaps even the comms moms can’t handle.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan was “sobbing” as he watched the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol unfold on television a new book reports.

Ryan who has criticized former President Donald Trump and his hold on the Republican Party “found himself sobbing” during the insurrection journalist Mark Leibovich writes in his forthcoming book “Thank You For Your Servitude” a copy of which was obtained by CNN.

“I spent my whole adult life in that building” Ryan who served as a Republican congressman from Wisconsin for two decades later told Leibovich according to the book. “And I saw my friends a lot of cops some of my old security detail – I’m still friends with a bunch of those guys. It really disturbed me foundationally.”

Leibovich writes that Ryan told him he’s not much of a crier but “something snapped in him” as he watched the Capitol attack.

CNN has reached out to a senior adviser at Ryan’s American Idea Foundation for comment.

Ryan has kept a relatively low profile since leaving Congress in 2019. He was seen as a rising star in the GOP – he was the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee and was elected speaker at age 45 – before facing a high level of scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike over his relationship with Trump with whom he occasionally clashed but also partnered on Republican legislative priorities.

His departure from Congress was seen as a blow to GOP members who saw Ryan as a stable and policy-oriented leader in a party shaken by Trump’s tumultuous presidency.

The Wisconsin Republican has previously decried the “horrifying” end to Trump’s time in office but Leibovich writes that Ryan never thought Trump’s unfounded election grievances “would come to” the violence on January 6 2021.

“Ryan figured the president would bitch and moan and maybe make a big show of ‘fighting’ for his supporters for a while. Everyone could feel good and victimized. But eventually Trump would just leave; hopefully he would know to do this on his own. And everyone could then just get on with their lives” Leibovich writes in the book.

Leibovich writes that Ryan hadn’t spoken with Trump since leaving Congress and “he expected never to speak to him again.”

Noting Ryan’s role on the board of the Fox Corporation the parent company of Fox News and alluding to the times as speaker that Ryan didn’t stand up to Trump Leibovich writes that Ryan was “not inclined to grapple with questions of complicity” in the attack.

If Sen. Schumer doesn’t call a vote now Sohn may never get confirmed.

That would not just be a loss for the tens of millions of people whose lives Sohn would improve as an FCC commissioner. It would be an unforgivable failure for a Democratic Party that can’t seem to get out of its own way to serve the public.

But since even the “two moms” claim falls apart it’s worth asking what Moms for Liberty really is.

I pay attention when a new “parents” or “moms” group bursts upon the education/politics scene. I exposed the millions in dark money behind Families for Excellent Schools during a 2016 charter schools ballot question campaign in Massachusetts. New groups like Moms for Liberty are just as transparently Astroturf — a group that claims to be grassroots but is actually artificial turf.

One of the best tools for analyzing phony education groups is a four-part test by Professor Daniel Katz. Let’s see how Moms for Liberty does.

Growth at a pace that only a corporation’s monetary resources could manage. Moms for Liberty incorporated as an Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4) organization a form that lends itself to dark money political shenanigans. It exploded on the scene with its leaders being guests on Fox News and breaking into the Washington Post. It has a well-developed website and extensive social media reach. Moms for Liberty has formed three federal and one state political action committees one of which is a SuperPAC able to accept unlimited donations. Its careers page is seeking state coordinators to work with the chapter chair coordinator and a communications officer. Here’s something I’ve noticed following Moms for Liberty and similar organizations: the “comms moms” — many of these groups’ leaders have backgrounds in marketing and communications. “At the top (Moms for Liberty) … are political strategists risk managers and communications professionals — high-powered women with connections to top state and national Republicans” reports the Florida Phoenix. Moms for Liberty’s press is being handled by Calvary Strategies whose CEO is a former campaign manager and chief of staff to Sen. (then-Gov.) Rick Scott.

Since its inception Moms for Liberty has managed a fund raiser with former Fox News celebrity Megyn Kelly (top ticket $20000) co-hosted The American Dream Conference featuring a keynote from former Trump Cabinet secretary Ben Carson and the upcoming national summit (presenting sponsorships for $50000 are sold out) featuring Gov. Ron DeSantis Carson Sen. Rick Scott and former Trump Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

Who is funding the group and for how much? Moms for Liberty’s leaders claim to get by on T-shirt sales. They’ve barely even heard of the Koch brothers! Yet perhaps they’ve heard of the Council for National Policy. Two of Moms for Liberty’s National Summit sponsors the Leadership Institute and Heritage Foundation are critical members of the Council for National Policy a secretive network of right wing billionaires and Christian fundamentalist leaders that underwrites and coordinates right wing politics.

Who is really running the operation? The two “founders” are former school committee member Tina Descovich a communications and marketing professional and Tiffany Justice also a former school committee member. But there was a third founder Bridget Ziegler. She is still a school committee member and her husband Christian Ziegler is vice chairman of the Florida Republican Party and the owner of a political marketing firm. He boasts that Moms for Liberty will provide crucial ground support for DeSantis’ re-election.

Then there’s the odd coincidence of so many grassroots parents organizations arising at the same time with similar missions. Parents Defending Education is Koch-connected. The Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council claims credit for the havoc wreaked by anti-Critical Race Theory legislation. The Council for National Policy’s Leadership Institute commenced its own program to take over school boards. The Council for National Policy-connected Turning Point USA initiated a School Board Watch List for reporting “woke” school boards.

Do its supposed grassroots members have even a clue what the organization is about? Upstart operations like Moms for Liberty according to a column in Forbes “are operated by professional communications folks and seasoned political operatives but that doesn’t mean they haven’t activated and harnessed actual anger and upset among people on the ground.” It also doesn’t mean those people understand that what they think is grassroots is actually manipulation from secretive puppeteers above.

Moms for Liberty could put such questions to rest by revealing its true financiers. But that would lead to a lot of uncomfortable inquiries questions perhaps even the comms moms can’t handle.

It's a smart addition that really adds a lot to this all-purpose smartwatch's functionality whether you're working out or not. In all other respects this is the same excellent sports-focused watch as before though this time there's only a single case size. That and the lack of wireless charging are minor quibbles though and if it's within your budget then we highly recommend adding the Venu 2 Plus to your shortlist when you're shopping for a smartwatch that you can wear 24/7.

Two-minute review

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus is 2022's successor to 2021’s Garmin Venu 2 and has all the same features with one major addition: a microphone. This allows you to answer incoming calls from your wrist and use your phone’s voice assistant without touching your phone. It’s compatible with Siri Google Assistant and Bixby and it’s a great addition to what was already an excellent smartwatch.

You’ll need to pay a little more for the added voice functionality – the Venu 2 Plus costs $50 / £50 / AU$70 more than the original – but it’s definitely not just a gimmick. Whether we wanted to make a quick translation to another language control a smart home device calculate a tip for a bill or control our music app the ability to simply press a button on the watch we were already wearing meant we ended up using our phone’s voice assistant much more than would have done previously. It might seem like a small feature but it’s a genuinely useful one that makes this excellent smartwatch even easier to recommend.

Like the original Venu 2 the Venu 2 Plus is an excellent all-purpose smartwatch and a solid choice if you’re looking for a single device that you can wear all day whether exercising or not. Its stainless steel case and sharp bright display mean it looks smart enough for pretty much any occasion and although it only comes in one size its mid-sized case should suit most wrists.

As you’d expect from a Garmin watch it excels at fitness tracking tracking heart rate SpO2 sleep cycles skin temperature respiration and stress. GPS has Garmin's signature accuracy and the Venu 2 Plus tracked our measured 5km running route to within just a few meters. Garmin’s latest optical heart rate monitor also delivers responding swiftly to changes during interval training sessions.

Garmin has also made the most of the watch’s bright high-res display with on-screen muscle maps that show the groups you’ve worked recently plus guided workout animations for yoga and Pilates. It’s a smart addition that makes the Venu 2 Plus well suited to anyone who wants to branch out into a new activity and bolster their existing workouts with strength and flexibility training.

(Image credit: Future)

There’s scope for Garmin to add more guided sessions in future and the company has a track record of supporting its devices with software updates long after their initial launch so we’re expecting this feature to become even better in the coming months and years.

If you want the most advanced tools such as live turn-by-turn navigation or training load assessment on your wrist then you’ll be better served by a watch like the Forerunner 955 Solar Forerunner 945 or Fenix 6 but for everyone else the Venu 2 Plus is easy to recommend.

Available to buy now

Slightly more expensive than Venu 2

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus was released globally on January 4 2022 and is priced at $449.99 / £399.99 / AU$699.

For comparison the original Venu 2 launched at $399.99 / £349.99 / AU$629 in April 2021 so the added microphone costs a little extra but not a huge amount.

Design

Almost identical to Venu 2

One available in one size

Microphone on left side of case

The Garmin Venu 2 Plus is almost identical in design to the Venu 2 but while the original watch came in 40mm and 45mm versions the Venu 2 Plus is only available with a 43mm case. It’s a good compromise; large enough to house the new watch’s extra components but not so big it overpowers smaller wrists.

The new components in question relate to the watch’s new microphone which is positioned on the case’s left-hand edge. The right edge has a new button which serves as a shortcut to your phone’s voice assistant. It’s a welcome addition; having to just hold a button for a second rather than browse through menus means you’re much more likely to use it and while testing the watch we found ourselves using Google Assistant far more often than we would normally.

(Image credit: Future)

The Venu 2 Plus comes in three colorways: cream-gold stainless steel with an ivory band (as shown here) slate stainless steel with a black band and silver stainless steel with a powder gray band. All the standard bands are made from the usual soft silicone material but if you don’t mind paying a little extra you can opt for something more luxurious like suede leather or metal by choosing from Garmin’s array of other quick release bands.

Like the Venu 2 the Venu 2 Plus has a water resistance rating of 5ATM making it suitable for showering and swimming but not high-speed watersports or diving.

It weighs 51g making it slightly heavier than both the 40mm and 45mm Venu 2 models (which weigh 38.2g and 49g respectively). It’s not a difference that you’ll notice in everyday wear though.

(Image credit: Future)

The watch is charged using the same proprietary USB-A cable as the rest of Garmin's current watch lineup. It plugs into the back of the watch case easily and stays securely in place though it's not as convenient as wireless induction charging.

The Venu 2 Plus has a bright high resolution AMOLED touchscreen display which feels smooth and responsive in use. It has an always-on mode though this puts a big dent in battery life.

Battery life

Up to 10 days in battery saver mode

Always-on screen drains battery much more quickly

As always battery life will vary depending on how you use the watch’s various features – particularly SpO2 and GPS. According to Garmin the watch lasts up to nine days in smartwatch mode up to 10 days in battery saver mode up to eight hours with both GPS and music or 24 hours with GPS and no music.

We used the Venu 2 Plus with all-day pulse ox deactivated and tracked one daily workout and we found that the battery drained at a rate of around 10% per day which exceeds the stated figures and is very respectable for a powerful AMOLED smartwatch. To put it into context the smaller-screened Fitbit Charge 5 has a maximum battery life of just seven days.

It’s not quite as impressive as the 46mm Huawei Watch GT 3 – a similarly specced watch that can run for up to a fortnight on a single charge – but the Venu 2 Plus is nevertheless one of the most power-efficient watches of its type.

Smartwatch features

Make and receive calls on your wrist

Access your phone's voice assistant

Contactless payments

As mentioned earlier the chief difference between the Venu 2 and Venu 2 Plus is the addition of a microphone. This allows you to use your phone’s voice assistant and make and answer calls provided your handset is within Bluetooth range.

Sound quality from mic is impressive – your voice is easy to hear during a call and we had no trouble getting Google Assistant to understand our requests in our trials with the watch connected to an Android phone. In fact the convenience of having Google Assistant effectively on our wrist meant we found ourselves using it much more often than we would usually even when we weren’t working out.

(Image credit: Future)

The ability to make and take calls isn’t just convenient either – it’s also a welcome safety feature that comes into its own in places where you’re worried about your phone being snatched or you can’t easily reach it in a hurry. In an emergency you can also use a shortcut on your watch to reach a contact automatically and activities like running and cycling have automatic incident detection that kicks in when the watch detects a fall.

If you don’t want to be disturbed you can send an automatic text response to incoming calls and messages. There are lots of preset options to choose from or you can create your own in the Garmin Connect app.

If you’d prefer to run without your phone there’s on-board storage for up to 350 songs. Alternatively you can use the watch to control music playback on your handset via Bluetooth.

(Image credit: Future)

There’s also support for contactless payments (something that’s missing from one of this watch’s main rivals the Huawei Watch GT 3). Our UK-based bank isn’t one of those supported so we weren’t able to test it for this review but it’s compatible with a huge range of banks in the US plus public transport services.

Fitness tracking

Super accurate GPS

Responsive heart rate tracking

Animated on-screen workouts

As you’d expect from a Garmin watch the Venu 2 Plus is a superb sports watch and although it doesn’t offer the advanced training tools of a top-end Fenix or Forerunner it’s well suited to beginner and intermediate athletes.

The company’s latest optical heart rate monitor is particularly impressive offering all-day tracking and responding very quickly to changes during interval training. We put it to the test in several tough spin sessions and the results matched those from a chest strap heart rate monitor almost exactly – though you can also link a chest strap to the Venu 2 Plus using ANT+ if you prefer. It’s possible to hook up a running pod this way too or link a Garmin Edge bike computer or Varia lights.

(Image credit: Future)

GPS is also superb and tracked our measured 5k running route to within 100 meters (a difference that could be accounted for by the fact it’s on public roads rather than a track).

Although you don’t get real-time turn-by-turn navigation as you do with Garmin’s top-end sports watches the Venu 2 Plus does have a return-to-start feature which is extremely handy if you’ve been exploring a new area during a workout. Before you begin select Navigation from the menu and the watch will use GPS to lock onto your current position so you can make your way back when you’re ready.

One of the Venu 2’s best new features was the addition of on-screen muscle maps which show which body parts you’ve been working recently plus animated Pilates and yoga workouts that you can follow in real time. It really makes the most of the watch’s big AMOLED screen and although there are only three Pilates and three yoga sessions to follow at the moment we’re hopeful that more will arrive with a future firmware update.

Companion app

Data clearly presented with useful graphs and info

Compatible with all major third-party fitness apps

Extra apps downloadable through Garmin Connect IQ

Garmin Connect remains one of the best designed fitness tracking apps around and if you’re upgrading to a Venu 2 Plus from one of the company’s earlier watches you’ll find that all your data is synced seamlessly. We had no issues connecting the new watch; just open Garmin Connect on your phone select ‘Garmin Devices’ from the menu and follow the on-screen instructions.

Upon opening the app you'll be presented with a dashboard showing all your latest biometric data. By default this includes body battery (a measure of how much energy you have for the day based on sleep and activity patterns) heart rate sleep stress intensity minutes (time spent engaged in physical activity) steps calories SpO2 and respiration. All of these are fully customizable though and you can rearrange the various tiles remove any that don't interest you or add others such as period tracking hydration and weight.

Garmin has really improved its women's health tracking in recent years and you can monitor your monthly cycle in the Garmin Connect app and on your Venu 2 Plus. The app will warn you when your period is due to start (accurate to the day in our experience) and prompt you to log symptoms throughout. There's also a pregnancy tracking feature though we've not tested this ourselves.

Tapping on any of the cards in the daily dashboard will take you to a more detailed analysis screen where you can browse through your most recent stats as well as historic data. Unlike some other watchmakers Garmin hasn't locked any of its analysis behind a paid subscription and everything is available to view at a glance with clear charts and extra information to put the stats into context.

(Image credit: Future)

Garmin Connect also gives you access to free training plans including ones for running and cycling that allow you to set a goal (such as running your first 10k) plot a weekly schedule for you and adapt on the fly according to your performance in training sessions. You can also tweak the plan along the way so if you need a day off the app will rearrange your scheduled workouts to fit around that.

Garmin Connect is compatible with all the major third-party fitness apps you’d expect including Training Peaks Strava MyFitnessPal and Zwift to name just a few. Linking apps is straightforward and your data will be synced between services automatically with no input from you.

You can download extra apps faces and data fields for the Garmin Venu 2 Plus through Garmin Connect IQ. As you’d expect the vast majority of apps are based around fitness and the overall standard is impressive; many were developed by people with a real passion for their specific sport – whether it’s running cycling Crossfit or something else – and a lot of effort has been put into giving you the most relevant information. You can also use Garmin Connect IQ to design your own simple watch face using a photo from your phone.

(Image credit: Future)

The whole experience is easy to familiarize yourself with and allows you to get the most from the vast amount of data harvested by your Venu 2 Plus every day.

Buy it if

You want one watch for all occasions

There's no need to invest in separate devices for everyday wear and workouts. The Venu 2 Plus is a feature rich smartwatch that's stylish enough for everyday wear and packs impressive workout tracking tools for tracking your training sessions.

You want to mix up your sports

All of Garmin's watches are excellent for tracking running cycling and standard gym work but the company is expanding its expertise and the animated yoga and Pilates workouts on the Venu 2 Plus will help you add some variety to your training.

Don't buy it if

You want to leave your phone behind

Unlike Garmin's LTE watches the Venu 2 Plus doesn't have its own SIM so you'll need to keep your phone within Bluetooth range to make and receive calls.

You don't work out regularly...

...and you don't intend to start. The Venu 2 Plus is fitness focused and if you're not exercising frequently then you'll be missing out on most of its best features.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9nYXJtaW4tZm9yZXJ1bm5lci0yNDUtcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Forerunner 245 review,"Bursting with features the Forerunner 245 squeezes a lot into such a compact and lightweight device. Then again it doesn’t come cheap - especially for a watch made predominantly from plastic. But if you can get over this it should deliver pretty much everything you’d need from a fitness tracker as long as you’re not super serious about your training or too bothered about immensely detailed running stats.

Even though the Garmin Forerunner 255 and Forerunner 955 Solar have hit the shelves the Forerunner 245 is still a stellar watch. The features sensor updates and tracking options all hold their own and while serious athletes will likely opt for the best-in-class new models the 245 is a brilliant budget mid-range option for recreational runners.

For starters the Garmin Forerunner 245 tracks loads of sports including strength training and swimming. It also gives you great feedback on your training to help you tell if your load is too low or too high as well as daily stress insights and an indication of whether you should be resting or not thanks to Garmin’s Elevate heart rate sensor.

Best of all though it has a long battery life lasting more than twice as long as its predecessor when GPS is active. There’s a lot crammed in to such a compact smartwatch but is the design a trade-off? Let’s find out.

Garmin Forerunner 245 price and availability

Out now in the UK US and Australia

Starts at £249.99 / $299.99 / AU$469.99

Can pick up the Music edition for just £50 / $50 / AU$90 more

The Garmin Forerunner 245 is out now in the UK US and Australia and at £249.99 / $299.99 / AU$469.99 costs £50 less than its predecessor ($30 less in the states and the same in Australia) did when it first launched four years ago.

While that price is without built-in music playback support you can pick up the same watch with this function - a version called Garmin Forerunner 245 Music - for just £50 / $50 / AU$90 more.

Design display and comfort

Crisp color screen

Improved resolution display

Comfortable silicone strap

The Forerunner 245 is definitely not a smartwatch that people are going to buy as an extension of their smartphone or to look pretty on their wrists but it hasn’t been designed for those reasons.

Aimed at providing fitness tracking data to those who workout often but aren’t trying to be the next Paula Radcliffe the Garmin Forerunner 245 includes a good number of sports tracking capabilities but not at the expense of form factor.

As a result it doesn’t look or feel too obtrusive on the wrist but with its largely plastic build it doesn't look or feel overly expensive either. It’s a mere 38.5g with a 30.4mm diameter face which is pretty small in comparison to the company’s Fenix series for instance.

(Image credit: TechRadar)

It’s this lightweight design alongside its comfortable silicone strap that makes the Forerunner 245 an absolute dream to wear during all kinds of sports and activities. You barely notice you’re wearing it.

The true test of comfort we think is wearing a smartwatch during a yoga class. If you can happily arm balance and back bend your way through an hour of vinyasa without feeling the urge to take it off you know you’re on to a winner. In fact we did two yoga practices with the Forerunner 245 and even wore it while sleeping four nights in a row and it felt extremely comfortable throughout so a massive thumbs up there.

While the Garmin Forerunner 245 is slightly thicker than its predecessor on paper you’re probably not going to notice - perhaps because it is smaller and lighter overall. The body has dropped down from a 45mm case to 42.3mm something you’re only likely to recognize if you’re a Forerunner 235 user.

Still it’s a good size especially for viewing performance data mid-workout or run. On the sides there's the same Garmin physical button setup you’ll find on most of its fitness-focused devices.

There’s no touchscreen here but this is intentional. It not only works better for many physical activities - especially in water - but it also saves on crucial battery life. As always with Garmin this button setup does take some getting used to if you’re a newcomer to the firm’s devices but after no time at all it will all make sense.

As for the display Garmin has upgraded the Forerunner 245’s screen from a 215 x 180 resolution on the Forerunner 235 to a 240 x 240 resolution adding a welcome touch of sharpness and better detail that wasn’t present in the 235. The 1.2-inch screen is a good size too - being big enough to feed you the data you need without overloading you with information.

If you’re familiar with Garmin devices you’ll know the firm doesn’t achieve display brightness through a backlit AMOLED screen as seen on many other smartwatches. Instead it uses transflective memory-in-pixel (MIP) tech which relies on external sources of light to illuminate the screen and what’s being presented on it.

This works really well on the Forerunner 245 and we never found a time where we couldn’t see what was being displayed on screen - all the timings heart rate information and elevations illuminated brilliantly especially in direct sunlight.

Obviously this only really works in well-lit conditions but for darker times there’s an LED backlight that lights up at the touch of a button when required (again to save on battery life).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9pcy1zb2xhci1vbi1hLWdhcm1pbi13YXRjaC13b3J0aC1pdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is solar on a Garmin watch worth the extra expense?,"11 min read

Garmin Solar – what is it?

Some Garmin watches are equipped with solar technology. They come with something called Power Glass which is a solar charging lens that sits on top of the watch face.

It consists of two layers. One is a thin rim surrounding the inside edge of the display which is clearly visible to the user. The other one is a thin transparent film that sits below the glass but above the display.

As you’ve probably guessed solar converts the sun’s rays into energy which adds additional battery life. The goal is to extend your time between charges.

Garmin first introduced the technology in 2019 on the Fenix 6x Pro model. The first devices with this functionality added a bit of extra battery life. So most considered it more of a gimmick rather than something that is truly useful. Particularly on something like a Fenix watch which is very power hungry.

However the surface area and efficiency of the solar panels was improved starting with the Fenix 7 units making this a more worthwhile addition. What’s more the power efficiency of these watches was better hence decreasing their power draw.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

Mind you solar charging is not meant to be used as the primary charging source for the watches. It is there to keep things going a bit longer. The idea is to give you some more time to train and do what you love without worrying as much about battery life.

Garmin Fenix 7 Garmin Forerunner 955

Watches that have solar display the solar intensity over the previous few hours via a line graph on some watch faces. There’s also a Solar Intensity widget that fills in gradually depending on the exposure to the sun. Finally you can also view this type of information in Garmin Connect. The data that is displayed represents the amount of sunlight or lux conditions received.

Which Garmin watches have solar?

Since the original Fenix 6 range there have been a slew of Garmin devices with solar technology. Enduro and the Instinct range followed the Fenix watch the latest addition being the Forerunner 955.

Looking only at the most recent range these are the watches that have variants with solar:

Forerunner 955

Fenix 7/7S/7X

Fenix 7/7X Sapphire

Instinct 2/2s (along with Tactical and Surf editions)

Fenix 6/6S 6/6S/6X Pro

quatix 7X

Tactics 7 Pro and Pro Ballistics

Descent GI

Enduro

As you can see the selection has grown quite a bit over the years.

What are the ideal conditions for solar charging?

The obvious question is to do with how much extra battery life you get with solar. The answer to this is not simple and it depends on a few factors.

Garmin advertises battery life of these watches. But this is in ideal conditions when the watch is receiving approximately 50000 lux or more for at least 3 hours per day. This only occurs when the watch on your wrist is in full direct sunlight with a solar intensity of 100%.

But again achieving ideal conditions will depend on a few factors:

You will want the lens to be facing directly towards the sun.

You are not using any kind of screen protector as this will reduce the solar intensity.

You are not covering any part of the watch lens with a sleeve.

It will depend on the position of the sun including time of day and current season.

Weather including clouds rain and other weather patterns that may block or obscure the sun should also be considered.

Exceeding solar charging temperature thresholds (from 0 to 60°C) has an effect.

Other things to consider:

Solar charging can take place while the watch is switched off. In fact this is more effective and can yield greater charge from the same solar intensity.

The farther away from the equator you are the more seasons will affect charging.

You can also use non-natural light such as from fluorescent lights. But this will not be nearly as effective as direct sunlight.

So how much extra battery life can you actually get?

Hopefully you have read through the ideal conditions section. Because what follows is how much extra battery life you can expect assuming use in 50000 lux conditions for at least 3 hours per day.

We’ll use a handful of devices as examples.

Garmin device Non-solar Solar Forerunner 955 Smartwatch mode: Up to 15 days;

GPS-only mode without music: Up to 42 hours; All Systems GNSS mode plus Multi-Band without music: Up to 20 hours; Ultratrac mode: Up to 80 hours. Smartwatch mode: Up to 20 days;

GPS-only mode without music: Up to 49 hours; All Systems GNSS mode plus Multi-Band without music: Up to 22 hours; Ultratrac mode: Up to 110 hours. Fenix 7 Smartwatch: Up to 18 days;

Battery Saver Watch Mode: Up to 57 days; GPS Only: Up to 57 hours;

All Satellite Systems: Up to 40 hours; Max Battery GPS: Up to 136 hours; Expedition GPS: Up to 40 days. Smartwatch: Up to 22 days; Battery Saver Watch Mode: Up to 173 days;

GPS Only: Up to 73 hours; All Satellite Systems: Up to 48 hours;

Max Battery GPS: Up to 289 hours;

Expedition GPS: Up to 74 days. Instinct 2 Smartwatch: Up to 28 days; Battery Saver Watch Mode: Up to 65 days; GPS: Up to 30 hours; Max Battery GPS Mode: Up to 70 hours; Expedition GPS Activity: Up to 32 days. Smartwatch: Unlimited; Battery Saver Watch Mode: Unlimited; GPS: Up to 48 hours; Max Battery GPS Mode: Up to 370 hours; Expedition GPS Activity: Unlimited. Enduro Smartwatch: Up to 50 days; Battery Saver Watch Mode: Up to 130 days;

GPS: Up to 70 hours; Max Battery GPS Mode: Up to 200 hours; Expedition GPS Activity: Up to 65 days. Smartwatch: 65 day; Battery Saver Watch Mode: Up to 1 year; GPS: Up to 80 hours; Max Battery GPS Mode: Up to 300 hours; Expedition GPS Activity: Up to 95 days.

As can be seen from the table below the difference is bigger on some watches than others. Namely in certain conditions you can actually keep devices such as the Instinct 2 going indefinitely! For other use cases you might be looking at an extra 20% or so.

One thing to consider is that solar charging is very slow. Much slower than if you plug your watch into a power outlet. Also achieving ideal lux conditions might not be achievable on certain days.

Take my example. I am located in London. And while I might be able to get 3 hours of sunlight on some days in the summer for most of the rest of the year the solar functionality would be completely useless to me.

Spending 10 hours per day in the office? Then a solar Garmin probably doesn’t makes sense.

But thinking of doing the Appalachian trail? Then every ounce counts. Solar could provide some extra safety for long outdoor trips or even endurance events.

What about the price difference?

A big factor that will affect your decision is the price difference. Needless to say solar watches are more expensive. If they weren’t we would probably all be buying them. But how much is the typical price difference?

Again let’s use a few examples.

Garmin device Non- solar Solar Forerunner 955 $499 $599 Fenix 7 $699 $799 Instinct 2 $349 $449

Essentially you can expect a difference of around $100 in the purchase price for the latest crop of devices. So you should look at the cost to benefit ratio for your specific situation.

If you got cash to splash then go for it. May as well.

If you’d rather save up because the feature is not important to you then save your money. Remember – you could always purchase a cheap portable USB charger which could refuel your device much more quickly – several times over! Or simply carry a battery pack.

Another thing to consider

There is one more thing that might make a difference to some. Solar adds a clearly visible ring around the watch face. Some people may not mind others might get annoyed by it. Plus the display itself may not be as crystal clear as the non-solar version – due to the other layer – so you might notice a bit of a difference there.

Here’s what this looks like when you compare the solar and non-solar version of the Forerunner 955. As can be seen there’s an orange ring around the edges on the Forerunner 955 solar.

Garmin Forerunner 955 solar Garmin Forerunner 955

The bottom line: is Garmin solar worth it?

The answer on whether Garmin solar is worth it is not that simple. It really depends on your specific circumstances and the device you’re thinking of purchasing.

Solar makes less of a difference on some watches. On the Fenix you will not get as much extra battery life as you would get on something such as the Instinct 2.

Live in a country without much sunlight? Spend most of your time indoors? Then there is little point in spending an extra $100 on a solar watch as you will experience few benefits. Remember most Garmin watches already have awesome battery life. Plus you will never get annoyed by the solar ring which some might view as obtrusive.

But the feature can be useful for people who go on multi-day outdoor adventures prolonged mountaineering backpacking long endurance events and similar. That extra 20% or so that you get in some conditions can make an important difference.

If you want to feel prepared for everything go for the solar version. You may also want to consider it if you enjoy grilling mowing lawns walking dogs and everything else that involves spending lots to time outdoors and at least some sun.

IT,Gartner,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlib3VsZXZhcmQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvNS10YWtlYXdheXMtZnJvbS10aGUtbmV3LWdhcnRuZXItaHlwZS1jeWNsZS1mb3Itc3RvcmFnZS1kYXRhLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tMjAyMi_SAXdodHRwczovL3NlY3VyaXR5Ym91bGV2YXJkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzUtdGFrZWF3YXlzLWZyb20tdGhlLW5ldy1nYXJ0bmVyLWh5cGUtY3ljbGUtZm9yLXN0b3JhZ2UtZGF0YS1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLTIwMjIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Takeaways From The New Gartner Hype Cycle For Storage & Data Protection 2022,"Background to the Gartner Hype Cycle For Storage & Data Protection

The latest 2022 Gartner Hype Cycle report for Storage and Data Protection has just been published and I’m thrilled to see that Cyberstorage is steadily progressing up the firm’s innovation curve.

In addition Continuity is listed as a featured vendor (apologies for patting ourselves on the back!!!)

For those who don’t know Gartner’s Hype Cycle represents the maturity and adoption of emerging technologies and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems.

In this particular report Cyberstorage is defined by Gartner as “protecting unstructured storage system data against ransomware attacks through early detection and blocking of attacks”.

Gartner explains why this has become such a hot topic.

Cyberstorage; The New Kid On The Block

“Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common requiring the adoption or deployment of cybersecurity tools for active defense.

Although numerous solutions are available for endpoint protection back-end protection largely fails due to a lack of solutions. Network-attached storage (NAS) and scale-out file system storage provides inadequate protection from malicious deletion or encryption of data.

Cyberstorage provides active defense against cyber attack on unstructured data.”

Cybersecurity threats dominated IT concerns in 2021 and are growing in occurrence and magnitude. The effect of ransomware is enormous and destructive impacting areas such as loss of business and recovery costs. Ransomware climbed an unprecedented 105% in 2021 over 2020 to 623.3 million attacks worldwide.

According to Gartner “ransomware attacks will become so common that I&O leaders will have to assume data cybersecurity responsibility and adopt new approaches for active defense. While storage infrastructure can be one of the most impacted solutions attacked by ransomware it initially receives limited attention by security and storage leaders”.

What Does NIST Have To Say About Storage & Backup Security

To address this potential gap NIST released Special Publication (SP) 800-209 Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure which includes comprehensive security recommendations for storage & backup infrastructures.

Storage technology just like its computing and networking counterparts has evolved from traditional storage service types such as block file and object.

This evolution has taken two directions:

The first is along the path of increasing storage media capacity (e.g. tape Hard Disk Drives solid-state drives (SSD) And the second is along the architectural front starting from direct-attached storage (DAS) to the placement of storage resources in networks accessed through various interfaces and protocols to cloud-based storage resource access

Accompanying the architectural evolution is the increase in management complexity which subsequently increases the probability of configuration errors and associated security threats.

How Widespread are Storage Vulnerabilities And Backup Misconfigurations?

Last year we published a research report that provided an analysis of the storage and backup vulnerabilities and storage & backup security misconfigurations.

We analyzed multiple storage & backup systems and vendors including Dell EMC IBM Hitachi Data Systems Cisco Brocade NetApp and others.

The report identified 6300 security risks with a single storage or backup device containing 15 vulnerabilities – many of them high risk.

As a result of the increased focus on storage vulnerabilities and backup misconfigurations there has been an emergence of new cyberstorage products that are designed to identify detect protect respond to and recover from ransomware attacks.

Some vendors position traditional storage technologies like snapshots as a single answer for ransomware protection which is completely inadequate to meet the new challenges ransomware brings.

Cyberstorage products differentiate their capabilities by aligning with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-209 Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure.

5 Takeaways From Gartner Hype Cycle & NIST

Assign higher priority to improving the security of enterprise storage and backup systems Build up knowledge and skill sets – and improve collaboration between your Infosec and IT infrastructure teams Define comprehensive security baselines for all components of storage and backup systems Use automation to reduce exposure to risk and free up your time. Storage vulnerability management solutions can solve this problem by automatically scanning prioritizing and remediating vulnerabilities & security misconfigurations Run frequent and more comprehensive testing of storage security backup protection – and your ability to recover from an attack. This will not only improve confidence but will also help identify key data assets that might not meet the required level of data protection

With the first compatible processors just months away one has to wonder: what will happen to the likes of GigaIO Fungible or Liqid when CXL finally arrives?

Will these composable infrastructure outfits adapt and thrive or be relegated to the scrap pile of tech vendors that had the right idea before the market was ready for it? And by composable infrastructure we mean rethinking your IT resources as pools of compute storage networking and accelerators and allocating these to workloads in the most efficient way on the fly as needed.

“For some of them” Gartner analyst Tony Harvey told The Register ""it’s not going to make a lot of practical difference. If you’re a GigaIO for example you’re doing a PCIe switch and you’re going to have to upgrade to PCIe 5.0 and you’re going to support CXL.""

While CXL may force these vendors to change and adapt their investments in PCIe switching puts them in a unique position to lead a new market segment for CXL switches he added.

The idea being that eventually CXL switches will replace Ethernet switches for in-rack communications. This will enable customers to interface any number of disaggregated compute memory or storage appliances within the rack. In other words the dream of multivendor composable infrastructure fully realized.

However CXL-based composable infrastructure remains years away. While CXL version 1.1 will make its debut with Intel’s Sapphire Rapids and AMD’s Genoa later this year the switching and fabric capabilities required to realize these composable infrastructure use cases won’t arrive until the launch of CXL 2.0 and CXL 3.0-based silicon.

The imminent birth of a CXL switching ecosystem?

In many respects CXL represents more of an opportunity for vendors like Liqid GigaIO and Fungible than a threat. However the technology will undoubtedly drive competition in the niche composable infrastructure market as major OEMs such as Dell HPE and Lenovo begin introducing their own CXL-based infrastructure.

As a result Harvey predicts that many composable infrastructure vendors could find themselves the target of acquisitions by OEMs looking to bolster their PCIe switching capabilities.

Alternatively he said PCIe switching could follow the path taken by Ethernet with these composable infrastructure vendors eventually becoming the CXL equivalents to Arista Juniper or Cisco.

This route isn’t without challenges of its own and will depend heavily on whether the vendors are willing to open their platforms up to the kind of Ethernet-style standardization required for interoperability.

“To create that open market for PCIe switches you're going to have to be vendor independent and vendor neutral and also create this Ethernet-style world where people expect everything to work with everything else” Harvey said. “I don’t care who made my network card or my switch. I plug them in and they work.”

On the flip side some vendors may double down on their proprietary architectures and create the CXL equivalent of Infiniband.

A disaggregated future

CXL switching is likely to have a much wider appeal than composable infrastructure according to a recent Gartner report which predicted the segment would account for less than 10 percent of enterprise server spend through 2025.

“There are bits of the market where it fits and bits of market where it doesn’t” Harvey said. “In the high-performance compute space and managed service providers or cloud providers it’s a beautiful solution.”

They compose once and then use it for five years and then shut it down

Most customers that are buying composable infrastructure today aren’t actually taking advantage of that composability in their day-to-day operation he explained. “You talk to anybody and they’ll tell you what they actually do is compose once and then use it for five years and then shut it down.”

Part of this is because many enterprise applications simply aren’t designed to take advantage of composability.

“Is anyone really going to take their Oracle ERP system shut it down resize the service it's running on then restart that ERP system in order to take advantage of composability” he said. “The answer to that question is no.”

But that’s not to say there isn’t value in the modularity unlocked by these technologies.

“CXL has the opportunity to completely change the way we architect servers. That’s going to be really interesting in the market because we’ve not seen a server re-architecture for years. We’re all still building 1U or 2U rack servers that look identical” Harvey said. “CXL can change all of that.”

So while enterprises might not recompose their infrastructure on the fly the ability to deploy large pools of memory or other accelerators in a disaggregated fashion still has its appeal and presents an opportunity for the likes of GigaIO Liqid Fungible and any number of other vendors to tie them all together. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkYmo3LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L3N1YnN0aXR1dGUtdGVhY2hlci1hcnJlc3RlZC1zZXh1YWxseS1hc3NhdWx0aW5nLXRlZW4tc2hlcmlmZnMtb2ZmaWNlLXNheXMvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YXBwc9IBemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkYmo3LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L3N1YnN0aXR1dGUtdGVhY2hlci1hcnJlc3RlZC1zZXh1YWxseS1hc3NhdWx0aW5nLXRlZW4tc2hlcmlmZnMtb2ZmaWNlLXNheXMvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Substitute teacher arrested for sexually assaulting teen sheriff’s office says,"ATLANTA (WGCL/Gray News) - A Georgia man is facing nearly a dozen sex charges in a case involving a teenage girl under the age of 16.

According to the Hall County Sheriff’s Office 23-year-old Christopher Brennen Young met his victim while he was employed as a substitute teacher at East Hall High School.

WGCL reports an investigation found evidence that Young sexually assaulted the teen and took videos of the sexual activity on his cell phone. The reported assaults did not occur on school property.

Young is facing charges that include aggravated sexual battery aggravated sodomy aggravated child molestation and violation of computer pornography.

The Hall County School District released the following statement after Young’s arrest:

“First and foremost our hearts go out to the victim and family. The district stands ready to provide the necessary support. The individual charged worked last year as a substitute teacher and no longer works in that capacity. The district was made aware of the arrest yesterday. All of our substitutes go through a criminal background check before working.

We are cooperating fully with law enforcement and all questions regarding the investigation should be directed to the Hall County Sheriff’s Department.”

Authorities said depending on forensic testing of electronic devices seized from Young’s residence he could face additional criminal charges.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill earlier this week that a person only needs to be enrolled to get their college degree to begin teaching in public schools.

Arizona’s Family reports it’s a big change and it’s been met with mixed reactions.

Jens Larson said there was a teacher shortage back when he joined the profession in 2000.

“I was hired as an emergency certified teacher. I had a degree but I didn’t have the teacher credentials that were needed” Larson said.

For 14 years he worked at the Phoenix Union High School District. He said the low pay lack of respect and resources led him to leave. Since leaving he started Phoenix Youth Circus Arts Program and continues to work with children.

“I have more fun teaching circus than I do teaching geometry I have to admit that” he said.

But this new change SB 1159 he said was a stretch.

“The situation will be even worse if you’re dealing with either younger people or even less well-educated people” Larson said.

Christopher Ramsey a Phoenix-area teacher said the new bill could work but there’s no one-size-fits-all.

“I’m a teacher and I taught for two years while doing an accelerated master’s program. If you have the right person it could work” Ramsey said.

The Arizona Educators Association or AEA fought this legislation.

“You have to have some experience. It’s going to allow people to do on-the-job training and that’s where it’s scary” Marisol Garcia the President of the AEA said.

In response Kaitlin Harrier the Senior Education Policy Advisor to the governor wrote:

“Signing this bill into law furthers Governor Ducey’s pro-education policies by giving schools the flexibility to establish their own locally designed school leadership preparation programs and will allow those without a bachelor’s degree to start training to become a teacher while also completing their degree. This flexibility will help strengthen the teacher talent pipeline provide the opportunity for more Arizonans to become teachers and allow for locally driven solutions.”

Garcia said the bill changes the credentialing requirements for public schools. In addition it brings it in line with charter schools.

More information is available here regarding teachers who are certified by the state.

A litter of newly born puppies was stolen from the home of a Kamloops dog breeder after she passed away suddenly almost two weeks ago. Two families who had purchased a puppy before her death are now out thousands of dollars.

Katy Gartner and her family in Penticton were thrilled to be getting a dog. They researched breeds and breeders until finally deciding on an Alapaha Blue Blooded Bulldog from the Kamloops breeder. They had named him ‘Gator.’

Gartner says they paid the full price of $3000 for the dog but weren’t able to take him home before he and his litter-mates went missing.

Instead they got a message saying the dog breeder 33-year-old Dainya Watson had died suddenly and the whole litter eight six-week-old puppies were gone.

“We got in touch with the roommates she lived with who had possession of the puppies when she passed” said Kearston Burton-Weatherhead Dainya Watson’s sister.

The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world.

“They let us know that they had been stolen within an hour of medical personnel and RCMP leaving the scene.”

The roommates told Burton-Weatherhead that someone had stolen the puppies through the side gate of the yard. However she says the story sounded “off.”

“I found the gate that they were apparently taken from and there was three-feet high of grass there was no way that someone was able to get in and out without some kind of path being made” said Burton-Weatherhead.

“It just didn’t make sense to me or my family.”

Besides filling a police report Watson’s sister also put up a number of posts on social media platforms that have been shared thousands of times.

“These dogs are worth anywhere between $2500 and $4500” said Burton-Weatherhead.

“So I’m sure the people that took them had the intention of selling them and making a quick buck.”

Katy Gartner is concerned about the safety and well-being of all the puppies that have allegedly been stolen but she can’t help but focus on the one that already won her heart the one she was expected to take home.

“We picked Gator. As soon as I saw him I was like ‘that’s my dog’. This is just hard” said Gartner.

Anyone who might have information about the puppies is asked to contact the Kamloops RCMP Detachment."

Days later more images of the first taxis of South Korea's new plane were released.

The tests were carried out at Sacheon Airport where some of the facilities of KAI (Korea Aerospace Industries) are located. The aircraft taxied and still made an abortive takeoff returning to the hangar and being inspected afterwards.

Interestingly the KF-21 did its first “run-in” tests with four meteor missiles installed in the hard points of the fuselage.

All tests take place rigorously and precede the plane's first flight scheduled for July 22nd.

Despite having clear similarities with the US F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters – South Korea's biggest partner – the KF-21 is not a 5th Generation fighter but a 4.5 Generation fighter like the Dassault Rafale Sukhoi Su-35 and Saab Gripen.

Unlike stealth planes the Boramae (Falcon in Korean) will carry all of its weapons externally in 10 hardpoints on the wings and fuselage.

The first versions called Block I will be dedicated to air combat carrying only air-to-air missiles and their internal cannon. Later South Korea will evolve the plane allowing it to receive bombs and missiles for ground attack.

The KF-21 was developed as part of the KF-X program that cost the South Koreans $6.3 billion. The Boramae replaces the old F-4E Phantom II and F-5E/F Tiger II which share the mission of defending the country with much more modern and capable aircraft such as the F-15K Slam Eagle and the F-35.

The project also has the participation of Indonesia whose flag can be seen on the fuselage. Jakarta agreed to cover 20% of the costs.

KAI's prediction is that serial production should start by mid-2026 and the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF) expects to have more than 120 units of the new fighter by 2032. The project also has the vital partnership of GE Aviation  responsible for supplying the F414 engines the same ones used in the SAAB JAS 39E/F Gripen and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doubling fuel efficiency: ‘Aircraft of future will have open engines with large fan blades’ says Safran,"all

NEW DELHI: With fan blades twice as large as they are today and open fan engines fixed on upper wings or back of airframe commercial aircraft in the not so distant future will look radically different in their pursuit for fuel efficiency and lower emissions. While the current generation of aircraft engines are 15% more fuel efficient then their predecessors the world’s largest aerospace engine manufacturer — French MNC Safran — is aiming at doubling the same to 30% through new age engines that will require airframe changes.“At four metres the blades (of the next gen engines) would be double the two-metre diametre of the current LEAP engines and be open fan. This engine will require a new plane. That will be the decision of airframes Airbus and Boeing . May be the next gen plane will require an upper wing or engine may be behind. We believe the airframe can bring an additional 10%. A combination of the two (20% engine tech and 10% airframe design) could lead to 30% fuel saving” Safran Global CEO and director Olivier Andriès 60 told TOI while giving a glimpse into the future.An aviation venetran Andriès had joined the French finance ministry in 1990 where he oversaw major state-owned aerospace and defence companies. A decade later the French national joined Airbus where he was VP (widebody aircraft programmes (A330/A340). And in 2008 he joined Safran in 2008 as EVP. In 2015 as CEO of Safran Aircraft Engines  he was tasked with ensuring a successful transition between the (previous gen) CFM56 and the new generation LEAP engine and ramp up the latter’s production to 2000 engines by 2020.“The current generation of aircraft engines are bringing 15% fuel efficiency. We are all aiming to be carbon neutral for aviation industry by 2050. It’s a very ambitious target. How are we going to get there for commercial aviation? Mainly two levels. One by working on technologies for aircraft frugality. Together with GE we had decided in June 2020 into a disruptive technology programme a disruptive architecture that could bring 20% fuel saving by 2035. We need time to demonstrate the technology not only on ground but in flight” Andriès said.What about the fuel for this engine? “It will be agnostic meaning it would work with kerosene (jet fuel) and our aim is that it works with 100% sustainable fuel. It could (also) work with hydrogen if need be. So the first step is working on a disruptive engine technology. It would not look like the engine of today. It would be an open fan. At four metres the diameter of the upcoming fan would be twice as big as the current two-metre diametre LEAP engine fan. A big big big fan. And open so no casing” he said.So it will be similar to the current turbojet engines but “rotating fast”. This will bring “propulsive efficiency” leading to fuel saving. “This is the disruptive technology we are working on with GE as the leader of the (engine) market. We should not be surprised by anyone else coming in and bringing disruption. We should be the disruptor.”This is “good but not enough to reach carbon neutrality”. So what else needs to be done?“Our view is that it has to be complemented by a very strong push on sustainable fuel. With sustainable fuel you basically recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) and therefore you don’t emit more CO2.” The first step is going to be bio fuels with which we can save upto 80% emissions. But bio fuel (generation) should not compete with food requirement and will have to be generated from waste.“The next step should be synthetic fuel. We have engaged in a partnership with French energy major Total. They have announced a very big strategic partnership with Adani Group in India. We are urging Total and everybody to move up the production capacity of sustainable fuel. Should one day I meet Mr (Gautam) Adani I would tell him that that he should go into sustainable and synthetic fuels” Andriès said.Safran is not a strong believer in hydrogen for two reasons. “We need to get there (carbon neutrality) by 2050 and there are two issues with liquid hydrogen. Liquid hydrogen requires four times more volume than kerosene. It simply cannot be a solution for long hauls as it would require big tanks. (That) does not fly. Long range account for 20% flights worldwide but 50% of airline revenue” he said.Hydrogen can be used for aircraft that fly 1000 nautical miles and be a good fit for regional aircraft. A320neo and B737 Max are designed to fly 3000 nautical miles.Then comes the other hurdle. “Should an airline be willing to operate hydrogen-powered aircraft you needairports in the world to be equipped with infrastructure to fill them with liquid hydrogen. I know of some places in them world where it is existing today. And they are space launching stations. So it’s a huge investment to imagine that all airports in the world will build cryogenic infrastructure to feed aircraft It’s kidding.”Electric will be solution for small regional aircraft and urban air mobility. “The difficulty with electric is the weight of batteries. In aerospace our biggest enemy is weight. The current generation batteries used by the car industry is 300 kilowatt per kg. If you are optimistic you will reach 500 kw per kg. Should you one day plan to fly an electric A320 you will need 180 tonnes of battery. And the maximum take off weight of the A320neo is half that number. Does not fly” Andriès said.",,,,,,,,,

We used the bacteriophage λ genomic DNA (λDNA) as a model DNA substrate for this study. Individual λDNA molecules were immobilized on a glass surface via biotin-streptavidin linkage stained with the YOPRO1 dye that intercalates into the DNA backbone and imaged with total-internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) (Fig. 1a)16. Double-tethered λDNA molecules exhibited a distribution of end-to-end distances due to heterogeneous surface-anchoring of the two ends. Molecules with short end-to-end distances displayed larger transversal fluctuations—due to more slacks—than those with long end-to-end distances (Fig. 1a). After flowing in Cy5-labeled recombinant full-length human Sox2 (Supplementary Fig. 1) we observed the formation of Sox2 foci on the DNA (Fig. 1b) which contains numerous Sox2 binding motifs across its native sequence (Supplementary Fig. 2). These foci displayed mobility on the DNA as well as fusion and splitting events (Supplementary Fig. 3a) indicating liquid-like properties217. Upon Sox2 binding and foci formation we also observed that the fluorescence signal of the DNA transitioned from a relatively uniform distribution to a few clusters that colocalized with the Sox2 foci (Fig. 1b). This was particularly apparent in the DNA strands with a short end-to-end distance.

(Right) Two example images of double-tethered λDNA molecules with different end-to-end distances (among 4 independent experiments). DNA was stained with YOPRO1 (20 nM) and imaged by TIRFM.

Once nucleated the Sox2 foci on DNA were long-lived and the fluorescence intensities of both Sox2 and DNA at the foci increased with time until reaching a steady state (Fig. 1c d). Interestingly we observed a loss of the fluctuating motion in the DNA concurrent with Sox2 foci formation (Fig. 1a b). Indeed the average DNA envelope width—a measure for the degree of transversal fluctuations—was significantly reduced in the presence of Sox2 (Fig. 1e f). Even though the DNA envelope is wider for molecules with shorter end-to-end distances in the absence of Sox2 as expected the addition of Sox2 reduced the envelope width for all double-tethered molecules to the same level (Fig. 1e). These findings can be rationalized by an ability of Sox2 to form co-condensates with DNA. As more DNA being pulled into the condensates the previously slacked DNA transitioned into a tensed state.

In addition we observed a fraction of λDNA molecules that were tethered to the surface at only one end (Fig. 1g) likely because the other biotinylated end did not find a streptavidin to bind during flow injection. Without Sox2 these single-tethered DNA molecules displayed random fluctuations characterized by a measurable radius (Fig. 1g i). The addition of Sox2 again visibly suppressed such fluctuations (Supplementary Movie 1)—most likely due to co-condensation with DNA—resulting in a significantly decreased average fluctuation radius (Fig. 1h i). Altogether these results demonstrate that Sox2 and DNA form co-condensates wherein proteins and DNA accumulate reducing the amount of free DNA outside the condensates.

Sox2:DNA co-condensation exerts mechanical stress on DNA

The loss of fluctuations in both single- and double-tethered DNA suggests that Sox2-induced condensation generates mechanical tension within the DNA. These effects were recapitulated using unlabeled wild-type Sox2 ruling out the possibility of labeling artifact (Supplementary Fig. 4a b). In accordance with this notion but nonetheless unexpectedly we observed that a significant population of double-tethered DNA underwent sudden breakage after losing slacks (Fig. 2a b Supplementary Fig. 4c and Supplementary Movie 2). The breakage was accompanied by a rapid collapse of the Sox2 and DNA fluorescence signals into the two tethered ends (Supplementary Movie 2). Notably these breakage events occurred over a time window that coincided with the formation of Sox2:DNA co-condensates and became much less frequent as the mobility of Sox2 foci decreased over time (Supplementary Fig. 3b–d). In contrast virtually no DNA breakage was observed in the absence of Sox2 (Fig. 2b) or for single-tethered λDNA where the tension can be released from the free end even after the addition of Sox2 (Supplementary Fig. 5a).

Significance was obtained using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons (****P < 0.0001). Source data are provided as Source Data Fig. 2. Full size image

We then explored other factors besides condensation-induced tension that could contribute to the tether breakage. We found that the fraction of broken DNA tethers was not significantly affected by the duration of laser exposure in our experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Given the known effect of DNA intercalating dyes on the mechanical properties of DNA1819 we washed out YOPRO1 prior to the addition of Sox2 and observed a lower fraction of ruptured DNA (Supplementary Fig. 5c). To evaluate whether nicks that inevitably exist in these λDNA samples played a role in tether breakage we treated the DNA with T4 ligase and observed fewer breakage events upon Sox2 condensate formation (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Based on these results we speculate that the DNA breakage observed in the TIRFM experiments resulted from a combination of tension generated by Sox2:DNA co-condensation and mechanical instability in the DNA substrate due to nicks and the intercalating dye. Nonetheless the breakage fraction is still a useful proxy for the magnitude of mechanical tension to compare different proteins and substrates if the same imaging conditions and DNA batch are used.

To examine whether other DNA-binding proteins can exert the same level of tension on DNA we repeated the above TIRFM assay with another abundant nuclear protein the human linker histone H1.4 (referred to as H1 hereafter). H1 is known to form co-condensates with DNA101320. We found that H1:DNA co-condensation also reduced the double-tethered DNA envelope width and single-tethered DNA fluctuation radius (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). However H1-mediated DNA condensation resulted in much fewer DNA breakage events compared to Sox2-mediated condensation (Fig. 2b) suggesting that H1 generates a lower force on DNA.

We then sought to examine whether Sox2:DNA co-condensation can generate inter-strand tension. In the absence of Sox2 the neighboring λDNA strands immobilized in proximity of each other fluctuated independently. Upon the addition of Sox2 these strands lost slack and joined one another through the fusion of Sox2 foci (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Movie 3). In some cases we observed successive severing and joining of DNA located nearby (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Movie 4). Together these results suggest that Sox2 condensates exert force on DNA both within the same strand (when both ends are anchored) and between multiple strands.

IDRs of Sox2 are dispensable for condensate formation but required for force exertion

Sox2 contains N- and C-terminal IDRs flanking the globular DNA-binding HMGB domain21. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism that underlies the capacity of Sox2 to form co-condensates with DNA we generated and fluorescently labeled Sox2 truncations (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1). We first examined a Sox2 construct that contains only its HMGB domain without the IDRs (Sox2-HMGB). Somewhat unexpectedly similar to the full-length Sox2 (Sox2-FL) Sox2-HMGB also formed foci on λDNA strands—both doubly and singly tethered—along with a concomitant loss of DNA fluctuations (Supplementary Fig. 7). This observation indicates that the IDRs of Sox2 are not required for its co-condensation with DNA. However Sox2-HMGB took a much longer time to form the same amount of DNA condensation (measured through the loss of fluctuations) (T condense = 184 ± 45 s) compared to Sox2-FL (T condense = 30 ± 4 s). Sox2-HMGB:DNA co-condensation also resulted in significantly fewer DNA breakage events (Fig. 2f). We next introduced a single-residue mutation W79A to Sox2-HMGB generating Sox2-HMGBW79A. Consistent with previous results22 Sox2-HMGBW79A displayed a diminished DNA-binding activity (Supplementary Fig. 8). Nevertheless it still retained the ability to form co-condensates with DNA (Supplementary Fig. 7) albeit with even slower condensation kinetics (T condense = 251 ± 59 s). This point mutation further attenuates the condensation-dependent mechanical tension exerted on DNA (quantified by the fraction of broken double-tethered DNA) compared to both Sox2-FL and Sox2-HMGB (Fig. 2f). Notably the mechanical effect of Sox2:DNA co-condensates is not directly correlated with their size as both Sox2-HMGB and Sox2-HMGBW79A foci on average contained more Sox2 molecules—estimated from the brightness of the fluorescent foci—than Sox2-FL foci (Fig. 2g). Together these results demonstrate that the HMGB domain alone can mediate Sox2:DNA co-condensation but the high mechanical stress on DNA is largely driven by the IDRs of Sox2.

Quantification of the force generated by Sox2:DNA co-condensation

Next we sought to quantitatively measure the force exerted by Sox2:DNA co-condensates on the DNA strand. Using optical tweezers combined with scanning confocal microscopy23 we tethered a single λDNA molecule between two optically trapped beads moved the tether in its relaxed form (i.e. zero applied force) to a channel containing Cy3-labeled Sox2 and monitored the force on DNA as a function of time. We first conducted experiments in a passive mode by keeping the trap positions fixed (Fig. 3a). As Sox2 foci appeared and accumulated on the DNA tether the force reading concurrently increased. Both fluorescence and force values reached a plateau after 10–20 s (Fig. 3b). Force generation requires the presence of Sox2 and the force plateau level is dependent on the concentration of Sox2 in solution (Fig. 3c) with a maximum value of ~7 pN measured at the highest Sox2 concentration tested (500 nM).

The trap separation was fixed in this experiment. b Force measurements (red) and the corresponding fluorescence intensities (green) as a function of time for the assay depicted in a. Data are averaged from 4 representative tethers. c Force measurements made with different Sox2 concentrations. The colored lines correspond to the mean forces as a function of time averaged from multiple DNA tethers (n = 4 or 5). The shades correspond to standard deviation. d Schematic of force-clamp experiments. The force applied to the tether was kept at a constant value via feedback such that DNA condensation would result in shortening of the tether. e A representative kymograph showing significant tether contraction and Sox2 condensate formation under a 0.5-pN force clamp. f A representative kymograph showing suppressed tether contraction under a 10-pN force clamp. g Schematic of pulling experiments. Sox2 condensates first formed on tethered λDNA under a low force (~0.5 pN). The tether was then subjected to mechanical pulling by gradually separating the two traps apart. h A representative force-distance curve from pulling a λDNA tether harboring Sox2 condensates (red line) in comparison to a representative curve from pulling a bare λDNA (blue line). The black arrowheads denote selected time points imaged in i. i Two-dimensional fluorescence scan of the same tether as in h (red line) at selected time points during pulling showing that Sox2 condensates persisted under forces up to 60 pN (time points #1–5) until tether rupture (time point #6). Source data are provided as Source Data Fig. 3. Full size image

We then conducted force-clamp experiments in which the tethered DNA was incubated with Sox2 at a constant force by adjusting the trap separation (Fig. 3d). We observed that with a force clamp set at 0.5 pN Sox2 and DNA underwent continued condensation reducing the length of free DNA and bringing the two beads closer to each other (Fig. 3e). In contrast a 10-pN force clamp largely abolished the condensation process (Fig. 3f) consistent with the above passive-mode results reporting a 7-pN maximum force that Sox2:DNA co-condensation can generate.

Next we asked how much force is required to dissolve Sox2:DNA co-condensates. To address this question we first formed Sox2 foci on a DNA tether under a low force (0.5 pN) and then gradually pulled the two beads apart thereby increasing the force applied to the tether (Fig. 3g). From the resultant force-extension curve we found that the extension of a Sox2-bound tether was much shorter than that of a bare DNA tether indicating significant DNA accumulation inside the condensates (Fig. 3h). Some transitions were observed in the force-extension curve which likely correspond to force-induced condensate dissolution events (Fig. 3h). Nonetheless a significant fraction of condensates persisted even when the force reached the DNA overstretching regime (~65 pN) as reflected by the shorter extension of Sox2-bound DNA at high forces compared to bare DNA (Fig. 3h). Concomitant fluorescence imaging confirmed that many Sox2 foci remained intact during pulling (Fig. 3i). These results demonstrate that Sox2:DNA co-condensates are stable and resistant to high disruptive forces.

The optical tweezers results corroborate the surface-based TIRFM results together revealing the mechanical effects of Sox2:DNA co-condensation. However we note that a force on the order of 7 pN by itself is not sufficient to break intact DNA. Indeed we observed few breakage events in the optical tweezers experiments. This discrepancy can be attributed to 1) the fact that we did not use any intercalating dye to stain DNA in the optical tweezers experiments; and 2) different illumination geometries between the TIRFM and optical tweezers assays which may render DNA in the latter assay less susceptible to nicks and other types of photodamage. We stress that the force values obtained from the optical tweezers assay represent a more direct and accurate measure of the mechanical tension that Sox2 condensates exert on DNA.

Nucleosomes attenuate the mechanical stress that Sox2 condensation exerts on DNA

Given that Sox2 is a nucleosome-binding pioneer TF24 we asked how the mechanical stress exerted by Sox2:DNA co-condensation on DNA may be regulated by nucleosome wrapping and chromatin organization. To this end we loaded histone octamers containing Cy3-labeled H2B onto surface-immobilized λDNA in the TIRFM setup (Fig. 4a) and then added Cy5-Sox2 to bind the nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 4b). As expected we observed that Sox2 foci nucleate around nucleosome locations (Fig. 4c d). Sox2 foci preferentially colocalized with nucleosomes over bare DNA sites (Fig. 4e f). The majority of Sox2:nucleosome foci contained multiple Sox2 molecules based on the Cy5 fluorescence intensity similar to the Sox2 foci on bare DNA (Supplementary Fig. 9a).

Strikingly we detected drastically fewer DNA breakage events upon the formation of Sox2 foci on nucleosomal DNA than on bare DNA (Fig. 4g). In the few examples in which nucleosomal DNA breakage did occur the tether ruptured at one of the anchor positions and the full DNA contour was sustained and underwent rigid-body-like fluctuations (Supplementary Fig. 9b and Supplementary Movie 5). This is in contrast to the breakage events observed on bare DNA where the tether broke in the middle and the Sox2/DNA signals abruptly collapsed into the two anchor positions (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 2). We also analyzed the single-tethered nucleosomal λDNA molecules and found that the addition of Sox2 did not significantly suppress their fluctuating motions (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Movie 6) again in contrast to the bare DNA results (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Movie 1).

Finally we performed optical tweezers experiments to directly measure forces exerted by Sox2 condensates on nucleosomal DNA. We assembled histone octamers containing AlexaFluor488-labeled H2A onto a λDNA tether moved the tether to a channel containing Cy3-Sox2 and monitored the force reading in the passive mode (Fig. 5a). Satisfyingly we observed that even though the Sox2 foci predominantly colocalized with nucleosomes (Fig. 5b) their formation hardly caused any increase in force in contrast to the significant force increase on bare DNA (Fig. 5c). These results corroborate the above TIRFM data together suggesting that nucleosomes attract Sox2 proteins and attenuate the force exerted by Sox2 condensates on DNA (Fig. 6).

Dr. Steven Victor and his ReGen Medical group are a testament to the way regenerative technology can help you heal and get stronger. The office offers the latest breakthroughs and therapies in health technology to help maximize energy and strength prevent disease and extend your health span. “Regenerative medicine seeks to replace tissue or organs that have been damaged by disease trauma or congenital issues versus the current clinical strategy that focuses primarily on treating the symptoms” explains Dr. Victor.

Originally trained as a cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Victor performed thousands of liposuction procedures over the years. “I learned that the fat I was throwing away contained numerous capillaries and in the walls of these capillaries were stem cells.” Twenty years ago he traveled to Athens Greece to learn more about the possibilities of stem cell therapy. “I came back to New York City excited and began integrating stem cell therapy into my practice using the technology I learned using enzymes to break up the fat to harvest the stem cells.” Dr. Victor then invested in a mechanical method to separate stem cells from the capillaries in the fat (or adipose tissue) and built a cellular lab in which to process the matter. “Stem cell therapy is useful where modern medicine fails” says Dr. Victor. “So we can help with ailments that traditional medicine fails to fix. Aging is inflammation and a decrease in circulation. Stem cell therapy helps to vastly reduce inflammation and increase circulation so you feel younger and better.”

When the Solow Building’s owner Stefan Soloviev decided to add amenities to the iconic Midtown space he believed tenants would love a medical wellness center and so he reached out to Dr. Victor who was looking for a new office space. At 9 West ReGen Medical has a full staff of emergency room physicians and cosmetic dermatologists all supported by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. When it’s completed in a few months the new space will offer regenerative medicine fitness wellness and aesthetics services as well as a membership concierge-medicine service for 24/7 access to care for building residents and private patients alike. Dr. Victor is also excited to be able to offer patients a full lab to process their bloodwork and other samples and special medical imaging equipment.",,,

Macy’s Chief Executive Jeff Gennette sees prices of overstocked items falling soon. “Customers are about to get some amazing deals on products that were hot during the pandemic” says Gennette who has run the biggest U.S. department-store chain since 2017.

Markdowns on excess inventory of everything from sweatpants to home goods could pinch retailers’ profit margins however. Consumers changed their spending habits this year faster than expected on items for the office dining out and travel. “In a lot of cases they’re visiting our stores again to see and touch products’’ Gennette adds while seated in a dark paneled conference room above Macy’s flagship store in Manhattan.

The 61-year-old CEO is trying to breathe new life into its brick-and-mortar stores which face existential threats from online competitors fast-fashion retailers and discount chains. His solution? Forge firmer ties between Macy’s virtual and physical settings. “We are focused on building a comprehensive omnichannel ecosystem” Gennette explains.

His iconic employer launched in 1858 today includes luxury Bloomingdale’s discount outlets mainly inside Macy’s department stores and smaller off-mall stores with extra digital services. “The second we add those off-mall stores” Gennette observes “the digital business in those ZIP codes goes up astronomically.”

Macy’s hired Gennette as an executive trainee in 1983 after the English literature major graduated from Stanford. He has worked for the chain ever since except for a brief stint running an FAO Schwarz store. He developed a reputation for spotting trends as he steadily advanced becoming Macy’s president in 2014. Gennette says being one of the few openly gay leaders of a Fortune 500 company has influenced his management style.

TIME recently spoke with Macy’s top boss about e-commerce’s rosy outlook increased personalization of brick-and-mortar shopping and his “authentic self” approach to leadership.

The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Why will we need department stores in the future? And how should they change to thrive within an omnichannel approach that promotes digital and in-store shopping?

The omnichannel customer is going to continue to be vibrant in America leading to healthy brick-and-mortar brands because those customers buy more frequently and are more profitable.

Five years from now that seamless exchange between brick and mortar a very developed app and e-commerce sites is going to be super fast and tailored to an individual. A one-to-one relationship is where omnichannel is going by anticipating customers’ needs at that moment.

More from TIME

Our customers in a cocoon during the pandemic are going into stores again. They want to try things on. Size fit is a big pain point for buying on the internet. And the younger generation is very prime to go to stores. There are on-ramp categories for them like toys engagement rings and a job interview suit. We’re making sure our future is highly relevant for all demographics.

Brick-and-mortar retail is not for the faint of heart. There are a lot of investments required and tradeoffs to manage. Within malls we’ve got great real estate. We’ve just got to make our store locations relevant. Customers’ expectations continue to evolve. The interplay between digital and physical is irrefutable. You have to have both channels—and potentially the metaverse in the future.

COVID-19 accelerated Americans’ shift to shopping online. What lies ahead for e-commerce?

It’s going to expand further but never to a point where stores are irrelevant. The human need to connect in a physical location is always going to be important

In fiscal 2010 digital commerce represented 5% of Macy’s net sales. By fiscal 2021 it represented 35%—or about $8.6 billion. How soon will you reach your goal of selling $10 billion of goods online annually?

We initially thought we’d get there by the end of 2023. But the timing is probably going to be off by a year with more business going to stores this year because we’re in a different stage of the pandemic—more of an endemic.

What portion of your annual net sales will come from e-commerce by 2027?



40%-plus. Over the next 10 years stores are still going to be more than 50% of the overall business. My job is to make sure the experience Macy’s customers have in brick-and-mortar stores meets their expectations and the way they want to shop. A store has to serve many shopping occasions for the same customer. You better have game plans imagined for all those journeys.

What obstacles must you overcome to complete Macy’s transformation into a digital led retailer with a substantial physical presence?

One big goal is to expand into the off-mall sector. About 60% of American brick-and-mortar business is done off mall where Macy’s now has got a very very shallow footprint. We’re in the pilot stage of making a small store format work there. We started opening our first off-mall ones about a little over a year ago. More are coming this year. The rate of new customers coming to Market by Macy’s—one of our off-mall concepts—is higher than full-line stores in markets they serve.

You employ numerous personal stylists who offer virtual and in-store appointments along with tailor-made recommendations. Where is personalized shopping headed next?

The bigger point is how to have a shopping experience that meets customers’ needs in that moment. A lot know what they want when they walk into a store. They don’t want to wait. That transaction needs to be speedy. Other customers want a fitting room and a knowledgeable Macy’s colleague. They’re booking appointments for a more fulsome shopping experience. We’re working through the technology. We’re training all our colleagues to be ready.

We help bring out your unique style for yourself your family and your home with a gigantic menu of brands and content from off-price to luxury. We do that fairly well digitally. Doing that in a physical setting has been more difficult but one we’ve set out to accomplish.

You unveil the first of 400 Toys “R” Us shops inside Macy’s locations this month with the rest opening by October. Greeted by Geoffrey the Giraffe kids will have areas to play with Legos dolls and other toys. What’s your rationale for this significant move? Should rival U.S. chains also revamp handle customers’ in-store experiences?

A more engaging experience for toys is something we can uniquely provide that other department stores either aren’t aspiring to do or won’t be able to do. We saw toys as a woefully underrepresented category in experiential retail. Go down one of our competitor’s main aisles. There isn’t a place where a kid can play with the goods.

Toys “R” Us was a unique opportunity for us to create a department store toy experience at scale. We’re putting great capital against it. Customers will come to the shops because their kids want to play there. We brought the Toys “R” Us brand online last year. Many of those online customers are new to Macy’s and 75% are now buying something else. It’s an opportunity to seed behavior. The challenge for retailers is: How do you take digital assets customers are quite comfortable navigating and bring them into your physical store experience? You give them delight by exposing them to new brands and services they weren’t thinking they wanted when they came in.

Amid soaring inflation is Macy’s raising as well as cutting prices?

We have been very selective about where we raise prices. Every customer has a device that can check prices anywhere. You’ve got to be super careful about raising prices for basic commodities like a T-shirt. It’s much easier to put price increases into trending categories. For some fashion items like a dress or a man’s suit you’re going to see higher prices.

You often talk about coming out as a gay man soon after you joined Macy’s. How has bringing your authentic self to work benefitted your longtime employer?

Early in my career I made the decision to live out loud and be my authentic self. But that probably was going to tamp down my ability to advance. There were no gay CEO examples I could look to in retail. I happened to be at Macy’s California then one of the most diverse companies and very supportive of the gay community. They kept saying ‘You can go to the next level.’ Yet when I was the only gay person in a room of senior leaders I always felt like an outsider. Was my perspective going to be valued? As I got higher it was very important for me to seek opinions of others in the room. They might feel their opinion wouldn’t be welcome because of their diversity. People got more comfortable expressing their point of view. I have been very purposeful about doing that on all teams I create and influence. I preach what I experienced.

How did encouraging colleagues to bring their authentic selves to work and speak frankly during meetings make you a better leader?

Equity is a very important component of how you get to an inclusive environment. An executive team is like a stadium. Who’s on the playing field making the calls and driving strategy? If your diverse populations are on the sidelines you’re not as effective. You have to have an inclusive environment where everybody feels like ‘I’m showing up with all my ideas and experiences.’ Until everyone feels valued you’re not going to maximize the potential of your brand that’s serving the most diverse population this country has ever had.

Why should CEOs of other companies bring their authentic selves to work?

Bringing your authentic self gives everybody else permission to do so. It also gives you the opportunity to contribute in a way that breeds trust followership and retention. That’s one of the secret sauces of our culture I’m quite passionate about. The authentic self idea is a litmus test of how you maximize your colleagues’ full potential. The sky’s the limit when you get that done.

You’re the guiding hand behind Mission Every One Macy’s new social purpose platform. It aims to invest $5 billion in various areas including businesses with diverse owners. How does your involvement reflect your personal experiences?

Mission Every One is as important as living my life as a gay man and not separating it from my work. Having our lives celebrated in their fullness is what I want for all our colleagues. We must also make Macy’s a much bigger tent representative of communities we serve.

You love words so much that you majored in English literature and now play Scrabble every day. Should more boards pick CEOs with undergraduate English degrees?

Having been an English lit major helps me in devising a great strategy that can be executed. But when I was coming through college my worried mother asked ‘What’s your career going to be when you’re majoring in English?’ I didn’t worry. I paid for college managing the faculty club. Commission sales worked well for me and I could manage people well. I decided ‘Let’s do that in retail.’ I have enjoyed retail so much. After almost 40 years I still can’t wait to tackle opportunities to serve customers every day. You should do what you’re passionate about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxzcHkuY29tL3R2L3VzdHYvYTQwNTYyMzMyL3RoZS1ib3lzLWF5YS1jYXNoLWdpcmwtZnJvbS1wbGFpbnZpbGxlLXNwaXJpdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Boys' Aya Cash talks morale on new true crime show,"Note: The following article contains discussion of themes including suicide that some readers may find upsetting.



The Boys star Aya Cash has opened up on how she kept her spirits up while filming the new true crime show The Girl From Plainville.

The show is based on a true crime 'texting suicide' case in which a man named Conrad Roy is encouraged to take his own life by his girlfriend Michelle Carter who was on the phone with him the entire time he did it. So naturally the show deals with a lot of heavy material.

Cash who plays Katie Rayburn the assistant district attorney who assured Michelle Carter's involuntary manslaughter conviction in the death of Conrad Roy sat down with Digital Spy to talk about the process of filming the show and how she kept the morale high on set.

""Sets are such interesting places where you can be on the darkest drama or the scariest horror film and that's where you laugh the most. Or on a comedy set where everyone is very very serious. It doesn't necessarily translate it depends on who you're working with and how they work"" she said.

She went on to explain the on-set environment and how it was completely different from the material they were filming.

""You always want to respect everybody's process and for this everyone was very aware of wanting to respect these people and was very sensitive to the facts of this case. But there was also lightness on set and playfulness"" she added.

She also expressed appreciation for the show's crew and the importance of social time with fellow set members.

""Nobody ever sees the crews but the crews are such a huge part of the experience of shooting something. This was a very interactive lovely fun crew. So a lot of times it's about breaking the tension by enjoying your social time because also shooting during COVID there's not much social time outside of shooting because you're trying to protect set and not let anyone get sick. So your social time is on set with these people"" she explained.

The show also stars Colton Ryan as Conrad Roy and Elle Fanning as Michelle Carter.

Decent 1080p gaming performance

Good keyboard and touchpad

Conservative good looks

Affordable Cons Confusing configurations

Poor battery life

Ho-hum screen

Gaming laptops tend to be expensive and the chip shortage has only made that situation worse in recent years. HP’s new Victus 15 slides in with options well under $1000 that attempt to provide a fix to that problem.

While the larger Victus 16 gets you up to an RTX 3060 the Victus 15 tops out at an RTX 3050 Ti — and starts at a budget-tier GTX 1650 which is what my review unit included. Despite having the latest 12th-gen CPUs we don’t normally recommend gaming laptops with graphics that are quite that bottom of the barrel. While our unit lacked in performance there are some configurations in the lineup that could make the Victus 15 a solid purchase — especially considering the alternatives.

Design

Like the Victus 16 the Victus 15 has a design that carries over a few elements from HP’s Omen lineup but maintains a more conservative aesthetic. The Victus logo shares the Omen logo’s basic geometry cutting off and retaining the bottom portion. The logo shows up on the lid and in the venting above the keyboard. Otherwise the Victus 15 has simple lines and few gamer-oriented elements. The rear vent has a bit of a fighter jet look but from the front and sides you wouldn’t be blamed for mistaking the Victus 15 for a mainstream budget laptop. That perception extends to the thin side bezels and reasonably small top bezel that contrast with the massive chin at the bottom of the display.

There are three available colors Mica Silver (dark gray) Performance Blue and Ceramic White. The Victus 15 doesn’t look exactly like a smaller version of the Victus 16 — the rear edges are more rounded giving a sleeker look. It’s not unusual for gaming laptops to strike a more mainstream look. Other examples include the Razer Blade 15 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. If you want a laptop that looks like a gaming machine you’ll want to consider something like the Asus ROG Strix G15 that’s a gamer through and through.

HP didn’t set out to make a thin and light gaming laptop but it didn’t make the thickest or heaviest either.

The Victus 15 is made of all plastic just like the Victus 16. Also like that laptop it has a lid that’s quite bendable. The keyboard deck also comes with a bit of flex although the smaller model is a bit more solid. The hinge works well allowing the lid to be opened with one hand and avoiding any serious wobble during intense gaming action. Overall the Victus 15 is slightly improved over the Victus 16 but it falls well short of more expensive machines like the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro and the Razer Blade 15.

Even given the large chin on the bottom of the display the Victus 15 is sized like the typical 15-inch gaming laptop . It’s fractions of an inch narrower and shallower than the Lenovo Legion 5 for example and just as thick at 0.93 inches. The HP is slightly lighter at 5.06 pounds compared to 5.3 pounds. The Acer Nitro 5 a similarly priced gaming machine is about the same size but thicker at 0.94 inches and lighter at 4.85 pounds. HP didn’t aim to make a thin and light laptop but it didn’t make the thickest or heaviest either.

Connectivity is robust with one exception. There’s a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports a full-size HDMI 2.1 port an Ethernet connection a 3.5mm audio jack and a full-size SD card reader. The one glaring omission is Thunderbolt 4 which we’ve seen on laptops at this price point. Wireless connectivity is either Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 or Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 depending on the configuration.

Price and configurations

Affordable gaming laptops are tough to come by these days especially ones that are actually worth buying. As with all cheap laptops  though digging into the configurations is key — and unfortunately HP has created a confusing lineup with the Victus 15 offering preconfigured models via retailers that utilize different Intel CPUs than you can buy via HP’s configure-to-order (CTO) system.

The preconfigured models range from a $600 (on sale from $880) configuration with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU 8GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and an Nvidia GTX 1650. My review unit was similar though it cost $800 and includes a Core i5-12450H and a 144Hz Full HD display. At the high end is the $1000 (on sale from $1100) model with a Core i7-12650H 16GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and the Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti. Other options include the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H and the RTX 3050. These higher-end options will give you far better performance.

You can configure the Victus 15 at HP.com which lets you spec out your laptop in finer detail ranging from $870 on the low end to $1230 on the high end. There are two primary competitors that price out closely to the Victus 15: The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 and the Acer Nitro 5. The Nitro 5 is $50 more expensive when configured similarly while the IdeaPad Gaming 3 comes with the latest Ryzen processor for $900.

Performance

The most important distinction is that the Core i5-12450H is a 45-watt 10-core (four Performance and six Efficient) and 12-thread CPU compared to the 45-watt 12-core (four Performance and eight Efficient) 16-thread i5-12500H. The Core i7-12650H is a 45-watt 10-core (six Performance and four Efficient) 16-thread CPU compared to the Core i7-12700H a 45-watt 14-core (six Performance and eight Efficient) 20-thread CPU. We’ve only benchmarked the Core i7-12700H but looking at the Geekbench 5 database the Core i5-12450H and Core i7-12650H are (as expected) slower than their higher-core and higher-thread counterparts.

We haven’t tested a 28-watt P-series Core i5 but again looking at the Geekbench 5 database it seems to be faster than the Core i5-12450H in my review unit. It’s worth noting that the Victus 15 couldn’t quite keep up with laptops running the 28-watt Core i7-1260P with its 12 cores (four Performance and eight Efficient) and 16 threads of which we’ve reviewed quite a few. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is also faster than the Core i5 in my review unit.

Accordingly the Victus 15’s productivity and creativity performances were mixed. It had the second-slowest Geekbench 5 results in our comparison group well behind the Core i7-1260P in the MSI Prestige 14 and the core i7-11800H in the HP Victus 16. The same held with our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265 although the differences weren’t as significant. At the same time the Victus 15 was more competitive in the Cinebench R23 benchmark producing the third-fastest single-core score and beating the MSI Prestige 14. The Victus 15 was again behind most of the pack in the PCMark 10 Complete test that runs through a range of productivity multimedia and creative tasks.

The Victus 15 can handle demanding productivity workflows and some low-end creative tasks.

Finally in the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark that runs in a live version of Adobe’s Premiere Pro the Victus 15 again fell behind the MSI Prestige 14. That laptop was configured with the RTX 3050 a faster GPU than the GTX 1650 in the Victus 15 and the Pugetbench benchmark is heavily influenced by GPU performance. However it wasn’t GPU performance that held the HP back. In fact the Victus 15 tied the Prestige 14 in the GPU section of the benchmark and it was in the CPU-dependent video playback section that the HP was much slower.

Overall mainstream performance was still solid for an $800 laptop. The Victus 15 can handle demanding productivity workflows and some low-end creative tasks. But you’ll see faster results by ordering via the CTO system. Interestingly the Omen Gaming Hub app has a performance tuning section but the GTX 1650 version of the Victus 15 doesn’t have a performance setting which is disappointing.

Gaming

Gaming performance was mostly in line with expectations given the GTX 1650 GPU. These are the lowest-end graphics cards you can find in a gaming laptop  so your expectations should be low when firing this up. First the Victus 15 had the lowest 3DMark Time Spy test in our comparison group as expected. It was considerably lower than the MSI Prestige 14’s RTX 3050 also as expected.

The Victus 15 performed OK in most of our benchmarks at 1080p and higher graphics settings. It managed playable frame rates in Civilization VI and Fortnite but just barely in the latter case. You’ll need to drop down to a lower setting to play Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The results aren’t listed in the table below but the Victus 15 managed to hit 45 frames per second (fps) in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p and Ultra graphics with DLSS turned off.

Overall the laptop averaged greater than 30 fps in most of our benchmark titles. Of course that’s the bare minimum fps for gaming so you’ll want to configure the RTX 3050 Ti to get more comfortable frame rates at higher graphics.

Display and audio

There are three display options for the Victus 15 all non-touch 16:9 Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS. They include a 250-nit 60Hz panel a 250-nit 144Hz panel and a 300-nit low blue light panel. My review unit was equipped with the 144Hz display and it seemed OK to me when I powered on the laptop and used it during my testing. The colors were muted but the contrast seemed deep enough and the display didn’t get terribly bright.

That’s pretty much what my colorimeter confirmed. Brightness was indeed low at 236 nits below our 300-nit threshold while the contrast was good at 1150:1 above our preferred 1000:1. Colors weren’t very wide at just 65% of sRGB and 49% of AdobeRGB and accuracy wasn’t great at a Delta-E of 3.04 (2.0 or less is considered the minimum for creative work). The Victus 16’s display was brighter and had wider and more accurate colors and only the Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey‘s display was worse.

These results aren’t terrible for a laptop that’s $800 or less but they become less palatable as you approach $1000. The display is fine for productivity work and gaming primarily thanks to the high contrast but creators will find it lacking.

Two downward-firing speakers provide the audio putting out plenty of volume with just a hint of distortion at the top end. Mids and clears were high but there was zero bass meaning you’ll want to wear some headphones for intense gaming and binging sessions.

Keyboard touchpad and webcam

There’s no per-key RGB lighting with the Victus 15 as HP is apparently reserving that for its Omen gaming lineup. Instead there’s just a single rather bright backlight setting. There’s plenty of spacing and the keys with their gamer-oriented font are large enough. I found the switches to be ligh with a nice click at the bottom which should work nicely for gamers even if it’s not a mechanical keyboard. Overall the keyboard felt much like the one on the Victus 16 which shouldn’t be a surprise.

The touchpad was large and had a surface that offered a touch of resistance. It was responsive and reliable for Windows 11 ’s complement of multi-touch gestures and the clicks were solid and confident without being too loud.

The webcam is a 720p version and it performed about as well as the typical laptop webcam. That is it was OK with good lighting but lost details in low light.

The Victus 15 doesn’t support Windows 11 Hello passwordless login. There are no fingerprint reader or infrared camera options which is disappointing.

Battery life

My review unit packed in just 52.5 watt-hours of battery which isn’t a lot for a 15-inch laptop with a discrete GPU. If you order a higher-end model via HP’s CTO system you can get a 70 watt-hour battery. I wasn’t expecting much in the way of battery life.

Unsurprisingly the Victus 15 didn’t do well. It managed just 4.25 hours in our web-browsing test that cycles through a series of popular and demanding websites and it only managed five hours in our video test that loops a local Full HD Avengers trailer. In the PCMark 10 Applications test that’s the best measure of productivity battery life it couldn’t quite make it to five hours. The average laptop in our database at least doubles those results.

The Victus 15 performed similarly to most of the gaming laptops in our comparison group. Only the Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey and the Razer Blade 14 with its AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX had meaningfully longer battery life.

Our take

Rating the HP Victus 15 is challenging given its wide range of configurations. The $600 configuration (on sale from $870) with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H and a GTX 1650 provides a lot of value and will likely provide similar performance to my review unit. Speaking of that the configuration I reviewed justifies its $800 price but barely.

In the end the Victus 15 performed well enough and is built solidly enough to make it a solid new entry in the budget gaming arena. You’ll just want to compare the available options before making your choice.

Are there any alternatives?

The best alternative to the Victus 15 is the Victus 16. It’s a little larger but it can also be configured with a much faster GPU and its display is slightly better. For just $100 more you can get a configuration with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H and RTX 3050 that’s probably faster than my review unit.

There aren’t many other gaming laptops under $1000 that have made the switch to Intel 12th-gen CPUs. One that has is the Acer Nitro 5 which has a more aggressive gaming design and similar configuration for a couple of hundred dollars more.

The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 is another alternative offering a similarly conservative design and similar components for just a bit more money than the Victus 15. You’ll want to look for the newest AMD Ryzen 6000 models.

How long will it last?

Despite a little bending in the lid and flexing in the keyboard deck the Victus 15 is a well-built budget gaming machine. It should still last for years of hard gaming. The industry-standard one-year warranty remains as disappointing as ever.

Should you buy it?

Yes. The Victus 15 is a good value as long as you make your selection carefully from among HP’s confusing purchasing options.

Once upon a time when the internet was still in its infancy (way before 3G 4G took over then 5G birthed a wave of conspiracies) people went online by connecting to a phone line.

It was as chaotic as it sounds – especially if you had promised someone you'd be on MSN at a certain time or planned to update your Myspace song.

Dial-up was first available commercially in 1992 by Pipex in the UK and Sprint in the US. The modem was the interface between the desktop computer and telephone line which you'd use to 'phone' the internet. It generally took around 30 seconds to a minute to get online – and that was on a good day.

Before the world was spoiled with lightning-fast connections a web page would take several minutes to load. To put it into perspective a 1GB file takes around 30 seconds to download today whereas in the olden days it could take approximately three days.

Landline calls couldn't be made while the internet was in use – so if someone in your house needed to make a call you'd often have to admit defeat and let them have the line.



It wasn't just the tedious chore of actually getting online and hoping no one would interrupt your internet sesh. Oh no. Millennials will remember the infamous dial-up soundtrack of digital hisses and beeps which signified data being sent and received when connecting to the internet.

Gen-Z consider yourself lucky:

The Sound of dial-up Internet www.youtube.com





Thankfully broadband started taking over the dot com boom. By 2007 half of all internet users had a broadband connection and the widespread popularity allowed costs to plummet making it accessible to most.

Broadband modems no longer require a dial-up to establish an internet connection. They remained online unless users turned it off.

Despite the endless dial-up niggles there was still an inevitable buzz about being online. It was still a relatively new concept and millennials were content in knowing they had access to such an exciting phenomenon.

That being said some things are better left in the past.

At least that’s what a new report suggests.On the occasion of World Social Media Day  findings from the Positive Aging Report 2021  published by Columbia Pacific Communities India's largest senior living community operator are debunking several misconceptions on how seniors approach social media and digital technologies.There are over six million senior citizens on Facebook in India. Through this not only does the average 60-year-old Indian maintain contact with his or her family but also with former classmates instructors and co-workers. Many seniors are using technology to improve or learn new skills whether through YouTube or Facebook groups where like-minded people share their knowledge.Contradicting numerous assumptions the insights from the report reveal that adults older than 60 years appear to be just as social media-savvy as millennials and Gen Z . As per the report one-in-five respondents aged 60 and up (20%) admit to spending more than 4 hours each day on social media compared to 19% of millennials and Gen Z.The report also indicates that nearly all respondents between the ages of 46 and 60 (97%) and those over 60 (95%) say that technology aids their mental health and peace compared to 82% of millennials and Gen Z and 87% of Gen X respondents.Mohit Nirula Chief Executive Officer of Columbia Pacific Communities commented on the subject ""It is critical to emphasise the use of social media among older adults and why it has become so important in this current times of physical isolation. Many seniors have joined social networking platforms that enable them to socialise virtually and maintain the much needed connect with their loved ones.”He adds that regular technological breakthroughs have not only aided the 60+ generation's ability to maintain their independence but also this culture appears to have had a positive effect on seniors who have lived worked and aged in cities for years. “The seniors are growing more interested in online games and content. E-magazines provide a wealth of knowledge and relevant items to keep senior citizens up to date on technology. Seniors are looking for a variety of services tailored to their needs as well as a lifestyle that is rich in social emotional physical psychological and spiritual well-being” says Nirula.Although technology is traditionally associated with men the research suggests that when it comes to individuals over 60 women are the more tech-savvy gender. 34% of senior women spend more than four hours per day on platforms such as Facebook WhatsApp and Twitter compared to only 11% of men. The percentage of women over 60 who spend more than four hours per day on social media is higher than that of millennial and Gen Z males (22%) and nearly double that of millennial and Gen Z women (15%). The explanation for this disparity would be that relative to men (74%) women (77%) appear to have a stronger belief in the utilitarian benefits of technology and hence use it more frequently.In addition compared to only 21% of men 37% of women 'strongly agree' that technology helps with their mental health and tranquility. Even though both genders believe in the benefits of technology it is safe to conclude that older women are more convinced of the benefits of a tech-enabled lifestyle than men.The Positive Ageing Report which was released in August 2021 is based on face-to-face and telephonic interviews conducted by Innovative Research Services (India) Pvt. Ltd. Over 2000 respondents older than 18 from Bengaluru Delhi Hyderabad Mumbai and Pune participated in the study. The respondents between 18 and 35 years are referred to as Gen Z and millennials and those between 36 and 45 years as Gen X in the report."

“These guys are the quietest band at Summerfest” a veteran local musician observed as Los Straitjackets effortlessly cruised through an afternoon set Thursday at the Generac Power Stage.

The masked quartet played a set of guitar instrumentals that relied on dynamics over volume. In fact it wouldn’t have been a surprise if they had given the sound mixer the afternoon off.

Clad in black to show off their gold instruments and colorful trademark Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling masks they delivered a musical history lesson that spanned big band and pop culture. But the prize in the crackerjacks for Los Straitjackets has long been the goldmine of surf and hot rod instrumentals.

If The Ventures The Shadows Link Wray and Dick Dale are obvious jumping-off points the show was a tribute to a hundred bands whose names we’ll never know. And the term show is key here as Los Straitjackets conveyed plenty of entertainment without vocals. For a rendition of Benny Goodman’s “Sing Sing Sing” drummer Gringo Starr’s tom-tom was brought center stage and he finished the number with smart dance steps.

Each tune was a soundtrack to the movies playing inside your head; for the two guitar bass and drums combo nearly everything was a familiar melody drawing from just-beyond-Easy Listening to the primal prototype of trashy garage and punk music to come. Everything was fair game with whiffs of spy movie themes and Spaghetti Western soundtracks leading to Santo and Johnny’s “Sleepwalk” to the “Batman Theme” with vocals from the crowd that segued into “Wipe Out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZmVzdGl2YWxzL3N1bW1lcmZlc3QvMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9zZWUtcGhvdG9zLWpvam8tYmxhY2stY3Jvd2VzLWZsb2NrLW9mLXNlYWd1bGxzLWFuZC1tb3JlLXN1bW1lcmZlc3QtMjAyMi1kYXktZWlnaHQtbWlsd2F1a2VlLzc3NTI0MzkwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See photos of JoJo Black Crowes and more at Summerfest 2022 Day 8 in Milwaukee,"SUMMERFEST

Fifteen minutes before his 3:30 p.m. time slot Bob Mould wandered on stage to check his mic. He was so nonchalant – not to mention dressed in his usual attire of jeans and a black T-shirt – that few fans waiting for the show to begin even noticed.

But from the moment he returned to the stage to perform his hour-plus set he was anything but casual. Instead the 61-year-old rocker powered through 22 songs often only pausing for a second or two between tunes. But the few words that came out of his mouth were warm and positive – he complimented the weather he intro’d the band he said thank you a few times – and made it perfectly clear Mould was engrossed but not aloof.

Mould performed tunes from his early days with Minneapolis punk band Husker Du to his ‘90s alternative band Sugar to cuts from his prolific solo career. When playing Mould never stopped moving from nodding his head to playing his Stratocaster like a man possessed. And the more he played the more energetic he became until he was sweaty and red-faced during his final song. X

Mould’s versatile song crafting continues to be one of his strong points. He is a masterful writer within numerous genres who can burn down the barn and then melt your heart a few minutes later. Such was the case during the show when he easily transitioned from “Hardly Getting Over It” – an emotive ballad about aging and loss – to the angry AF “Hate Paper Doll.”

The mood diversity of his songs reflects aspects of his personal life. Mould spent the first decade of adulthood trying to fit into the straight-white-male punk rock scene all the while hiding his homosexuality until the early 1990s. However in doing so Mould was able to harness feelings of both anger and loneliness that translated into powerful songs some of which confused his hardcore punk fans. (Yeah I’m talking about you “Too Far Down.”) X

Other high points of today’s Summerfest set included Husker classics “Flip Your Wig” “I Apologize” and “Makes No Sense At All” along with his solo hit “See A Little Light” and Sugar’s “If I Can’t Change Your Mind.”

Mould – who had been touring Europe solo electric – played Summerfest with a guitar player and drummer (as well as a surprise visit from Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie during the final song). The trio was eerily reminiscent of Husker Du (Mould Greg Norton and the late Grant Hart). With closed eyes it sounded like what I imagined they sounded like 35 years ago when they gigged at Century Hall on Milwaukee’s East Side.

At first the 3:30 p.m. time slot seemed early for the still-riotous punk troubadour. And yet there was something satisfying about experiencing such an incredibly powerful concert before 5 p.m. with the entire evening yet to unfold.

Getty Images

American companies are moving manufacturing back to the US from Asia.

General Motors GE Intel and US Steel are among companies opening new factories in America.

Companies started reviewing their supply chains following the US-China trade war and pandemic.

American manufacturers are increasingly bringing production back to the US to reduce their reliance on global supply chains that proved vulnerable to disruption such as the pandemic.

An overwhelming majority of American companies with production operations in China have already moved some back to the US or plan to do so in the next three years according to Kearney's 2021 Reshoring Index.

Almost four in five corporations companies have already shifted production to the US and at least 15% are considering it due to high tariffs and ongoing supply chain challenges Kearney's report shows.

However imports from low-cost Asian countries to the US still increased last year.

""Reshoring"" manufacturing has also been spurred by geopolitical disruption triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.

General Motors announced in January it would spend $7 billion on four plants in Michigan. Last year it spent almost $40 billion buying parts from some 5600 US suppliers.

The manufacturer behind Chevrolet GMC Cadillac and Hummer announced its biggest investment to increase its battery cell production to achieve its aim of becoming North America's biggest electric vehicle producer.

GE Appliances is also investing on expanding US production to make products closer to customers and create more American jobs.

The company which produces appliances like refrigerators dishwashers and hot water heaters has invested more than $2 billion in its US plants and distribution centers since 2016.

It opened a water heater plant in May in Camden South Carolina and has increased its spend on US suppliers by two thirds in the past five years.

Intel is investing $12 billion on two chip factories near Phoenix that are due to open in 2024. The company said last year that the US has ""lost ground"" in manufacturing semiconductors.

The new US plants will help meet domestic demand for the billions of chips now used in a array of products from computers to cars.







US Steel is investing in a $3 billion steelmaking factory in Osceola Arkansas. Similarly Nucor is spending about $2.7 billion on a steel plate mill in Brandberg Kentucky with construction set to start later this year.

Generac Power Systems moved some production from China to the US after the pandemic. Last year it unveiled plans to open a new plant in Trenton South Carolina.

Lockheed Martin is putting $16.5 million into a new Missile System Integration Lab facility in Huntsville Alabama. The defense contractor already has 25 facilities in Alabama and expects to create a further 200 jobs there.

US companies started reconsidering having their supply chains abroad after a trade war with China resulted in high tariffs on Chinese imports.

The Trump administration pushed for ""America First"" trade and called to bring jobs back to the US as the trade war began in 2018.

Manufacturers told US trade officials in June 2019 that increasing tariffs on Chinese imports would increase costs for consumers and put jobs at risk. Two months later Trump told businesses that they should ""immediately"" look for alternative manufacturers to China ""including bringing your companies home"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vb25taWx3YXVrZWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2RlYXRoLWNhYi1mb3ItY3V0aWUtc3VtbWVyZmVzdC1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Death Cab for Cutie closes out Summerfest with ample doses of nostalgia & new,"Your guide to having a great summer is brought to you by Potawatomi Hotel & Casino and Peoples State Bank .

Death Cab for Cutie capped off a series of memorable performances at the Generac Power Stage on Saturday night giving fans a helluva show to close out Summerfest.

Their performance showcased a treasure trove of gems including fan favorites from albums that span over two decades. But frontman Ben Gibbard and his bandmates also delivered fresh takes well executed experimentalism and a few new songs during their memorable 90 minute set. X

Sound issues plagued the first two songs in the set – “I Dreamt We Spoke Again’ and “Summer Years” – with droning base muting Gibbard’s silky vocals. But by the time they broke into “The Ghosts of Beverly Drive” a lively meditation on the baggage often carried into new relationships the sound crew had effectively mitigated the issues paving the way for Gibbard and crew to pick up the pace with “Long Division” a fast paced tune that uses mathematical metaphor to tackle the deep-rooted feelings of living as an outsider.

It struck me as I listened to the cerebral lyrics that the band has come a long way since its inaugural album “Something About Airplanes” was released in 1998. And yet there's so much about them which has remained consistent. For me part of the appeal of Death Cab has always been their down-to-earth vibe – even in concert the band bears the stereotypical look of Seattle coffee shop denizens – and thought provoking lyrics. It's undoubtedly among the reasons why their starkly confessional albums have somehow despite the passage of over two decades aged as well as they have.

That became starkly evident when Gibbard pulled the tune ""Photobooth"" out of the proverbial ""way back machine."" The song released 22 years ago on the ""We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes"" album could well have been written yesterday. X

From Cactus Club to fireworks

Gibbard was congenial throughout the show thanking the crowd regularly for listening but also engaging them with more personal banter.

“It’s always good to be back here in Milwaukee” he said following a performance of “Blacking Out the Friction”. “I’ve got fond memories of the first time we played here at the Cactus Club in August of 1999 [ …] This is dedicated to the six people who showed up..”

And with that he broke into a soulful performance of “I Will Follow You Into The Dark” a darkly beautiful ballad that tackles both the loss of faith and the passion of a relationship that transcends death. Ben Gibbard X

As he sang fireworks broke out in the background the explosions marking a distinctive contrast to the lyrics. Gibbard stopped. “I think this might be the first time we’ve ever been interrupted by fireworks” he said with a chuckle finishing out the song as the crowd sang enthusiastically along the booming fireworks like bombs in the distance.

Big energy

Little was predictable about the concert including a rendition of the popular “I Will Possess Your Heart” that featured a memorable intro featuring gritty distorted guitar that enhanced the inherently creepy sentiment of the song (it’s basically the ballad of a stalker). Dave Depper X

Emotions ran high during performances of “Cath…” and “Northern Lights” a tune that serves up poignantly angsty teenage scenes worthy of a John Hughes film thanks to lyrics like “We shared a clove cigarette / On the parapet / As the T.V.s glowed from windows of the model homes.”

Gibbard was in constant motion throughout the 90 minute performance. His shoulders swayed his feet bounced and he frequently propelled himself across the stage often backwards wielding his Fender Mustang with bristling punk rock energy.

That energy was evident during heavy-hitters like “Title and Registration“ and “Crooked Teeth” a tune bristling with fuzzy-toned guitar. In fact the talent of the entire quintet which included bass player Nick Harmer lead guitarist Dave Depper drummer Jason McGerr and keyboardist Zac Rae – was evident throughout the tight lively set. Nick Harmer X

Something new

The Summerfest performance marked the fifth show in their 2022 Asphalt Meadows Tour which intersects the release of their tenth studio album on Sept. 16.

As a result the set also included two new singles. The first was the recently released “Roman Candles” a pandemic-fueled anthem in which Gibbard sang: “I used to feel everything like a flame/Now it's a struggle just to feel anything/I watch the world from a window on a hill/Everyone moving as I'm standing still” before the band erupted into a cacophony of distorted 80s shoegaze-esque noise including drums that emulated the fireworks for which the song is named. Jason McGerr X

The second was “Here to Forever” which will be released on July 13.

It seemed the night would wrap up with “Bixby Canyon Bridge” and its maelstrom of whirling synths and screeching guitars. But after the band left the stage guests were treated to a rare Summerfest encore.

Just a few moments ticked by before Gibbard walked back onto the stage grabbing his guitar and launching into the catchy crowd-pleaser “You Are a Tourist.” That was followed by the heart-string tugging “Soul Meets Body” after which Gibbard stood with his Gibson acoustic ax held high as the crowd roared with praise and applause.

Born Robert Lee Haymaker in Indianapolis on September 23 1935 to John Oglesby Haymaker and Elizabeth “Mimi” Way Bob went to Broadripple High School graduating in the class of 1953. He was also a member of Trinity Episcopal Church. Selected for a Naval ROTC scholarship for college Bob studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois where he earned his freshmen numerals in Baseball managed the Illinois Basketball team and was a Senior Track and Field manager for which he lettered. When he graduated he received his commission and was stationed in Okinawa Japan where he worked with the US Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) and taught local children baseball for which he received a commendation from the school system. In the 50s as part of the Pacific Command he was stationed in Honolulu Hawaii when it became a state. A gifted athlete he played baseball at Broadripple High School where he teamed up with his best friends Ken Sieman and Al Lindop to win city-wide championships. After his time in the service he worked at North American Aviation and General Dynamics where he worked on trajectories for the moon landing using slide rules. But he frequently traveled back to the Midwest where he reconnected with the Muir family who he knew through his university days just when Joanne Muir was graduating. They decided to keep in touch and after a whirlwind six month transcontinental courtship were married on December 31 1965 in Blue Island Illinois at St. Paul’s Evangelical Reformed Church. After nearly a decade traveling the US installing computer systems and training personnel Bob accepted a position at Lone Star Industries. The young couple settled in Greencastle Indiana and started a family. They also bought a parcel of degraded farmland planted it in trees and watched as it restored itself to woods over the years recently placing it in a conservation easement with Oubache Land Conservancy. Known for his quirky sense of humor and fun-loving nature Bob was active in the community especially St. Andrews Episcopal church youth sports and the local Tai Chi club. Bob was preceded in death by his parents his sister Margaret Anne “Midge” Haymaker Ervin and brother-in-law Gene Ervin. He is survived by his wife Joanne their two children and two grandchildren. A celebration of Bob’s life is planned at St. Andrews Episcopal Church on Saturday July 23 from 2-5 PM. In lieu of flowers donations in Bob’s name can be made to the Oubache Land Conservancy St. Andrews Church or the Putnam County Library all of which Bob was proud to contribute to throughout his life.

Chinese hypersonic weapons test ‘has all of our attention’ US General Mark Milley says

Chinese hypersonic weapons test ‘has all of our attention’ US General Mark Milley says

In an anti-ship or land-attack role hypersonic weapons – which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound – could be a significant threat and give a decisive advantage to one side if its opponent lacks a similar capability or the means to defend itself against hypersonic weapons.

The assessment comes as several countries including the United States China and Russia are developing the highly destructive weapon whose high speed and greater range make them difficult to intercept.

Experts warn that an emerging hypersonic arms race raises the danger of miscalculation and retaliatory strikes.

China has operationally deployed the DF-17 hypersonic glide vehicle and is set to deploy a bomber-launched anti-ship missile named CH-AS-X-13. The country also tested an orbital hypersonic glide vehicle on a fractional-orbital bombardment system last year.

Russia is developing its own system. The Kinzhal is a nuclear-capable hypersonic aero-ballistic air-to-surface missile that has a claimed range of more than 2000km (1250 miles) at 12 times the speed of sound. The Kinzhal entered service in December 2017.

And the Japanese military is considering developing a hypersonic anti-ship missile with a warhead specifically designed to penetrate the decks of Chinese aircraft carriers.

Timothy Heath a senior security analyst from US think tank Rand said “there definitely seems to be a hypersonic missile arms race under way … because the technology is new and there is no defence against it”.

“The main reason the countries are developing hypersonic weapons is for deterrent purposes. There is currently no defence against the weapons so countries are building their own capabilities to deter a country like China or Russia. The reasoning is that a hypersonic missile strike by China or Russia could be met with a retaliatory strike by the defending the country” Heath said.

Heath warned that the net result was likely to be heightened tension as countries build up inventories of hypersonic missiles.

“These missiles move extremely fast and cannot be defeated so there is a danger that in a crisis a country could miscalculate and launch one of the missiles spurring retaliatory strikes.

“As tensions between China and the US and its allies increase it will become more imperative that all sides find ways to ease tensions and improve crisis management mechanisms in order to reduce the danger” he said.

02:13 North Korea claims to have conducted hypersonic missile test attended by leader Kim Jong-un North Korea claims to have conducted hypersonic missile test attended by leader Kim Jong-un

Malcolm Davis a senior analyst from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute echoed Heath’s forecast.

“I think we are potentially seeing the beginnings of a hypersonic race emerging as both the Western democracies and their authoritarian adversaries sense the importance of this type of technology for long-range strike against land and maritime [targets]” Davis said.

“Obviously there are ways to reduce the threat – to sever the kill chain between sensor and shooter and to enhance missile defence technologies but with hypersonics it’s actually likely to become a ‘battle of the first salvo’ – he who shoots first wins” Davis said.

Ridzwan Rahmat a security analyst from Janes said the proliferation of hypersonic weapons accelerated the tempo of modern combat operations.

“Tactics and doctrines are now shifting in a way for units in the battlefield to react faster to the possibility of a hypersonic weapon deployment. Additionally there are now efforts to develop higher-powered sensors and suitable satellite technology that can better detect these weapons” Rahmat said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2V1cm9zYXRvcnktdmlydHVhbC12aXNpdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eurosatory virtual visit,"Paolo Valpolini

Command Post variant of the ACSV Armored Combat Support Vehicle. (Picture source GDLS Canada)

On September 5 2019 the government of Canada awarded GDLS-Canada (General Dynamics Land Systems) a $2 billion contract to provide 360 wheeled armored vehicles in eight variants including troop or cargo vehicle (TCV) ambulance command post engineer electronic warfare maintenance recovery mobile repair team and fitter/cargo vehicle to replace the LAV II Bison 8x8 armored vehicles and M113 tracked armored combat support capabilities.

The ACSV (Armored Combat Support Vehicle) is a new enhanced version of the LAV 6.0 developed by General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) Canada for the Canadian Army. It is a modernized version of the LAV III also an 8x8 armored vehicle.

The ACSV is built on the same chassis as the Canadian Army’s primary fighting platform the LAV 6.0 and will deliver a highly mobile and protected vehicle system able to provide command support combat support and combat service support capabilities to forward elements of a brigade group formation during expeditionary and domestic operations.

Citing information from a Canadian army officer as part of the fighting echelon the ACSV has mobility and protection commensurate with the current combat fleet of the Leopard Main Battle Tank the LAV 6.0 and the Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle. The ACSV will differ significantly from the fleets the variants are replacing by providing crews and troops with enhanced power mobility longer operating ranges protection firepower and safety features – all platforms will come with energy attenuating seats to protect from blast threats.

Building on the common chassis the Canadian Army is also striving for a significant amount of modularity in the design of the ACSV family. The design and structure of the TCV Ambulance and Command Post for example are identical and mission specialist payloads could be interchangeable if required.



Troop carrier version of the ACSV Armored Combat Support Vehicle. (Canada MoD)

The ACSV design consists of three main parts with the driver position at the front left side of the hull with the powerpack on its right the commander hatch is located behind the driver's position and the troop's compartment at the rear. In terms of protection the vehicle has a double-V hull and energy attenuated seats providing a high level of protection against ballistic and mine threats. Compared to the previous LAV the ACSV has a raised troop compartment offering more space and comfort for infantrymen.

The ACSV also features an upgraded driveline suspension larger tires and a more powerful engine to deliver significantly increased payload and superior mobility performance. Advanced electronics and sight upgrades provide improved target identification and weapon accuracy all packaged in a turret with enhanced ergonomics and safety.

The ACSV is powered by a Caterpillar C9 engine developing 450 hp (335 kW) coupled to a ZF transmission with 7 forward and 1 reverse speed. The vehicle can run at a maximum road speed of 100 km/h with a maximum cruising range of 600 km. It can cross a trench of 2 m length and negotiate vertical obstacles up to 60 cm high. It can negotiate a gradient of 60 % and side slopes of 30 %. The turning radius of the vehicle is less than 19 m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTE2NzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Refining real-time predictions of Vibrio vulnificus concentrations in a tropical urban estuary by incorporating dissolved ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722011676 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTE2NzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Inside away from the elements Mr. Gaesser pondered what the coming year might bring for farmers.

As tractors and planters throughout the Midwest rolled into fields like the ones near his house earlier this year Mr. Gaesser 69 was hopeful that soaring grain prices and heightened global demand for food would translate into robust revenues. But he also expected that sharply higher costs for fuel fertilizer and other necessities would cut deeply into profits.

And then there is Big Food.

Companies like PepsiCo Cargill Walmart and General Mills are trying to convince farmers like Mr. Gaesser to adopt new climate-friendly agricultural techniques through a variety of financial incentives and programs. They have good reason. Together these companies have pledged that at least 70 million acres or roughly 18 percent of the nation’s total cropland an area about the size of Nevada will be operated using regenerative agriculture techniques by 2030.

Through photosynthesis plants — whether corn or trees — convert carbon dioxide from the air into energy that is stored in the soil. Regenerative farming techniques such as planting a cover crop during the fall allows that process to continue throughout the winter months when the soil would normally be bare.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIyMTQ3LXNsaWRlc2hvdy1pdHMtYmFjay1wdW1wa2luLXNwaWNlLXJldHVybnMtdG8tc3RvcmUtc2hlbHZlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: It's back — pumpkin spice returns to store shelves,"KANSAS CITY — Although temperatures may remain high across much of the United States summer is coming to a close — at least as far as retail flavors are concerned. From energy drinks to cereals pumpkin spice flavored products are flooding shelves across the United States.

General Mills Inc. released a host of fall flavored products across a few of its brands including Cheerios and Pillsbury. The limited-edition Cheerios have been formulated with pumpkin puree as well as a blend of cinnamon cloves and nutmeg. Pumpkin-spiced products from Pillsbury include Grands! Pumpkin Spice Rolls and a ready-to-bake pumpkin cookie dough featuring cream cheese flavored chunks.

Pumpkin spice also may be found in the beverage aisle of grocery stores in varieties ranging from coffee creamers to energy drinks. Plant-based beverage brand Califia Farms added a Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista blend meant for making at-home pumpkin spice lattes according to the company.

“We’re thrilled to introduce our new Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista which gives oat milk fans an easy way to froth up their favorite seasonal oat lattes at home” said Suzanne Ginestro chief marketing officer at Califia Farms. “Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista will launch as a limited-edition item this fall alongside our ready-to-drink Pumpkin Spice Almondmilk Latte and Pumpkin Spice Almondmilk Creamer. With the launch of Pumpkin Spice Oat Barista Califia brings yet another reason to celebrate the season with a full variety of yummy plant-based options to make all types of seasonal coffee-house drinks at home.”

Taking pumpkin spice a different direction is plant-based energy brand Yerbaé which debuted Yerbaé Pumpkin Spice a zero-calorie energy drink flavored with natural caffeine from yerba mate and nutmeg cinnamon and ginger.

Pumpkin spice also may be found in the snack category where Campbell Soup Co. partnered with Dunkin’ Brands to launch Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Grahams. The fall snack combines notes of pumpkin donut glaze and warm spices according to Campbell Soup.

“We continue to take Goldfish to the next level with new delicious and unexpected partnerships” said Janda Lukin chief marketing officer of Campbell Snacks. “The new limited-edition Goldfish Dunkin’ Pumpkin Spice Graham crackers bring together two fun and iconic brands to give pumpkin spice lovers a new way to experience the sweet side of their favorite snack. This is the first time Goldfish is tapping into the pumpkin spice season and we couldn’t be more excited to partner with the brand that knows pumpkin spice the best.”

She had words of love for her husband Lowell Turner her four daughters six grandchildren and four sons (in law). She lived every day with care love and compassion. Joyce was a farm girl at heart. She was born April 20 1929 in Rush Point MN. Her mother and father Ruth and Walter Carlson farmed in the area. At an early age Joyce was eager to assist her dad in milking cows driving horses and later tractors. Joyce would often say that growing up on a farm was the best childhood she could imagine. She attended the same two-room country school as her father before graduating from Braham High School. Following high school her career took her to Minneapolis where she worked at General Mills Provident Mutual Life Insurance and Diversity Chemical. She spent summers helping her parents farm. Joyce met her future husband Lowell at a dance at Pine Camp Ballroom near Pine City and two years later they married. They continued as life and dance partners for 67 loving years. Most Saturday nights were spent at Medina Ballroom dancing until the last song ended. They lived in Plymouth almost their entire married lives until moving to Summit Place in Eden Prairie in late 2017. Lowell and their four daughters were the center of Joyce's life. She was everything you would associate with a mom and grandma - loving caring and interested in whatever her family was doing. Even in her final days she was checking to make sure that everyone had enough to eat and was getting enough sleep - pets too. A true mom. Hearing Joyce play the piano was one of life's joys. She learned to play by ear and became so accomplished that she once finished second in a state high school piano competition. Calvary Lutheran Church in Rush Point selected Joyce to be the organist. Later she played piano and taught Sunday School and Vacation Bible School at Calvary Lutheran Church in Golden Valley where Joyce and Lowell were members for 60 years. Every day at 4 p.m. Joyce played piano at Summit Place. She prepared a daily play list that reflected a holiday season of the year plus some of her favorite songs. Summit Place residents say it's not the same without Joyce's daily piano playing. In high school Joyce also started writing poems and continued composing them throughout her life. Many times she wrote them as ""histories"" about a friend or family member. If you were fortunate enough to be the subject of one of her poems it was a lifelong treasure. She was also a woman of faith which gave her strength daily and to the end. Joyce leaves behind a legacy of family. In addition to Lowell there are four daughters and their spouses Jan Eide (Jerry) Diane Schultz (Scott) Darlene Otten (Elmer) Dawn Kelly (Chuck) 6 amazing grandchildren and their spouses and 12 great grandchildren. Per Joyce's request they will be named! Grandchildren: Jill (Schultz) Hartl (Jason) Jenna (Schultz) Papes (Rob) Josh Leuer (Christy) Jon Leuer (Kellie) Joe Leuer (Tiya) Kenny Leuer (Brianna).

Getty Images

American companies are moving manufacturing back to the US from Asia.

General Motors GE Intel and US Steel are among companies opening new factories in America.

Companies started reviewing their supply chains following the US-China trade war and pandemic.

American manufacturers are increasingly bringing production back to the US to reduce their reliance on global supply chains that proved vulnerable to disruption such as the pandemic.

An overwhelming majority of American companies with production operations in China have already moved some back to the US or plan to do so in the next three years according to Kearney's 2021 Reshoring Index.

Almost four in five corporations companies have already shifted production to the US and at least 15% are considering it due to high tariffs and ongoing supply chain challenges Kearney's report shows.

However imports from low-cost Asian countries to the US still increased last year.

""Reshoring"" manufacturing has also been spurred by geopolitical disruption triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.

General Motors announced in January it would spend $7 billion on four plants in Michigan. Last year it spent almost $40 billion buying parts from some 5600 US suppliers.

The manufacturer behind Chevrolet GMC Cadillac and Hummer announced its biggest investment to increase its battery cell production to achieve its aim of becoming North America's biggest electric vehicle producer.

GE Appliances is also investing on expanding US production to make products closer to customers and create more American jobs.

The company which produces appliances like refrigerators dishwashers and hot water heaters has invested more than $2 billion in its US plants and distribution centers since 2016.

It opened a water heater plant in May in Camden South Carolina and has increased its spend on US suppliers by two thirds in the past five years.

Intel is investing $12 billion on two chip factories near Phoenix that are due to open in 2024. The company said last year that the US has ""lost ground"" in manufacturing semiconductors.

The new US plants will help meet domestic demand for the billions of chips now used in a array of products from computers to cars.







US Steel is investing in a $3 billion steelmaking factory in Osceola Arkansas. Similarly Nucor is spending about $2.7 billion on a steel plate mill in Brandberg Kentucky with construction set to start later this year.

Generac Power Systems moved some production from China to the US after the pandemic. Last year it unveiled plans to open a new plant in Trenton South Carolina.

Lockheed Martin is putting $16.5 million into a new Missile System Integration Lab facility in Huntsville Alabama. The defense contractor already has 25 facilities in Alabama and expects to create a further 200 jobs there.

US companies started reconsidering having their supply chains abroad after a trade war with China resulted in high tariffs on Chinese imports.

The Trump administration pushed for ""America First"" trade and called to bring jobs back to the US as the trade war began in 2018.

Manufacturers told US trade officials in June 2019 that increasing tariffs on Chinese imports would increase costs for consumers and put jobs at risk. Two months later Trump told businesses that they should ""immediately"" look for alternative manufacturers to China ""including bringing your companies home"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvY2Fycy9nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L21pY2hpZ2FuLWRlYWxlci1zYXlzLWhlcy1nb3QtZmlyc3QtY2FkaWxsYWMtbHlyaXEtd29ybGQvMTAwMDkwNjYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cadillac dealer says he has first Lyriq EV in the world told 'Don't touch it',"A few days before the Fourth of July holiday weekend Cadillac of Novi's General Manager Ed Pobur got a surprise phone call.

It was his Cadillac representative who told him ""You’re getting delivered the first Lyriq in the world.""

Pobur said he was supposed to get it before July 4 but because of the holiday it was delayed a few days. A Cadillac spokesman confirmed a hauler truck delivered the Lyriq to Cadillac of Novi before taking the second production Lyriq to LaFontaine Cadillac in Highland.

To be first is big but it's especially noteworthy in this case. The 2023 Cadillac Lyriq all-electric SUV is the cornerstone of Cadillac's future.

The Lyriq is the first EV to enter Cadillac's lineup which General Motors vows will be entirely electric by the end of the decade. As a company GM has said all its brands will be all-electric by 2035.

The car is so important to Cadillac that the person who bought it cannot take delivery of it for seven to 10 days so that Cadillac engineers and a team of specialists can inspect it and teach Cadillac of Novi's service technicians how to service it.

Pobur said he had strict instructions from his brand rep: “Don’t touch it.""

The 'white glove treatment'

Cadillac spokesman Michael Albano told the Free Press that GM started shipping 2023 Lyriqs last week to the highest demand markets: New York Los Angeles and Detroit.

Of Pobur’s dealership he said ""they're pretty fortunate"" Albano said.

Cadillac started building the Lyriq in late March at its Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee.

Just days before opening the order banks for the rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive models in May GM said the 2023 rear-wheel drive model will top 300 miles in range and offer two new colors.

The rear-wheel drive Lyriq will start at $62990 a $3000 price bump from the Lyriq Debut edition. The all-wheel drive model starts at $64990. Initial deliveries of the all-wheel drive model will start early next year and the EPA-estimated range for that model will be announced closer to the start of production.

GM opened the order banks on May 19 but stopped taking orders for the 2023 Lyriq in two hours saying it sold out. GM will not say how many Lyriqs constitute ""sold out"" but earlier this year GM told suppliers to prepare to produce 25000 Lyriqs this year.

As for the delivery of the SUVs to customers Albano said all cars go through a dealer inspection no matter what the make and model but there is ""an added element on this car.""

""We're doing a white glove treatment"" Albano said. ""These first early cars we're going to make sure everything is perfect. I don't know if we'll do that at every dealership. But with Lyriq we're doing everything we can to assure this launch is perfect.""

Four minutes on the floor

About 1 p.m. Thursday an open-air hauler truck rolled up to the store on Grand River Avenue in Novi. On it was the Satin Steel-colored Lyriq.

Pobur and his staff were anxiously waiting and ready to greet it.

“We took pictures and videos. It was very exciting"" Pobur said. ""No one’s seen the car. Usually people the engineers are running around town with them. But this one’s been kind of a secret. When you see it in person it’s spectacular.""

GM did bring a few pre-production Lyriqs to metro Detroit in February to test.

Pobur's crew got it off the truck inspected it wiped it down and put it on the showroom floor he said.

""Then Cadillac’s team showed up to inspect it so we had to move it and up it went on the hoist"" Pobur said. Cadillac has to teach his technicians about the EV because ""we've never had it before"" he said.

As a result the first Lyriq in the world was only on the showroom floor for four minutes Pobur said.

That was long enough for another customer to see it and tell a sales associate that if the customer who bought it has a change of heart ""tell him I’ll give him $30000 over sticker for it.""

A near $1 million investment

Once Cadillac gives the dealership the OK Pobur will put it in the showroom until the customer can take delivery.

""We can’t let anyone drive it because it’s somebody’s car"" Pobur said.

Albano can't say why Cadillac of Novi was the first to get a production Lyriq but Pobur believes it's because he has been the top-selling Cadillac dealer in the country for eight of the last 12 years including last year.

“I do the most business in Detroit and I do the most business in the country so I get preferential treatment on some of this stuff"" Pobur said. ""That’s the way it should be when you sell the most cars.”

Albano said Cadillac concentrated its first Lyriq deliveries on the markets that have the highest volume of orders which are Detroit New York and Los Angeles and ""geographically the trucks got here from Tennessee first before they got to LA and New York.""

Cadillac of Novi has 13 orders for the rear-wheel drive 2023 Lyriq and 130 more orders sitting in the order bank for either 2023 or 2024 models when GM switches to the new model year.

Cadillac of Novi meanwhile spent $900000 to make the dealership EV-ready Pobur said. He had to get new electric wiring throughout the buildings to support the chargers new electrical lines and various chargers in place.

“I didn’t want to do it half-ass"" Pobur said. ""I wanted to do it right. So we spent a little more than we probably wanted to but we’re ready now.”

The subsidiary of the South Korean steel company expects to complete construction early next year and will focus on motor cores.

Posco International plans to inject about 160 billion won ($123.2 million) by 2030 to produce 1.5 million motor cores in Mexico annually. By 2025 targets include 650000 units.

“Mexico will become our basecamp to expand our presence in the North American EV parts market” said Posco International CEO Joo Si-bo at the groundbreaking ceremony. “And we will become a leading manufacturer of motor cores in the auto industry striving to go green” quotes the Korea Herald.

Driving motor cores comprise a stator and a rotor and are key components to generate electricity in EVs and are key to determining their performance Posco said adding it had received orders worth US$460m from global automakers without disclosing names.

Posco and its subsidiary Posco Chemical had invested heavily in the global EV supply chain in the last few years with a number of plants for EV battery components and materials currently under construction worldwide. They also hold deals with companies such as General Motors ProLogium or Morrow Batteries.

Posco International itself completed the construction of a motor core plant in Pohang South Korea last December.

Globally the company targets a capacity of seven million motor cores by 2030 up from 1.2 million in 2021.

These appear to be developed by the Posco Mobility Solution division. It focuses on developing embossed automatic additive cores loose welding cores and Embo-free (EMFree) cores. Further aims include reducing the vibration and noise of rotors through use of Skew/Index additive cores and using Self-Bonding cores so the website.

While Posco has complete cores it says it also offers components in modularized forms including magnet moulding and shaft assembly to better meet diverse customer needs.

It can be a lot of fun buying stocks trading in the single digits. While there are a lot of bad companies down in the cheap seats sometimes you can find some amazing bargains. Our roundtable has found three really cool biotech stocks trading under $10 a share.

Here's why we like SeaSpine (SPNE) Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX -1.68%) and Agenus (AGEN -7.26%).

Growth at a serious discount

Patrick Bafuma (SeaSpine): Looking at growth prospects spinal surgery pure-play SeaSpine caught my eye. This healthcare company offers hardware for spinal implants as well as orthobiologics -- implanted medication at the surgical site that enhances bone repair after surgical procedures. It also offers a surgical navigation system designed to improve the accuracy of hardware placement thus providing a faster and more cost-effective radiation-free surgery. In short SeaSpine gives its orthopedic and neurosurgical customers a complete solution to meet patients' evolving clinical needs.

And business is picking up. In the first quarter of 2022 the company grew total revenue 21% over the prior-year period to $50.7 million slightly exceeding the high end of guidance by $1 million. In fact the company raised full-year 2022 revenue guidance by $5 million to a range of $231 million to $235 million. This reflects growth of approximately 21% to 23% over full-year 2021. SeaSpine also sports an adjusted gross margin of 62% for the first quarter and reminds me of another surgical supplier Stryker and its 64% margin. This is a good company to be in considering Stryker has handily beat the S&P 500 over the last two decades.

SeaSpine expanded its product portfolio with the full commercial launch of four products and systems in 2021. It is guiding for a 15%-18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years and aims to be profitable by the end of 2024. This healthcare company trades below an Alexander Hamilton yet its market cap of $220 million is actually below its 2022 full-year revenue guidance. Given that and its anticipated double-digit CAGR for the next few years SeaSpine looks to swim past the market for years to come.

Re-imagining drug discovery

Taylor Carmichael (Recursion Pharmaceuticals): I've been binge watching Elementary this last week a great modern-day update of Sherlock Holmes. Among other things I love that Sherlock is an out-of-the-box thinker who tries to be logical and rational as he approaches crime. Some of his theories apply to drug discovery as well. After all in both cases you are trying to solve a mystery.

Holmes hates concepts like ""luck"" and ""guessing."" (As a stock investor I am totally on board with this hatred.) But he takes this antipathy even further. Holmes is very dubious about having a scientific hypothesis about a crime before you have enough facts. So his first move is always collecting data. This will result in a future hypothesis that is more likely to be right.

Recursion is trying to bring Sherlock's approach to drug discovery. There's a danger in scientists forming a hypothesis about a disease before they have data known as ""confirmation bias."" They're looking for positive data to confirm their hypothesis and they're blind to the negative data that negates it. This human bias is perhaps why so many drugs fail to make it to market (almost 90% of them).

Recursion has a new way to find drugs. The biotech has created a massive map of biology. Using artificial intelligence (AI) Recursion has run 100 million highly reproducible experiments. From this data set the AI software has inferred 240 billion biological relationships that might help scientists treat diseases. Researchers accessing this data can now create a data-based hypothesis using human intuition to find drugs that are more likely to work well.

Traditional Drug Discovery Approach Recursion Drug Discovery Review the scientific literature Review an AI map of biology Generate a hypothesis Navigate a massive index of machine-generated hypotheses created from the results of 100 million experiments Try to validate the hypothesis Already validated 10% success rate in humans Unknown success rate in humans

Right now Recursion has a small market cap ($1.5 billion) and an even smaller amount of revenue ($13 million over the last year). This biotech doesn't have a P/E ratio and it's P/S ratio is astronomical. Nonetheless there was a fair amount of excitement at the IPO probably because mega-caps like Roche and Bayer are collaborating with the biotech and Cathie Wood is an investor.

The stock is now down about 71% from its IPO and in this market it might fall further. But I suspect Recursion will emerge a big winner with its data-based approach to drug discovery. If you're interested I would suggest opening with a small position (under 1% of assets).

A potential 10-bagger

George Budwell (Agenus): Agenus is a small-cap immunotherapy company with enormous potential as a growth vehicle for patient investors. Although the company's share price has jumped by a whopping 61% over the last 30 days Agenus' stock is still down by an eye-catching 59% from its 52-week high.

Agenus' shares have started to turn the corner recently due to an important clinical update for its next-generation CTLA-4 antibody known as botensilimab. Specifically botensilimab when used in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor balstilimab reportedly produced an unprecedented overall response rate in patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer.

To date Agenus' lead anti-cancer candidate has shown clinical activity across nine different types of cancer that do not respond to the current slate of available immunotherapies. Put simply this biologic anti-cancer therapy could be a game-changer for scores of patients with hard-to-treat malignancies.

What's more Agenus also has a handful of high-value collaborations underway. As things stand now the company has $2.8 billion in potential milestone payments in play from a host of partners such as Bristol Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences. That's a sizable amount of money for a company with a market cap under $800 million at the time of this writing.

The bottom line with Agenus is that the company does have a long way to go to realize its full potential. Botensilimab after all is only in mid-stage development right now. But with a possible franchise-level drug in hand and multiple partnerships in full swing Agenus' stock appears poised for a long-tailed growth spurt in the years ahead. In fact this small-cap biotech arguably has the very real potential to morph into a large-cap immunotherapy behemoth by the end of the decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Australian Financial Review’s economics editor John Kehoe for example has noted:

Australians are paying more personal income tax as a share of government revenue than any other advanced economy except for the high-taxing Scandinavian welfare state of Denmark.

And the day after the federal election the AFR editorialised:

Too heavy reliance on taxing productive workers and business earnings blunts incentives to work save and invest.

Perhaps even more stinging is that the AFR considers New Zealand to have a better income-tax system. New Zealanders pay 10.5% on their first NZ$14000 (then 17.5% up to NZ$48000) while Australians enjoy a tax-free threshold up to A$18200. The AFR says this:

creates tax-penalty work disincentives that partly explain New Zealand’s approximately 5% higher rate of workforce participation than Australia.

Are these issues really a problem? If there is a case for tax reform what sort of reform?

High individual income tax

In 2019 the most recent year for which the OECD has complete statistics Australia ranked second among OECD members on personal income tax as a share of total taxes.

In fact it has ranked second or third in 36 of the past 40 years and fourth in the other four years swapping places with New Zealand and the United States.

But that’s just part of the picture

Overall Australia’s level of taxation measured as a proportion of GDP is relatively low – 27.7% to the OECD average of 33.4%.

That makes Australia the 29th lowest-taxing nation of the OECD’s 38 members.

Other nations have social security taxes

The main reason Australia ranks so highly on individual income tax levels is because Australians don’t pay separate social security taxes.

Australia New Zealand and Denmark fund social security from general government revenue. The other 35 OECD nations levy specific taxes on employers and employees to fund social security systems (unemployment support age and disability pensions etc)

These account for an average 25.9% of total tax revenue or close to 9% of GDP across the OECD.

Employee social security contributions are very similar to income taxes. They are generally collected the same way and counted as direct taxes on households or individuals in income surveys.

Though employers also pay social security taxes evidence suggests about two-thirds of these are effectively paid by employees through lower wages.

In fact if we add together personal income taxes and social security contributions then Australia rather than having the second-highest share of income taxes in the OECD has the eighth-lowest.

What about superannuation?

Some say Australia’s compulsory superannuation scheme in which employers pay 10.5% of an employee’s wage as super should be counted in these tax measures because it is similar to social security contributions in other countries.

12 other OECD countries have mandatory employer-paid private pension schemes.

Employers pay this money directly into private accounts not to the government so it doesn’t meet the definition of a tax.

But for argument’s sake we can factor in super payments using “tax wedge” data.

Combining mandatory payments

A tax wedge is the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average worker (assumed to be single without dependents) and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer.

The important point here is that wedge data include both what employers pay as mandatory private payments and as mandatory payments into government social security.

On this measure Australia’s direct tax burden is the 11th lowest in the OECD.

So claims we have very high shares of personal income taxes are only part of the picture. Superannuation does not change the story significantly.

So what about New Zealand?

New Zealand does collect more revenue through consumption taxes – 12.5% of GDP in 2019 compared to 7.3% for Australia.

But it still collects more in income taxes – 12.4% of GDP compared to 11.6%. Its total level of taxation is 33.4% of GDP compared to 27.7% for Australia.

The case for tax reform

Even so there are things to learn from New Zealand.

Australia’s system could be structured better. As Louis XIV’s finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683) said the art of taxation is about “plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”.

Income taxes are highly visible. This may make us more ready to believe we are highly taxed. There is a case for considering tax reforms that deliver adequate revenue more fairly.

New Zealand is in the process of this change with its proposed Social Unemployment Insurance scheme being funded by a 1.39% levy on employers and workers.

Last month the Australian Treasury’s secretary Steven Kennedy said in a speech it was possible for the government to spend more on things “that improve lives” such as higher-quality aged care and disability services “while reducing pressures arising from poorly designed policies”:

We will need a tax system fit for purpose to pay for these services that appropriately balances fairness and efficiency. This is achievable.“

The iconic green jersey has returned for Mexico's national teams.

After years of experimenting with various shades and colors El Tri have gone back to their traditional roots with the release of an eye-catching green top for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Inspired by the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl the ""Feathered Serpent"" Mexico's kit shines with a design that evokes the god's plumage and the feathered headdress known as the ""copilli.""

""For this season's home jersey which will be worn on football's biggest stage we wanted to capture the spirit of the nation with a design that is deeply rooted in the culture of Mexico"" said James Webb Senior Product Designer at adidas in a statement. ""The head and feathered headdress of Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl is displayed with pride on the shirt which features a completely new crest.""

Mexico's revamped crest which has now gone through a seventh change since it was introduced in 1930 was first revealed last December in the country's iconic home of Estadio Azteca. Similar to the latest kit the alterations in the crest were influenced by characteristics of pre-Hispanic culture.

El Tri have gone back to their traditional roots with the release of an eye-catching green top for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Adidas

El Tri's throwback for the 2022 home jersey has also brought back the classic combination of white shorts and red socks. Green socks have also been revealed providing Mexico with the possibilities of either the signature green-white-red mix or even a green-white-green for the home kit.

As for when the jerseys will be worn? Fans won't have to wait too long.

According to the Mexican Football Federation the women's national team will debut the green kit in an upcoming CONCACAF W Championship match against the United States on Monday July 11. In order for El Tri Femenil to keep their 2023 Women's World Cup hopes alive through a possible playoff spot they'll need to somehow find a way to defeat the defending World Cup champions who've haven't lost a game since last August.

Perhaps some divine help from Quetzalcoatl is exactly what they need and if they succeed it could possibly be a sign of even better things to come for the men's side in November...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9iMmItcGF5bWVudHMvMjAyMi9pbmRpYXMtd2F5Y29vbC1mb29kcy1yYWlzZXMtNi01bS10by1ib29zdC10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's WayCool Foods Raises $6.5M to Boost Technology,"Business-to-business (B2B) agri-commerce company WayCool Foods raised the equivalent of $6.5 million in debt funding to make technology-related expansions according to multiple news reports.

He was attended to by local EMS personnel then transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Nichols-Payne was 56.

Nicholas-Payne who had been employed by Audacy (formerly CBS) for 31 years had been the primary technical director for Rangers radio broadcasts from 1995-2010 and again since 2015.

“Ted’s dedication and attention to detail made him an expert engineer who provided an outstanding technical quality to our broadcasts” Rangers executive vice president of public affairs John Blake said in a statement released by the club. “All of us with the Rangers’ organization send our deepest sympathies to Ted’s family. He will certainly be missed.”

Semien hit a tiebreaking RBI triple in the eighth inning of a 9-7 win over the AL Central-leading Minnesota Twins on Saturday after earlier being part of back-to-back homers with Seager for the first time since the Rangers committed a half-billion dollars to the middle infielders last December.

“It seems like every time I’m putting my helmet away he hits a home run. That means that we had not gone back-to-back” Semien said. “Of course I was happy. I just hit one myself.”

A three-run shot by Semien in the fourth tied the game at 6 and Seager followed with a go-ahead shot that chased Twins starter Devin Smeltzer. That was two innings after a three-run homer by Kole Calhoun another offseason addition for the Rangers.

“It was just kind of an all-around game offensively for us” said Seager adding props to Calhoun in the locker to his right.

It was the sixth time this year Texas had back-to-back homers but the first with Semien and Seager. It came in the 82nd game one past the midpoint of their first season together.

“It’s not surprising because I know they’ve been having good at-bats” manager Chris Woodward said. “When those two guys are at the top swinging like that man it makes it really tough on that opposing team.”

Seager the shortstop who signed a $325 million 10-year deal with Texas homered for the third time in four games and has 18 this season. Second baseman Semien who got a $175 million seven-year contract went deep for the fourth time in 10 games and has 11 homers overall.

Rookie first baseman José Miranda and Gary Sánchez homered for the Twins whose three-game losing streak matches their longest this year.

“We’re playing some games over the last couple of weeks that resemble this one. You know sometimes we’re winning the game and sometimes we’re not like today” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “We’ve had a tough time stopping them from scoring. They’ve had good at-bats since we’ve come into town. And they had a couple of hitters that are swinging the bat real good right now.”

The Twins have blown multi-run leads in both games at Texas. They led five different times in their extra-inning loss at the White Sox on Wednesday.

Minnesota got even at 7 on Gilberto Celestino’s RBI groundout in the eighth. After Leody Taveras opened the bottom of the inning with a single off Jhoan Duran (0-3) and advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Josh Smith Semien hit a sharp liner that dropped and skipped past left fielder Nick Gordon to the wall.

“At first I thought it was just going to be a single and then I saw Gordon dive for it and I just kept running” said Semien who scored on a single by former Twins catcher Mitch Garver.

Matt Moore (4-2) retired the only batter he faced. Brett Martin worked a perfect ninth for his second career save after getting his first in the series opener that was his 163rd career appearance.

Texas starter Martín Pérez a potential first-time All-Star on Sunday overcame taking a comebacker off his lower left leg and later a six-run outburst by the Twins to remain unbeaten in his last 15 starts. The left-hander back in Texas this season after three seasons away struck out five walked one and exited after six innings with a 7-6 lead.

“Location was a little off and that inning when he gave up six” Woodward said. “The warrior kind of came out (after that). ... That’s just the mark of a champion.”

MATCHING HOMERS

The back-to-back homers by Semien and Seager came after the Twins went ahead 6-3 in the top of the fourth. Miranda had a three-run homer Sánchez hit a two-run shot and Byron Buxton had an RBI double on a ball that ricocheted off the top of the wall in right field.

He was 56.

Nichols-Payne worked in Dallas for 31 years at the company now called Audacy and formerly CBS Radio.

Air Force,"Next in a series from Road to CFB of first-hand game day experiences at stadiums across the country:

Army vs Air Force: An Overtime Thriller!

4 Gallery 4 Images

Army 21 Air Force 14/OT

Football games involving the three service academies– especially games between the service academies– are a different breed of football. They're famously stuck to running a wishbone triple option offense.

Off the field game days involving the service academies are also a different breed. The first-ever Commander's Classic came to the DFW Metroplex and Globe Life Field courtesy of Lockheed Martin which is based in Fort Worth. Though this isn't quite Army vs. Navy the mixture of soldiers and airmen was a sight.

While this game day offered an incredible experience it came with a price tag. Early-sale tickets just to get in where $73 after fees; closer seats pushed $200. Parking is a financial nightmare too with three options: $50 lot at the stadium $40 lot within two blocks or $30 lots within a mile.

The field was wedged onto a baseball field normally inhabited by the Texas Rangers which left the Air Force-painted end zone just feet away from the outfield wall. Luckily for this game every single point was scored going the other way.

Before the game started six Medal of Honor recipients were honored before the 20000+ ranging from Afghanistan veterans to Vietnam vets. With so many veterans and service member's families in the crowd it was an emotional welcome. Globe Life even cracked their retractable roof open (despite temperatures in the upper-40s) to offer a view of F-35s and Chinooks doing a flyover.

The Commander-in-Chief's Trophy awarded to the top service academy football team each year. Air Force leads the way with 20 wins since 1972 followed by Navy with 16 and Army with 9. However Army's won four of the last five iterations.

The Game

A notable tradition is the Cadet Exchange where cadets are ceremoniously ""returned"" to their service academies before the game. Instead of being a solemn representation the cadets are returned with some pretty hilarious messages spelled on their backs. The Air Force Academy won the jabs by spelling LAME AF across the six Army cadets' backs.

That's all Air Force won the day though. Army won the ballgame 21-14 in overtime on a bizarre sequence. Quarterback Christian Anderson fumbled the ball into the end zone and the ball was recovered by his own lineman. After a gutty fourth-down stop Army sang second (a tradition by the winning service academy).

Air Force out-gained Army 195-28 in the fourth quarter sending the game into OT.

36 combined passes were attempted by the teams uncharacteristic of the service academies. It led to 35 second-half points.

Following the first score from the Air Force Falcons fans launch cheese singles onto the field. Don't ask me why but schools in the western plains tend to take after one another (Texas Tech is famous for throwing tortillas on the field after kickoff).

The Commander's Classic provided a wonderful game day experience. It's different– from the venue to the offensive schemes to the fans. There's lots of pride surrounding these programs and it bleeds into Saturdays.

Game Day Grades

Stadium: N/A. Professional stadium I’m not grading it here.

Tradition: B. It's not Army-Navy but it's a special matchup anyway. The Commander-In-Chief's trophy is at stake in all of these games which is one of the best trophies in sports period. There's plenty of other traditions from the cheese slices to singing the alma maters that are worth paying attention to.

Atmosphere: B-. The makeup of the crowd and the military feel is really neat. I mean they had an Air Force jet on the sidelines. However a triple-option offense brings a sleepier crowd. When the game was in the balance it was exciting. But the best part about the atmosphere is the pageantry.

Tailgating: C-. I was actually surprised to see any tailgating at all. But we're talking about a crowd largely made up of cadets and families that have responsibilities. Those that did tailgate were up bright and early; it just wasn't much (note: the game also kicked off at 10:30 local).

Fans: A+. I've never run into a more well-behaved crowd. There were no altercations only respect amongst one another. And of course the fans are passionate– many served in the respective branches. Many more's children are serving.

Extracurriculars: A+. Arlington is one of the best cities in the US. It's situated right in between Dallas and Fort Worth and has a plethora of things to do in itself. Check out Texas Live! a conglomeration of several bars and eateries with live music on the campus of Globe Life Field.

Mansour age 25 holds a B.Sc and M.Sc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

He is the co-founder and CEO of the New York-based platform Kalshi a platform that allows investors to place bets on future events such as how many Americans will receive the Covid-19 vaccine.

Mansour used to work at Goldman Sachs a leading global investment banking and investment management firm.

While in that job according to Forbes magazine his clients wanted to hedge their investments during Brexit but he did not have a direct way to do so.

That led him in 2018 to start the platform Kalshi (meaning “everything” in Arabic) with MIT alumna Luana Lopes Lara.

The most challenging part was getting regulatory approval but as luck would have it the start-up became the first to be regulated as a financial platform by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in November 2020.

Numerous billionaires jumped in to invest in Kalshi which raised $36 million since its launching in July 2021.

In 2022 Tarek Mansour was featured on the 10th edition of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.

Among the 5 other Lebanese featured on the prestigious list Mansour was the youngest of the selection and one of the standouts.

On June 28 in its first public meeting since our investigation the Hartford Joint 1 School Board set up shop in the Central Middle School auditorium to accommodate a larger-than-usual crowd still buzzing over revelations that the district's longtime superintendent signed a contract steering federal COVID-19 relief funds to his wife.

Such media attention is unusual for the small suburban district which consists of two elementary schools and one middle school. And that attention has prompted frustrations among district leaders.

""You want my position?!"" bellowed Board President Greg Erickson pointing toward an audience member. ""You want to come up here and do this?!""

Erickson had been largely silent since the FOX6 Investigators first started asking questions and seeking public records in April.

""I'm going to explain myself because I've had this bottled up for two months!"" he said to a fellow board member who asked him to withhold comment.

""It’s not on the agenda right now"" said Louise Schrunk the board's newest member elected April 5.

""Louise let him talk!"" came a loud voice from the crowd.

Board President Greg Erickson points his finger at fellow board member Erin Wilk during a tense public meeting June 28.

The tense exchange was one of several that occurred over the next three hours in an auditorium filled with parents and staff members many of whom came for one reason.

""What has come to light recently with the FOX6 investigation"" said Becky Kumar a district parent.

""Most of us in this room probably wouldn’t know about this if it hadn’t been on FOX6"" added Jodi Groonwald also a Hartford Joint 1 parent.

Since the coronavirus pandemic began the federal government has allotted Wisconsin schools more than $2 billion in aid most of which has yet to be claimed or spent. The funds were made available as part of the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program also known as ESSER.

The latest round -- known among educators as ESSER III -- directs more than $1.3 milllion to Hartford Joint 1 (not to be confused with Hartford Union High School which exists as a separate distinct school district). Last fall the school board voted unanimously to spend $130000 of ESSER III funds for a two-year period on a ""District Community Coordinator.""

Cindy Smits was retired from Hartford Joint 1 before the board voted in December to use pandemic relief funds to bring her back as a consultant making phone calls to parents. Her husband Superintendent Mark Smits signed the contract.

It's a newly-created work-from-home position aimed at engaging with parents whose children are falling behind because of the pandemic.

""We have to stop that!"" said Superintendent Mark Smits referring to a sharp drop in student test scores since the pandemic began.

In December Dr. Smits signed a contract that gave the job to a retired district teacher named Cindy Smits --his wife.

""I didn’t do anything wrong"" he said.

""Do you think this is a conflict of interest?"" asked FOX6 Investigator Bryan Polcyn.

""No I don’t think this is a conflict of interest"" Smits replied.

It doesn't appear anyone in the district raised concerns about the hire. Then again it doesn't appear many people knew. Cindy Smits' name did not appear in public meeting agendas minutes or detailed packets of information given to board members before meetings. In fact a four-page ""consulting proposal"" provided to board members just days before the December 14 vote merely described ""the desired candidate"" as a ""veteran educator"" even though emails obtained by FOX6 show the district knew weeks earlier it would be Cindy Smits and had already made plans to send her resume to CESA 6 the third-party staffing agency handling the paperwork.

Erickson acknowledges that he knew exactly who the board was voting to hire because the superintendent told him in advance in a private discussion outside public view.

Parents and staff member fill the seats in Central Middle School's auditorium for the first public meeting since our investigation.

""Dr. Smits brought it to my attention that they were thinking about hiring his wife"" Erickson explained during the June 28 board meeting.

It's not clear if other board members met with the superintendent privately before the vote but board member Erin Wilk said no one told her she was casting a vote for Cindy Smits.

""I don’t know why one board member would know more than another but I did not"" she told the audience.

‘What were they trying to hide?"" said Jessica Gronbeck a mother of four children three of whom are still attending schools in the Hartford Joint 1 district. Gronbeck’s 10-year-old son Wesley has reading challenges that require special attention. But Cindy Smits' job entailed no direct contact with students.

""Then what is she doing?"" Gronbeck asked.

From January through June 2022 the district - through its contract with CESA 6 – paid Cindy Smits more than $42000 in salary and benefits to make phone calls to parents about Exact Path an online diagnostic and learning tool produced by Texas-based Edmentum.

Dr. Smits tells FOX6 ""I don't know how how to respond"" to calls for his resignation over the handling of his wife's contract.

In April a draft of next year's district calendar showed teachers would be expected to work evenings - for no additional pay - making similar phone calls to parents that earned Mrs. Smits a full-time salary.

Several responded to that with angry letters to board members.

A half dozen current and former staff members talked to the FOX6 Investigators on the condition we would not identify them.

""Why don't the teachers let us know?"" Erickson asked during the meeting.

""Because they're afraid of losing their jobs"" answered a voice from the crowd as board member Wilk nodded in agreement.

After our story first aired on June 8 one teacher came forward. Tiffany Stapleton an English-Language Arts teacher stood up before board members and made a request.

""I'm asking the board to reconsider the use of the ESSER funds"" she said.

In addition to Stapleton nearly a dozen parents lined up to make public statements many wearing bright orange T-shirts that read Be Kind RESIGN and No Confidence.

""We need transparency from the administration"" said Lauren Dohman.

""I question how and why the school board and administration let this happen"" added Chad Russ.

""Was this position actually benefiting us?"" asked Beth Garcia. ""Or was it convenient to benefit the superintendent personally?""

Not everyone was critical of school leaders.

""I hear all the grumbling"" said Joshua Waszak in a mocking tone. ""[Dr. Smits] has been on here 19 years. And all of a sudden now he’s a problem? Now there’s corruption?""

Some who were critical shared more than words. They made a call for action.

""Maybe the superintendent and the president of the school board should resign"" said Groonwald.

""You want me to resign fine!"" Erickson said in an impassioned retort. ""You want my position? You want to come up here and do this?! Do any of you guys?! Fine. I've had it up to here!""

Erickson did not actually resign. And Dr. Smits brushed the calls aside.

One teacher and nearly a dozen parents spoke during public comment. Nine were critical of school board leadership and school administration. Two defended Dr. Smits. One criticized those in attendance for only coming to meetings when there is ""somethi Expand

""I don’t know how to respond to that"" he said when asked about the coordinated T-shirts many wore to the meeting.

""I finally felt heard"" Gronbeck said.

If their goal was to get parents more engaged it seems they are now.

The Hartford Joint 1 School District's contract for the services of Cindy Smits expired at the end of June. According to the district's ESSER III plan filed with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and emails between the district and CESA 6 the original plan was to bring Cindy Smits back again this fall at a salary of $70400 plus benefits.

Since our story aired however the board and administration have decided to survey staff members and parents on the district's priorities before settling on how to spend ESSER III funds next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53a293LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FsbC1sYW5lcy1vZi13aXMtaHd5LTYwLWNsb3NlZC1uZWFyLWhhcnRmb3JkLWR1ZS10by1jcmFzaC9hcnRpY2xlXzQyYjFiMjJjLTAwOTgtMTFlZC04YTc0LTAzMmEwYjViZGRhNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE: All lanes of WIS HWY 60 near Hartford reopened after crash,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

By Ronni Newton

Blythe Kaufman lives in a classic West Hartford colonial on a typical quarter-acre lot on Four Mile Road. That’s where – in “Our Lady’s Victory Garden” – she grows a majority of the vegetables her family of five eats during the spring summer and fall and some of the fruits too.

“We really try to get as much as we can out of our yard” said Kaufman and she wants to encourage others to plant their own Victory Gardens.

On a tour of her yard early in the growing season Kaufman points out the Honeycrisp apple tree the plants that will yield blueberries elderberries and currants. “We have almost every type of berry bush” she said.

Kaufman and her husband Seth have lived on Four Mile Road for 17 years and one of the things that drew her to the house was the existing greenhouse. She grew up outside Boston and while that wasn’t exactly a rural upbringing her mother was an avid gardener and some of her earliest and best memories are of gardening with her mom – who loved watching “Crockett’s Victory Garden” on WGBY.

Kaufman trained as an endodontist but developed a rare disorder when pregnant with her youngest son which impacted her joints. Her hands remain weak and she doesn’t drive. When her kids (now between the ages of 15 and 21) were young she taught them to be her hands in the garden.

A lifelong gardener Kaufman is always reading about gardening and also attended a course through UConn Storrs. It’s become a family endeavor and now she’s sharing her expertise with the community. Recently she created a website ourladysvictorygarden.com  which she launched along with an associated YouTube channel on March 25.

Sharing her gardening is a way to bring the community along on her family’s Victory Garden journey Kaufman said.

“With food prices on the rise it seems a perfect time for people to put in the classic Victory Garden which first seemed to get its name during WWII but then saw a revival in the late 70s when inflation was surging” she said.

“It seems such an endeavor may be needed with commercial farmers straining to meet their needs with shortages of fertilizers. Many professional farmers have reported they will simply spread less fertilizer this year and hence will have less harvest. Home gardeners have the benefit of using kitchen organic scraps to amend the soil and less fertilizers are needed so we who live on small quarter-acre plots can make a big difference by growing even a portion of what we might normally buy at the store.”

As non-edible plantings in her yard die off Kaufman replaces them with plants that yield food. Elderberry bushes grow along the front walk and bunch onions in the planters near the front door will be replaced with sweet potatoes. She has pear trees along with apple trees.

In the spring Kaufman harvested potatoes that she started growing in December in the greenhouse. Before the weather was ready for outdoor planting tomatoes oregano and bay leaf were among the plants already thriving in the greenhouse while an enclosure in her backyard had peas onions beets and leeks growing protected from squirrels that like to dig early in the season as well as bunnies that will eat the plants.

The enclosure has wire mesh on the sides that goes 18 inches down into the ground to keep out pests that like to dig and a net on top. There is gardening fabric on the ground to keep out weeds and waist-high raised beds and a drip irrigation system that keep her from having to bend over.

The stone bed on the side of her house is also at waist height and easier to tend plus it has great drainage Kaufman said. “Most things will do very well I in there without a lot of work.”

Everything is planted from seed which she said tends to create heartier plants and some of her plants are also “volunteers” taking root and growing where seeds dropped naturally the previous year have fallen.

She practices succession planting rotating her crops throughout the growing season and from year-to-year.

It may appear daunting to plant that first garden and many beginners make mistakes. She’s made them too and shares successes and failures on the website and in videos. To Kaufman the efforts to grow her own food are worthwhile.

“I just feel better about having something growing right outside my door.”

Using organic matter is important said Kaufman who uses very little commercial fertilizer other than for root crops. She uses kitchen scraps hay and other organic material and strategically combines plantings. Garlic plants keep away the chipmunks she said and radishes keep the pests away from the cucumbers.

Once the garlic – which was planted in the fall and is growing robustly – is done for the season she’ll plant tomatoes for a late harvest where they will yield fruit through late September into early October.

Items planted in the spring included Swiss Chard spinach lettuce beets leeks shallots Spanish yellow onions red onions parsley celery kale radishes snow peas sugar snap peas scallions and potatoes (for fall harvest).

In mid May the more tender crops that were started from seed and were growing in the greenhouse – where the atmosphere is several USDA growing zones ahead of the outdoors – were ready to be moved outside. Those include tomatoes peppers eggplant and basil. Cucumber green beans summer and winter squash sunflowers and sweet potatoes were all planted as seeds directly in the garden in May.

Kaufman said no one in her immediate family is vegan but they do like vegetables and during the growing season the garden produces at least 80% of the fresh produce they eat. “Last year we froze tomato sauce and soups made with Swiss chard” she said. “We had a packed freezer.”

The apple and pear trees yield fruit too.

“The Honeycrisps are great. We made pies applesauce apple crisp into late October” she said.

The berries are eaten raw as well as blended into smoothies.

This year she’s planning to do more pickling and canning. She’s also growing sprouts on her kitchen counter and recently started growing microgreens after attending a workshop.

“There’s just something about the simplicity of life of seeing where your food comes from that’s peaceful and calming.” In the winter she enjoys planning her garden and it’s a good reminder that better weather is ahead.

During the pandemic Kaufman said her family tried a lot of new recipes – soups and rhubarb pie among them. “It’s a bright light to have those memories from the pandemic” she said.

Gardening is something that transcends the generations Kaufman said. She shares gardening tips with a young family next door … and she is eager to share her knowledge with others.

“It’s really nice for building neighborhood and community spirit” said Kaufman.

There are so many issues that divide people but gardening can bring people together. “It’s hard to find someone that can’t rally around it.”

A new version of Monopoly comes with a new season of Netflix’s Strange Things. The hit series’ fourth season has been touted as a return to form for the Duffer brothers and cast but does that translate into an exciting version of the classic real estate board game?

Entertainment Earth is currently taking pre-orders for Stranger Things 4 Monopoly. The set like any other bearing the name contains small metal player pieces paper money plastic cassettes (instead of houses) and card stock property tokens. The twist with this game is that player must spin a dial which indicates where a portal opens up on the board. Players must then reach that spot to close it while playing by the standard rules of Monopoly. I can see that getting real aggravating really quick.

ST4: Monopoly will set you back $27.99 and the game will ship out sometime this month.





It’s 1986 and a dark force known as Vecna is opening Gates to the Upside Down in Hawkins and beyond! Inspired by Season 4 of the Netflix series Stranger Things the Monopoly: Stranger Things Edition board game is a must for fans. Spin the hand on Vecna’s ominous grandfather clock to find out where the Gates are then race to close them. Players earn money along the way by charging other players rent and the last player with money when all other players have gone bankrupt wins. But watch out! The game also ends if Vecna opens enough Gates so that every location is in the Upside Down.

The Duffer Brothers’ Strange Things series is no stranger to the board game market or Monopoly. How often can you refresh a game about mortgages rent and land ownership before even a Netflix show’s overlay gets boring? I always thought Monopoly was the game you pulled out when you really wanted your house guests to leave.

What do you think of this latest version of the Stranger Things-themed game from Hasbro? How many different versions of Monopoly do you own? Me? I’ve got the Ghostbusters ’84 version and a Star Wars one from the late ’90s. Let us know in the comments section below.

While Veesenmeyer is likely best known now for his work on LEGO he got his start in part as a storyboard artist on X-Men: The Animated Series.

As the series celebrates its 30th anniversary this year Veesenmeyer is bringing several new prints for it to the con including this fun X-Men: The Animated Series MEME print replicating the original photo from the famous Wolverine scene in which he looks on Jean Grey and Scott’s photo together with sadness. This 8.5″x11″ LE print will be available at #DD-19.

The X-Men: The Animated Series love continues with this Rogue print which measures 11″x14″. There are two versions — a regular glossy and an “ultra limited” holofoil variant. You can see the holofoil at the bottom of this post.

Veesenmeyer also shows off some of his storyboard artwork from the series in this fun Storyboard Art print depicting some iconic moments from the series and just fun shots. This piece is 11″x17″.

Veesenmeyer will also have several 8″.5″x11″ LEGO prints with pricing starting at $10 and more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL2dlZWstY3VsdHVyZS81MTY0NTItZmluYWwtc3RyZXRjaC1nb2Fscy1mb3ItaGFzbGFiLWctaS1qb2UtY29icmEtaGlzcy10YW5rLXJldmVhbGVk0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3VwZXJoZXJvaHlwZS5jb20vZ2Vlay1jdWx0dXJlLzUxNjQ1Mi1maW5hbC1zdHJldGNoLWdvYWxzLWZvci1oYXNsYWItZy1pLWpvZS1jb2JyYS1oaXNzLXRhbmstcmV2ZWFsZWQvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Final’ Stretch Goals for HasLab G.I. Joe Cobra HISS Tank Revealed,"With HasLab’s G.I. Joe Cobra HISS tank on track to hit its last goal of 16000 backers by the end of this weekend and more than 30 days left to go after that the likelihood of even more bonus add-ons feels strong. But of all the tiers they announced the final ones are revealed and almost claimed.

The 14000 backer tier recently unlocked added on a HISS gunner — basically a female version of the HISS driver. Along with her came two extra guns for the turret and another set to clip on under the cockpit. The 16000 tier likely to unlock shortly is the biggie with an all-new Cobra Commander based on his very first action figure. And yes that means specifically the initial straight-arm version and its more simplified Cobra logo before Hasbro really finalized the design. With its circular stylized eye bumps it’s been called the “Mickey Mouse” Cobra Commander by collectors. While the HISS Gunner Driver and Tactician will come in standard G.I. Joe Classified boxes Cobra Commander gets a retro-style cardback.

Any informed speculator will tell you that Hasbro will most likely reissue a version of this figure later with a “corrected” logo. He’s too significant a character to keep an all-new sculpt this exclusive. Backers simply score a variant version first.

Now that it (soon) includes four figures the HISS looks like an even better value. G.I. Joe Classified figures run $25 apiece after the latest price hike so that’s $100 right there making the HISS itself effectively $200. For an 18-inch long toy with LEDs that’s not outside the norm.

And if the Galactus campaign signified anything it’s that Hasbro sometimes throws in another extra when a HasLab goes this well. Let’s see if more happens. meanwhile check out the add-on images in the gallery below. Then tell us what you think in comments.

This week Seymour stepped into her new role as the CEO of the HCA Florida St. Petersburg Hospital a full-service 215-bed hospital as the former CEO of the St. Petersburg hospital was promoted to another position.

Although St. Pete is somewhat new territory for Seymour she has more than 20 years of health care experience and most recently served as the COO and interim CEO for HCA Florida Trinity Hospital.

Seymour joined Trinity Hospital in 2018 from HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital where she also served as COO. Over the last four years she has been instrumental in supporting the growth of the Trinity’s women’s services and surgical and emergency programs during a time when the hospital’s inpatient capacity expanded to 340 beds that supported a secondary campus with behavioral health services in New Port Richey and three freestanding emergency rooms one each in Pasco Pinellas and Hillsborough counties.

Seymour’s journey through HCA began in 2013 when she was selected to participate in the HCA Healthcare Executive Development Program and joined HCA Florida Largo Hospital as associate COO. Prior to HCA she worked for Pfizer pharmaceuticals in San Francisco and Tampa.

Seymour shared her experience and goals for the St. Pete campus with the Catalyst in her first interview as the CEO. The responses have been edited for clarity.

St. Pete Catalyst: You’ve had quite the career journey through HCA. What skills and experiences from the other campuses are you bringing with you to St. Pete?

Sally Seymour: The acceptance into the HCA Healthcare Executive Development Program meant I could move to a new hospital. I spent two and half years at the Largo campus and learned so much about how they operated from the ground up from all facets and roles – inpatient therapy housekeeping – I’ve spent time with all of these folks who are the subject matter expert in their field. To have a successful hospital you need to know how all those elements work together. You can have the best neurosurgeon but if your bed isn’t clean you can get an infection – every aspect matters.

What is your impression of St. Pete? I grew up in Upstate New York. My husband and I moved to Florida around 2005 and we didn’t know a lot about Tampa Bay as a whole. I love St. Pete. It’s fun to see the evolution of the town it’s been remarkable – you get a different feel whether you’re on the beach or go downtown with the art exhibits and restaurants and yet it still has this small-town feel and is so diverse for a smaller area.



What is on your to-do list? Right away it is to get to know the team. I’ve been setting up one-on-one meetings and reaching out to board members and physicians. They’ve done phenomenal jobs. My primary objective is to listen and I’ve heard this hospital truly caters to the community. I’ve seen what differentiates us is how we serve the LGBTQ+ (lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer) community. In our delivery and labor department we personalize the care to families especially those who may not be defined as a traditional family. Having inclusive and personalized care and health equity are important and it does lead to better health outcomes. This is something we really learned during the Covid pandemic when people needed to have their loved ones by their side.

On the topic of Covid what has it been like for you in leadership roles battling the ongoing pandemic and emerging infectious diseases?

One of the benefits of being in a much larger organization is the access to the HCA clinical database where 185 hospitals share their best practices in treating diseases like monkeypox and if you are the first hospital to receive a case of an infectious disease that’s spreading you can reach out to your sister facilities. For example when one of the first Covid cases appeared in Florida it was at the Doctors Hospital of Sarasota an HCA-owned campus. As soon as the patient arrived all of the hospital executives got on a conference call and shared what they had learned and how the patient was treated. As a new CEO here it gives me a lot of confidence to know I have this larger system backing me.

Are there any plans for the campus to expand or leverage new technologies?

There aren’t any physical projects currently but the team has shared their wish list to rehab some older areas of the building and update them on how care is delivered today. In technology we have three Da Vinci surgical robots (which are used in minimally invasive surgeries) that produce amazing outcomes. Patients have a reduced length of pain from surgery and it reduces any chance of errors. We are capitalizing on updating the registration process for patients to check in on kiosks.

What is a typical day like for you (keeping in mind it’s only been a few days)?

I wake up around 5:40 a.m. to walk my dog a rescued mutt and arrive at the hospital around 7-7:30 a.m. Sometimes that changes because I like to check in with the nightshift crew. During the day I make leadership touch points and have different scheduled meetings. We are a very metric-driven organization and we do team huddles at 9 a.m.

Outside of work what are your hobbies and what’s your family life like?

I have a daughter and a son who was the one who begged us to get a dog. My husband is from Ireland and we would make frequent trips there. I was a runner for years and ran a few marathons in San Francisco but I had foot surgery so I haven’t found something that replaces running.

For those who want to form a professional relationship with you do you have a go-to meeting place?

I love meeting new people. I’ve had so many mentors over the years and I’d love to be able to reverse that and serve as a mentor for someone else. I’m still exploring the city and would like to be introduced to new places.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL2xzdHJpYnVuZS5uZXQvaW5kZXgucGhwLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvbGVlcy1zdW1taXQtbWVkaWNhbC1jZW50ZXItYW5ub3VuY2VzLWxlZXMtc3VtbWl0LWZhbWlseS1tZWRpY2luZS1yZXNpZGVuY3ktcHJvZ3JhbS10aGF0LXdpbGwtdHJhaW4tbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW9mLXBoeXNpY2lhbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lee's Summit Medical Center Announces Lee's Summit Family Medicine Residency Program That Will Train Next ...,"July 9 2022

Lee’s Summit Medical Center is introducing a graduate medical education program at Lee’s Summit Family Medicine in affiliation with HCA Midwest Health Kansas City’s leading healthcare provider. Earlier this year HCA Midwest Health’s parent company HCA Healthcare announced that it offered 1867 positions across the country for its July 2022 graduate medical education programs. HCA Healthcare is the nation’s largest sponsor of graduate medical education programs.

The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) granted accreditation for the Lee’s Summit Family Medicine residency program at the end of April. The three-year program which accepted its first class of residents on July 1 2022 will give physicians academic training and hands-on experience as they start their careers. Six residents will be selected each year for a total of 18 by its third year.

The Association of American Medical Colleges has projected that the United States could see an estimated shortage of between 37800 and 124000 physicians by 2034 especially shortfalls in primary care.

“HCA Healthcare has a longstanding commitment to graduate medical education across the country sponsoring more than 300 residency and fellowship programs in 16 states” says HCA Vice President Graduate Medical Education Sabesan “Saby” Karuppiah MD MPH FAAFP. “Because Lee’s Summit Medical Center is part of HCA Midwest Health it has access to a strong infrastructure necessary to create the program. We are proud of Lee’s Summit Medical Center’s new GME-accredited program that will further address the shortage of primary care physicians while increasing access to high-quality compassionate patient care in Eastern Jackson County.”

“A residency is a critical component of a physician’s career path” says Lee’s Summit Family Medicine’s Residency Program Director Lawrence Gibbs MD MSEd FAAFP a Board-certified family medicine physician. “Lasting three years this program will allow our trained medical staff to help prepare physicians to provide comprehensive medical care to patients across their lifespan an essential element of family medicine training. Attracting and retaining talent is integral to expanding access to patient care and improving the overall health of our community.”

The 2021-22 Hershey Bears struggled to score goals down the stretch as the chocolate and white were shut out a whopping seven times after winger Joe Snively was recalled to the Washington Capitals on January 28. To improve in the 2022-23 American Hockey League (AHL) season Hershey has to find more scoring.

The forward corps will likely feature five rookies and could see a few players begin the season in the National Hockey League (NHL). Additionally captain Matt Moulson is retiring and some players will move on to other organizations.

Scorers should be the target of the Bears (and their parent club Washington) when free agency commences on July 13. Adding players that are proven scorers will take pressure off of the rookie forwards and allow them to grow into the professional game. Who fits the bill on the free agent market to bolster the Hershey offense? Here’s a breakdown by position.

CENTER

With 11 players who can play center including Mike Sgarbossa Mike Vecchione Aliaksei Protas and Garrett Pilon the chocolate and white would seem to be set down the middle. However there are circumstances that may call for adding to the depth at center.

With Nicklas Backstrom out for the start of the season in Washington there is an opportunity for someone like Protas to start in the NHL. Pilon is no longer waiver-exempt and the possibility exists that he could be claimed off waivers. If another pivot is signed the centers are all versatile enough to play on the wing.

The cream of the free agent center crop is Andrew Poturalski. The Williamsville New York native is a bona fide AHL star. He led the league in scoring this past season posting 101 points including 41 on the power play with the Chicago Wolves. It was the second straight season where Poturalski topped the AHL scoring list.

The University of New Hampshire product finished second in the league with 73 assists and was named a First Team AHL All-Star. In the postseason Poturalski captured his second Calder Cup championship having previously won the cup with Charlotte in 2019.

Poturalski has recorded 43 or more points in every AHL season he has played with the exception of the 2019-20 season in which he was injured. He is a dynamic offensive player that would transform the offense. An opportunity to sign a player of Poturalski’s caliber has to be explored.

Another potent center that is available is Sam Anas. With the Springfield Thunderbirds last season Anas netted 20 goals and dished out 44 assists. He added 15 points in the postseason as the Thunderbirds made it to the Calder Cup Finals.

The native of Potomac Maryland compiled 70 points in the 2018-19 season with Iowa and also has a 61-point AHL season on his resume. Anas would provide an offensive boost to the Bears.

Utica’s Chase de Leo is another pivot option. The Californian potted 21 goals and had 35 assists this last campaign. The 55-point season marked the second time de Leo scored more than 56 points in a season.

Other centers on the free agent market include Glenn Gawdin (50 points with Stockton) Joel L’Esperance (49 points with Texas) Nicolas Petan (44 points with Abbottsford) Luke Philip (44 points with Stockton) Andrew Agozzino (43 points with Belleville) and Chambersburg  Pennsylvania native Steven Fogarty (42 points with Providence can also play wing).

LEFT WING

This is the thinnest forward position depth wise for Hershey. Beck Malenstyn and Mason Morelli are the only two natural left wings under contract. Morelli can play any of the three forward positions. After those two Aliaksei Protas and Hendrix Lapierre can line up on the left side. Clearly a need exists on the left wing.

One of the top left wings available is Dylan Sikura. The Northeastern University alum had a breakout campaign with the Colorado Eagles. He tied for fifth in the AHL in goals with 33 and tied for sixth in scoring with 73 points.

A versatile player Sikura can play all three forward positions and is productive on the power play. Last season he netted 11 power play goals and had 21 helpers with the man-advantage. The Bears power play struggled last season and Sikura would help improve the unit.

Another productive left winger on the market is Charles Hudon. The native of Alma Quebec found the back of the net a career-high 30 times for the Syracuse Crunch last season and compiled 57 points. It marked the third time Hudon has posted a 50-plus point season in his AHL career.

He is a speedy winger who produces on the power play having netted 23 goals on the man-advantage last season. Hudon also has 125 games of NHL experience and would serve as a viable callup option for the Capitals.

Free agent C.J. Smith matched a career high in points with 58 while winning a Calder Cup championship with the Chicago Wolves. The Iowan set a new career high with 34 assists. He also posted 26 points on the power play.

Former Binghamton Devil Brett Seney is coming off the best season of his professional career and is an option on the left wing. He amassed a career high 59 points for the Toronto Marlies. He topped the team’s scoring list and was second on the Marlies in assists with 42.

Additionally there are two other free agent left wingers who recorded 50 or more points this past season. Kyle Rau netted 25 goals and assisted on 28 others to finish with 53 points for the Iowa Wild. The total equaled his career high and it was the University of Minnesota product’s third 50-point season in his AHL career. Utica’s AJ Greer set career highs in points (52) goals (22) and assists (30).

Also available as free agents are Justin Kirkland (48 points with Abbottsford) Cameron Hughes (45 points with Providence) Jayden Halbgewachs (41 points with San Jose) and Phil Di Giuseppe (36 points in 42 games with Abbottsford.

RIGHT WING

Unlike the left side Hershey has plenty of options on the right wing. There are seven or eight players under contract who can play the right side. With an opening in Washington on the right wing due to Tom Wilson’s injury there is a possibility a player like Brett Leason or Garrett Pilon begins the season in D.C.

The loss of Leason or Pilon to the Capitals would hurt the depth on the right side and would take a potential scorer away from the chocolate and white. None of the other options are goal scorers. Ethan Frank has the potential to be a solid goal scorer but has yet to prove he can score at the professional level.

Even if Leason and Pilon are on the roster the right wing free agent crop is so strong that adding one of the available options would be highly beneficial to the Bears’ offense. Four right wings who finished in the top eight in the AHL in scoring are all free agents. The Calder Cup playoff most valuable player is also available as is a former Bear who had a strong season.

Leading the way among the free agent right wingers is Stefan Noesen. The Plano Texas native tallied an AHL-best 48 goals last season with the Chicago Wolves. He also led the league with 13 game-winning goals. He finished third in the AHL in scoring with 85 points 23 of which came on the power play.

Noesen was also second in the league with a plus-35 rating. In the postseason the Texan posted 25 points and helped lead the Wolves to a Calder Cup championship. Noesen has played in 207 NHL games and would be a callup possibility for Washington.

Finishing two spots behind Noesen on the AHL scoring list was Kiefer Sherwood of the Colorado Eagles. The Miami University product compiled 75 points in 57 games. His 36 goals were the third most in the league. Sherwood produced 13 goals and 13 assists on the power play and totaled 10 points in eight playoff games. The Columbus Ohio native saw action in 11 NHL games with the Colorado Avalanche last season and has 87 career NHL games on his resume making him a callup option in D.C.

Martin Frk was sixth in the league in scoring with 73 points in 58 games with the Ontario Reign. The Czech winger was second in the AHL in goals with 40 including seven game winners. Frk possesses a cannon of shot once registering the hardest shot ever with a 109.2 mile per hour blast at the 2020 AHL All-Star game. He is another player with NHL experience having netted 20 goals in 124 games in the show.

The final top 10 scorer that is on the free agent market is Sheldon Rempel. His 33 goals were tied with Sikura for the fifth most in the AHL and were a career high for the native of Calgary Alberta. Rempel ended the campaign with a career high 69 points good for eighth in the league in scoring. He also registered a career high in assists with 36.

Also available as a free agent is Josh Leivo. He earned the Jack A. Butterfield Award Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the Calder Cup playoffs. The Innisfil Ontario native scored a playoff best 15 goals for the Chicago Wolves. Leivo compiled a playoff best 29 points as the Wolves captured the Calder Cup. During the regular season he had 22 goals and 24 assists in 54 games. Leivo has played in 214 NHL games and has seen action in the NHL in every season since 2013-14.

Finally former Bear Riley Barber is a potential signing. He is coming off his best season since his rookie campaign in the 2015-16 season. He tallied 28 goals the second most of his AHL career and amassed 53 points. The Pittsburgh Pennsylvania native played 237 games in four seasons with the chocolate and white netting 90 goals and adding 90 assists during that span.

Additional right wingers on the free agent market include Cooper Marody (55 points with Bakersfield) and Jesper Froden (34 points in 49 games with Providence).

Offense Needed

Coming off a season of offensive struggles there is ample opportunity for the Hershey Bears to improve their offense when free agency opens. With the amount of talent available the chocolate and white should be able to land a few of the players above to bolster their roster.

Center Andrei Nikolishin played 11 seasons in the NHL from 1994 to 2004. He began his North American hockey career with the Hartford Whalers before moving to the Washington Capitals where he played from 1996 to 2002. Nikolishin ended his playing career with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2004 and became a scout for them in 2016 where he remains today.

Being a center during his playing career and a current scout who knows Russian hockey players very well Nikolishin has a good knowledge base of Capitals 2022 first round pick Ivan Miroshnichenko. He provided his thoughts on “Miro” in a recent interview with Russian media outlet MatchTV.

Miroshnichenko 18 is under contract in the KHL with Avangard until 2024 but that should have little-to-no impact on his overall development plans as far as the Capitals are concerned. The situation closely resembles that of Evgeny Kuznetsov who had to wrap-up his KHL career before heading to the District.

“How long he will play in the KHL no one cares” said Nikolishin. “No one was going to bring Ivan to Washington right now. The illness took him back a little. To put it simply the guy was battling cancer. But now Miroshnichenko has completely recovered passed all the tests. Really in full combat readiness.”

However exactly when Miro returns to play for Avangard is still not known and Nikolishin believes there is still development needed at the VHL and the KHL levels.

“It’s hard to say while he only spent one year in the VHL. And then I think that he was too early there. Miroshnichenko should have continued to play in the MHL where he would have received more playing time and his role in the team would have been different. It would develop better.”

Finally Nikolishin provided his player scouting report for Miroshnichenko.

“Miroshnichenko is big and powerful beyond his years. This is a power forward with a crazy shot who is very good at navigating around the net – he finds the puck and shoots from any position. Plus hardworking efficient. There are of course flaws in skating and balance. But these are particulars there are many more advantages. He had already adapted to the VHL after the New Year before his illness he began to play in the leading teams.”

Miroshnichenko and the other Capitals draft selections are now in northern Virginia for next week’s Capitals development camp which runs from Monday through Thursday at MedStar Capitals Iceplex. Players will then participate in a scrimmage at Capitals One Arena on Friday night. Both venues are free and open to the public.

The initiative will be funded by the Government and Hess Corporation with the Stabroek Block partner investing close to US$32 million.

Executive Vice President and Chief Clinical Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System Dr Jeremy Boal yesterday inked an agreement during a simple ceremony held at State House where President Irfaan Ali also announced that Mount Sinai has offered to provide a 30 per cent discount to any Guyanese who may require any specialised treatment abroad once they go through the Ministry of Health for access to the facility.

Also present for the signing were Chief Executive Officer of Hess Corporation John Hess; Minister of Health Dr Frank Anthony and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health Malcolm Watkins.

Delivering the feature address at the event Ali said the goal of the initiative is to position Guyana as a destination of choice for health care services globally.

To achieve this he said there will be an “overhaul” in both the public and private sector. “There will be an entire system overhaul….You can have the best service but if you don’t have the system or platform to provide that service you would be wasting time” Ali said.

To kickstart the initiative Boal said that Mount Sanai has assembled a team of over 40 leaders who are specialised in oncology cardiovascular medicine endocrinology primary and preventative care global health and health system operations and they will arrive in Guyana within the next few days to engage their counterparts at the George-town Public Hospital.

“…While we acknowledge achieving the full health care transformation will take some time we are hitting the ground running starting next week. Three days from now Mount Sinai’s Clinical Quality and administrative leaders will arrive to engage with their counterparts at the Georgetown Public Hospital to improve and enhance care and outcomes there” Boal said.

Soon after that other clinical experts will return to Guyana to continue the planning for the announced oncology and cardiovascular centres of excellence as well as end-to-end diabetes screening and care Boal added.

Further he noted that leaders from their institution will also work with their local partners to help integrate all aspects of the health system throughout Guyana from primary and preventative care to emergency and tertiary care.

Three components

Dr Anthony revealed that the new national health care initiative has three components.

The first component he said will focus on strengthening primary health care across the country and developing a health informatics system.

“….We will be looking at how we can prevent things like diabetes hypertension cardiovascular diseases cancers and so forth. Also something that we have always spoken about but had much difficulty in achieving has been developing a health informatics system…During this period we will be working on developing not just the electronic medical records system but also using the data to do proper planning as we move the health system forward” he explained.

“We envisage the day when someone would have a smart card when they come to anyone of our facility that they would be able to present that card and when they put it into the computer system at any one of the facilities you would be able to pull up that patient’s record regardless of which ever part of the system you come to” Anthony said.

The second component will focus on change management at the George-town Public Hospital. “…We will be having a team from Morningside Hospital that would be partnering directly with counterparts at the Georgetown Public Hospital in all the aspects of its operations. And so we will look at developing clinical excellence developing patient care relationships improving turnaround times for testing and waiting time people would be waiting to see a doctor and so forth” Anthony further explained.

And the final component of the initiative will see the government and private sector collaborating to establish the two centres of excellence. “…We are looking at a joint partnership between government and the private sector to develop a cardiovascular centre of excellence for Guyana and for the wider Caribbean. Also we are looking at developing an oncology centre of excellence again for Guyana and the wider Caribbean” he noted.

Meanwhile Hess said his company was proud to be part of the strategic partnership with the government and the Mount Sinai Health System to bring a brighter and healthier future “for every Guyanese citizens now and for generations to come.”

‘World class’ system

According to Anthony the signing of the agreement marks a pivotal moment for health care transformation in the country. “The Mount Sinai team has the expertise to help us build the new world class system that we are thinking about” he said.

The creation of a world class health care system in Guyana was said to be a vision of Ali.

In his address Ali said with the new initiative the country’s health sector will be subject to a “monumental” transformation.

He stated that the transformation will focus on technological upgrades from the primary to tertiary healthcare levels.

Additionally to advance the process forward Ali said a Coordinating Steering Committee which will include Mount Sinai Hess Corporation and the Government of Guyana would be established as well as a National Steering Committee which will include the Private Sector and the Government of Guyana.

He also stated that before the process is concluded a patient management information system will be deployed. “…By the end of this process we must be able to go to every single secondary school and register every child and do a baseline health assessment of every child the future of Guyana…Put them on electronic management information system where we can track them for the rest of their lives and provide the best health care for them” Ali explained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2RlbWVyYXJhd2F2ZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvdXMtYmFzZWQtbW91bnQtc2luYWktaGVhbHRoLXN5c3RlbS1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbi10by1pbXByb3ZlLWdlb3JnZXRvd24taG9zcGl0YWxzLXF1YWxpdHktb2Ytc2VydmljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US-based Mount Sinai Health System institution to improve Georgetown Hospital's quality of service,"Last Updated on Saturday 9 July 2022 7:42 by Denis Chabrol

The globally recognised New York-headquartered Mount Sinai health system will next week dispatch a team to Guyana to begin overhauling the quality of service at the country’s primary healthcare institution the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation (GPHC) officials said Friday.

Health Minister Dr Frank Anthony said a team from Morning Side Hospital would be partnering directly with counterparts at the GPHC in “all the aspects of its operation”. Those he said would include developing clinical excellence improving patient care relationships and improving turnaround times for testing and “the waiting times that people would be waiting to see a doctor and so forth.”

Mount Sinai’s Chief Clinical Officer Dr Jeremy Boal said early next week a team of clinical quality and administrative leaders “will arrive to engage with their counterparts at the Georgetown Public Hospital to improve and enhance care and outcomes there.”

Chief Executive Officer of Hess Corporation John Hess said the estimated US$30 million project being supported by his exploration and production oil company would not only include tackling diabetes cancer and cardiovascular complaints but also “significant enhancements to modernise the Georgetown Hospital.”

For several decades patients have been complaining about the long wait times to see doctors and poor inter-personal communication by mostly ancillary staff such as attendants and some healthcare workers. The attendants’ movement of patients arriving in private vehicles has also been observed to be less than satisfactory in some instances without due regard to possible injuries.

At the same time the GPHC and the Ministry of Health have been putting systems in place to better communicate with patients and relatives and address their concerns.

The agreement among the Guyana government Hess Corporation and Mount Sinai would also see that healthcare system organisation establish cancer and cardiovascular centres of excellence improve diabetes screening and care and integrate all aspects of health care. “All if these efforts will be coordinated with guidance and oversight of the Ministry of Health and all of the efforts will be in the service of the government’s overall strategic plan for health system strengthening that includes already announced investments in new and upgraded hospitals and related infrastructure.

The Mount Sinai health system which has 40000 employees including 7000 doctors describes itself as an integrated health care system that provides exceptional medical care to our local and global communities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXNzb2NpYXRlc3RpbWVzLmNvbS9ndXlhbmEtcmVjZWl2ZXMtNDA4MDAtZG9zZXMtb2YtbW9kZXJuYS12YWNjaW5lcy1mcm9tLWdvdnQtb2YtcmVwdWJsaWMtb2Ytc291dGgta29yZWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana receives 40800 doses of Moderna vaccines from govt of Republic of South Korea,"During the brief handing-over ceremony at the Ministry of Health’s Bond in Kingston Health Minister Dr Frank Anthony welcomed the donation.

Guyana: The Government of Guyana today received 40800 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines from the Government of the Republic of South Korea.

During the brief handing-over ceremony at the Ministry of Health’s Bond in Kingston Health Minister Dr Frank Anthony welcomed the donation.

“The Government of Guyana and people of Guyana would like to thank the Government and people of the Republic of Korea for this donation of COVID-19 vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic” the Minister said.

He further explained that the vaccines would be distributed across the ten administrative regions and will be administered to anyone 18 years and older who requires their primary series of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Meanwhile the Honorary Consul of the Republic of South Korea in Guyana Mr Ramesh Dookhoo said the valuable donation will aid in saving many lives while satisfying the need of the health care system in Guyana.

Also on site this afternoon was Dr Ertenisa Hamilton Director of Family and Primary Health Care Services; Dr Farrah December Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) Support Officer and Andrea Budburgh Medex attached to the Ministry of Health.

This morning at State House the Government of Guyana in Collaboration with Hess Corporation and Mount Sinai Health System announced a National Health Care Initiative. This initiative was officially commissioned by the signing of an agreement.

The collaboration seeks to facilitate a transformation of Guyana’s health sector in keeping with the President’s healthcare agenda which will position Guyana as a healthcare destination in the Caribbean region and eventually the world.

The initiative will improve the nation’s Primary Healthcare System implement Change Management at the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation (GPHC) and foster partnerships between the Government and the Private Sector for the development of Cardiovascular and Oncology Centres in Guyana.",,,,,,

The new two-year agreement reportedly includes improved wages benefits and reinstatement of daily room cleaning and other services according to the union.

Roughly 1800 hotel workers at the Hilton Hawaiian Village would benefit from the agreement. The union says the workers will vote to ratify the deal over the next week.

“We are proud to announce a breakthrough in our two-year campaign to defend Hawaii’s hotel service standards” Financial Secretary-Treasurer of Unite Here Local 5 Eric Gill said.

Since the onset of the pandemic hotels cut back or even eliminated daily room cleaning and changed it to a request-based system. That decision impacted the jobs of many hospitality industry housekeepers in the state and they have been fighting to reverse it and bring back previous industry standing the union said.

In a statement Hilton said “We are pleased to have reached a new labor agreement with UNITE HERE Local Five which represents some of our Team Members at Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Hilton is committed to offering a workplace environment where Team Members are treated fairly and respectfully and has always maintained a cooperative and productive relationship with UNITE HERE. We believe this agreement is beneficial to our valued Team Members and to our hotel and we look forward to continuing to provide our guests with our signature hospitality.”

The union says Hilton also agreed to significantly increase contributions to bolster health and welfare fund services to increase wages and pension contributions.

“We have reached this excellent two-year agreement with Hilton that addresses the most critical issues facing hotel workers as tourism recovers from the pandemic. Local 5 was able to reach this agreement because of the militancy and strong organization of Hilton workers and because Local 5 participated in coordinated bargaining efforts over the past two years with 15 other local unions and our international union” Gill added.

Previous collective bargaining terms with the union and several other hotel companies expired on June 30. The union says they will continue working with others in hopes of bettering working conditions for employees.

You aren’t literally getting the 5th night free though now that different nights may have different prices (first with the introduction of peak and off-peak rates and now with dynamic pricing). Instead you get the least expensive night for no additional points.

Still this can be a nice savings of up to 20% of points on a five night stay which leads a lot of members staying on reward nights to stretch their stays to 5 nights.

Both IHG and Hilton have similar programs. Hilton offers 5th night free to elites. IHG offers 4th night free to their co-brand cardmembers. Hyatt does not have a similar perk.

Back when 5th night free was a feature of the Starwood Preferred Guest program you really could get the 5th night free regardless of room type. Making only the cheapest night of a stay free (zero points for the redemption) isn’t the only way this benefit has been devalued.

Marriott also only gives you the points for a standard room free regardless of what room you’re booking on points. Somehow I never realized this. If you book a premium view a larger room or a suite you only get the base standard points price free and still pay the difference in points for the premium room even on the free night.

Here’s an example where you’ll see that the ‘free night’ on a 5-night premium room redemption actually costs 32000 points:

Hilton does this too – their 5th night free only gets you the cost of a standard room when booking five nights as an elite member though their 5th night free is more generous because instead of deducting the cost of the cheapest room night they deduct the cost of an average room night. Meanwhile IHG doesn’t generally offer premium room redemptions.

I’ve seen this language before but somehow failed to internalize that the benefit has been devalued in two ways – that you get the cheapest night ‘free’ and that it’s only for the standard room. I’d booked numerous Starwood Preferred Guest stays where 5th night free covered the full premium room. As in so many things Marriott doesn’t do this. That’s good to know when budgeting your points stays. And when you see a free night that isn’t free now you’ll know why."

You may have noticed a new outdoor power equipment brand showing up as you search Home Depot’s website: Green Machine. We got our hands on both Green Machine battery-powered lawn mower models to see where they fit in the wider range of cordless options and if one is a good fit for your lawn.

Editor’s Note: Looking for an upgrade this mowing season? Get our best lawn mower pick and find out who we think makes the best models in the industry.

Green Machine Battery-Powered Lawn Mower Performance

Green Machine has two mowers to choose from. One is a push mower and the other is self-propelled. Aside from the drive system the two mowers are very similar.

Green Machine uses a 62-volt brushless motor to power its 22-inch blade. That’s a larger blade than most battery-powered lawn mowers use. Despite the additional load the motor can keep the blade turning at high RPMs even in our thick St. Augustine grass. Even in areas that we allowed to grow a few extra days the mower did an excellent job of cutting without dropping the drive speed down to a crawl.

Green Machine says to expect up to 45 minutes of runtime on each 4.0Ah battery (90 minutes with two batteries) and be able to cut 1/2 an acre with the two that come in the kit. Grass thickness heat and moisture can all affect that so if you have thick fast-growing grass plan on closer to 30 minutes worth of cutting using a 4.0Ah battery during the summer.

*Note that the push mower comes with one battery and the self-propelled model comes with two.

Everything you need to mulch bag and side discharge comes in the box. Both mowers use a true side discharge rather than a rear attachment that attaches to the bagger connection. If you’re cutting down overgrown grass or simply prefer to side discharge you’ll get better distribution than many battery-powered models.

Green Machine Battery-Powered Self-Propelled Lawn Mower Design Notes

Self-Propelled Drive System

Green Machine uses a dial to set the drive speed. What’s odd is that there’s no separate drive engagement bar and it’s a rear-wheel-drive system. That means there’s no quick way to stop the drive wheels when you turn aside from flipping the dial down to zero and then pushing it back up when your turn is complete. The good thing is the dial placement is easy to adjust on the fly. Still it’s something the design team will need to address in the next version.

Of course this isn’t a problem on the push mower.

There’s an “SP” button on the left that’s for engaging the self-propelled drive for transport without turning the blade on.

Single-Point Deck Height Adjustment

Deck adjustments are a piece of cake thanks to a single-point adjustment lever. The large handle is easy to grasp and the movement is easier than most of the mowers we’ve tested. The range is excellent with six levels starting at 1 1/4 inches on the low side and 3 3/4 inches at the highest setting.

Vertical Storage

Like many battery-powered models both Green Machine lawn mowers store vertically by folding the handle forward. Simply twist the same detent knobs you use to adjust the handle height fold the handle forward until the detents click into place and stand it up. It’s super-easy and saves a whole lot of your garage floor space.

LED Indicators

Right behind the battery housing there are 4 LED indicators. Reading from left to right they let you know about a low battery detected errors high temperature and power on.

Additional Highlights

Simple push-button starting

Three handle height positions

23-inch steel deck

11-inch high rear wheels improve traction

Push mower is 72 pounds

Self-propelled mower is 76 pounds

Compatible with all Green Machine 62V batteries

Low noise no emissions no gas and no oil

Green Machine Battery-Powered Self-Propelled Lawn Mower Price

Green Machine’s entire cordless lineup is available exclusively at The Home Depot online. The self-propelled lawn mower runs $449 as a kit with two 4.0Ah batteries and a charger. The push mower is $329 with one 4.0Ah battery and a charger. When you order they’ll ship it to your home or your local Home Depot for free.

Green Machine warranties the mower for 5 years and the batteries for 3 years.

Considering what other brands are charging for similar designs Green Machine’s price makes for a compelling value.

The Bottom Line

For the price Green Machine’s lawn mower options are worth taking a close look at. If you’re looking for a push mower you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better bang for the buck. It’s worth holding off on the self-propelled mower until they deal with the drive control though. Once they do Green Machine will be in a great position to earn the top value picks for both styles.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Decent 1080p gaming performance

Good keyboard and touchpad

Conservative good looks

Affordable Cons Confusing configurations

Poor battery life

Ho-hum screen

Gaming laptops tend to be expensive and the chip shortage has only made that situation worse in recent years. HP’s new Victus 15 slides in with options well under $1000 that attempt to provide a fix to that problem.

While the larger Victus 16 gets you up to an RTX 3060 the Victus 15 tops out at an RTX 3050 Ti — and starts at a budget-tier GTX 1650 which is what my review unit included. Despite having the latest 12th-gen CPUs we don’t normally recommend gaming laptops with graphics that are quite that bottom of the barrel. While our unit lacked in performance there are some configurations in the lineup that could make the Victus 15 a solid purchase — especially considering the alternatives.

Design

Like the Victus 16 the Victus 15 has a design that carries over a few elements from HP’s Omen lineup but maintains a more conservative aesthetic. The Victus logo shares the Omen logo’s basic geometry cutting off and retaining the bottom portion. The logo shows up on the lid and in the venting above the keyboard. Otherwise the Victus 15 has simple lines and few gamer-oriented elements. The rear vent has a bit of a fighter jet look but from the front and sides you wouldn’t be blamed for mistaking the Victus 15 for a mainstream budget laptop. That perception extends to the thin side bezels and reasonably small top bezel that contrast with the massive chin at the bottom of the display.

There are three available colors Mica Silver (dark gray) Performance Blue and Ceramic White. The Victus 15 doesn’t look exactly like a smaller version of the Victus 16 — the rear edges are more rounded giving a sleeker look. It’s not unusual for gaming laptops to strike a more mainstream look. Other examples include the Razer Blade 15 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. If you want a laptop that looks like a gaming machine you’ll want to consider something like the Asus ROG Strix G15 that’s a gamer through and through.

HP didn’t set out to make a thin and light gaming laptop but it didn’t make the thickest or heaviest either.

The Victus 15 is made of all plastic just like the Victus 16. Also like that laptop it has a lid that’s quite bendable. The keyboard deck also comes with a bit of flex although the smaller model is a bit more solid. The hinge works well allowing the lid to be opened with one hand and avoiding any serious wobble during intense gaming action. Overall the Victus 15 is slightly improved over the Victus 16 but it falls well short of more expensive machines like the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro and the Razer Blade 15.

Even given the large chin on the bottom of the display the Victus 15 is sized like the typical 15-inch gaming laptop . It’s fractions of an inch narrower and shallower than the Lenovo Legion 5 for example and just as thick at 0.93 inches. The HP is slightly lighter at 5.06 pounds compared to 5.3 pounds. The Acer Nitro 5 a similarly priced gaming machine is about the same size but thicker at 0.94 inches and lighter at 4.85 pounds. HP didn’t aim to make a thin and light laptop but it didn’t make the thickest or heaviest either.

Connectivity is robust with one exception. There’s a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports a full-size HDMI 2.1 port an Ethernet connection a 3.5mm audio jack and a full-size SD card reader. The one glaring omission is Thunderbolt 4 which we’ve seen on laptops at this price point. Wireless connectivity is either Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 or Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 depending on the configuration.

Price and configurations

Affordable gaming laptops are tough to come by these days especially ones that are actually worth buying. As with all cheap laptops  though digging into the configurations is key — and unfortunately HP has created a confusing lineup with the Victus 15 offering preconfigured models via retailers that utilize different Intel CPUs than you can buy via HP’s configure-to-order (CTO) system.

The preconfigured models range from a $600 (on sale from $880) configuration with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU 8GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and an Nvidia GTX 1650. My review unit was similar though it cost $800 and includes a Core i5-12450H and a 144Hz Full HD display. At the high end is the $1000 (on sale from $1100) model with a Core i7-12650H 16GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and the Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti. Other options include the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H and the RTX 3050. These higher-end options will give you far better performance.

You can configure the Victus 15 at HP.com which lets you spec out your laptop in finer detail ranging from $870 on the low end to $1230 on the high end. There are two primary competitors that price out closely to the Victus 15: The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 and the Acer Nitro 5. The Nitro 5 is $50 more expensive when configured similarly while the IdeaPad Gaming 3 comes with the latest Ryzen processor for $900.

Performance

The most important distinction is that the Core i5-12450H is a 45-watt 10-core (four Performance and six Efficient) and 12-thread CPU compared to the 45-watt 12-core (four Performance and eight Efficient) 16-thread i5-12500H. The Core i7-12650H is a 45-watt 10-core (six Performance and four Efficient) 16-thread CPU compared to the Core i7-12700H a 45-watt 14-core (six Performance and eight Efficient) 20-thread CPU. We’ve only benchmarked the Core i7-12700H but looking at the Geekbench 5 database the Core i5-12450H and Core i7-12650H are (as expected) slower than their higher-core and higher-thread counterparts.

We haven’t tested a 28-watt P-series Core i5 but again looking at the Geekbench 5 database it seems to be faster than the Core i5-12450H in my review unit. It’s worth noting that the Victus 15 couldn’t quite keep up with laptops running the 28-watt Core i7-1260P with its 12 cores (four Performance and eight Efficient) and 16 threads of which we’ve reviewed quite a few. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is also faster than the Core i5 in my review unit.

Accordingly the Victus 15’s productivity and creativity performances were mixed. It had the second-slowest Geekbench 5 results in our comparison group well behind the Core i7-1260P in the MSI Prestige 14 and the core i7-11800H in the HP Victus 16. The same held with our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265 although the differences weren’t as significant. At the same time the Victus 15 was more competitive in the Cinebench R23 benchmark producing the third-fastest single-core score and beating the MSI Prestige 14. The Victus 15 was again behind most of the pack in the PCMark 10 Complete test that runs through a range of productivity multimedia and creative tasks.

The Victus 15 can handle demanding productivity workflows and some low-end creative tasks.

Finally in the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark that runs in a live version of Adobe’s Premiere Pro the Victus 15 again fell behind the MSI Prestige 14. That laptop was configured with the RTX 3050 a faster GPU than the GTX 1650 in the Victus 15 and the Pugetbench benchmark is heavily influenced by GPU performance. However it wasn’t GPU performance that held the HP back. In fact the Victus 15 tied the Prestige 14 in the GPU section of the benchmark and it was in the CPU-dependent video playback section that the HP was much slower.

Overall mainstream performance was still solid for an $800 laptop. The Victus 15 can handle demanding productivity workflows and some low-end creative tasks. But you’ll see faster results by ordering via the CTO system. Interestingly the Omen Gaming Hub app has a performance tuning section but the GTX 1650 version of the Victus 15 doesn’t have a performance setting which is disappointing.

Gaming

Gaming performance was mostly in line with expectations given the GTX 1650 GPU. These are the lowest-end graphics cards you can find in a gaming laptop  so your expectations should be low when firing this up. First the Victus 15 had the lowest 3DMark Time Spy test in our comparison group as expected. It was considerably lower than the MSI Prestige 14’s RTX 3050 also as expected.

The Victus 15 performed OK in most of our benchmarks at 1080p and higher graphics settings. It managed playable frame rates in Civilization VI and Fortnite but just barely in the latter case. You’ll need to drop down to a lower setting to play Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The results aren’t listed in the table below but the Victus 15 managed to hit 45 frames per second (fps) in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p and Ultra graphics with DLSS turned off.

Overall the laptop averaged greater than 30 fps in most of our benchmark titles. Of course that’s the bare minimum fps for gaming so you’ll want to configure the RTX 3050 Ti to get more comfortable frame rates at higher graphics.

Display and audio

There are three display options for the Victus 15 all non-touch 16:9 Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS. They include a 250-nit 60Hz panel a 250-nit 144Hz panel and a 300-nit low blue light panel. My review unit was equipped with the 144Hz display and it seemed OK to me when I powered on the laptop and used it during my testing. The colors were muted but the contrast seemed deep enough and the display didn’t get terribly bright.

That’s pretty much what my colorimeter confirmed. Brightness was indeed low at 236 nits below our 300-nit threshold while the contrast was good at 1150:1 above our preferred 1000:1. Colors weren’t very wide at just 65% of sRGB and 49% of AdobeRGB and accuracy wasn’t great at a Delta-E of 3.04 (2.0 or less is considered the minimum for creative work). The Victus 16’s display was brighter and had wider and more accurate colors and only the Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey‘s display was worse.

These results aren’t terrible for a laptop that’s $800 or less but they become less palatable as you approach $1000. The display is fine for productivity work and gaming primarily thanks to the high contrast but creators will find it lacking.

Two downward-firing speakers provide the audio putting out plenty of volume with just a hint of distortion at the top end. Mids and clears were high but there was zero bass meaning you’ll want to wear some headphones for intense gaming and binging sessions.

Keyboard touchpad and webcam

There’s no per-key RGB lighting with the Victus 15 as HP is apparently reserving that for its Omen gaming lineup. Instead there’s just a single rather bright backlight setting. There’s plenty of spacing and the keys with their gamer-oriented font are large enough. I found the switches to be ligh with a nice click at the bottom which should work nicely for gamers even if it’s not a mechanical keyboard. Overall the keyboard felt much like the one on the Victus 16 which shouldn’t be a surprise.

The touchpad was large and had a surface that offered a touch of resistance. It was responsive and reliable for Windows 11 ’s complement of multi-touch gestures and the clicks were solid and confident without being too loud.

The webcam is a 720p version and it performed about as well as the typical laptop webcam. That is it was OK with good lighting but lost details in low light.

The Victus 15 doesn’t support Windows 11 Hello passwordless login. There are no fingerprint reader or infrared camera options which is disappointing.

Battery life

My review unit packed in just 52.5 watt-hours of battery which isn’t a lot for a 15-inch laptop with a discrete GPU. If you order a higher-end model via HP’s CTO system you can get a 70 watt-hour battery. I wasn’t expecting much in the way of battery life.

Unsurprisingly the Victus 15 didn’t do well. It managed just 4.25 hours in our web-browsing test that cycles through a series of popular and demanding websites and it only managed five hours in our video test that loops a local Full HD Avengers trailer. In the PCMark 10 Applications test that’s the best measure of productivity battery life it couldn’t quite make it to five hours. The average laptop in our database at least doubles those results.

The Victus 15 performed similarly to most of the gaming laptops in our comparison group. Only the Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey and the Razer Blade 14 with its AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX had meaningfully longer battery life.

Our take

Rating the HP Victus 15 is challenging given its wide range of configurations. The $600 configuration (on sale from $870) with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H and a GTX 1650 provides a lot of value and will likely provide similar performance to my review unit. Speaking of that the configuration I reviewed justifies its $800 price but barely.

In the end the Victus 15 performed well enough and is built solidly enough to make it a solid new entry in the budget gaming arena. You’ll just want to compare the available options before making your choice.

Are there any alternatives?

The best alternative to the Victus 15 is the Victus 16. It’s a little larger but it can also be configured with a much faster GPU and its display is slightly better. For just $100 more you can get a configuration with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H and RTX 3050 that’s probably faster than my review unit.

There aren’t many other gaming laptops under $1000 that have made the switch to Intel 12th-gen CPUs. One that has is the Acer Nitro 5 which has a more aggressive gaming design and similar configuration for a couple of hundred dollars more.

The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 is another alternative offering a similarly conservative design and similar components for just a bit more money than the Victus 15. You’ll want to look for the newest AMD Ryzen 6000 models.

How long will it last?

Despite a little bending in the lid and flexing in the keyboard deck the Victus 15 is a well-built budget gaming machine. It should still last for years of hard gaming. The industry-standard one-year warranty remains as disappointing as ever.

Should you buy it?

Yes. The Victus 15 is a good value as long as you make your selection carefully from among HP’s confusing purchasing options.

In a press statement issued here Sunday Himachal Pradesh Congress president Pratibha Singh said Gandhi had laid the foundation stone of the tunnel on June 23 2010.""By removing the foundation stone laid by Sonia Gandhi the BJP governments at the Center and the state have shown their petty mentality"" said the Mandi MP.The tribal area of Lahaul Spiti and the people of the state are well aware of this fact she said. ""The CM cannot mislead the people by telling lies.""The Congress state president said ""It is very unfortunate that the names of Congress leaders Indira Gandhi Rajiv Gandhi Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi who played an important role in the construction of this tunnel are not even taken.""The BJP today is trying to tamper with the history of the country to serve its political interests she alleged.""If the BJP government does not restore this plaque this plaque will be restored at the same place as soon as the Congress government is formed in the state"" Singh said.The Himachal Pradesh police had on October 14 2020 said that the foundation stone was secure with the construction company which built the tunnel.The police had issued the clarification after the state Congress alleged that the foundation stone laid by Sonia Gandhi for the tunnel over a decade ago had been removed before its inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 3 2020.Then Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh said the Border Roads Organisations (BRO) had kept the stone in the mechanical workshop of the tunnel's construction company SAJV so that it could not get damaged during the construction.The SP had said the Lahaul-Spiti police had got a complaint from the district Congress regarding the missing plaque and it was forwarded to the Kullu police.This came to light during investigation that the foundation stone is secure and lying in the workshop he had added.Earlier in a letter to Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur in October 2020 itself then state Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore had said Gandhi had laid the foundation stone in 2010 in the presence of the then CM Prem Kumar Dhumal and Union minister Virbhadra Singh.Former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after whom the tunnel has been named had announced the project during a public meeting at Lahaul-Spiti's Keylong in June 2000. Vajpayee had laid the foundation stone for an approach road to the tunnel in 2002.The all-weather road beneath the 13058-foot-high mountain in Himachal Pradesh's Rohtang Pass Atal Tunnel Rohtang connects Lahaul of Lahaul-Spiti district and Manali of Kullu district in Himachal Pradesh.The 9.2-km-long tunnel is the world's longest highway single-tube tunnel located above 10040 feet."

Un polémico experimento con humanos contemporáneos comprueba que elaborar herramientas de piedra se puede conseguir sin modelos culturales previos.

Una investigación desarrollada en la Universidad de Tubinga ha llegado a una polémica conclusión sobre la herencia cultural temprana en la evolución humana.

Hasta ahora se ha considerado que al comieno de la Edad de Piedra cuando se crearon las primeras herramientas líticas se produjeron innovaciones técnicas y conductuales en las que nuestra cultura actual hunde sus raíces.

Sin embargo la nueva investigación considera que las herramientas de piedra excavadas arqueológicamente algunas con una antigüedad de hasta 26 millones de años no indican necesariamente que en esa época se estuviera generando propiamente hablando una cultura humana.

Solo demuestra que nuestros antepasados prehistóricos tenían la capacidad de fabricar esas herramientas pero no certifica que ya se estuvieran volviendo humanos mental y culturalmente como se ha considerado hasta ahora.

Experimento actual

Para llegar a esta conclusión Claudio Tennie y William Snyder del Departamento de Prehistoria Temprana y Ecología Cuaternaria de la citada universidad alemana han testado esta interpretación tradicional de la cultura humana en un estudio financiado por el Consejo Europeo de Investigación.

Pidieron a 28 participantes (adultos locales que no estudiaron arqueología) que abrieran una caja cerrada que contenía recompensas monetarias.

Para conseguirlo tenían a su disposición unas materias primas equivalentes a las que podrían haber usado nuestros antepasados: un hemisferio de vidrio pintado un guijarro de río de tamaño mediano y un gran bloque de granito.

Ninguno de los participantes recibió información sobre el posible uso de esas herramientas y mucho menos demostraciones. Podían usarlas de la manera que consideraran adecuada para romper una cuerda que mantenía la caja cerrada.

Nuevas herramientas

Los investigadores comprobaron que la mayoría de los participantes innovó y procedió a fabricar y utilizar las herramientas resultantes para cortar la cuerda que cerraba la caja del rompecabezas.

También descubrieron que todas las técnicas de producción de las primeras herramientas de piedra se reinventaron en el lugar desde cero entre los participantes.

Esta constatación los ha llevado a concluir que inventar herramientas de piedra (sílex) no es difícil y que se puede conseguir sin tener modelos previos que imitar lo que implicaría aprovecharse de una forma de transmisión cultural.

“Que las herramientas de piedra existieran hace 26 millones de años no es una prueba irrefutable de que nuestros antepasados en la primera Edad de Piedra tenían una cultura como la nuestra” resume Snyder. ""Ahora debemos mirar a períodos de tiempo posteriores para determinar el origen de la cultura humana moderna"" concluye.

Conclusiones polémicas

Felipe Cuartero Monteagudo técnico del Laboratorio de Arqueología Experimental y Tafonomía del Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana (CENIEH) no lo tiene tan claro.

En declaraciones a SMC considera que ninguno de los participantes podía ignorar la naturaleza cortante del vidrio por lo que no puede considerarse que su habilidad sea equiparable a la de nuestros antepasados.

Cuestiona también las materias primas facilitadas a los voluntarios ya que considera que no son totalmente representativas de los materiales disponibles para nuestros antepasados.

Habría que replanteárselo

Añade no obstante que a pesar de este sesgo sobre la elección de los materiales en el planteamiento del experimento es plausible suponer que los procesos de reinvención de una tecnología sencilla como la de la prehistoria africana tuvieran lugar en alguna ocasión sin necesidad de un componente natural “aunque el experimento a mi juicio no consigue demostrarlo con suficiente solvencia” matiza Cuartero.

La experimentación sobre el comportamiento de individuos actuales simulando necesidades y soluciones pretéritas tiene poca relevancia y debería haberse hecho de otra forma para que el resultado fuera más consistente concluye.

El objetivo ha sido ayudar y solidarizarse con este enclave que está sufriendo una importante desecación.

Desde las nueve y media de la mañana hoy sábado han acudido en torno a 500 personas para protestar por la avería del canal de alimentación. Una reivindicación que responde a la «inacción» de la Junta de Andalucía y de la empresa Unión Salinera que explota los terrenos ante la desecación de las charcas que «son hábitat de aves migratorias» que «siguen viniendo» pero «se encuentran que no hay charcos para repostar» según ha desvelado la asociación.

«¿Esto a qué se debe? ¿Es por Las Salinas? Yo vengo desde Madrid todos los años y me parece lamentable que haya ocurrido esto y nadie haga nada» ha expresado María acercándose allí atraída por lo que estaban realizando. Y acto seguido no ha dudado en utilizar un cubo y unirse a la fila para aportar su granito de arena entre los asistentes.

Durante un par de horas han estado transportando el agua del mar desde el Torreón de San Miguel hasta el humedal protegido de Las Salinas de Cabo de Gata. Sin embargo las protestas no acaban aquí ya que mañana domingo 'Cabo de Gata me mata' tiene pensado hacer un llamamiento para que todos los bañistas que estén entre Cabo de Gata y Las Salinas «salgan a las 13.00 horas a la carretera para reivindicar con una cadena humana que se ponga un sistema al menos provisional desde el mar a las salinas» ya que «es un lugar de gran importancia medioambiental y turística».

También a través de la plataforma Change.org están dando voz a lo ocurrido y exigen «medidas urgentes» para que salven el lugar así como la fauna que vive en Las Salinas.

Por parte de la Junta de Andalucía remitieron un escrito a la empresa Unión Salinera SL perteneciente al grupo Salins en el que da tres días para que «ponga sobre la mesa» medidas de emergencia para restablecer el suministro de agua del mar al humedal protegido. En el escrito la delegada territorial de Desarrollo Sostenible Raquel Espín urge y exige a la empresa la puesta en marcha «de forma inmediata» de medidas provisionales en lo que se lleva a cabo la solución definitiva planteada ante el cegamiento del canal de abastecimiento.

Espín ha insistido en que se tomen medidas dirigidas para recuperar «a la mayor brevedad la normalidad de esta laguna artificial» enclavada en el parque natural de Cabo de Gata-Níjar e incluida en la lista Ramsar de Humedales. «Hemos dado tres días a la empresa para que presente ante la Delegación de Desarrollo Sostenible su propuesta de medidas excepcionales dirigidas a garantizar el suministro de los volúmenes de agua salada necesarios para la reposición de las condiciones idóneas para el mantenimiento del hábitat y la biodiversidad característicos de las Salinas» reflejó. Y la delegada en funciones de la Junta en Almería Aránzazu Martín aseguró el viernes que el Gobierno andaluz ha actuado «con la máxima celeridad» y un «grupo de técnicos» de la Delegación Territorial «está en primera línea por si hubiera que llevar a cabo alguna actuación 'in situ'».

Por su parte el colectivo almeriense ha manifestado que pese la advertencia de la Delegación Territorial de Desarrollo Sostenible a la empresa salinera para que en «tres días» dé una solución urgente al cegamiento del canal que abastece al humedal «no se creen nada» y reclaman a los vecinos que «no se queden quietos» ante lo que califican de un «desastre ambiental».

La maldad es un concepto complejo que ha sido abordado por los filósofos desde la antigüedad hasta nuestros días. A continuación veremos las posturas más relevantes sobre este fenómeno.

Escrito por Equipo Editorial Última actualización: 25 mayo 2023

La maldad es uno de esos conceptos que sabemos identificar muy bien en la práctica pero al momento de definirlo nos puede resultar complicado. Y es que si nos pidieran diferenciar entre acciones moralmente buenas y malas seguro lo haríamos sin mayor dificultad basándonos en valores y principios.

Pero si nos pidieran definir en teoría la maldad nos encontraríamos con algunas dificultades. Se trata de un concepto complejo cuya naturaleza y dimensiones resultan difíciles de delimitar.

De allí que la noción de maldad posea un amplio historial de discusión filosófica. Aun hoy se siguen debatiendo ciertos aspectos de este fenómeno. Dicho esto veamos a continuación algunas de las teorías filosóficas más importantes sobre el concepto.

¿Qué es la maldad?

Antes es importante señalar que existen al menos dos conceptos de maldad: uno amplio y otro restringido. Veamos en qué consiste cada uno.

Concepto amplio

El concepto amplio de maldad abarca cualquier eventualidad que perjudique al ser humano o le cause sufrimiento. En este sentido el malestar derivado de un dolor de muelas es igual de malo que un engaño por ejemplo.

Ahora bien el mal en sentido amplio se ha dividido también en dos categorías: natural y moral. En el primero se incluyen todos los estados de cosas que no resultan de la intención o negligencia de los agentes morales. Por lo tanto entran aquí los accidentes naturales y las enfermedades como males naturales.

En cambio los males morales derivan de las intenciones o la negligencia de los agentes. Por ende incluyen aquellas acciones humanas que perjudican al otro como el engaño o el asesinato.

Cabe destacar que esta noción tiende a utilizarse en los contextos teológicos y en las discusiones sobre el problema del mal que reflejan la dificultad para explicar la naturaleza de la maldad en un mundo creado por un Dios todopoderoso omnisciente y bondadoso.

Concepto restringido

Por su parte el concepto restringido de maldad solo incluye aquellas acciones personajes o acontecimientos considerados despreciables desde el punto de vista moral.

En este sentido el mal solo se le atribuye a los agentes morales (los seres humanos) y a sus acciones. Suele utilizarse en contextos políticos y jurídicos contemporáneos.

Las teorías filosóficas del mal

Desde la antigüedad diversos filósofos de renombre han teorizado sobre la maldad. A continuación veremos algunas teorías al respecto.

El mal como producto de la ignorancia

Uno de los primeros filósofos en analizar la maldad fue Sócrates quien atribuía el mal a la ignorancia. Es decir ningún hombre actuaría mal a sabiendas sino porque desconoce lo que es el bien y cómo hacer las cosas conforme a él.

En este sentido el malvado no actuaría como tal si tuviera un verdadero conocimiento de su error. Si supiera que vivir conforme al bien es la mejor manera de hacerlo entonces no optaría por obrar mal.

Dios y el mal

Las teorías filosóficas sobre la maldad iniciaron con los intentos de resolver el problema del mal. Es decir cuando se buscaba reconciliar la existencia del mal (en el sentido amplio) con un Dios o creador todopoderoso omnisciente y bueno.

Una teoría que proporciona una solución al problema del mal es el dualismo maniqueo. Según esta postura el universo es el producto de una batalla en curso entre dos primeros principios iguales y eternos: Dios y el Príncipe de las Tinieblas.

De estos primeros principios surgen sustancias buenas y malas que estarían en una batalla constante por la supremacía.

Por su parte los primeros filósofos cristianos como San Agustín se decantaron por el neoplatonismo. Ellos defendieron que el mal no existe como sustancia o propiedad sino como privación de sustancia forma y bondad.

Por ejemplo el mal de la enfermedad consiste en la privación de la salud. El mal del pecado consiste en la privación de la virtud.

En estos casos Dios no crea el mal pues toda su creación es buena. Por lo tanto el mal es la ausencia de ser o falta de bien.

La maldad: ¿una cualidad natural del ser humano?

El ser humano siempre ha sentido inclinación hacia la maldad. De hecho como sociedad hemos llegado a sentir fascinación y cierta curiosidad por los malvados.

Ahora bien esta atracción o propensión hacia el mal ha traído a colación el cuestionamiento sobre si la maldad es connatural al ser humano o es una cualidad aprendida.

En este aspecto autores como Nicolás Maquiavelo o Thomas Hobbes afirman que el ser humano es malo por naturaleza. Su egoísmo e instinto de supervivencia le lleva a saciar sus propios deseos en detrimento de sus pares. Por lo tanto se vuelve necesaria la ley y el Estado entidades que permiten regular el comportamiento de las personas en pro del bien común.

Kant afirma que existe un mal radical en la naturaleza humana. Lo que implica que todos los seres humanos tenemos una propensión a subordinar la ley moral al interés propio; y esta propensión es radical o arraigada en la naturaleza humana.

Para Kant la tarea del bondadoso sería según su imperativo categórico la de dar ejemplo con acciones moralmente correctas. En cambio Rousseau plantea una postura contraria al defender que el ser humano es bueno por naturaleza y es la sociedad la que lo corrompe.

La banalidad del mal

En el siglo XX Hanna Arendt ofrece una noción de maldad asociada a grupos sociales y al propio Estado. Sus reflexiones surgen como un intento de comprender y evaluar los horrores de los campos de exterminio nazis.

Arendt defiende que el mal no es natural al ser humano ni es una categoría metafísica. Sería producido por las personas y se manifestaría solo cuando encuentra espacio institucional y estructural para ello.

Según Arendt una característica distintiva del mal radical es que no se hace por motivos humanamente comprensibles como el egoísmo. Simplemente se ejecuta para reforzar el control totalitario y la idea de que todo es posible.

Las guerras ponen en evidencia extremos críticos de la maldad que llevan a los filósofos a plantearse nuevas perspectivas sobre este hecho.

Componentes de una acción malvada

Muchos filósofos contemporáneos consideran que la noción de maldad está ligada al concepto de acción malvada. En este sentido defienden que una persona malvada es aquella que realiza acciones malas o incorrectas.

Pero ¿qué es lo que caracteriza a las acciones malas? Algunos teóricos han propuesto los siguientes componentes:

Presencia de daño: las malas acciones deben causar o permitir un daño significativo a una víctima al menos.

las malas acciones deben causar o permitir un daño significativo a una víctima al menos. Motivación : también se piensa que las acciones malas requieren cierta intencionalidad o motivación de hacer el mal. Si no hay tal intención entonces no se debe considerar como un acto de maldad.

: también se piensa que las acciones malas requieren cierta intencionalidad o motivación de hacer el mal. Si no hay tal intención entonces no se debe considerar como un acto de maldad. Afecto: también se ha afirmado que para hacer el mal debemos sentirnos de cierta manera o tener determinadas emociones al momento de actuar. Por ejemplo Laurence Thomas cree que los malhechores se deleitan en causar daño o sienten odio hacia sus víctimas.

también se ha afirmado que para hacer el mal debemos sentirnos de cierta manera o tener determinadas emociones al momento de actuar. Por ejemplo Laurence Thomas cree que los malhechores se deleitan en causar daño o sienten odio hacia sus víctimas. Responsabilidad: se asume que una mala acción está ligada a un agente moralmente responsable. Es decir aunque los accidentes naturales puedan causar mucho daño estos fenómenos no pueden realizar malas acciones porque no son agentes morales.

De acuerdo con esto las acciones malas son ejecutadas por los seres humanos de forma intencional y producen sufrimiento en la víctima y cierto placer en el malhechor.

Pero esta perspectiva de acción malvada puede ser cuestionada. Por ejemplo si intentamos detonar una bomba en una habitación llena de personas inocentes pero la policía frustra el intento ¿la acción seguiría siendo malvada a pesar de que no causó algún daño?

La maldad es un concepto complejo

Como pudimos comprobar el concepto de maldad no es fácil de delimitar. A pesar de que muchos filósofos se han dedicado a reflexionar sobre este tópico se siguen discutiendo las condiciones necesarias y suficientes que definen a una mala acción o a una persona malvada.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuZXMvdGVuaXMvd2ltYmxlZG9uLzIwMjIvbmljay1reXJnaW9zLXBlcnNvbmEtaHVtYW5hLWFydGljdWxvLW9waW5pb24tZmluYWxpc3RhLXdpbWJsZWRvbi1kam9rb3ZpY19zdG85MDI3OTAyL3N0b3J5LnNodG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nick Kyrgios persona humana,"El tenista del millón de multas.

Nick Kyrgios ha elegido ser el villano en parte porque su temperamento volátil explosivo le hizo ganar muy pronto ese papel en un 'casting' sin apenas oposición dentro del circuito. Al final es la vida la que le ha conducido por este camino y ahora se ve obligado a alimentar un personaje del que a menudo se cansa con el que no se identifica plenamente y del que es improbable que se sienta orgulloso aunque le siga resultando útil para gestionar la presión y ciertas emociones. Porque los antihéroes venden mucho en los tiempos que corren. Ahora todo el mundo parece dispuesto a destruirlo todo a transgredir todas las normas a romper todas las convenciones y superar todos los límites como si nada mereciera la pena. El malvado atormentado tiene sus razones como bien sabe cualquiera que haya leído alguna vez un cómic. Y nunca faltarán imbéciles que lo apoyen.

Pero Nick no es malvado ni de lejos. Puede que sí se haya comportado de forma cruel con el enemigo ocasional (“Kokkinakis se folló a tu novia siento decírtelo colega” le soltó a Wawrinka en pleno partido). Puede que haya insultado y escupido y discutido y gritado mucho más de lo aceptable. Ni es ni quiere ser un modelo conducta mucho menos de deportista. Puede también que sea bastante egoísta en lo relativo a la satisfacción inmediata de sus deseos hedonista anárquicamente individualista incluso podríamos afirmar que un poco esteta en la medida en que el arte (lo bello de la vida) está para él muy por encima de la victoria y de la derrota. “No quiero hacer perder el tiempo a ningún entrenador porque no me importa alcanzar o no mi máximo potencial” aseveró muchas veces. Ahora bien nada de eso lo convierte en el líder de una contrarrevolución cultural o anticultural neopopulista en el tenis.

Lo hizo el niño-adulto Nick el que siendo adolescente hubo de desarrollar un tenis propio especialmente agresivo porque carecía de condición física para sostener intercambios largos desde el fondo.

Lo mejor de Nick es esa rara lealtad a sus principios sean los que sean y el hecho de anteponerla a sus propios intereses. La percepción de la injusticia enciende su fuego interno como pocas cosas y está en el origen de un alto porcentaje de los altercados que ha protagonizado en competición. “Si alguna vez Rafa juega tan rápido como yo hoy me retiro del tenis” bramó cuando un árbitro le llamó la atención por tomarse demasiado tiempo entre saques. En otras ocasiones es cierto son sólo caprichos como el circo que montó aquella vez en un torneo cuando no había manera de que alguien le trajera unas puñeteras toallas blancas. Él sólo quería que fueran blancas joder.

¿Lo peor? Lo peor se ve todos los días muy a menudo está en todos los artículos y en todas las noticias. Y es normal Nick se lo ha ganado a pulso. Pero hablamos de un veinteañero que no come animales porque le dan pena le gustan no quiere hacerles daño. Hablamos del impulsor de la campaña de donación masiva de dinero por parte de tenistas profesionales australianos para contribuir en la lucha contra los incendios forestales que asolaron el país. Estamos ante un ecologista convencido quizá no muy informado pero sí diligente en lo que estima que está en su mano militante. Un tenista profesional que sin miedo a represalias de patrocinadores apareció un día con una camiseta antitrumpista en la que el ahora expresidente de los Estados Unidos figuraba reflejado como si fuera el auténtico demonio. “La imagen habla por sí misma” se limitó a explicar.

Ya con veintitantos años el profesional multimillonario Nick Kyrgios se seguía dejando revisar el correo electrónico por su mamá princesa malaya casada con un pintor de brocha gorda de origen griego. No hay que ser un genio para darse cuenta de que Nick ha sufrido graves problemas de salud mental. Él mismo ha hablado de ellos en alguna ocasión. Ha contrapuesto las canchas llenas de aficionados los millones de espectadores por todo el mundo con la soledad del veinteañero perdido en un planeta grande y complejo el muchacho que sólo cree necesitar una consola algo de comida a domicilio y por favor que nadie lo moleste durante horas. Bueno y quizá alguna que otra droga. El chico deprimido que coquetea con el suicidio y llega a autolesionarse el brazo."

My wife had actually started at Tiktok account. She had a couple thousand followers and she was kind of gloating about it saying ""Check it out. I'm so famous."" Like rubbing it in my face"" Niu explains. ""We're both very very competitive people. And so I thought 'Okay you know what? I'm going to start my own TikTok account and I'm going to beat you. Give me until end of the year.'""

Within three to four days of launching his account Niu easily surpassed his wife's follower count. Since then the multi-millionaire has amassed over 748000 followers.

Niu who grew up in a poor family graduated from Iowa State University in 2013. He landed his first job as a software engineer at IBM in January 2014 where he was given a $74000 salary and $5000 signing bonus.

""I did really well for my group as one of the top performers but after one year they didn't give me a promotion which really made me quite upset"" he explained. ""I actually quit my job before I even found a new one.""

After leaving IBM in June 2015 and losing a portion of his money to day trading Niu moved to San Francisco in hopes of working for a tech startup.

Though he secured a position as a DevOps engineer with the tech firm Dwolla a month after leaving IBM the stint was short-lived as he was laid off in December 2015. During that job he earned a salary of $125000 salary a $5000 signing bonus and stock options.

Two months later he joined Credit Karma as a senior software engineer where he was given a $138000 salary and $100000 stock package. Although Credit Karma ""checked a lot of the boxes"" he was looking for in a company he ended up quitting that job in May 2017 to go run a cryptocurrency startup which ""went nowhere.""

As Niu focused on his next move he and his then-girlfriend were thinking about getting engaged and settling down. The couple ended up moving to Chicago where Niu took a job with GrubHub in July 2017 as a senior site reliability engineer earning a $140000 salary a $7500 sign on bonus and a $200000 stock package.

""The job and everything was great"" he said. ""I got really lucky with my stock grants hit like 4x or something so my total salary and compensation shot up to like an insane level.""

Ultimately they decided not to stay in Chicago long-term and have since settled down in Canada. Niu got a job as a tech lead with Netflix in April 2019 which ended up offering him more than $500000 in total compensation. However he reevaluated what was important in his life following a death in the family and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Basically my entire reporting channel at Netflix from like the vice president down to my immediate manager was let go within the span of like two years or so during the time I was working there"" he noted. ""And I got a new manager who as new managers do shake things up. And she wanted me to come back early from paternity leave. And I made it very clear before I left that I was not going to do that.""

In October he took severance from the streaming behemoth and started raising his two kids full-time. At the time of his departure he and his wife had surpassed their goal of reaching $2 million in assets.

""Money doesn't buy happiness but it buys you freedom"" he said. ""I'm able to focus on family or friends or my health or things that I care more about.""

In addition to raising his kids and posting on TikTok Niu and his wife have started a podcast. He's also made his first angel investment with Beacons and has been asked to serve as an advisor at several startups.

Niu's advice for anyone looking to retire early is to work in a high-paying career that allows you to maximize your salary job-hop frequently to ensure you're being paid the highest possible rate in your field live below your means and invest your money.

For new investors getting started he recommends dollar cost averaging into S&P 500 index funds. In order to protect yourself from inflation he suggests Series I Savings bonds.

Niu also emphasizes the importance of not letting fear or negativity get in the way of trying to be financially successful.

Scott Santi is chairman and CEO of Illinois Tool Works one of the Music Institute’s largest sponsors and a corporate sponsor for more than 25 years. Both are known for their farsighted leadership in numerous non-profits and their enthusiastic approach to community problem solving.

The Richard D. Colburn Award for Teaching Excellence was presented to cello faculty member Dr Tanya L. Carey. In addition to Carey’s daily teaching in Chicago and work as a guest master clinician she has trained hundreds of cello teachers around the world and performed at Tully and Carnegie Halls as well as other venues. She is a past president of the Suzuki Association of the Americas and an artist-teacher at Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts. She is also the author of the “Cello Playing is Easy” series a comprehensive guide for teachers and players.

Musical performances at the gala included a drumline from the LEARN Excel Charter School a New Orleans Band procession led by Music Institute Jazz Studies Director and faculty member Audrey Morrison and performances by students in the Music Institute’s Community Music School and the Academy for gifted pre-college students.

Board Chair Scott Verschoor who is also one of more than 200 adult students at the Music Institute said in his remarks “Tonight we celebrate music from discovery through mastery and to the many spaces in between. We celebrate the importance of music to provide healing to a country and world faced with pandemics war and civil unrest.

“Music will always be our constant. I came across a statistic that stated more than 70 percent of people over age 45 say music gave them strength and healing during a difficult time in their lives. At the Music Institute we believe music is an essential element of a compassionate community—it strengthens bonds and nourishes the human spirit. We also believe live music and quality music education should be accessible to everyone.”

Break measurement by INDUCE-seq is achieved via a two-stage PCR-free library preparation (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Stage one consists of labelling in situ end prepared DSBs via ligation of a full-length chemically modified P5 adapter. In stage two extracted fragmented and end-prepared genomic DNA is ligated using a second chemically modified half-functional P7 adapter. The resulting DSB-labelled DNA fragments which comprise both the P5 and half-functional P7 adapters can hybridise with the illumina flow cell and subsequently be sequenced. Remaining genomic DNA fragments that are not ligated to the P5 adapter are therefore not derived from a physiological break-end and are subsequently blocked by the ligation of two half-functional P7 adapters. This renders them non-functional since they lack the sequence required to hybridise to the flow cell. This strategy enables the enrichment of functionally labelled physiological DSB sequences on the flow cell and the elimination of all other genomic DNA fragments preventing them from generating system noise. The avoidance of break-sequence amplification produces a sequencing output where a single sequencing read is equivalent to a single labelled DSB-end in the cell (compare Supplementary Fig. 1a b see Supplementary Fig. 2a). This important innovation generates a digital DNA break readout enabling the direct detection and quantification of genomic DSBs by sequencing without the need for error-correction. Following in situ break labelling currently available DSB detection methods BLISS DSBCapture and END-seq all employ an enrichment protocol to separate DSB-labelled DNA fragments from the excess fragmented genomic DNA. This is followed by a PCR-based library preparation and illumina sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1b). This results in a readout where a single read is not equivalent to a single break. Therefore PCR error-correction such as UMI-correction is employed to adjust for this18 (Supplementary Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Importantly INDUCE-seq is compatible with any of the in situ DSB labelling protocols reported to date.

Fig. 1: The INDUCE-seq workflow. In situ break labelling in fixed and permeabilised cells is performed by ligating a full-length chemically modified P5 sequencing adapter to end-prepared DSBs. Genomic DNA is then extracted fragmented end-prepared and ligated using a chemically modified half-functional P7 adapter. Resulting DNA libraries contain a mixture of functional DSB-labelled fragments (P5:P7) and non-functional genomic DNA fragments (P7:P7). Subsequent illumina sequencing of INDUCE-seq libraries enriches for DNA-labelled fragments and eliminates all other non-functional DNA. As the INDUCE-seq library preparation is PCR-free each sequencing read obtained is equivalent to a single labelled DSB-end from a cell. Full size image

In vitro detection of restriction enzyme-induced breaks

To evaluate the performance of INDUCE-seq we first examined the ability of the method to capture genome-wide DSBs induced by a high-fidelity HindIII restriction endonuclease in permeabilised cross-linked HEK293T cells. This approach has been used previously to benchmark other DSB detection methods such as END-seq BLISS and DSBCapture111718. There are ~800000 HindIII genomic positions that match the restriction sequence. However each of these restriction sites will be cut with varying efficiencies depending on their location in the genome and other factors. Therefore the total number of breaks detected in the sample can be used to calculate the average number of breaks per cell across the population of cells examined. We labelled DSBs in cross-linked HEK293T cells and prepared INDUCE-seq libraries to sequence labelled DSBs obtained from the genomic DNA extracted from ~25000 cells yielding ~148 M reads. This number is equivalent to the total number of breaks detected in the experimental sample. Therefore INDUCE-seq detects an average of ~5900 breaks per cell (~148 M breaks divided by 25000 cells). In untreated HEK293T cells ~200 K breaks were detected. These represent background endogenous breaks present in the cell sample. This equates to an average of ~2 endogenous breaks per cell (~200 K breaks divided by 100000 cells). As shown in Fig. 2a INDUCE-seq simultaneously detects highly recurrent HindIII-induced DSBs as well as lower-frequency endogenous DSBs (highlighted in red) within the same sample. Supplementary Fig. 2c also illustrates the simultaneous detection of recurrent and non-recurrent endogenous breaks in HEK293 cells. Furthermore this data revealed that ~146 M of these reads map precisely at the expected cut site for ~782000 HindIII restriction sites located within the genome. To determine the distribution of the reads obtained at HindIII sites detected we ranked them according to the number of breaks observed from highest to lowest and plotted the data in Fig. 2b. The top-ranked site detected by INDUCE-seq (i.e. the most frequently cut site in the cell population) has ~2500 reads observed. This means that cutting at this specific restriction site can be detected in ~10% of the 25000 cells in the sample. At the other end of the scale ~2000 HindIII sites were detected with just a single read meaning that these sites are cut very infrequently being detected in a single cell from the 25000 cells sampled (see Fig. 2b). Plotting the cumulative break frequency illustrates the variation in HindIII site cutting efficiency by demonstrating that 50% of the total breaks detected are accounted for by 30% of the top-ranked HindIII sites. Collectively these observations demonstrate a remarkable dynamic range for break detection achieved by INDUCE-seq across three orders of magnitude. This is made possible by the elimination of PCR amplification during sequencing library preparation and the remarkable efficiency of sequencing flow-cell enrichment of labelled DSB breaks. These features permit the accurate simultaneous detection and proportional measurement of both endogenous and induced DSBs within the same sample for the first time.

In addition to breaks identified at HindIII on-target sequences (AAGCTT) multiple 1 bp and 2 bp mismatching off-target sites were also identified. INDUCE-seq measured cumulative breaks spanning 8 orders of magnitude from ~146 M breaks identified at HindIII on-target sites down to the selected cut-off of 5 breaks identified per site at the least frequent off-targets.

Direct end-labelling and data processing also allows the structure of breaks at base pair resolution to be examined. As with other end-capture methods INDUCE-seq detects the precise HindIII cleavage pattern of two semi-overlapping symmetrical blocks of sequencing reads that map to the known HindIII cleavage positions on both strands of DNA (Fig. 2c). INDUCE-seq is unique because it precisely measures the frequency of reads on both sides of a break and this can inform on the mechanism of break induction. Thus INDUCE-seq can be used to precisely measure DSB-end structures at single-nucleotide resolution.

Comparison of INDUCE-seq with an alternative DSB detection method

To compare the performance of INDUCE-seq in capturing in situ restriction enzyme- induced DSBs we identified a previous study which performed a similar experiment using a different DSB detection method called DSBCapture. Whilst the experimental design was the same a different restriction enzyme EcoRV was used to induce DSBs in the DSBCapture study whereas we used the HindIII enzyme17. Therefore we used the relative frequency of restriction enzyme cutting to enable comparison. We found that INDUCE-seq identifies a similar proportion of all possible HindIII restriction sites (92.7%) compared to all possible EcoRV sites (93.7%) as identified by DSBCapture (Fig. 2d). Significantly INDUCE-seq captures >90% of the HindIII restriction sites present in the genome despite using just ~25000 cells which is 800-fold fewer cells than used by DSBCapture. In addition a greater proportion of INDUCE-seq reads were mapped to restriction sites (Fig. 2e). These data reveal that 96.7% of aligned reads were mapped to restriction sites representing an improved efficiency over DSBCapture (81.1%). We also identified ~1 M DSBs at HindIII off-target sequences; sites that differ from the restriction sequence by one or two mismatching bases (Fig. 2f). The total number of HindIII-induced DSBs measured by INDUCE-seq ranged from ~146 M across ~780000 on-target sites (see above) to just five DSBs at the lowest ranking off-target site (containing 2 mismatches) (Fig. 2f). INDUCE-seq therefore detects breaks across seven orders of magnitude enhancing the dynamic range of break detection over current methods.

Detecting DSBs in live cells using INDUCE-seq

To further characterise INDUCE-seq we measured induced DSBs in live cells by using the DIvA cell system13. We confirmed that INDUCE-seq is capable of accurately detecting breaks at AsiSI sites in DiVA cells (Fig. 3a). In this experiment INDUCE-seq detected the presence of breaks at ~230 AsiSI sites expanding the AsiSI sites discovered in live cells compared to the 214 sites reported by BLISS and 121 sites reported by DSBCapture. It is important to note the difference between the raw sequencing output observed between these methods which is enabled by the characteristics of INDUCE-seq (Fig. 3a). Figure 3a (bottom two panels) demonstrates the effect of PCR amplification on DSB sequencing output which uncouples the relationship between breaks labelled in the cell and reads sequenced. This explains the need for some form of error-correction (e.g. UMI correction or DSB spike-in) when using these methods. Importantly this improvement in AsiSI site detection was achieved despite sequencing 40-fold fewer reads than a comparable DSBcapture experiment and 23-fold fewer reads compared to a BLISS experiment1721. This demonstrates that INDUCE-seq is significantly more sensitive efficient and cost effective than these other methods (Fig. 3b).

INDUCE-seq is designed to capture DNA double strand breaks in direct proportion to their frequency of occurrence within the starting cell population. Because each sequencing read obtained is derived from precisely one DSB present in a cell from the starting population this means that the relationship between reads and breaks is unity. It follows therefore that multiple reads located at the same genomic location (recurrent breaks) are typically derived from different cells in the starting population. Consequently recurrent breaks identified by INDUCE-seq are a precise measure of the propensity of that genomic location to form breaks in the cell population being examined. These characteristic features of the data derived from INDUCE-seq make it possible to quantify the breaks detected in relation to cell number in the starting sample. To illustrate this firstly we analysed INDUCE-seq data derived from DIvA cells and observed that the number of DSBs detected at AsiSI sites is directly proportional to the total number of breaks measured in the cell sample (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We found that this relationship is true whether using in silico subsets of the data (red data points) or using experimental repeats with different numbers of cells in the starting population (green data points). Importantly the output is reproducible when comparing break numbers at AsiSI sites across four independent biological repeats (Supplementary Fig. 3b c). However examining the number of breaks observed at individually ranked AsiSI sites located at different genomic positions reveals a dynamic range of 2 orders of magnitude from one break per site to hundreds of breaks per site depending on the genomic location of the AsiSI site as shown in Fig. 3c (bar chart primary y-axis). Next we ranked individual AsiSI sites by the number of breaks detected at them and calculated the cumulative break frequency expressed as a percentage across the rankings (see Fig. 3c scatter secondary y-axis). This analysis revealed that 60% of the top-ranked AsiSI sites account for >90% of the total number of breaks at AsiSI sites as detected by INDUCE-seq. Plotting the data in this way revealed a striking asymptotic relationship (Fig. 3c). This clearly demonstrates the difference in enzyme cutting efficiency at different AsiSI sites depending on their position in the genome. To demonstrate the sensitivity of INDUCE-seq we show that it is possible to detect 38 AsiSI sites that are cut with very low efficiency being detected only once in 400000 cells sampled. This clearly demonstrates the diminishing returns of sequencing increased numbers of breaks on the detection of additional AsiSI sites in the genome (Fig. 3c). This further confirms that not all AsiSI sites are cut with equal efficiency. Others have also observed a similar phenomenon20. Expressing cumulative break frequency as a percentage in relation to break site ranking makes it possible to estimate how likely a break event will occur at a specific genomic location and how many cells would need to be sampled to detect such an event. We note the presence in the genome of ~1200 AsiSI restriction sites based on DNA sequence. However our data shows the detection of 232 sites when sampled from a total of 400000 cells. Furthermore cumulative break frequency plotting predicts that few additional AsiSI sites will be discovered by increasing the starting cell number. It is known that the AsiSI restriction enzyme is CpG methylation sensitive meaning that sites located in CpG methylation islands are refractory to enzyme cutting. These methylation islands are located in dense chromatin regions that are not cut by DNaseI. Therefore we plotted DNaseI hypersensitivity at AsiSI sites discovered by INDUCE-seq (n = 232) and then compared them to the DNaseI hypersensitivity at the sites which were not detected (n = 990). We observed DNaseI hypersensitivity uniquely at the cut AsiSI sites whereas uncut AsiSI sites exhibit no DNaseI hypersensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 3d). These results demonstrate that AsiSI sites not detected by INDUCE-seq are located in closed chromatin which is associated with methylated CpG islands explaining why they are refractory to cutting by AsiSI and therefore are not detected by INDUCE-seq.

Detection of CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing induced breaks

Having established the characteristics of break detection by INDUCE-seq next we applied it to the detection of CRISPR-Cas9-induced on- and off-target DSBs in the genome. This analysis is of central importance in safety profiling for the development of CRISPR-based cell and gene therapies. Following RNP nucleofection of HEK293 cells with the extensively characterised EMX1 sgRNA DSBs were measured at 0 7 12 24 and 30 h post-nucleofection in two independent biological replicates. Cas9-induced breaks were then analysed and as described above ranking these nuclease-induced breaks in order of their recurrence in the sample enables the unbiased identification of both on- and off-target sites simply by virtue of their frequency. This unique feature of INDUCE-seq makes this possible (Fig. 4a on-target highlighted in red). Importantly by comparing ranked break lists for the CRISPR-edited versus the untreated control sample it is possible to identify endogenous (background) recurrent breaks in the genome that are not caused by EMX1 editing. These common recurrent sites found in both samples are highlighted in blue in Fig. 4a. These represent fragile sites in the genome that occur endogenously in the cells examined. It is established that off-target editing induced by CRISPR-Cas9 is in part due to sequence degeneracy of the target site. However it is also known that sequence alone is not sufficient predict off-target editing22. We therefore developed a sequence-based off-target discovery pipeline which is described in Supplementary Fig. 4. This enables us to apply a selection criterion to the sequence-based off-target predictions that takes full advantage of the empirical measurement of DSBs detected by INDUCE-seq. This is achieved by assessing the guide RNA sequence mismatches and break occurrence at potential off-targets to create 32 distinct and partially overlapping filter conditions of varying stringency (Supplementary Fig. 4). It is now possible to apply these filter conditions to discover off-targets in treated and control samples. Supplementary Fig. 5 demonstrates the detection of off-targets across the varying filter conditions used and the degree of false positive detection is revealed by the non-treated control samples when viewed as a function of filter stringency. Supplementary Fig. 6a demonstrates the false positive discovery of off-target detection in relation to these different filter condition by plotting the reproducibility of off-target discovery (False Discovery Rate FDR) as a function of total off-targets detected. Here true positive off-targets were defined as the sites identified across the treated sample group (Supplementary Fig. 5 pink bars) and false positive off-targets were defined as those identified across the control sample group (Supplementary Fig. 5 blue bars). This analysis can be applied to select the appropriate filter condition for off-target discovery for any given sgRNA by selecting the optimal combination of yield and FDR to maximise discovery power (bottom right quadrant of Supplementary Fig. 6a). For EMX1 filter condition 7 meet these criteria resulting in the highest number of off-targets discovered with the fewest number of false positives (Supplementary Fig. 6a highlighted red) and was therefore selected for subsequent analysis (Fig. 4b). This figure shows the break number discovered at the on-target and each of the 60 off-targets detected (Fig. 4b left panel). Detecting more off-targets results in a higher rate of false discovery and vice versa. This explains the selection of filter condition 7 as being optimal for the discovery of editing induced breaks by EMX1 during genome editing in this example. Optimal filter selection will be guide- and cell-type dependent. Figure 4b right panel presents the off-target mismatch plot highlighting mismatches from the EMX1 target sequence shown in colour.

Next we compared the kinetics of break induction during EMX1 gene editing across 5 time points. Figure 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6b and d show that the majority of both on- and off-target activity is observed immediately following nucleofection and during the early stages over the time course reported. Supplementary Fig. 6c shows the reproducibility of on- and off-target editing observed in two independent experiments. When compared to existing technologies we find that INDUCE-seq outperforms alternative cell-based methods GUIDE-seq BLISS and HTGTS as well as capturing several sites that were previously only identified using in vitro off-target discovery methodologies CIRCLE-seq and Digenome-seq (Fig. 5b). Importantly INDUCE-seq also detects off-target break sites not previously detected by any other method (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Measuring mutations at INDUCE-seq detected off-target sites

Finally using the DNA from the samples analysed above we measured the editing outcome at on- and off-target sites detected by INDUCE-seq using amplicon sequencing23. This method accurately detects mutations with a sensitivity of only 0.1%242526. This means that the mutational effect of editing can only be observed at sites that reach this threshold. Consequently evidence of editing is only detected at the on-target and four of the 60 off-target sites that were discovered using INDUCE-seq (Fig. 5c). This observation is in agreement with a previous study using GUIDE-seq for off-target detection23 which identified five off-targets with indel frequencies >0.1% at 48 h post-nucleofection of HEK293 cells with EMX1 RNP (Fig. 5c 48 h). These results demonstrate that INDUCE-seq discovers CRISPR-induced DSBs at off-targets with a much higher sensitivity than indel detection using amplicon sequencing. This observation highlights the need for more sensitive methods for the detection of mutations to accurately evaluate the safety of genome editing. We note that the sgRNA-specific cleavage pattern observed reflects the editing outcome at the on-target (Supplementary Fig. 8a) and top two off-target sites (Supplementary Fig. 8b and c). This raises the intriguing possibility of using the CRISPR-induced DSB pattern to model and predict the editing outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When the series was initially launched we did not have the MSRP/ RCP for the SoCs. At the time the big question was down to price. Now we have that information and it appears as though these small chips are not immune to inflation with a caveat. Let us get to it.

Intel Atom C5000 Series Updated with Pricing Inflation Takes Hold

When we originally looked at the new Atom C5000 SKUs we had a fairly good grasp of the storage-focused C5100 series and the networking-focused C5300 series. Intel will be pushing its QuickAssist Technology in the coming quarters and we already have in the pipeline two pieces showing some of the dramatic offload benefits as an update to our Intel QuickAssist at 40GbE Speeds: IPsec VPN Testing and OpenSSL and Setup Tips pieces from 5-6 years ago. The Atom line has changed to embrace acceleration and that is reflected in the new parts. Still we did not have pricing.

With the latest update we were able to add pricing into the equation and it seems as though Intel is using $213 as the base recommended price for 4-core models and $299-320 for the 8-core parts. That puts the per-core pricing in the $37.38 to $53.25 range.

To us it seemed a bit higher than we remembered so we added these to the 4 and 8-core Atom C3000 series SKUs we had numbers for.

What we saw is that the RCP for the new chips has gone up. Just taking an average of the SKUs above 4 cores in the Atom C3000 line were $20.35 and in the Atom C5000 series they are fixed at $53.25. On the eight-core parts it was less dramatic with the C3000 average of $24.44 and the C5000 average of $38.25. roughly doubled for the quad-core parts and the eight-core parts.

Again a big part of the increase is not just the cores themselves but the other features of the SOCs.

We discussed the acceleration in the Intel Atom C5000 and P5000 Acceleration Including Networking and QAT piece but those accelerators mean fewer PCIe-based components smaller packages but also higher TDPs. Not adding a 25W PCIe accelerator and an extra NIC means that the net costs can go down especially with the C5300 series but the SoC prices go up.

Final Words

At this juncture prices have increased on just about everything so the Atom C5000 series is no different. Still these increased prices will mean more expensive end devices in some classes since the floor to get into a 4-core Atom has gone from $64 to $213. It seems like Intel will need to have something like the Jasper Lake series STH has been doing reviews of recently to provide a lower-cost and lower-acceleration solution in the market that cannot handle $200+ pricing on Atom C series SoCs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Rlc3RpbmctaW50ZWxzLWNvcmUtaTktaHgtaXMtdGhpcy1sYXB0b3AtY3B1LWFuLWFsZGVyLWxha2UtanVnZ2VybmF1dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Testing Intel's Core i9 HX: Is This Laptop CPU an 'Alder Lake' Juggernaut?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/news/testing-intels-core-i9-hx-is-this-laptop-cpu-an-alder-lake-juggernaut on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Rlc3RpbmctaW50ZWxzLWNvcmUtaTktaHgtaXMtdGhpcy1sYXB0b3AtY3B1LWFuLWFsZGVyLWxha2UtanVnZ2VybmF1dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0dQRC1XaW4tTWF4LTItaGFuZGhlbGQtZ2FtaW5nLVBDLXJldmlldy1JbnRlbC1Db3JlLWk3LTEyNjBQLW9yLUFNRC1SeXplbi03LTY4MDBVLjYzMzU2NS4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GPD Win Max 2 handheld gaming PC review: Intel Core i7-1260P or AMD Ryzen 7 6800U?,"GPD has been making headlines with its growing lineup of handheld PCs equipped with hardware fast enough for gaming purposes. Last year alone saw the launch of three such models: the Win 3 Win Max and Pocket 3 each with their own unique designs and twists on how gaming-on-the-go can be like.

For 2022 GPD has introduced the Win Max 2 to directly replace the first generation 2021 Win Max. This latest model is a complete redesign of the first model with even more auxiliary features and faster hardware. Users can choose between the Intel 12th gen Core i7-1260P or AMD Ryzen 7 6800U with integrated Iris Xe or Radeon 680M graphics respectively. Each version is expected to retail for $1000 USD.

The Win Max 2 is unique in its space as it is one of the only 10.1-inch laptops shipping with an Intel Alder Lake-P CPU for a very high level of performance relative to its size category. More information and specifications can be found on its official product page here. This review focuses on the Intel version of the model.

Yep The DG1 Graphics Card Has Been Made To Run on An AMD Ryzen PC,"Twitter leaker 9550pro found a post by Misaka_9993 on the Chiphell forums about the user taking an Intel DG1 dGPU made by manufacturer GUNNIR and using it on a system that is based solely on AMD's Ryzen platform. The test results are surprising because the DG1 discrete graphics cards are incompatible with AMD-based motherboards or so we thought.

Intel's First Desktop Graphics Card Can Now Run On An AMD Ryzen PC But Not Officially Yet!

Misaka_9993 initially sought to purchase the Inte DG2 Arc Alchemist graphics card but accessibility and high costs for the Intel GPU are still relatively high worldwide. The user decided to buy the GUNNIR DG1 GPU offering 80 EUs onboard the first Intel Xe-based GPU released in the second half of 2021. GUNNIR designed the card around the Xe-LP architecture and the card is the first customized design seen upon the launch of Intel's new architecture. Website VideoCardz mentions that ""this should be either Iris Xe or Iris Xe Index V2.""

Intel DG1 series dGPUs are reported to not be compatible with AMD motherboards by the company. That did not stop the Chiphell forum member from taking an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G integrated Vega GPU and an ASUS ROG STRIX X570-I motherboard and combining the three to do the DG1 dGPU work.

Misaka_9993 utilized UEFI and disabled the CSM to boot the system from the AMD Ryzen 7 5700G integrated Vega 8 GPU. From there the system can output the graphics signal through the GUNNIR DG1 dGPU's HDMI connection. This action allowed the user to display two separate GPU-Z windows working together. The AMD Cezanne Vega 8 GPU is pictured on the left while the Intel DG1 dGPU is on the right in the example below.

The Intel discrete graphics card performs far less than the AMD Vega graphics as pictured below in the AIDA64 benchmark screenshot on Chiphell. This configuration is less typical but proves that the Intel DG1 dGPU can run on an AMD-based motherboard even with little work. The output given by the Intel dGPU is not ideal for gaming and is only remotely decent for media.

Readers should remember that the Ryzen 7 5700G supports PCIe Gen3 x16 while the Intel DG1 supports PCIe Gen4 x8. This test causes the AMD card to minimize the bandwidth to 8 lanes instead of 16 lanes.

Even though the cost is much higher the Alchemist DG2-128-based Arc A380 GPU is the next-gen version of the Intel DG1 card used in the test. Also the card is much harder to come by than the Intel DG1 which was the initial starting point for the company to create a discrete graphics card for their systems.

7.8 / 10

SCORE LG Gram 16 2-in-1 (2022) $1185 at Amazon Pros Incredibly lightweight for its size

Long battery life

Excellent 16-inch display

Active pen included Cons Noticeable flex in body and display

Body is a fingerprint magnet

No pen storage

The LG Gram 16 2-in-1 is an excellent pick for the same reasons as past Gram laptops and two-in-ones: It's lightweight it has long battery life and it has an excellent display. For the Gram 16 2-in-1 you'll get a 16-inch 2560x1600-resolution pen-enabled touch display with 300-nit brightness and approximately 99% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. Battery life reached nearly 13 hours outlasting competitors in its class. And despite its size it is compact slim and weighs about 3.3 pounds (1.5 kilograms).

Updated with a 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processor the 2022 model has respectable productivity performance too. If you're looking to tackle typical home office or school tasks on a bigger screen without sacrificing mobility or battery life the LG Gram 16 2-in-1 has you covered. However it does have a handful of shortcomings not least of which is the price.

Josh Goldman/CNET

The Gram 16 2-in-1 starts at $1500 with a 12th-gen Core i7 processor integrated graphics 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD for storage. This is the model I tested and it's currently only available from Costco. LG offers configurations with 1TB or 2TB of storage. The 2TB version is $2100 which is a lot to pay for a storage bump. It does include a $300 portable 16-inch USB-C monitor which is great if you want to double your display space even when you travel. The 1TB configuration is available in the UK for £1733. The 2-in-1 is currently not available in Australia but the UK price converts to AU$3045.

LG is including an excellent 16-inch portable display with certain configurations of its Gram laptops and two-in-ones. Josh Goldman/CNET

At $1500 the Gram 16 isn't exactly overpriced for what you're getting but it's no bargain either. However Costco at the moment has it discounted to $1200 which actually is a good buy and worth jumping on if this model lines up with your needs. And if you're reading this and it's not currently available it's worth waiting for a price drop.

Also despite the premium price there is some bloatware you might want to remove. It's not a lot and a couple of preloaded programs like Wacom's notepad app Bamboo Paper and LG Glance (which uses presence detection for privacy and security features) are useful. But I could do without stuff like Alexa for PC and McAfee Live Safe on a $1500 laptop.

LG Gram 16 2-in-1 (16T90Q-K.AAC7U1) Price as reviewed $1500 Display size/resolution 16-inch 2560x1600 touch display CPU 2.1GHz Intel Core i7-1260P Memory 16GB 5200MHz LPDDR5 (onboard) Graphics 128MB Intel Iris Xe Graphics Storage 512GB PCIe NVME Gen 4 M.2 SSD Networking 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6E) Bluetooth 5.1 Connections Thunderbolt 4 USB-C (x2) USB-A (3.2 Gen 2) 3.5mm audio jack microSD card slot Operating system Windows 11 Home

The LG Gram 16 2-in-1 does have the look and feel of a premium laptop. Well as long as you don't touch it with your bare hands. The matte black finish manages to pick up every last fingerprint and it takes a serious wipe down to get rid of them all.

The chassis is made from magnesium alloy. That keeps it lightweight but doesn't give it the solid feel or stiffness of an aluminum laptop. There is noticeable flex in the keyboard deck and lid (you definitely want to avoid picking this up one-handed by the display). Still as with other Grams it is strong enough to pass seven military-grade durability tests including shock and vibration so it's built for a commute or travel.

You'll need to wear gloves to keep the Gram 16 looking this clean. Josh Goldman/CNET

In general 15- and 16-inch two-in-ones are too big and heavy to use handheld in tablet mode. This LG is at least tolerable due to its weight and the screen's 16:10 aspect ratio which makes it less awkward to hold vertically than a 16:9 display.

The Gram 16 2-in-1 is still best suited for use on a desk or lap in tablet mode and LG includes an active pen if you want to write or draw on the screen. Unfortunately the pen doesn't store in the body or even magnetically attach like models from Samsung and HP.

The display and pen make this Gram an excellent digital whiteboard. Josh Goldman/CNET

The screen also flexes when you put pressure on it with the pen making it a little less enjoyable to use. If you use it in tent or stand mode though this is not an issue. Plus the size makes it excellent for presentations and as a digital whiteboard.

This Gram is great as just a straight-up laptop too. (You might not want to use it on your lap though. It gets uncomfortably warm and there's even a note on the bottom of the Gram to use it on a flat and hard surface.) The backlit keyboard has a comfortable firmness to the keys and a fair amount of travel. The function keys are also mapped for shortcuts: For example pressing the F4 key lets you kill the mic and webcam. The webcam itself is good with a 1080p resolution giving video chats some added clarity and detail.

Both Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports are on the left side. Josh Goldman/CNET

The touchpad is 16:10 to match the display but its increased size and position puts much of it under your right palm. This can lead to accidental brushes or clicks if you tend to drag your right palm while typing. The precision touchpad is otherwise nice to use.

LG skimps some on ports compared to the clamshell version of the Gram 16. It does have two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports but they're both on the left side which means you lose flexibility when it comes to charging and connecting a monitor. There's no HDMI out and only one USB-A port; the LG Gram 16 laptop has an HDMI 2.0 and two USB-A ports.

The Gram 16 2-in-1 doesn't have an HDMI out like the Gram 16 clamshell version. Josh Goldman/CNET

Performance from the LG Gram 16 2-in-1 was right where it should be for its components. (You can see how it stacks up compared to similarly configured systems in the performance charts below.) With its 12th-gen i7 processor and 16GB of high-speed memory it's plenty for productivity tasks light photo and video editing and entertainment.

However it is a champ when it comes to battery life. It reached 12 hours 47 minutes on our streaming video battery drain test with brightness and audio set to 50%. With some power management getting through a workday is possible and the Gram charges quickly too.

Again if your main needs are good battery life a big display and mobility with strong processing performance for productivity the LG Gram 16 2-in-1 has you covered. But I'd wait for a sale.

Hussman has a long detail-packed answer to that question but it can be summed up rather simply: No.

Despite the S&P 500 having fallen as much as 23% this year Hussman — the president of the Hussman Investment Trust who called the 2000 and 2008 crashes — said in a commentary on Thursday that valuations remain at levels seen during some of the biggest bubbles in history.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""At the January 2022 market peak our most reliable valuations measures exceeded their 1929 and 2000 extremes. While the market decline of recent months has retraced the frothiest portion of the bubble market valuations remain near those 1929 and 2000 extremes"" Hussman said in the commentary.

""Indeed valuations remain at levels that were never observed in history except at those extremes"" he added the emphasis his.

To measure market valuation Hussman uses total market cap of non-financial stocks divided by total revenue of non-financial stocks. He says it's been his most reliable indicator for determining future returns. The indicator remains around its 2000 dot-com bubble peak.

Hussman Funds

Hussman also pointed out that gains above valuation norms shown in green below have tended to revert to valuation norms over the last century. Current market gains remain well above valuation norms Hussman showed.

Hussman Funds

Given how elevated valuations remain Hussman said in April that there's a strong possibility that the S&P 500 suffers a 50-70% loss from January's peak. He also said in June that stocks would likely drop 60-70%. He shared the quote from his April commentary in his most recent post.

The S&P 500 which currently sits around 3900 would fall to 1950 if it fell 50%. It would fall to 1170 if it dropped 70%.

Regardless of the severity of the current sell-off however Hussman said the long-term prospect for returns remains dismal and that stocks would go on a ""long and interesting trip to nowhere.""

Another reason Hussman remains cautious is how low cash levels currently are among investors. While investor sentiment is extremely bearish at the moment he said it's not being reflected in portfolios. In other words the capitulation levels that have happened in prior market crashes haven't yet been reached.

""As a specific class of investors it's fair to say that by the end of a cyclical market decline [American Association of Individual Investors survey] respondents tend to have much larger allocation to cash than they do at present"" Hussman said.

Related stories

""Bearish sentiment appears to be dominant among investors but there is little evidence that investors have actually acted on that sentiment suggesting that they are operating on hope that 'it always comes back'"" he added.

Hussman Funds

Hussman's track record — and his views in context

Hussman's call for a 50-70% drop is among the more extreme among strategists but there is a group of more mainstream voices calling for stocks to end the current sell-off down between 30-40%.

Societe Generale strategist Solomon Tadesse who recently with his team studied 150 years of bear markets said in a June note that he expects stocks to end up down about 37% from January's peak.

Tadesse showed that returns after the 2020 crash far exceeded those following past market crashes and that stocks still have a ways to fall before hitting return norms.

Societe Generale

Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson also said that investors are not pricing recession risks appropriately and if they begin to do so the S&P 500 would likely hit a bottom around 3000. That's a 37.5% decline from January's top.

""The bear market will not be over until recession arrives or the risk of one is extinguished"" Wilson said.

In terms of future returns given current valuations Hussman has company in Bank of America's Savita Subramanian. She said in June that most of the bank's 20 valuation measures remain historically extended.

Bank of America

She has also said that the bank's model shows that valuations explain for 80% of the market's return over a following 10-year period — basically valuations are by far the most important variable in determining long-term returns and when they're historically extended it doesn't bode well for stocks' returns a decade down the road. However they mean far less in the short-term.

Still Subramanian also looked at the average declines of bear markets over the last century and her analysis showed that the current sell-off is still the smallest among them.

Bank of America

Investors are navigating an uncertain environment as the Federal Reserve tightens policy aggressively to cool four-decade-high inflation. How high the central bank will have to raise interest rates to help slow rising prices and how severely the economy — and by extension the stock market — will be impacted remains unclear.

For the uninitiated Hussman has repeatedly made headlines by predicting a stock-market decline exceeding 60% and forecasting a full decade of negative equity returns. And as the stock market had continued to grind mostly higher he persisted with his doomsday calls.

But before you dismiss Hussman as a wonky perma-bear consider again his track record. Here are the arguments he's laid out:

He predicted in March 2000 that tech stocks would plunge 83% then the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index lost an ""improbably precise"" 83% during a period from 2000 to 2002.

Predicted in 2000 that the S&P 500 would likely see negative total returns over the following decade which it did.

Predicted in April 2007 that the S&P 500 could lose 40% then it lost 55% in the subsequent collapse from 2007 to 2009.

However Hussman's recent returns have been less-than-stellar. His Strategic Growth Fund is down 42% since December 2010 though it's up about 3.4% in the last 12 months. The S&P 500 by comparison is down 9.7% over the past year.

The amount of bearish evidence being unearthed by Hussman continues to mount. Sure there may still be returns to be realized in this market cycle but at what point does the mounting risk of a larger crash become too unbearable?

That's a question investors will have to answer themselves — and one that Hussman will clearly keep exploring in the interim.",,,,,,,,,,,,
IFF,International Flavors & Fragrances,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXlvbmQtYmFsYW5jZS1zaGVldC1zd290LXJldmVhbHMtMDUwNjA4ODc5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF),"IFF demonstrates resilience with increased gross profit despite sales dip.

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

Technically the park is not gone — but it’s also not quite there. The land is buried under gravel and heavy machinery. Trail closure signs and fencing keep passersby away from where excavators are busy dredging polluted sediment.

Long-awaited remediation is finally ramping-up in Kalamazoo this summer with the onset of dredging at Verburg Park. Work began in mid-June to remove toxic PCBs from an urban Kalamazoo River cove popular with local fishermen and will continue elsewhere nearby for a couple years.

“In the grand scheme of things what we’re trying to accomplish is to address some historic contamination in the river” said Chase Gerbig senior environmental remediation engineer at Wood PLC a British firm in charge of the design and engineering on the project.

Georgia-Pacific and International Paper are removing PCBs which have plagued the river since the 1950s when Kalamazoo paper mills that recycled carbonless copy paper made with the persistent chemicals discharged waste to the river.

Over the years contaminants settled out in areas of slower water creating an expansive remedial site stretching all the way to Lake Michigan about 80 miles downstream. The entire stretch is a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site and fish are under a “Do Not Eat” advisory for all species until the river passes the Calkins Dam.

To date most of the cleanup has been in several river-adjacent landfills and downstream communities like Plainwell and Otsego. Design and engineering for the dredging the urbanized stretch between Comstock Township and Parchment began in 2017. The most recent removal took place in late 2020 when PCBs were dug from a side channel at the old Crown Vantage landfill on the edge of Parchment.

In Kalamazoo the work is focused this year on Verburg Park and nearby river hotspots. The park has been transformed into an elaborate sediment processing area with excavators on barges are using GPS-positioning to dig targeted sections and deposit the sloppy material in dump trucks.

The polluted sediment is taken to the park’s south end behind a big grassy berm along Gull Street where where it’s mixed with Portland cement in a processing area called “The Spa” that features liners and other measures to keep contamination from leaching into the soil. Once drained and hardened the sediment is sent to the Autumn Hills Landfill near Zeeland.

In the water turbidity curtains are being used to control sediment migration during dredging. Sand will cover finished areas and banks will be stabilized with rip-rap when complete.

The federally-ordered project was supposed to begin last year but engineers were thrown a curveball when the Morrow Dam upriver in Comstock Township unexpectedly drained its reservoir in late 2019 flooding the river with an estimated 369000 cubic yards of additional sediment.

Eagle Creek Renewable Energy which owns Morrow Dam is being sued by the state of Michigan over the debacle which has added millions to the PCB project costs.

About 3000 cubic tons of sediment has been dug from the cove since dredging began June 16. A substantial amount of that washed in from Eagle Creek’s reservoir discharge.

“About 15 to 20 percent of the material we’re taking out is Morrow sediment” said Gerbig. “There are spots here with four to five feet of Morrow material we’ve got to take out before we can even do the work we’re here to do.”

The dam which adjusts the river flow to generate electricity is also causing substantial water level fluctuations that Gerbig said creates “headaches” for the dredging effort.

“We’ve been trying to reach out to them” he said. “We’re not getting a lot of daily info.”

Gerbig said plans call for dredging at the Verburg cove to be finished this summer. The work will then move immediately downstream to a stretch north of Paterson Street along the Graphic Packaging International and Kalamazoo Water Reclamation Facility properties.

Dredging at Mayors Riverfront Park will occur after those projects are completed.

Verburg Park will be restored and reopened next year.

“When it’s done it’ll look just like the Verburg Park that it was before we took this over and in some ways will actually be better” Gerbig said.

The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) arose following recognition of the need for a product of this nature in discussions on implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In 2011 a joint work programme to strengthen information services on invasive alien species as a contribution towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 was developed19. The Global Invasive Alien Species Information Partnership (GIASI Partnership) was then established to assist Parties to the CBD and others to implement Article 8(h) and Target 9 of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The Conference of Parties (COP-11) welcomed the development of the GIASI Partnership and requested the Executive Secretary to facilitate its implementation (paragraph 22 of decision XI/28). In 2013 the development of GRIIS was identified as a key priority to be led by the IUCN ISSG and Partners built on a prototype initiated almost a decade earlier (Item 4 Report of the Global Invasive Alien Species Information Partnership Steering Committee 1st meeting Montreal 15 October 2013)20.

GRIIS is a database of discrete checklists of alien species that are present in specified geographic units (including not only countries but also as yet unpublished checklists of islands offshore territories and protected areas) (Fig. 1). The GRIIS Country Compendium is a collation and key product that derives and is updatable from the working GRIIS Research Database that underpins this and other GRIIS products (Fig. 1). Individual checklists are published to GBIF through an installation of the Integrated Publishing Toolkit21 (IPT) and hosted by the GBIF Secretariat. Exceptions include the Belgium (hosted by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest) and U.S.A checklists (hosted by the United States Geological Survey). Data are published as Darwin Core (dwc namespace) Archive files and the terms and structure follow that standard exchange format22.

The GRIIS Country Compendium is an aggregation of 196 GRIIS country checklists of which 82% have been verified by Country Editors (see13) along with revised and additional fields that enable global level analysis and country and taxon comparisons (Tables 2 3). Checklists for the 196 countries were combined into a single file (Table 3). A field was added to indicate which country the checklist belonged to and the ISO 3116-1 Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 country codes are included to facilitate dataset integration (see ‘Usage notes’) (Table 2). A field was also added to indicate the verification status of each checklist (Table 2). The ID field was renamed (originally ‘taxonID’ and now ‘recordID’) as the data now represent a country-level occurrence dataset containing multiple records per species rather than checklist-type data that contains one record per species. In total the data now include 18 fields as described in Table 2 encompassing taxonomic location habitat occurrence introduced and invasive alien status (see also Table 1). This publication represents a versioned citable snapshot of the Compendium (Fig. 1) that is ready for analysis and integration with other data sources (e.g. workflow23 and ‘Example applications of the Compendium’ outlined further below).

Population of data fields in GRIIS

The methods by which GRIIS is populated were described in 201813 and are summarised in brief here. A systematic decision-making process is used for each geographic unit by species record to designate non-native origin and evidence of impact (see Fig. 2 in Pagad et al.13). Comprehensive searches are undertaken for each country. Records are included from the earliest documented to the most recent accessed record prior to the date of the latest published checklist version. Information sources include peer-reviewed scientific publications national checklists and databases reports containing results of surveys of alien and invasive alien species general reports (including unpublished government reports) and datasets held by researchers and practitioners13. A log of the changes to each checklist is available on the GBIF IPT24 with the changes to the Belgium checklist available at the INBO IPT25. The most up to date version of each checklist is thus available via GBIF.org as is a list of all GRIIS checklists at GBIF.org24.

Number of records per major taxonomic groups (c) and habitat (d). The number of species and records associated with invasion impact (i.e. isInvasive) are shown in black. Note different y-axis scales in each case. Full size image

Introduced species of all taxonomic groups are considered for inclusion in GRIIS. Habitats include terrestrial freshwater brackish marine and also host (i.e. for species that are not free-living) (Table 2 Pagad et al.13). The habitat information in GRIIS (Table 2) is sourced from taxon and region-specific databases such as WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species) FishBase Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk and the USDA Plants Database. Typically GRIIS records are at the species level but in some cases other ranks are more appropriate including infraspecies (including forms varieties and subspecies). A separate field is provided for hybrids (Table 2). Where species are present and both native to parts of a country and alien in other parts of the country their introduction status (dwc:establishmentMeans) is included as Native|Alien (Tables 1 2)26. If there is limited knowledge about the Origin of the species its introduction status (dwc:establishmentMeans) is included as Cryptogenic|Uncertain (Tables 1 2).

Two types of evidence are considered to assign a species by country record as invasive (Table 1 see also Pagad et al.13): (i) when any authoritative source (e.g. from the primary literature or unpublished reports from country/species experts) describe an environmental impact and/or (ii) when any source determines the species to be widespread spreading rapidly or present in high abundance (based on the assumption that cover abundance high rates of population growth or spread are positively correlated with impact)2728. Each record is assigned either invasive or null in the isInvasive field to reflect the presence of evidence of impact or absence of evidence of impact (note not ‘evidence of absence of impact’) for that species by country record (Table 2). In the future this information may be supplemented with impact scores293031. Finally a draft checklist is sent to Country Editors for validation and revision (see Technical Validation).

Taxonomic harmonization and normalization

The use of different synonyms across countries to refer to the same taxonomic concept is frequent32. The species in each Country Checklist were thus harmonised against the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy33. The names in each checklist were matched using a custom script that integrates with the GBIF API34 and the accepted name taxon rank status and higher taxonomy (Table 2) were obtained at this stage. Spelling and other errors in assigning species authorship were corrected where appropriate.

To validate the taxonomic harmonisation every name variant present in the GRIIS Country Compendium was checked against the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy using the API33. A unique list of names (i.e. acceptedName Usage) was thus produced and the source name retained as ‘scientificName’ (that can differ across countries) (Table 2). Over 95% of names across all kingdoms matched exactly at 98% or greater confidence (Table 4). All names that were below 98% confidence or had a match type other than ‘Exact’ were checked and modified if appropriate to do so. Of the non-matches (n = 253 those with a match type of ‘None’) most were formulaic hybrid names of plants and animals (~62%) which are not officially supported by GBIF35. The remaining non-matches were names of mostly plants (17%) but also animals (8%) viruses (8%) and chromists (3%).

Data summary

There are currently ~23 700 species represented by 101 000 taxon-country combination records across 196 countries in the GRIIS Country Compendium. All raw numbers are provided to the nearest order of magnitude to reflect the taxonomic uncertainty and dynamic nature of GRIIS (see ‘Known data gaps and uncertainties’). The vast majority of records are at the species level (97.6%) with the remaining present as subspecies (1.7%) varieties (0.6%) genera (0.1%) and forms (<0.1%). In addition approximately 0.5% of records are either named or hybrid formulae. For the purpose of providing an overview of the content of the Compendium we counted species using the accepted species name in the ‘species’ field (for this purpose not differentiating by taxonRank) (Table 2).

Most country checklists include between 100–1000 species; 36 checklists have <100 species and 23 checklists with >1000 species (minimum = 5; maximum values = 5649). On average the number of species per country is 516 (721 s.d.) with the fewest records for San Marino South Sudan and Monaco (<12) and most for the U.S.A France and Australia (>2900). The taxonomic and habitat coverage in the Compendium is broad with 55 phyla 149 classes 630 orders and 2305 families represented across terrestrial marine freshwater and brackish habitats (Fig. 2). Those currently represented include Animalia Bacteria Chromista Fungi Plantae Protista (Protozoa) and Viruses. Over 98% of records have establishmentMeans as simply alien whereas 1% of records are Cryptogenic|Uncertain and 1% Native|Alien (Tables 1 3).

As expected for invasive alien species the Compendium is dominated by plant and invertebrate species and records (Fig. 2ac). Overall 16% (n = 16 221) of all records are associated with impact (isInvasive Table 2) and 22% of species (n = 5199) are associated with evidence of impact in at least one country. Terrestrial habitats have most species and records associated with evidence of impact followed by freshwater and marine species and records (Fig. 2bd). Approximately 15% of plant (n = 11436) and 16% of invertebrate (n = 2300) species by country records are associated with evidence of impact whereas mammal (42% n = 644) and amphibian (34% n = 84) records have higher percentages of evidence of impact at the country level. Over half of the species in the Compendium are recorded from only a single country with 10.5% present in more than 10 countries (Fig. 3a). As expected the numbers of ‘isInvasive’ records per species are lower than the total number of records per species although species with many country occurrence records do tend to have many ‘isInvasive’ status annotations (Fig. 3b).

Example applications of the Compendium

The GRIIS Country Compendium enables the first multitaxon assessment of the most widely distributed subset of introduced species that harm biodiversity and ecosystems. These ‘worst’ invasive alien species (in terms of realised impact across most countries) include wild sage black rat common carp red-eared slider turtle American bullfrog common myna sea walnut and giant African snail (Table 5). To demonstrate key envisaged uses of the Compendium it has been incorporated in Map of Life enabling: (1) multitaxon mapping of richness patterns in invasive alien species (e.g. Fig. 4) and (2) the combination at the species level of alien information along with point observations expert defined ranges and other types of data describing species distributions worldwide (Fig. 5). This facilitates model-based integration of the Compendium data with environmental data to assess changes and trends in species distributions. The Compendium also enables the consideration of gaps and inferred absences of species at the country scale useful for the purpose of surveillance updating country checklists informing risk assessments and for research on the drivers of invasive alien species spread and establishment2336. For example occurrence records for the red eared slider turtle in East Africa the Middle East and Australia (Fig. 5) suggest that GRIIS country checklists for the countries concerned may need to be updated triggering an update to the Compendium. A growing number of publications now cite use of multiple GRIIS checklists accessed through GBIF by use of Digital Object Identifiers37. The Compendium will now streamline and facilitate such multi-checklist applications.

The Compendium will further facilitate international research avoiding the need for repeated multi-country data integration by individual researchers. In support of surveillance and information currency it provides a mechanism for generating automated alerts of risks of new incursions by analysing presence in neighbouring countries especially through development of further workflows reporting new occurrence data published through GBIF. The Compendium may be used in decision support contributing to invasion pathway and impact analyses and horizon-scanning exercises as well as presence-absence inference in risk analysis36. In addition to the GRIIS country checklists available to national governments through the CBD Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) and national CHMs the GRIIS Country Compendium provides a foundation for long-term reporting on progress towards meeting invasive alien species-relevant goals and targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity the Sustainable Development Goals and regional or thematic goals and targets. For example the habitat data included in the Compendium could be disaggregated and used by relevant conventions such as The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the Convention on Migratory Species. The Country Compendium data were also used in the development of the Global Biodiversity Outlook GBO5 and are being used in the IPBES Invasive Alien Species Assessment currently underway.

The Compendium provides the baseline used in the development of the invasive alien species headline indicator that measures trends in introduction events. It provides the key information source for Essential Biodiversity Variable-based indicators of invasion including rate of spread impact and status information614. This includes an indicator for reporting against the draft post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD/WG2020/3/3) Target 5 and associated Headline Indicator – Rate of Invasive Alien Species Spread (CBD/WG2020/3/3/ADD1) enabling the calculation of baseline values at different scales including the country level. Aggregated data from GRIIS now published as the GRIIS Country Compendium have thus already supported multiple research and key policy activities.

Known data gaps and uncertainties

One of the principal objectives of GRIIS is to provide a geographically and taxonomically comparable source of information on invasive alien species. The intent is to collate the taxonomy and use the same approach to designating every taxon as alien Native|Alien Cryptogenic invasive or not (Table 1). These factors have previously been the cause of major uncertainty in collations of information on alien species. Nonetheless a number of known gaps and uncertainties remain in the Compendium.

Taxonomy

Sources of taxonomic uncertainty include multiple accepted names (acceptedNameUsage) for the same species concept - including author variations lexical variants and potentially different taxonomic interpretation from the source. For example the bay barnacle is associated with both Balanus improvisus and Amphibalanus improvisus. There are also multiple scientificName variants for individual ‘acceptedNameUsage’ cases (Table 2). No attempt has been made to edit or match species authorities or reference literature defining the taxon concepts. The species-level prevalence of lexical variants synonyms and infraspecific names used across countries in the scientificName field is 20% i.e. ~ 4740 species with more than one scientific name used ~1520 species with more than 2 names 14 species with more than 10 names and a maximum of fifteen scientificName variants for a single species. Overall 4.5% of unique species names are associated with an infraspecific name. The average percentage of such cases across species groups is ~14% with the lowest percentage for birds (~9%) and the highest for plants (~ 27%) (microorganisms not considered).

The taxonomic information in the Compendium thus includes sources of uncertainty in common with all interspecific inventories of taxonomic information38 including different usage of synonyms across countries that could result in the inclusion of the same species as multiple taxa39. A shortage of editors specializing in particular taxonomic groups within countries is a recurring problem as is the time necessary for editors to conduct and return reviews of draft checklists. Nonetheless the most appropriate approach for harmonising taxonomy is determined by the intended use of the dataset. The Compendium provides both harmonised and un-harmonised taxonomic data in different fields to enable users to select the appropriate data for their use case. The ‘acceptedNameUsage’ cases provided are not necessarily the most taxonomically up to date usage or necessarily the preferred usage of a particular country but this field is included to enable comparisons across countries. For instance Map of Life uses harmonized taxonomic data excluding all infraspecies level records (i.e. subspecies hybrids varieties) to integrate GRIIS data with other types of data describing the distribution of species (e.g. species occurrence data mediated through GBIF or expert range maps) (Fig. 5).

Completeness

Invasive alien species checklists are inherently dynamic and indeed the value they embody is in the changes in the inclusion and exclusion of species over time. Alien and invasive alien species databases and lists are by nature dynamic for multiple reasons including the population and range dynamics of alien species the time lag that often occurs between establishment and spread of alien species outside of their native ranges and time lags between such events and the quantification and documentation of their impacts40. Other biases include those well known for alien species including geographic and habitat bias (such as marine invasions being generally less well known than terrestial ones41 and taxonomic gaps language barriers to information access and collation and inconsistent use of invasion terminology across information sources4042). In addition potential sources of uncertainty and error include (i) misidentification of particular species in particular countries (ii) species listed as being present that have subsequently become extinct or been eradicated (iii) species listed as present based on in-country occurrence records but where the species has not established and (iv) cases where particular taxonomic groups are undergoing rapid or regular taxonomic revision.

GRIIS aims to be a list as complete as possible of those alien species both confirmed to be present and also associated with evidence of impact in one or more countries i.e. of ‘true presences’ of introduced species with evidence of impact. It is less complete as a list of true presences of alien species for which no evidence of negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems exists. In other words its focus is on the subset of alien species most likely to be a policy and management priority7. GRIIS should be regarded and appreciated as an evidence-based information repository designed for the purpose of improving and monitoring change in alien and invasive status and properties. Acknowledging the uncertainties and the dynamic properties of these data (in some cases inherent and in other cases by design) by providing a transparent traceable process of data collation the GRIIS Compendium provides a platform for delivering refining and updating information on invasive alien species needed for global reporting a baseline for ongoing updates and a platform for sustainable delivery of this information (Fig. 1).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvanVsLzEwL3ViZXItZmlsZXMtbGVhay1yZXZlYWxzLWdsb2JhbC1sb2JieWluZy1jYW1wYWlnbtIBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvanVsLzEwL3ViZXItZmlsZXMtbGVhay1yZXZlYWxzLWdsb2JhbC1sb2JieWluZy1jYW1wYWlnbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber broke laws duped police and secretly lobbied governments leak reveals,"A leaked trove of confidential files has revealed the inside story of how the tech giant Uber flouted laws duped police exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion.



The unprecedented leak to the Guardian of more than 124000 documents – known as the Uber files – lays bare the ethically questionable practices that fuelled the company’s transformation into one of Silicon Valley’s most famous exports.

The leak spans a five-year period when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick who tried to force the cab-hailing service into cities around the world even if that meant breaching laws and taxi regulations.

During the fierce global backlash the data shows how Uber tried to shore up support by discreetly courting prime ministers presidents billionaires oligarchs and media barons.

Leaked messages suggest Uber executives were at the same time under no illusions about the company’s law-breaking with one executive joking they had become “pirates” and another conceding: “We’re just fucking illegal.”

On Monday Mark MacGann Uber’s former chief lobbyist for Europe the Middle East and Africa came forward to identify himself as the source of the leaked data. “It is my duty to speak up and help governments and parliamentarians right some fundamental wrongs” he said. “Morally I had no choice in the matter.”

The cache of files which span 2013 to 2017 includes more than 83000 emails iMessages and WhatsApp messages including often frank and unvarnished communications between Kalanick and his top team of executives.

Q&A What are the Uber files? Show The Uber files is a global investigation based on a trove of 124000 documents that were leaked to the Guardian by Mark MacGann Uber's former chief lobbyist in Europe the Middle East and Africa. The data consist of emails iMessages and WhatsApp exchanges between the Silicon Valley giant's most senior executives as well as memos presentations notebooks briefing papers and invoices. The leaked records cover 40 countries and span 2013 to 2017 the period in which Uber was aggressively expanding across the world. They reveal how the company broke the law duped police and regulators exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments across the world. To facilitate a global investigation in the public interest the Guardian shared the data with 180 journalists in 29 countries via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The investigation was managed and led by the Guardian with the ICIJ. In a statement Uber said: ""We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.""

In one exchange Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry. “I think it’s worth it” he shot back. “Violence guarantee[s] success.”

In a statement Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion he was involved in such activity would be completely false.

The leak also contains texts between Kalanick and Emmanuel Macron who secretly helped the company in France when he was economy minister allowing Uber frequent and direct access to him and his staff.

Macron the French president appears to have gone to extraordinary lengths to help Uber even telling the company he had brokered a secret “deal” with its opponents in the French cabinet.

Privately Uber executives expressed barely disguised disdain for other elected officials who were less receptive to the company’s business model.

After the German chancellor Olaf Scholz who was mayor of Hamburg at the time pushed back against Uber lobbyists and insisted on paying drivers a minimum wage an executive told colleagues he was “a real comedian”.

When the then US vice-president Joe Biden a supporter of Uber at the time was late to a meeting with the company at the World Economic Forum at Davos Kalanick texted a colleague: “I’ve had my people let him know that every minute late he is is one less minute he will have with me.”

After meeting Kalanick Biden appears to have amended his prepared speech at Davos to refer to a CEO whose company would give millions of workers “freedom to work as many hours as they wish manage their own lives as they wish”.

The Guardian led a global investigation into the leaked Uber files sharing the data with media organisations around the world via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). More than 180 journalists at 40 media outlets including Le Monde Washington Post and the BBC will in the coming days publish a series of investigative reports about the tech giant.

In a statement responding to the leak Uber admitted to “mistakes and missteps” but said it had been transformed since 2017 under the leadership of its current chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi.

“We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values” it said. “Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”

Kalanick’s spokesperson said Uber’s expansion initiatives were “led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal policy and compliance groups”.

‘Embrace the chaos’

The leaked documents pull back the curtains on the methods Uber used to lay the foundations for its empire. One of the world’s largest work platforms Uber is now a $43bn (£36bn) company making approximately 19m journeys a day.

The files cover Uber’s operations across 40 countries during a period in which the company became a global behemoth bulldozing its cab-hailing service into many of the cities in which it still operates today.

From Moscow to Johannesburg bankrolled with unprecedented venture capital funding Uber heavily subsidised journeys seducing drivers and passengers on to the app with incentives and pricing models that would not be sustainable.

Uber undercut established taxi and cab markets and put pressure on governments to rewrite laws to help pave the way for an app-based gig-economy model of work that has since proliferated across the world.

In a bid to quell the fierce backlash against the company and win changes to taxi and labour laws Uber planned to spend an extraordinary $90m in 2016 on lobbying and public relations one document suggests.

Its strategy often involved going over the heads of city mayors and transport authorities and straight to the seat of power.

In addition to meeting Biden at Davos Uber executives met face-to-face with Macron the Irish prime minister Enda Kenny the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and George Osborne the UK’s chancellor at the time. A note from the meeting portrayed Osborne as a “strong advocate”.

In a statement Osborne said it was the explicit policy of the government at the time to meet with global tech firms and “persuade them to invest in Britain and create jobs here”.

While the Davos sitdown with Osborne was declared the data reveals that six UK Tory cabinet ministers had meetings with Uber that were not disclosed. It is unclear if the meetings should have been declared exposing confusion around how UK lobbying rules are applied.

The documents indicate Uber was adept at finding unofficial routes to power applying influence through friends or intermediaries or seeking out encounters with politicians at which aides and officials were not present.

It enlisted the backing of powerful figures in places such as Russia Italy and Germany by offering them prized financial stakes in the startup and turning them into “strategic investors”.

And in a bid to shape policy debates it paid prominent academics hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce research that supported the company’s claims about the benefits of its economic model.

Despite a well-financed and dogged lobbying operation Uber’s efforts had mixed results. In some places Uber succeeded in persuading governments to rewrite laws with lasting effects. But elsewhere the company found itself blocked by entrenched taxi industries outgunned by local cab-hailing rivals or opposed by leftwing politicians who simply refused to budge.

When faced with opposition Uber sought to turn it to its advantage seizing upon it to fuel the narrative its technology was disrupting antiquated transport systems and urging governments to reform their laws.

As Uber launched across India Kalanick’s top executive in Asia urged managers to focus on driving growth even when “fires start to burn”. “Know this is a normal part of Uber’s business” he said. “Embrace the chaos. It means you’re doing something meaningful.”

Kalanick appeared to put that ethos into practice in January 2016 when Uber’s attempts to upend markets in Europe led to angry protests in Belgium Spain Italy and France from taxi drivers who feared for their livelihoods.

Amid taxi strikes and riots in Paris Kalanick ordered French executives to retaliate by encouraging Uber drivers to stage a counter-protest with mass civil disobedience.

Warned that doing so risked putting Uber drivers at risk of attacks from “extreme right thugs” who had infiltrated the taxi protests and were “spoiling for a fight” Kalanick appeared to urge his team to press ahead regardless. “I think it’s worth it” he said. “Violence guarantee[s] success. And these guys must be resisted no? Agreed that right place and time must be thought out.”

The decision to send Uber drivers into potentially volatile protests despite the risks was consistent with what one senior former executive told the Guardian was a strategy of “weaponising” drivers and exploiting violence against them to “keep the controversy burning”.

It was a playbook that leaked emails suggest was repeated in Italy Belgium Spain Switzerland and the Netherlands.

When masked men reported to be angry taxi drivers turned on Uber drivers with knuckle-dusters and a hammer in Amsterdam in March 2015 Uber staffers sought to turn it to their advantage to win concessions from the Dutch government.

Driver victims were encouraged to file police reports which were shared with De Telegraaf the leading Dutch daily newspaper. They “will be published without our fingerprint on the front page tomorrow” one manager wrote. “We keep the violence narrative going for a few days before we offer the solution.”

Kalanick’s spokesperson questioned the authenticity of some documents. She said Kalanick “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion that he was involved in such activity would be “completely false”.

Uber’s spokesperson also acknowledged past mistakes in the company’s treatment of drivers but said no one including Kalanick wanted violence against Uber drivers. “There is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today” she said. “But one thing we do know and feel strongly about is that no one at Uber has ever been happy about violence against a driver.”

The ‘kill switch’

Uber drivers were undoubtedly the target of vicious assaults and sometimes murders by furious taxi drivers. And the cab-hailing app in some countries found itself battling entrenched and monopolised taxi fleets with cosy relationships with city authorities. Uber often characterised its opponents in the regulated taxi markets as operating a “cartel”.

However privately Uber executives and staffers appear to have been in little doubt about the often rogue nature of their own operation.



In internal emails staff referred to Uber’s “other than legal status” or other forms of active non-compliance with regulations in countries including Turkey South Africa Spain the Czech Republic Sweden France Germany and Russia.



One senior executive wrote in an email: “We are not legal in many countries we should avoid making antagonistic statements.” Commenting on the tactics the company was prepared to deploy to “avoid enforcement” another executive wrote: “We have officially become pirates.”

Nairi Hourdajian Uber’s head of global communications put it even more bluntly in a message to a colleague in 2014 amid efforts to shut the company down in Thailand and India: “Sometimes we have problems because well we’re just fucking illegal.” Contacted by the Guardian Hourdajian declined to comment.

Kalanick’s spokesperson accused reporters of “pressing its false agenda” that he had “directed illegal or improper conduct”.

Uber’s spokesperson said that when it started “ridesharing regulations did not exist anywhere in the world” and transport laws were outdated for a smartphone era.

Across the world police transport officials and regulatory agencies sought to clamp down on Uber. In some cities officials downloaded the app and hailed rides so they could crack down on unlicensed taxi journeys fining Uber drivers and impounding their cars. Uber offices in dozens of countries were repeatedly raided by authorities.

Against this backdrop Uber developed sophisticated methods to thwart law enforcement. One was known internally at Uber as a “kill switch”. When an Uber office was raided executives at the company frantically sent out instructions to IT staff to cut off access to the company’s main data systems preventing authorities from gathering evidence.

The leaked files suggest the technique signed off by Uber’s lawyers was deployed at least 12 times during raids in France the Netherlands Belgium India Hungary and Romania.

Kalanick’s spokesperson said such “kill switch” protocols were common business practice and not designed to obstruct justice. She said the protocols which did not delete data were vetted and approved by Uber’s legal department and the former Uber CEO was never charged in relation to obstruction of justice or a related offence.

Uber’s spokesperson said its kill switch software “should never have been used to thwart legitimate regulatory action” and it had stopped using the system in 2017 when Khosrowshahi replaced Kalanick as CEO.

Another executive the leaked files suggest was involved in kill switch protocols was Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty who ran Uber’s operations in western Europe. He now runs Uber Eats and sits on the company’s 11-strong executive team.

Gore-Coty said in a statement he regretted “some of the tactics used to get regulatory reform for ridesharing in the early days”. Looking back he said: “I was young and inexperienced and too often took direction from superiors with questionable ethics.”

Politicians now also face questions about whether they took direction from Uber executives.

When a French police official in 2015 appeared to ban one of Uber’s services in Marseille MacGann Uber’s chief lobbyist in Europe the Middle East and Africa turned to Uber’s ally in the French cabinet.

“I will look at this personally” Macron texted back. “At this point let’s stay calm.”

The Adjudicating Authority of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has imposed a penalty of ₹51.72 crore on Amnesty India International Private Limited (AIIPL) and ₹10 crore on its former Chief Executive Officer Aakar Patel in connection with alleged violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in 2019.

The ED’s inquiry was initiated on the basis of information that Amnesty International United Kingdom had been remitting “huge amounts of foreign contribution” through its Indian entities not registered under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) through the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) route.

It was allegedly done to expand its non government organisation (NGO) activities in India despite the denial of prior registration or permissions to the Amnesty International India Foundation Trust (AIIFT) and other trusts under the FCRA by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

The showcause notice issued by the ED had said that between November 2013 and June 2018 the remittance which was received by the AIIPL – and claimed as receipt for business/management consultancy and public relation services for export of services to foreign beneficiary – was nothing but the amount borrowed from the overseas sender thereby violating the FEMA provisions.

“After getting a detailed reply from the AIIPL and following the principal of natural justice the Adjudicating Authority of ED has held that the AIIPL is an umbrella entity under Amnesty International Limited UK which was declared to be set up for the cause of social activities in India” said the agency.

However the agency alleged the AIIPL was involved in many activities that were not relevant to its declared commercial business and a circumventing model had been used to route the foreign funds under the guise of business activities to escape the FCRA scrutiny. “All contentions and submission from the AIIPL regarding the claim of the remittance towards the export of services to Amnesty International have been dismissed in the absence of concrete evidence” it said.

As a result more than ₹51.72 crore received by the AIIPL through inward remittances was “nothing but the fund lent by the Amnesty International to the AIIPL to ensure its objectives in the territorial jurisdiction of India which is not accordance with the provisions of Regulation 3 of the Foreign Exchange Management (borrowing and lending in Foreign Exchange) Regulations 2000”.

The ED had earlier attached assets worth ₹19.54 crore in connection with a money laundering case involving the AIIPL Indians for Amnesty International Trust (IAIT) AIIFT and the Amnesty International South Asia Foundation. The case is based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) alleging FCRA violation.

As alleged the AIIFT was granted permission under the FCRA during 2011-12 for receiving foreign contributions from the Amnesty International U.K. However based on adverse inputs from security agencies it was cancelled. Then the IAIT and the AIIPL were formed in 2012-13 and 2013-14 to “escape the FCRA route and carried out NGO activities in the guise of service export and FDI”.

Responding to the development Mr. Patel on Friday tweeted: “the ED is the govt not the judiciary. we will fight it (again) and win (again) in court.”",,,

The awards have evolved through the years. While they used to be selected solely by the editorial team we now tap the knowledge and expertise of a judging panel comprising independent industry veterans and top executives from asset owners across the region to bring greater weight to our awards procedure.

We have also developed more specific criteria with a points system to guide entries and allow for a more structured and transparent process.

Today we reveal the rationale behind the judges' selection of winners for the Top Local Fund Houses for mainland China mainland China (offshore) Hong Kong India and Indonesia which we had announced in April.

The criteria for this category included business growth in 2021 particularly with institutional clients; sophistication evolution such as new markets products or mandates; and key innovations in areas such as services and technology. As with all our awards client testimonials and case studies were given some weight in the decision process as well.

Tomorrow we reveal the second half of the local fund manager award explanations. Congratulations again to all winners.

CHINA

Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited

Invesco Great Wall is fast becoming a fixed income king in China. Already well recognised for it in a competitive market IGW went on to consolidate this position in 2021.

Overall the picture has never looked better for the fund with operating income and net profits hitting record highs in 2021.

Total operating income for the year was CNY4.5 billion ($670 million) a year-on-year increase of 70%. The net profit was CNY1.4 billion a year-on-year increase of 71%.

The overall performance of IGW’s equity investment was stable with excellent medium and long-term performance. Total sales of IGW in 2021 were CNY3.40 trillion and the net sales were CNY203.8 billion.

Among these sales of balanced products with bias towards equities registered CNY331.8 billion with net sales of CNY92.8 billion. Sales of fixed income products meanwhile were CNY129.6 billion with net sales of 85 billion.

In terms of its retail business the issuance of new funds achieved remarkable results in 2021 further deepening its strategic partnership with two banks in China one of which had a new fund sell out in one day to reach a cap of CNY8 billion.

CHINA (OFFSHORE)

CSOP Asset Management Limited

A clutch of great new products and a steadily growing client base continues to position CSOP Asset Management as China’s most successful offshore fund.

Established in Hong Kong in January 2008 as the first offshore subsidiary established by one of the largest Chinese asset management companies CSOP is a leading ETF issuer in Asia.

Judges awarded CSOP not only the Top Fund House in China (offshore) but it has also been awarded Asia’s Fund House of the Year due to its penetration of fresh geographies.

With sizeable inflows from both institutional and retail investors in different markets giving it a diversified investor structure CSOP’s flagship products performed strongly throughout 2021.

Thanks to the cross-listing of its Hang Seng TECH Index ETF in June 2021 AUM was boosted to more than HK$13.6 billion AUM as at the end of December 2021. The investment from onshore China accounted for more than 26% of this.

CSOP also relaunched the CSOP Bloomberg China Treasury and Policy Bank Bond Index ETF in Hong Kong by engaging ICBC as the investment advisory. The relaunch attracted more than $725 million fund flows including investment from sovereign wealth funds and multi long-only institutional investors.

It also ranked among the top inflows of 2021 among all ETFs listed in Hong Kong.

As the largest Singapore domiciled ETF and the largest pure Chinese government bond ETF in 2020 CYC/CYB attracted investment from sovereign wealth funds and regional institutions with AUM growing to $1.45 billion as at the end of December 2021.

In terms of client base this increased significantly thanks to the geographic expansion in terms of both products and business development activities.

According to Central Clearing & Settlement Systems there are more than 500 institutions participating in CSOP’s products in Hong Kong alone representing millions of investors.

Thanks to the new ETF launched in Singapore the number of institutional investors from Southeast Asia grew significantly. Moreover the investor base also expanded considerably in Korea Taiwan and Thailand as evidenced by marketing and sales efforts in those regions.

In 2021 CSOP introduced 10 ground-breaking products further enriching its product offerings. These included future-themed ETFs that covered green energy smart driving biotech cloud computing among others.

HONG KONG

JP Morgan Asset Management

With a submission that impressed judges and delivered “impressive achievements across many areas” JP Morgan Asset Management leveraged its leading position in 2021 to achieve significant growth.

Stepping up its service for Chinese institutions and high-net-worth individuals on outbound investments from Hong Kong its active participation in cross-border programmes between Hong Kong and China is charting a path for other funds to follow.

It is now strategically positioned for the new Greater Bay Wealth Connect Scheme with more Hong Kong Unit Trusts ready to be sold to Chinese investors than any of its rivals.

In terms of sustainable investments the June 2021 acquisition of Campbell Global a leading player in forest management and timberland investing made JPMAM a significant player in this renewable resource aligning with its ESG mindset as a global asset manager.

There were plenty of opportunities too for institutional investors.

In June it also launched JP Morgan Private Capital which includes a new growth equity investment arm and an existing private debt business committed to providing customised solutions for early and growth stage companies across the capital structure.

The fund also expanded its private credit platform with Global Performing Credit broadening its ability to offer direct equity and debt investment capabilities to clients and corporations.

As far as appointments were concerned JPMAM bucked the trend by placing key people in Hong Kong. James Peagam the fund’s Global Head of Insurance Solutions relocated to the city permanently.

The move has highlighted the firm’s focus in the region and its commitment to strengthening its advisory and analytics offerings to insurance clients (particularly on asset-liability capital regulatory tax and accounting considerations).

INDONESIA

Manulife Aset Manajemen Indonesia

This fund returned big numbers. MAMI delivered outstanding growth in 2021 beating estimates quarter after quarter throughout the year.

Deftly navigating a tough investment landscape required strong risk management and the application of prudent principles to deliver these remarkable returns.

A big push in terms of institutional investors – which currently make up 68% of the company’s assets under management (AUM) – saw the fund add 31 new institutional clients in 2021.

Throughout the year MAMI’s total number of investors more than doubled from over 655000 retail and institutional investors to more than 1.5 million investors.

In just 12 months the company's mutual fund AUM grew by 27.3% from IDR49.4 trillion ($US3.5 billion) to IDR 62.9 trillion ($US4.4 billion) far exceeding the industry growth of 1.1% in the same period.

MAMI recorded the highest AUM growth rate in the Indonesian mutual fund industry. The company's market share increased rapidly from 8.6% at the end of 2020 to 10.8% at the end of 2021.

The outstanding growth in the mutual fund’s AUM has contributed positively to MAMI’s total AUM. The company’s total AUM increased by 17% from IDR 97.2 trillion ($US6.8 billion) to IDR113.4 trillion ($7.9 billion) at end of 2021 cementing its position as the leading investment management company in Indonesia among its 92 other rivals.

“I should have gone back on medication sooner in the pandemic than I did” said Leah Bellow-Handelman 36 matter-of-factly. Ms. Bellow-Handelman a nurse who lives in Brooklyn with two small children has been on and off Prozac for anxiety since her 20s. Shortly before the pandemic she had weaned herself off in time for her first pregnancy.

So she wasn’t taking anything when the pandemic struck even though her life was operating in full crisis mode: She worked at the urgent care center at Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan a cancer hospital. The emergency room is dedicated to current and former cancer patients and many of the patients admitted to urgent care had especially severe cases of Covid and needed oxygen or intubation right away.

“We just put our heads down and did what we had to do” she said. “We were in such autopilot disaster mode in the spring that by the summer that was when we really realized how intense that spring really had been.” Ms. Bellow-Handelman also felt isolated; many friends had left the city and of those who remained some were hesitant to see her because she worked in health care.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wood Ducks finished 4-0 at the tournament and defeated Iron Mountain Golds 11-0 in four innings in the championship game Saturday at James Field.

“We played pretty good baseball in all areas” EUP coach Kris Bontrager said. “Our pitchers threw strikes we backed them up with outstanding defense and we put a lot of balls in play.

“We’re a streaky team offensively and this weekend were were streaky in a good way. The guys hit the heck out of the ball.

“We started the summer season the same way. We didn’t score many runs in our early games at the Escanaba tournament but by about the third game of the Mount Pleasant tournament the guys starting raking the ball. All through the order everybody is hitting right now.”

EJ Suggitt pitched four innings for the win allowing just one hit while striking out five and walking none.

“We had the luxury of having both EJ and Garrett Gorsuch available to pitch in the championship game” Bontrager said. “Those are two of the better pitchers in the U.P.”

Avery Wilson Suggitt Garrett Gorsuch and Oden Medrick had two hits each while Ethan Chambers Jack Bachand one hit for the Wood Ducks.

The Ducks scored six runs in the bottom of the second inning to take a 6-0 lead and added five more in the bottom of the third inning.

Earler Saturday the Wood Ducks defeated Ishpeming 9-1. Ethan Chambers and Denvy McCord finished with two hits apiece Suggitt had an RBI triple Ethan Adair hit a double and Cam Labadie had a single.

Matt Lumsden Wilson Chambers and Bachand had two hits each while Suggitt Gorsuch and Adair had one hit each against Iron Mountain. Adair collected the pitching win against the Golds and Zach Hagen was the winning pitcher against the Black Sox.

“We have two more weeks to prepare for the Zone tournament” Bontrager said. “We’re playing well but I don’t think we’ve peaked yet. We just need to go out and keep having fun and hopefully the bats stay hot.”

The Wood Ducks also played host to the Soo Ontario Black Sox on Thursday and had another home game against Menominee Red Wave on Sunday. The Wood Ducks beat the Black Sox 12-1 and lost 8-2 against the Red Wave at James Field.

The win which was Bennett’s second here of the year was worth $1200 to the third generation racer.Norway’s 2021 rookie of the year Wyatt Spade led much of the early going in the contest but surrendered the lead to Scott Stanchina after a lap 19 spin.

Bennett wheeling the Coleman Racing Products 119 stormed past Stanchina on the restart and never looked back stretching his lead to a full straightaway for much of the race.

Gleason Wisconsin’s Justin Mondeik closed the gap slightly on Bennett after a caution flew with 10 laps remaining but Bennett fought off the challenge. Mondeik settled for second place money followed by Stanchina and Fort Collins Colorado’s Jonathon Knee who wheeled the Mike Butz Racing entry to a fourth place finish.

Manitowoc Wisconsin’s Gregg Haese rounded out the top five finishers. “Randy Klitzke prepared one heckuva car for me tonight – it was on rails” exclaimed Bennett in victory lane. “This is the car Johnny Sauter raced to a second place finish here last week in the Stateline Challenge. Even with the yellow with ten laps to go tonight I wasn’t really worried about Justin (Mondeik). We had him covered tonight.”

Earlier in the night hometown driver Joey Pontbriand led wire-to-wire guest driving Ryan Wender’s machine to a $750 Auto Value super stock win.

Defending stock car champion B.J. Schoneck of Marion Wisconsin emerged triumphant in that division’s feature race while Kingsford’s Brent Barglind fought off his brother Brad Barglind at the wire to score the sport truck feature win.

The spectator eliminator feature was won by Kingsford’s Ryan Okler.

There is no racing next Friday night July 15 but the TUNDRA super late model series comes to town Saturday night July 16. The track’s weekly divisions will be in action including super stocks stock cars and 4 cylinders with the action getting underway at 7 p.m.

Marie (48 Photos),"103 teams compete in Gus Macker 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament along St. Marys waterfront for the seventh year

Gus Macker 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament made its seventh return to the historic streets of Sault Ste. Marie this sunny weekend to finish up today at 4:30 p.m. when winners will be announced.

Approximately 103 teams of four from across the state of Michigan over the St. Marys River and as far as Arizona competed in a series of basketball tournaments and competitions organized by Mary Jo DuVall of Superior Health Support Systems.

“They come from far and beyond” DuVall said. “Gus Macker is a great summer event. People vacation their weekends at the Macker tournaments.”

Set up began Friday with official registration later that same evening.

""Opening Ceremonies were held at 8 a.m. Saturday morning and then the games started"" said Gus Macker Broadcaster Travel Agent Lynn Mason. ""This is a small tournament actually but it’s a nice place to hold tournaments.”

Mason said Gus Macker’s largest tournament to date occurred in the 1980s when 5000 people competed in a single weekend. What started as a three-on-three basketball tournament in a Lowell Mich. driveway 48 years ago has since turned national.

“There’s usually somewhere around tournaments a year” Mason said. “Next week we’re in Iron Mountain and Newaygo. Tournaments last through November. We have a new one in October and we are going to Las Vegas.”

All Gus Macker teams are placed into divisions according to sex and age as follows: 10 and under 11 to 12 13 to 14 15 to 16 and 17 to 18. Co-ed are registered in the male division.

Adult teams are computer-matched into divisions according to age height and experience. Anyone over the age of 30 is placed into the following age brackets: 30 to 34 35 to 39 40 plus.

Gus Macker 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament registration fees cost $5 helping DuVall and volunteers rack in anywhere between $4000 to $6000.

Event proceeds will support the assisted living facilities of Superior Health Support Systems including Hearthside Assisted Living Merlin Home Pennington Home Harbor View Assisted Living & Hospice and White Wiles Home.

“We need to say thank you to our community members in Sault Ste. Marie all of our local businesses and the organizations who have made a financial donation to bring this event to town” said DuVall. “It takes money to get Gus Macker to come up here. They come up with a full staff to run the tournaments for us.”

Without sponsorship basketball players would not bring their friends and families to Sault Ste. Marie Mich. to fill gas tanks eat at local restaurants drink in establishments purchase hot dogs from food truck vendors and occupy motels/hotels.

“A lot of people make this thing happen so thank you to all those people” DuVall said to include Chippewa County Sunrise Rotary Club and Rotary Club of Sault Ste. Marie.",,,

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

The deal is worth $10.2 million according to TSN.

Colorado also re-signed defenseman Jacob MacDonald to a two-year contract.

The Avs sent three draft picks — third- and fifth-round picks in last week’s draft and a third-round pick in 2023 — to acquire the 26-year-old Georgiev. The netminder from Bulgaria appeared in 33 games (28 starts) for the Rangers last season compiling a 15-10-0-2 record with a .898 save percentage and 2.92 goals-against average.

“When he was a starter he played really well and he wanted a bigger opportunity and he’s got that opportunity” Avalanche executive vice president and general manager Joe Sakic said Thursday night at the NHL draft in Montreal. “He was looking forward to the challenge. What I like about it he played in a big market. He was in New York. He can deal with a lot of that stuff. We’re excited for him.”

MacDonald 29 appeared in eight games for the Avs this past season. With the Colorado Eagles in the AHL he tallied 25 points (10 goals and 15 assists) in 33 games last season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2JzZXJ2YXRldXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTAvYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItbWVkaWNhaWQtZnJhdWQtZXhwb3NlZC1hdC1mcmF1ZC1hbmQtZm9yZW5zaWMtYWNjb3VudGluZy1jb25mZXJlbmNlLWluLWJhdG9uLXJvdWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billion Dollar Medicaid Fraud exposed at Fraud and Forensic Accounting Conference in Baton Rouge - L'Observateur,"Billion Dollar Medicaid Fraud exposed at Fraud and Forensic Accounting Conference in Baton Rouge Published 8:30 am Sunday July 10 2022

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

To find fraud follow the money” says Dr. Jacob Kuriyan President of Physmark Inc. and Care Maps Inc.

In his presentation at the 2022 Fraud and Forensic Accounting Conference E.J. Ourso College of Business Louisiana State University Baton Rouge the scientist will disclose the results of investigating a myriad of health care data.

“We found fraud at the top of the food chain – in the multibillion-dollar transactions between the government and health insurance companies” says Kuriyan.

After decades of coding software for healthcare organizations Kuriyan has developed highly complex forensic accounting tools which are able to reveal the real costs of medical services.

“Insurance companies systematically overcharge the government for their Medicare health insurance program” Kuriyan states and delivers proof: After we analyzed the data according to the state’s Legislative Finance Committee New Mexico recovered $660 million in “intentional overpayments” in the period from 2014- 2017.

Accurate auditing is vital. Due to increased health care costs millions of people in the US will only have access to very limited health care – or will have none at all. Therefore Kuriyan offers a way out:

“If we get an opportunity to review the data with our CareMaps program the US government will probably be able to recover more than 100 billion dollar from the insurance companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZWFzLmV1cm9wYS5ldS9kZWxlZ2F0aW9ucy90aW1vci1sZXN0ZS9hbWJhc3NhZG9yLWFuZHJldy1qYWNvYnMtaGFzLWJlZW4tYXdhcmRlZC1ncmF1LWNvbGFyLWRhLW9yZGVtLWRlLXRpbW9yLWxlc3RlX2VuP3M9MjU00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Ambassador Andrew Jacobs has been awarded the ""Grau Colar da Ordem de Timor-Leste""","Ambassador Andrew Jacobs has been awarded the ""Grau Colar da Ordem de Timor-Leste""

Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS10aHJlYXQtbWlrZS1qb2huc29uLWhvdXNlLXNwZWFrZXItbW90aW9uLXRvLXZhY2F0ZS_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9tYXJqb3JpZS10YXlsb3ItZ3JlZW5lLXRocmVhdC1taWtlLWpvaG5zb24taG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci1tb3Rpb24tdG8tdmFjYXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene backs away from imminent threat to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson,"Washington — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared to retreat from her threat to imminently trigger a vote to remove Speaker Mike Johnson as House leader after lengthy meetings with him this week.

""Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court"" Greene said Tuesday. She added that the timeframe for following through on her promise to force a vote is ""up to Mike Johnson and it can't drag out.""

She said Johnson was not given a ""specific timeline but it's pretty short.""

Greene met Monday and Tuesday with Johnson as the Georgia Republican weighed the exact timing of forcing a vote to remove him from leadership. Greene said last Wednesday she would start the clock on a vote to overthrow Johnson a Louisiana Republican this week after dangling the threat since March.

But she emerged from the meetings to offer few details about her plans to force a vote signaling that tensions could be cooling — at least until he makes another misstep in the eyes of the far-right.

Greene demanded that Johnson promise no more aid for Ukraine no bill be brought to the floor unless the majority of Republicans support it stripping funding for Justice Department investigations into former President Donald Trump and automatic spending cuts if the 12 appropriations bills are not passed individually.

""I have high expectations and they have to be met in full"" Greene said in an interview with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his ""War Room"" podcast before Tuesday's meeting. ""There is no middle ground there is no compromise.""

Johnson a Louisiana Republican said Tuesday the initial conversation was ""productive"" and ""it was not a negotiation."" He also described the second meeting as ""productive"" and said he was ""optimistic"" about finding a resolution on the suggestions. They did not have more meetings scheduled he said.

""I take Marjorie's ideas and Thomas' and everybody else's equally and we assess them on their own value and where we can make improvements and changes and all of that we do. That's what this is. There's nothing more than that going on"" he said Tuesday morning.

Rep. Thomas Massie a Kentucky Republican joined both meetings. He and GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona are the only two Republicans who have publicly backed Greene's effort at this point.

Johnson has repeatedly noted that he's leading a divided majority with a one-vote margin. Special elections in May and June to fill the seats of Republicans who retired in recent months are expected to help give more cushion to the GOP majority.

If Greene does eventually trigger a vote Johnson is expected to survive the attempt to strip him of the gavel thanks to Democratic support that puts him in a stronger position despite the GOP's razor-thin margin of control. Democrats said they would thwart the effort to remove him after he defied conservative members of his party to support more aid to Ukraine.

Democrats offering to help a GOP leader keep his power demonstrates how far conservatives' unwillingness to compromise has pushed the House toward this unique moment. But Democrats say the move is more about beating back the far right than saving Johnson.

""Our view would traditionally be 'Let the other side work its own mess out'"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries a New York Democrat recently told ""60 Minutes."" ""But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.""

Johnson said Tuesday he expects to remain in power next year.

""I intend to lead this conference in the future"" he said at his weekly news conference. ""I expect I'll be doing that in the future. I'm glad to have the support of President Trump.""

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin."""

When Musk dropped a regulatory filing late Friday saying he was walking away from his $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter Inc. some of the bankers who were backing him felt a mixture of disappointment and relief even with millions of dollars in fees at risk according to people familiar with the matter.

“He did burn bankers for tons of time” said Susan Wolford a former investment banker who was vice chair and ran the tech group at Bank of Montreal. “You have to take this to committee you have to do all the work for something that large.”

While Musk has said he’s walking away Twitter has vowed to keep the deal alive and has threatened legal action.

Many of the bankers had no heads-up from Musk’s camp that the filing was coming with one person saying that for legal reasons the group in the know was kept small. Asking not to be identified because the matter is private they said they had an inkling of Musk’s second thoughts from the first time he tweeted that the deal was on hold in May.

Busted hopes

It was the second time in five years that Musk fielded an ambitious acquisition idea that got Wall Street’s hopes up only to change his mind. In that 2018 episode Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private with the claim “funding secured.”

The Twitter agreement had made it to the announcement stage though with many banks lending their balance sheets and names to his effort led by Morgan Stanley. According to Musk’s Friday filing Morgan Stanley has spent much of the past two months “requesting critical information from Twitter.”

A representative for Morgan Stanley couldn’t be reached for comment.

Fees imperiled

The fee bonanza from the deal is now in peril. Twitter bankers Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were set to earn a combined $133 million in fees once it closed according to filings. Morgan Stanley and the other banks working with Musk were also expected to have a big payday.

Banks and other advisers could still get a small fee even if the deal dissolves—but likely only a fraction of their take if it closed.

Even though they said Musk had lost some credibility most of the bankers who didn’t want to be identified said they would jump at the chance of working with Musk again.

Musk’s business empire is the main reason. SpaceX was worth $125 billion in a fundraising round in May making it the most valuable U.S. startup on record according to data from CBInsights. The bankers who stand to lose out on the Twitter deal still got closer to Musk during this process perhaps allowing them to still feast on fees if SpaceX goes public as expected in the next few years.

Musk owes

“After doing this the bankers can say you kind of owe me now. I didn’t get paid” Wolford said. “They’re in pole position to lead the next deal. He’s informally obliged to pay them with something else.”

Tesla which has a market value of almost $780 billion could also pursue transactions whether it’s M&A or debt financing. Musk’s futuristic brain-computer interface startup Neuralink has also been in fundraising mode and has attracted more money than other companies in the field. Meanwhile his tunneling startup Boring Co. was valued at $6 billion in April.

One banker said it’s hard to ignore the mercurial Musk the world’s richest person even if he shoots from the hip on megadeals. Musk’s personal wealth totals almost $227 billion according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“He’s a once in a lifetime client” said Mark Boidman head of media and entertainment at Solomon Partners. “He’s created some of the most iconic companies of course everybody wants to be his banker.”

While deal teams at the banks toiled over holiday weekends and through sleepless nights to get Musk to the finish line it’s the nature of the business for those efforts to often go to waste they said. Usually that happens before a deal gets announced though one person acknowledged.

Off hook

Some of the advisers were relieved at the prospect of getting off the hook for the billions of dollars they agreed to lend Musk.

Since the merger was announced the financing market for take-private deals has melted down. Banks have been struggling with more traditional technology acquisitions.

The buyout of Citrix Systems Inc. which was expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees could now deliver $1 billion in losses instead Bloomberg News previously reported.

It’s also not the end of journey. Bankers will be closely watching the legal situation play out and haven’t ruled out the possibility that the deal could still close they added. Twitter said within minutes of Musk’s filing Friday that it would seek to enforce its agreement in a Delaware court one that typically frowns on efforts to back out of merger agreements.

Whatever the outcome Musk seems likely to have his choice of bankers whenever he needs them next.

“I would work for Elon Musk any day” said John Chachas founder and a managing principal at Methuselah Advisors.

“He has flaunted convention” Chachas said. “He is unconventional. He has no patience for bureaucracy which he views as value negative. So if people find him frightening maybe that’s an institutional bias against creativity?”

About This Project “Diagnosis: Debt” is a reporting partnership between KFF Health News and NPR exploring the scale impact and causes of medical debt in America. Read More This story also ran on NPR. It can be republished for free.

“My kids had lost so much” said Peters a single mom and mental health counselor. She had just adopted two girls and was fostering four other children. “I swore I wouldn’t force them to have yet another parent.”

Multiple surgeries radiation and chemotherapy controlled the cancer. But despite having insurance Peters was left with more than $30000 of debt threats from bill collectors and more anxious nights thinking of her kids. “Do I pull them out of day care? Do I stop their schooling and tutoring? Do I not help them with college?” Peters asked herself. “My doctor saved my life but my medical bills are stealing from my children’s lives.”

Cancer kills about 600000 people in the U.S. every year making it a leading cause of death. Many more survive it because of breakthroughs in medicines and therapies.

But the high costs of modern-day care have left millions with a devastating financial burden. That’s forced patients and their families to make gut-wrenching sacrifices even as they confront a grave illness according to a KHN-NPR investigation of America’s sprawling medical debt problem. The project shows few suffer more than those with cancer.

About two-thirds of adults with health care debt who’ve had cancer themselves or in their family have cut spending on food clothing or other household basics a poll conducted by KFF for this project found. About 1 in 4 have declared bankruptcy or lost their home to eviction or foreclosure.

Other research shows that patients from minority groups are more likely to experience financial hardships caused by cancer than white patients reinforcing racial disparities that shadow the U.S. health care system.

“It’s crippling” said Dr. Veena Shankaran a University of Washington oncologist who began studying the financial impact of cancer after seeing patients ruined by medical bills. “Even if someone survives the cancer they often can’t shake the debt.”

Shankaran found that cancer patients were 71% more likely than Americans without the disease to have bills in collections face tax liens and mortgage foreclosure or experience other financial setbacks. Analyzing bankruptcy records and cancer registries in Washington state Shankaran and other researchers also discovered that cancer patients were 2½ times as likely to declare bankruptcy as those without the disease. And those who went bankrupt were likelier to die than cancer patients who did not.

Oncologists have a name for this: “financial toxicity” a term that echoes the intractable vomiting life-threatening infections and other noxious effects of chemotherapy.

“Sometimes” Shankaran said “it’s tough to think about what the system puts patients through.”

Cancer Diagnosis Upends Family

At the three-bedroom home in Rapid City that Peters shares with her children and a friend there isn’t time most days to dwell on these worries. There are ice skating lessons and driving tests and countless meals to prepare. Teenagers drift in and out chattering about homework and tattoos and driving.

The smallest children congregate at a small kitchen table under a wall decorated with seven old telephones. (As Peters tells it the red one is a hotline to Santa a green one to the Grinch and a space shuttle-shaped phone connects to astronauts orbiting the Earth.)

Peters 44 presides cheerfully over the chaos directing her children with snide asides and expressions of love. She watches proudly as one teenage daughter helps another with math in the living room. Later she dances with a 5-year-old to Queen under a disco ball in the entry hall.

Peters who sports tattoos and earlier this year dyed her hair purple never planned to have a family. In her late 30s she wanted to do more for her adopted community so she took in foster children many of whom come from the nearby Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. One of her daughters had been homeless.

“Foster kids are amazing humans” she said. “I joke I’m the most reluctant parent of the most amazing children that have ever existed. And I get to help raise these little people to be healthy and safe.”

“My doctor saved my life but my medical bills are stealing from my children’s lives” says Peters pictured with her daughters Braelyn Featherman (left) and Lisha Jane. (Dawnee LeBeau for KHN and NPR)

In spring 2020 the secure world Peters had carefully tended was shattered. As the covid pandemic spread across the country she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer.

Within weeks she had an intravenous port inserted into her chest. Surgeons removed both her breasts then her ovaries after tests showed she was at risk of ovarian cancer as well.

Cancer treatment today often entails a costly debilitating march of procedures infusions and radiation sessions that can exhaust patients physically and emotionally. It was scary Peters said. But she rallied her children. “We talked a lot about how they had all lost siblings or parents or other relatives” she said. “All I had to do was lose my boobs.”

Much harder she said were the endless and perplexing medical bills.

There were bills from the anesthesiologists who attended her surgeries from the hospital and from a surgery center. For a while the hospital stopped sending bills. Then in April Peters got a call one morning from a bill collector saying she owed $13000. In total Peters estimates her medical debts now exceed $30000.

High Costs Despite Insurance

Debts of that size aren’t unusual. Nationwide about 1 in 5 indebted adults who have had cancer or have a family member who’s been sick say they owe $10000 or more according to the KFF poll. Those dealing with cancer are also more likely than others with health care debt to owe large sums and to say they don’t expect to ever pay them off.

This debt has been fueled in part by the advent of lifesaving therapies that also come with eye-popping price tags. The National Cancer Institute calculated the average cost of medical care and drugs tops $42000 in the year following a cancer diagnosis. Some treatments can exceed $1 million.

Usually most costs are covered. But patients are increasingly on the hook for large bills because of deductibles and other health plan cost sharing. The average leukemia patient with private health insurance for example can expect to pay more than $5100 in the year after diagnosis according to an analysis by the consulting firm Milliman. Even Medicare can leave seniors with huge bills. The average blood cancer patient covered by fee-for-service Medicare can expect to pay more than $17000 out-of-pocket in the year following diagnosis Milliman found.

Additionally ongoing surgeries tests and medications can make patients pay large out-of-pocket costs year after year. Physicians and patient advocates say this cost sharing ― originally billed as a way to encourage patients to shop for care ― is devastating. “The problem is that model doesn’t work very well with cancer” said Dr. David Eagle an oncologist at New York Cancer & Blood Specialists.

More broadly the KHN-NPR investigation found that about 100 million people in the U.S. are now in debt from medical or dental bills. Poor health is among the most powerful predictors of debt with this debt concentrated in parts of the country with the highest levels of illness.

According to the KFF poll 6 in 10 adults with a chronic disease such as cancer diabetes or heart disease or with a close family member who is sick have had some kind of health care debt in the past five years. The poll was designed to capture not just bills patients haven’t paid but also other borrowing used to pay for health care such as credit cards payment plans and loans from friends and family.

For her part Peters has had seven surgeries since 2020. Through it all she had health insurance through her employers. Peters said she knew she had to keep working or would lose coverage and face even bigger bills. Like most plans however hers have required she pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket.

Within weeks of her diagnosis the bills rolled in. Then collectors started calling. One call came as Peters was lying in the recovery room after her double mastectomy. “I was kind of delirious and I thought it was my kids” she said. “It was someone asking me to pay a medical bill.”

Peters faced more bills when she switched jobs later that year and her insurance changed. The deductible and cap on her out-of-pocket costs reset.

In 2021 the deductible and out-of-pocket limit reset again as they do every year for most health plans. So when Peters slipped on the ice and broke her wrist ― a fracture likely made worse by chemotherapy that weakened her bones ― she was charged thousands more.

This year has brought more surgeries and yet more bills as her deductible and out-of-pocket limit reset again.

“I don’t even know anymore how much I owe” Peters said. “Sometimes it feels like people just send me random bills. I don’t even know what they’re for.”

Surgeries radiation and chemotherapy for breast cancer left Peters with at least $30000 in debt. “I don’t even know anymore how much I owe” Peters says. “Sometimes it feels like people just send me random bills.” (Dawnee LeBeau for KHN and NPR)

Making Sacrifices

Before getting sick Peters was earning about $60000 a year. It was enough to provide for her children she said supplemented with a stipend she receives for foster care.

The family budget was always tight. Peters and her kids don’t take extravagant vacations. Peters doesn’t own her home and has next to no savings. Now she said they are living at the edge. “I keep praying there is a shoe fairy” she said joking about the demands of so many growing feet in her home.

Peters took on extra work to pay some of the bills. Five days a week she works back-to-back shifts at both a mental health crisis center and a clinic where she counsels teenagers some of whom are suicidal. Last year three friends on the East Coast paid off some of the debt.

But Peters’ credit score has tumbled below 600. And the bills pile high on the microwave in her kitchen. “I’m middle-class” she said. “Could I make payments on some of these? Yes I suppose I could.”

That would require trade-offs. She could drop car insurance for her teenage daughter who just got her license. Canceling ice skating for another daughter would yield an extra $60 a month. But Peters is reluctant. “Do you know what it feels like to be a foster kid and get a gold medal in ice skating? Do you know what kind of citizen they could become if they know they’re special?” she said. “There seems to be a myth that you can pay for it all. You can’t.”

Many cancer patients face difficult choices.

About 4 in 10 with debt have taken money out of a retirement college or other long-term savings account the KFF poll found; about 3 in 10 have moved in with family or friends or made another change in their living situation.

Dr. Kashyap Patel chief executive of Carolina Blood and Cancer Care Associates said the South Carolina practice has found patients turning to food banks and other charities to get by. One patient was living in his car. Patel estimated that half the patients need some kind of financial aid. Even then many end up in debt.

The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society which typically helps blood cancer patients navigate health insurance and find food housing and other nonmedical assistance is hearing from more patients simply seeking cash to pay off debt said Nikki Yuill who oversees the group’s call center. “People tell us they won’t get follow-up care because they can’t take on more debt” Yuill said recalling one man who refused to call an ambulance even though he couldn’t get to the hospital. “It breaks your heart.”

Academic research has revealed widespread self-rationing by patients. For example while nearly 1 in 5 people taking oral chemotherapy abandon treatment about half stop when out-of-pocket costs exceed $2000 according to a 2017 analysis.

Robin Yabroff an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society said more research must be done to understand the lasting effects of medical debt on cancer survivors and their families. “What does it mean for a family if they have to liquidate savings or drain college funds or sell their home?” Yabroff said. “We just don’t know yet.”

As Peters put away bags of groceries in her kitchen she conceded she doesn’t know what will happen to her family. Like many patients she worries about how she’ll pay for tests and follow-up care if the cancer reappears.

She is still wading through collection notices in the mail and fielding calls from debt collectors. Peters told one that she was prepared to go to court and ask the judge to decide which of her children should be cut off from after-school activities to pay off the debts.

She asked another debt collector whether he had kids. “He told me that it had been my choice to get the surgery” Peters recalled. “And I said ‘Yeah I guess I chose not to be dead.’”"

Open RAN frees customers from vendor lock-in and provides cost-effective roadmaps to 5G adoption for Africa’s first and second-tier mobile network operators (MNOs) and communications service providers (CSPs).

5G Open RAN enables new network and business models by leveraging low latency high throughput high connection capacity benefits that help MNOs and CSPs prepare for emerging use cases as well as those that cannot yet be predicted.

“Africa’s top networks want the benefits of 5G Open RAN’s open systems integration and vendor ecosystem. It enables cost-effective migrations that help them expand coverage grow the subscriber base and enable new services” says Wally Beelders executive of Communications Solutions at NEC XON.

Keynote speaker at NEC XON’s 5G Open RAN event in Melrose Arch on 7 July 2022 Professor Brian Armstrong chair of Digital Business at Wits University says 5G is at the heart of the current digital revolution.



“Personal computing and the internet established the foundation of the digital revolution. Then we had 3G and apps that built on it. Now 5G with the internet of things (IOT) data science and distributed intelligence establish the next phase of innovation. 5G Open RAN creates a platform to leverage these technologies to enable innovation and the unexpected which are the advances that we cannot predict we will derive from this 10x and even 100x enabler” says Professor Armstrong.

“The complexity and interrelated nature of open carrier-grade technology requires collaboration” says Beelders. “We have long-term relationships with the world’s leading names in 5G Open RAN and related technologies. That’s why Rakuten Symphony Juniper Networks and Red Hat are our platinum sponsors. It’s why we have NEC and ADVA as gold sponsors. And it’s why we have Airspan Cradlepoint Fortinet Polarium and Veritas as silver sponsors. These organisations represent arguably the leading global community who can deploy commercially viable 5G Open RAN in Africa with us right now.”

Rakuten launched full-scale commercial services on its world first virtualised cloud-native Open RAN mobile network in Japan in 2020. To spearhead the global adoption of cloud-native Open RAN infrastructure and services by mobile network operators enterprises and government bodies the company launched Rakuten Symphony to bring its 4G and 5G infrastructure and platform solutions to customers worldwide.

“We're thrilled to team up with NEC XON in South Africa to empower greenfield and brownfield telco operators enterprises and governments across Africa to easily build and deploy quality 5G Open RAN cloud-native network services at speed and low cost generate new revenue streams and offer customers innovative and immersive experiences"" says Rabih Dabboussi Chief Business Officer at Rakuten Symphony.

“The goal of Open RAN is to democratise the network. It allows 5G network operators to speed up innovation and give their customers a unique experience. An open ecosystem approach to network expansion is at the heart of Open RAN’s culture” says Jai Thattil Senior Director of Service Provider Marketing at Juniper Networks.

“Juniper’s role in Open RAN reflects its commitment to bringing an experience-first network to customers through automation intelligent control and assurance of experience. Juniper is engaged in expanding integrations with key partners and constantly exploring new areas of collaboration. Early customer trials using our RIC technology together with our partner ecosystem highlight the momentum in Open RAN and how its success can address the key business challenges faced by mobile operators around personalised user experience and viable revenue generation for 5G services” he says.

Timo Jokiaho EMEA chief technologist Telecom Media & Entertainment Red Hat says: “As service providers focus on growth innovation and reducing risk they are looking to Open RAN together with cloud-native technologies and processes to deliver greater flexibility and agility. With its open hybrid cloud technologies Red Hat supports the intensive demands of RAN for automated scalability predictable latency high performance security-focused capabilities timing and synchronisation. Enterprise Kubernetes platform Red Hat OpenShift enables the industry to build cloud-native network functions that can scale consistently across a network from core to edge.”

“The clusters of interrelated technological innovation such as AI IOT and data analytics via pervasive next-generation connectivity that uses 5G Open RAN are central to the next surge of the industrial revolution” says Professor Armstrong. “And as with other technological paradigms organisations that lead adoption lead the markets. 3G became visible to the majority of people between 2007 and 2010 when it changed how we interact with each other and businesses. But the leaders had already begun their network deployments between 2003 and 2005. The advantage we can gain today is understanding how we adapt our business strategy and core business processes to capitalise on the benefits.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Let the family know you are thinking of them

March 25 1931 – March 26 2022

A life well-lived and a mother that was very loved. Mary Joann (Jo) Cooley passed away in Santa Rosa CA of natural causes one day after her 91st birthday on March 26 2022.

The daughter of Herbert Spencer and Ida Mae Freeman of Florida Jo Cooley was born in Three Rivers Michigan on March 25 1931 where her father briefly lived and worked before the family returned to their home state of Florida when Jo was three years old.

The Freeman family lived in Ocala Tampa and Miami FL in the late 1930s and 1940s before moving permanently to Daytona Beach FL where Jo graduated from high school in 1949.

In 1949 Jo enrolled in the University of Florida where she attended college before relocating to Baltimore Maryland where she met the love of her life William A (“Bill”) Cooley (September 18 1926 – February 17 2015).

Jo married Bill Cooley on June 28 1953 and the couple remained married for 61 years until Bill’s passing in 2015.

Bill and Jo had two children while living and working in Niagara Falls NY where children James and Karen were born. They next moved Niagara Wisconsin where son David was born and followed Bill’s career with the Kimberly-Clark Corporation to Neenah WI. In 1977 they moved from Neenah to Green Bay Wisconsin where they lived and worked through early 1990s before relocating to Sun Lakes AZ and Redwood City CA during their retirement years.

Jo received her transferred her credits from the University of Florida to complete and earn her Bachelors of Arts degree in Psychology from the University of Buffalo (NY). She then earned a Master of Science from the State University of New York College for Teachers in Buffalo NY. In the late 1950’s she was a social worker in Baltimore Maryland.

After her children were in junior high and high school she re-enrolled in college in both UW-Milwaukee and UW-Oshkosh (WI) to be accredited as a School Psychologist. Jo was a School Psychologist in the DePere (Wisconsin) Public Schools for many years and finished her career as a Psychologist for the Green Bay Correctional Institution.

Bill and Jo spent their early retirement years traveling to China Australia Austria Africa France Brazil Hungary and many other countries.

Both Bill and Jo were voracious readers joining the Great Books Association in Neenah WI and playing on winning volleyball teams through the Neenah YMCA leagues in the early 1970s. In later years they were both avid bridge players.

Jo’s favorite motto was from writer Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”

Jo is survived by son James Cooley of Green Bay WI Karen Cooley Lugerner and husband Jeff Lugerner of Healdsburg CA son David Cooley of Los Angeles CA grandchildren Courtney and Chase Cooley of Green Bay WI and step-grandchildren Lauren Kader and Steven Lugerner both of San Francisco.

The itinerant market has been forced into another move landing four miles away in the parking lot at the Westbury Baptist Church 10425 Hillcroft St. at Willowbend Boulevard where it will be open from 9 a.m.-1 p.m.

“I’m glad to say that they have welcomed us in with open arms” founder Michael Babajanov announced this week on the market’s Facebook page. It’s the fourth location in the southwest Houston area for the three-year-old venture.

“If you trust the vendors and you enjoy the market there should be no reason why you shouldn’t continue to come out and support the vendors” Babajanov said in what he said was a response to complaints about the market relocating too far from the Bellaire site.

Babajanov described the notice to move as “sudden” and created a series of videos this week to keep customers informed. He said he was told a contract had been executed on the old Randalls market in Bellaire precipitating the ouster.

Kimco Realty did not respond to a request for information about the Braeswood market’s removal and the new tenant and Cheryl Bright community relations administrator for the city of Bellaire told Essentials Friday that “No official submittals have been received at this time.”

The Braeswood Farmers Market features more than 60 vendors of local produce meats baked goods prepared foods and specialty items such as coffee wines salsas and honey. Food trucks and live music are sometimes part of the mix. In addition to the Facebook page the market maintains a website http://braeswoodfarmersmarket.com.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Klarna once Europe’s most valuable VC-backed company has confirmed an 85% valuation cut from $45.6 billion to just $6.7 billion following an $800 million round that included investors such as Sequoia Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

Klarna blamed wider market conditions for the drop with Sequoia partner Michael Moritz commenting in a statement that the cut is “entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years.” But Klarna’s massive haircut is also indicative of the challenges facing the BNPL space. Public companies like US-based Affirm and Australia’s Zip have seen their share prices plummet—over 77% and 89% respectively year to date.

“There was definitely a gold rush last year and we’re now seeing a significant cooling off” Cherry Ventures’ founding partner Filip Dames said. “I don’t think investors will altogether turn away from the sector but we’re not going to get the same crazy prices as last year and potentially more down rounds.”

BNPL became popular during the pandemic as a way for users to spread the cost of purchases over a longer period. However rising inflation and slower economic growth have reduced consumer purchasing power and higher interest rates have tightened margins for BNPL providers. The sector is also attracting more scrutiny from regulators over concerns that users aren’t sufficiently aware that they are taking on debt.

Part of the issue is the “checkout button” model adopted by many consumer-focused BNPL players according to Philip Belamant CEO and co-founder of merchant-agnostic BNPL provider Zilch. Under this model the providers rely on fees charged to retailers but increased competition in the space has put pressure on their revenues.

“It’s a race to zero for a lot of these companies” Belamant said. “Everyone has been undercutting each other to sign up retailers and some of those deals frankly could never be profitable for them. On top of that they promise retailers that they’ll approve a certain ratio of people and find themselves in a position where they’re lending to people they shouldn’t be lending to. I’m not sure it’s sustainable and that’s where I think we’ll see a cooling off.”

While the consumer-focused BNPL sector has seen a slowdown in investor appetite VCs are predicting growing investor interest in the B2B side.

Businesses are grappling with ongoing supply chain issues and worsening macroeconomic conditions are increasing the need for flexibility when paying suppliers. In the past few months several startups in the B2B space have been fundraising. In June London-based Hokodo secured a $40 million Series B while UK-headquartered peer Playter reportedly raised $55 million.

“The [B2B] market is very much underserved” Speedinvest principal Olga Shikhantsova said. “The pain points for businesses have always been much larger than for consumers but in a way ignored because they’re more complicated to address. The [VC market] is smaller now but the opportunities are massive in the B2B space.”

Sky News has learnt that Klarna which is based in Sweden is expected to announce as soon as this week that it has secured the funding from existing investors and new backers which could include Canada's largest pension fund.

Sources said on Sunday that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and the Abu Dhabi state investment fund Mubadala had been in talks with Klarna in recent weeks about participating in the capital-raising.

At $800m the size of the funding round is larger than had been anticipated in recent weeks.

The injection of new capital is being undertaken at a pre-money valuation of below $6bn less than 15pc of Klarna's $45.6bn valuation just two years ago.

That would place Klarna on a post-money valuation of about $6.7bn according to one source.

The company's valuation has tumbled in recent weeks with various reports suggesting Klarna's chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski was trying to secure funding at $30bn then $15bn and then $10bn valuations.

Its other shareholders include SoftBank's Vision Fund.

Its fading valuation is partly the result of changing economic circumstances with investors increasingly shunning tech-focused growth companies partly increased regulatory scrutiny and partly the emergence of behemoths such as Apple in the buy-now pay-later sector.

Kroger's dairy sections are full of options regardless of whether you're seeking butter coffee creamer or cottage cheese. The company isn't content to milk its current place as one of the head cheeses in the U.S. grocer industry though. On the contrary it's putting some serious dollars behind building its selection of dairy products even further.

Statista shows that Kroger was the second-leading grocer in the U.S. in 2017 and Zacks Equity Research reports that Kroger has gained more share of the market in the past year. Zacks Equity Research credits investments for improving ""freshness and quality"" along with launches of new items as reasons why sales have gone up 4.1% year-over-year.

Kroger has devoted some of that investment into diversifying its dairy selection with some new science behind the forthcoming products. While Kroger isn't trying to build a better cow the grocer is taking aim at making cows' legacies last longer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYm95LTEzLWZhY2VzLW11cmRlci1jaGFyZ2UtYWZ0ZXItc2hvb3Rpbmctb3V0c2lkZS1rcm9nZXItc3RvcmUtaW4tdGV4YXMvYXJ0aWNsZV80YTEwMjYwOC0xOTEyLTU0NDgtOTM1MS05NDEzMDFmYjIyOGEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boy 13 faces murder charge after shooting outside Kroger store in Texas,"Memphis TN (38111)

Here's why it's everywhere,"New York CNN Business —

“Unexpected item in the bagging area.”

“Please place item in the bag.”

“Please wait for assistance.”

If you’ve encountered these irritating alerts at the self-checkout machine you’re not alone.

According to a survey last year of 1000 shoppers 67% said they’d experienced a failure at the self-checkout lane. Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.

“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all” said Sylvain Charlebois director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.

The machines are expensive to install often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.

Despite the headaches self-checkout is growing.

In 2020 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout up from 23% the year prior according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.

This raises the question: why is this often problematic unloved technology taking over retail?

Making customers do the work

The introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.

Instead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work the model promised lower prices.

Self-checkout however was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66% according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.

The first modern self-checkout system which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.

Customers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.

The technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.

But self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.

It took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.

“The rationale was economics based and not focused on the customer” Charlebois said. “From the get go customers detested them.”

A 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”

The mixed response led some grocery chains including Costco (COST) Albertsons and others to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.

“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes coupons payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.

The move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.

Retailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision said Christopher Andrews a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”

Although self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs he said.

Self-checkout Andrews added “delivers none of what it promises.”

In the biggest headache for store owners self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.

“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout losses would be 77% higher” than average according to Adrian Beck an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.

Customers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.

Some products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce including fruit and meat typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.

“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”

Other customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak) scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.

Stores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors requiring store employees to intervene.

“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience” Beck said.

Self-checkout is here to stay

Despite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners the trend is only growing.

Walmart (WMT) Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.

It may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.

Stores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers even though there’s little evidence to support that. But because customers are doing the work rather than waiting in line the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.

Store owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.

“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it you look like an idiot if you don’t have it” said David D’Arezzo a former executive at Dollar General Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”

Covid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.

During the pandemic many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers. And challenges hiring and retaining workers have led stores to rely on the machines more heavily to get customers through the door.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY3czOS5jb20vY3czOS9idXJucy1vcmlnaW5hbC1iYXItYi1xdWUtb3BlbnMtbmV3LWJpc3Ryby1sb2NhdGlvbi1pbi1wZWFybGFuZC_SAVlodHRwczovL2N3MzkuY29tL2N3MzkvYnVybnMtb3JpZ2luYWwtYmFyLWItcXVlLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1iaXN0cm8tbG9jYXRpb24taW4tcGVhcmxhbmQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burns Original Bar-B-Que opens new Bistro location in Pearland,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://cw39.com/cw39/burns-original-bar-b-que-opens-new-bistro-location-in-pearland/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY3czOS5jb20vY3czOS9idXJucy1vcmlnaW5hbC1iYXItYi1xdWUtb3BlbnMtbmV3LWJpc3Ryby1sb2NhdGlvbi1pbi1wZWFybGFuZC_SAVlodHRwczovL2N3MzkuY29tL2N3MzkvYnVybnMtb3JpZ2luYWwtYmFyLWItcXVlLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1iaXN0cm8tbG9jYXRpb24taW4tcGVhcmxhbmQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2RldHJvaXQuY29tL2hpc3RvcmljYWwtc2lkZW5vdGUvd2hhdC1ldmVyLWhhcHBlbmVkLWZhcm1lci1qYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What ever happened to Farmer Jack?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainsdetroit.com/historical-sidenote/what-ever-happened-farmer-jack on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2RldHJvaXQuY29tL2hpc3RvcmljYWwtc2lkZW5vdGUvd2hhdC1ldmVyLWhhcHBlbmVkLWZhcm1lci1qYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The impediments were substantial for the team from the American company L3Harris which also had experience with spyware technology. They started with the uncomfortable fact that the United States government had put NSO on a blacklist just months earlier because the Israeli firm’s spyware called Pegasus had been used by other governments to penetrate the phones of political leaders human rights activists and journalists.

Pegasus is a “zero-click” hacking tool that can remotely extract everything from a target’s mobile phone including messages contacts photos and videos without the user having to click on a phishing link to give it remote access. It can also turn the mobile phone into a tracking and recording device.

That's according to a new bombshell report from the New York Times.

L3 Harris abandoned negotiations with NSO Group after their talks were widely reported in June.

Since November 2021 the Biden Administration has blacklisted NSO Group on the Commerce Department's Entity List barring US companies from doing business with the Israeli firm.

The Times report cites five people familiar with the negotiations in reporting that multiple US intelligence agencies were supportive of L3 Harris' deal with NSO Group.

That support was conditional on NSO Group allowing for their 'zero days' technology a piece of tech that allows Pegasus to hack into cell phones to be sold to the so-called other members of Five Eyes an intelligence community featuring the US along with Canada Britain Australia and New Zealand.

Speaking to the Washington Post an anonymous US government official said that after the reports of the talks were made public an L3 Harris representative told the Biden administration that the talks were off.

When the attempted L3 Harris deal was reported the White House said in a statement that the company's deal could 'pose a serious counterintelligence and security risk to U.S. personnel and systems.'

The Biden Administration accused Pegasus of being 'misused around the world to enable human rights abuses including to target journalists human rights activists or others perceived as dissidents and critics.'

L3Harris is a Melbourne Florida based defense contractor who counts the Department of Defense as their biggest client

According to the Times reporting that statement caught L3Harris off guard.

That's despite the company knowing that there would be 'definitive pushback' from within the intelligence community according to The Guardian.

A statement on the todays reports from the US government published in the Washington Post reads: 'We are unaware of any indications of support or involvement from anyone in a decision-making policymaking or senior role.'

It continued: 'The U.S. Government was not involved in and did not support or attempt to facilitate any reported potential transaction involving a foreign commercial surveillance software company on the Department of Commerce's Entity List. In fact the intelligence community expressed concerns after learning about the possibility of the sale which informed the administration's concerns.'

Lockdown Mode will be released this autumn with iOS 16 the tech giant's new software update

Earlier in July Apple announced a new 'Lockdown Mode' for iPhones iPads and Macs to protect against Pegasus-style cyber attacks.

Lockdown Mode is an optional protection for users who face 'grave targeted threats to their digital security' like journalists and activists Apple said.

When a device is in Lockdown Mode apps websites and features are restricted for security reasons and others are completely disabled.

For example most message attachment types in the Messages app other than images are blocked and other features like link previews are disabled.

Incoming invitations and service requests including FaceTime calls are blocked if the user has not previously sent the initiator a call or request.

The new mode also blocks access to an iPhone when it is connected to a computer or accessory.

Lockdown Mode will be released this autumn with iOS 16 the tech giant's new software update announced last month.

US government agencies were contacted by the NSO Group an Israeli cyberweapons firm multiple times between 2019 and last summer over a possible deal involving Pegasus according to the New York Times Magazine.

The firm which has been accused of aiding human rights abuses in nations across the globe demonstrated a new system called 'Phantom' during a presentation to officials in Washington that could hack into any phone nationwide.

While the country's top law enforcement agency ultimately did not purchase or procure the spyware software an FBI spokesperson told the Times that investment in such technologies not only helps to 'combat crime' but also apparently can 'protect both the American people and our civil liberties.'

The $240 million construction project comes after the company raised its stake in Lamb Weston Alimentos Modernos SA a joint venture with Sociedad Comercial del Plata in Argentina increasing to 90% from 50%.

“Our investment in a new french fry processing facility demonstrates our continued confidence in the growing global market for frozen french fries and our commitment to serving our customers in Argentina and the broader South American market” said Tom Werner president and chief executive officer of Lamb Weston. “We’re grateful for the partnership of Sociedad Comercial del Plata and the expertise they’ve shared over the last three years. We felt it was the right time to increase our interest in the joint venture and we look forward to continuing to work with them as we expand in the region.”

The new facility is expected to add 250 new jobs and should be completed in 2024. The increased production capacity will add to the 70000 tonnes of finished goods produced in the joint venture’s existing facility in Munro Buenos Aires Argentina.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81NzQ4Ny1jb25hZ3JhLXN3aW5ncy10by1sb3NzLW9uLWltcGFpcm1lbnQtY2hhcmdlcy1zdXBwbHktZGlzcnVwdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conagra swings to loss on impairment charges supply disruptions,"CHICAGO — Several unexpected issues affected Conagra Brands Inc.’s first-quarter results. The issues masked what otherwise was a positive quarter for the company.

During the quarter the company reorganized its reporting structure for certain brands within its Refrigerated and Frozen business unit. As part of the changes the company recorded a $386 million goodwill and brand impairment charge with $244 million associated with its Bird’s Eye business.

Adding to the pressure were supply chain disruptions in the Foodservice and canned chili businesses.

“In our Foodservice business we identified an off-spec finished good issue while producing product for a customer” said Sean M. Connolly president and chief executive officer during an Oct. 6 call to discuss first-quarter results. “We disposed of the product and lost manufacturing time during our diagnostic. This pulled sales and gross margin below where they should have been.”

The company also identified canned chili product that was off spec had to be disposed of and led to lost inventory.

“While production is now back up and running properly the lost inventory effect will linger into Q2 impacting volumes and margins” Mr. Connolly said. “The point is these types of challenges can result in downtime needed to determine and solve the root cause of the issue as well as proper testing to ramp production back up. That lost time can result in higher costs and less production.”

Mr. Connolly added that there is clear progress in Conagra’s supply chain as well as in the supply chains of the company’s peers with service levels improving and productivity tracking well. But they are “not flawless” and will remain “dynamic” for the foreseeable future

For the quarter ended Aug. 28 Conagra Brands recorded a loss of $78 million down significantly from the year before when the company earned $235 million equal to 49¢ per share on the common stock.

Quarterly sales rose to $2.9 billion from $2.7 billion the year prior.

“We continued to gain market share at the total portfolio level particularly within our strategic frozen and snacks domains and drove solid profit improvement during the quarter” Mr. Connolly said. “We also saw another strong performance from Ardent Mills as effective management enabled the joint venture to continue capitalizing on volatility in the wheat markets.”

Conagra’s adjusted net income increased 14% to $275 million or 57¢ per share according to the company. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in gross profit and the performance from the company's Ardent Mills joint venture.

The company raised prices in fiscal 2022 and continued to do so during the first quarter.

“As you would expect pricing has driven some volume elasticities both for Conagra and the overall industry” Mr. Connolly said. “This tends to be most acute in the immediate aftermath of new pricing and wanes over time as consumers adjust.”

He added that Conagra’s net elasticities have remained “nearly flat” over the past few quarters.

“What you should expect in a super cycle of pricing like we've seen right now is that there will be modest short-term impacts on household penetration as consumers defer purchases” Mr. Connolly said. “And that's kind of — you see it really show up in the shopping data when people — their big trips become smaller trips and they postpone purchases and their buying rate will drop a bit.”

Conagra Brands plans to continue raising prices in the second and third quarters.

“We continue to expect the inflationary environment to persist but moderate through calendar year '23 which will result in a low teens inflation rate for our fiscal year '23 weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year” said David S. Marberger chief financial officer. “We also expect previously communicated pricing actions in light of these costs to become effective early in the second quarter likely causing volume to decline.

“We recently communicated some additional pricing that will be effective in Q3. However the magnitude will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price as needed to manage future volatility.”

The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2023 guidance of organic net sales growth between 4% to 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 1% to 5% over fiscal 2022. But management is expecting continued supply chain inefficiencies and incremental volume weakness as prices are raised. It was also noted that despite the strong performance of the Ardent Mills joint venture during the quarter the elevated level is not expected to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.",,,,,,,,,
LVS,Las Vegas Sands,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYXZlbC1oZWFsdGgtY2hpbmEtYXNpYS0yM2FhOWJkODUwNTJiNTZkNDk3MmZmNjQzNTE1ZTEzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Las Vegas of Asia' tells casinos to grow beyond gambling,"BEIJING (AP) — Losing money due to COVID the American casino giants that helped make Macao the “Las Vegas of Asia” face a fresh challenge: The tiny Chinese territory wants them to help reduce its reliance on gambling by paying to build theme parks and other attractions.

The former Portuguese colony stayed out of business decisions for decades and now is aligning with official strategy on China’s mainland where foreign companies are required to help pay for the ruling Communist Party’s development ambitions profitable or not.

The licenses of MGM Resorts Las Vegas Sands Wynn Resorts and three Chinese rivals that invested billions of dollars in Macao expire in December. Rules released in early July say any that want to operate over the next 10-year period face an added requirement to invest in “non-gaming projects.”

Casinos face still more financial pressure after they were ordered to close this week along with most other businesses while Macao tries to control a renewed coronavirus outbreak. They already were operating under rules imposed in late June that limited the number of their employees to 10% of normal.

Financial analysts expect the Americans to get licenses but the government says bidding is open to anyone.

The territory of 700000 people crowded onto a 30-square-kilometer (12-square-mile) peninsula jutting into the South China Sea near Hong Kong is the biggest global center for gambling but is under pressure from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government to rely less on its dominant industry.

Beijing wants theme parks entertainment and conventions to attract more non-Chinese visitors. Even before tourist travel was shut down to fight COVID in 2020 the mainland was trying to limit the flow of gamblers across the fenced boundary that separates Macao from Guangdong province.

Macao is “dedicated to steering the composition of industries towards adequate diversification” said its economy secretary Lei Wai Nong at a May 31 government meeting.

An added complication for the Americans: Relations between Xi’s government and Washington are strained by disputes over trade technology human rights and other irritants. Other companies have been hit by retaliation for U.S. tariff hikes but Macao casinos haven’t been targeted.

“There is a high risk that at least one if not two may not get a new concession” said Ben Lee managing partner of IGamiX a gambling industry consulting firm in Macao. “Why would 50% of such a dominant industry in Macao be ceded to foreigners particularly Americans?”

Pressure for change comes as Macao faces growing competition for potential non-Chinese gamblers from casinos in Singapore Malaysia and Cambodia.

Financial analysts expect MGM Sands and Wynn to be approved for licenses due to the jobs and tax revenue they generate. Their casino hotels with thousands of employees soar above the narrow lanes of Macao’s centuries-old city center and Cotai a strip of land reclaimed from the sea.

Still the risk an established operator might fail to receive a license “should not be ignored” Fitch Ratings said in a June 16 report.

The Chinese competitors include SJM Holding part of the empire of the late Stanley Ho a competitive ballroom dancer and Macao’s “King of Gambling” who had a four-decade government-granted monopoly on casinos until 2001. SJM is run by Ho’s daughter Pansy.

The others are Melco International run by Ho’s son Lawrence and Galaxy Entertainment Group.

The decision to allow in foreign-owned casinos in 2002 brought a flood of money to Macao once best known in China for its Portuguese-style egg tarts and billions of dollars in profit to their operators. In total the six license holders operate 41 casinos.

Annual revenue from slot machines dice tables and other games peaked at $45 billion in 2013. That was equal to $65000 for each man woman and child in Macao and more than triple Nevada’s 2021 revenue of $13.5 billion.

But revenue was sliding even before COVID hit in 2020. Beijing was tightening controls on how often mainland gamblers could visit. Curbs were imposed on financial transfers to Macao in a crackdown on money laundering and tax evasion.

By 2019 before the pandemic gambling revenue had sunk 19% from 2013′s level to $36.4 billion. In 2020 it collapsed a further 80% to just $7.6 billion. Last year revenue climbed back to $10.8 billion but that is down 75% from 2013.

Macao’s economy possibly the world’s most tourism-dependent has shrunk by half since 2019 according to government data.

The government has appealed to casino operators to avoid laying off employees.

Macao’s appeal is so powerful that Las Vegas Sands Corp. traditionally the biggest global casino operator by revenue sold its namesake Las Vegas hotel in 2021 to wager everything on its six Macao properties and one in Singapore.

The company has invested an estimated $13 billion in Macao. It is in the midst of a $2.2 billion overhaul of one of its hotels.

Betting so heavily on Asia however meant Sands suffered the biggest COVID hit. The company reported a first-quarter loss of $478 million. Revenue fell 21% from a year earlier to $943 million.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. said revenue at its two Macao casinos fell but its Las Vegas properties helped to limit its overall loss to $183.3 million on revenue of $953.3 million temporarily putting it ahead of Sands.

MGM Resorts said its first-quarter revenue of $268 million in Macao was down 76% compared with the pre-outbreak level of $734 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Adding non-gambling assets would make Macao more like Las Vegas where casinos try to attract families and non-gamblers with roller coasters music shopping centers art exhibits and water parks.

SJM operates a zip line and indoor skydiving attractions. It has dropped an earlier proposal for a Hello Kitty theme park. The tycoon behind Galaxy talked about a possible theme park resembling the movie “Avatar” but it never went ahead.

“Entertainment and theme parks are costly to run with questionable returns” said Lee.

Regulators need to craft investment requirements “very carefully” Lee said. “You can’t force concessionaires to invest in theme parks and entertainment without a return unless it is in black and white.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL21hY2FvLXRvLXNodXR0ZXItY2FzaW5vcy1mb3ItYS13ZWVr0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvbWFjYW8tdG8tc2h1dHRlci1jYXNpbm9zLWZvci1hLXdlZWsuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Macao to shutter casinos for a week,"Players looking to gamble in Macao will have to find another way to get their fix as all its casinos will close for a week starting Monday.

A COVID-19 outbreak has Macao largely restricting people to their homes.

The virus has infected more than 1400 people in the past three weeks.

All businesses have been ordered to shut with the only exceptions being for supermarkets and essential services.

Residents must stay home unless they fit into food shopping or essential categories.

Macao a semi-autonomous Chinese region like nearby Hong Kong is following a version of China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy.

That involves locking down buildings that have cases and conducting repeated rounds of mass testing to find and isolate infected individuals.

Macao is facing its first sizable outbreak of the pandemic. The city of 680000 people recorded 93 new cases on Saturday bringing the total in the ongoing outbreak to 1467.

Though they haven't released any original music this millennium Rage Against the Machine sound more urgently relevant than when they debuted 30 years ago.

In their first show together in 11 years Zach De La Rocha and co. played all the hits but kept their most provocative messages for a video screen onstage such as a direct jab at the recent gutting of Roe v. Wade: ""Abort the Supreme Court.""

At the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in Wisconsin on July 9 Rage channeled their well... rage into not just their music but the videos accompanying them — eschewing speeches for some powerful imagery.

""Forced birth in a country that is the only wealthy country in the world without any guaranteed paid parental leave at the national level"" began a series of captions flashing across the screen. ""Forced birth in a country where Black birth-givers experience maternal mortality two to three times higher than that of white birth-givers. Forced birth in a country where gun violence is the number one cause of death among children and teenagers.""

The captions culminated in the call to ""abort"" SCOTUS in all caps.

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel other clips shown included ""a border patrol agent posing menacingly with a barking German Shepherd; an El Paso police van burning in slow motion; a boy with a ski mask kneeling in front of a bull; and a boy with a blindfold busting open a piñata that looked like an ICE agent.""

Rage donated $475000 from tickets proceeds from the Alpine Valley show and two shows in Chicago to reproductive rights organizations in Wisconsin and Illinois.

After releasing their last album of originals with 1999's The Battle of Los Angeles Rage Against the Machine broke up the following year with De La Rocha's departure. Various side projects later the members of Rage occasionally reunited for a gig or two over the years. Their last live performance together was at 2011's L.A. Rising festival. The band had planned to make a comeback two years ago ahead of the presidential election but ... something happed in 2020 ...not sure what but Rage had to postpone their reunion.

And in the intervening years well there has been quite a bit at which to rage. At Alpine Valley during their 1992 anti-police brutality anthem ""Killing in the Name"" De La Rocha changed the lyrics to reflect the complicity of politicians adding that they are ""the same that burn crosses.""

One Direction announced they were going on a hiatus in 2015 leaving their fans absolutely devastated. Less than a year later in 2016 the band then confirmed that they were completely splitting up. Since then a reunion has been spoken about frequently by punters Directioners and the band themselves. Harry Styles has mostly stayed out of the conversation - until now. He has revealed how ""nice"" a reunion would be but there are some caveats.

Harry is easily the most popular former 1D member around. The star has not only had three exceptional number-one solo albums but his acting career has exploded in Hollywood.

Later this year two of his big-budget movies will hit cinemas: Don't Worry Darling and My Policeman. In a rare interview he has now spoken about the elephant in the room: Would he go back to One Direction?

Harry at first said he ""didn't know"" how he would feel about the band getting back together. Then he added: ""The thought of it is really nice."" However Harry did hint that it was not something he wanted to explore at this moment in time.

This article was published 08/07/2022 (669 days ago) so information in it may no longer be current.

The Rogers outage notwithstanding online event ticketing platforms have made it such that there is no such thing as a sold-out event anymore.

Anyone can buy a ticket for any event anywhere in the world even if it’s happening tomorrow. It just depends on how much you’re willing to pay.

While that’s just as true for concerts or NHL games in Winnipeg as it is anywhere else the difference in Manitoba is that you will have to turn to the online grey market.

Mike Sudoma / Winnipeg Free Press Files Winnipeg Jets fans take in a Jets-Capitals game in February 2020. Event-goers at Bell MTS Place who want to buy tickets to a sold-out show must turn to an online grey market as the province’s laws still forbid reselling tickets for over list price.

The online secondary marketplace for event tickets has evolved to eliminate the presence of sketchy scalpers lurking around the corner from the venue with tickets for sale.

Manitoba is the only place in North America that does not have such a safe environment and it is still technically illegal to sell event tickets above the list price in this province.

According to Kevin Donnelly senior vice-president venues & entertainment at True North Sports & Entertainment Winnipeg is the only one of the 32 NHL cities with such a law in place.

“Manitoba is an island in North America” Donnelly said. “We’re not keeping pace with what is happening in the industry and what other regions have done to try to corral it in terms of the resale of tickets.”

Trevor Allin the executive vice-president of Ticketmaster said Manitoba is the only jurisdiction in all of Canada and the U.S. with such a law.

That Manitoba law was revised in 2018 eliminating the penalty but the law has remained on the books.

What that means is that in Manitoba Jets season ticket holders who for whatever reason want to sell tickets for some of the games and believe the demand is greater than the supply for that game cannot post those tickets for sale on Ticketmaster at a price greater than the list price.

“Ticketmaster and True North partner to sell everything in the venues they operate and provide Manitobans with a safe ticketing service for all the events in their venues” Allin said. “Other provinces and states allow for the safe buying and selling of tickets above face value. Manitoba does not.”

The fact that the punitive repercussions may be non-existent is beside the point for Ticketmaster.

“We just follow the law” Allin said.

While Donnelly wants his customers to have the same freedom to sell high demand tickets as they do in other cities in North America the situation in Manitoba also curtails True North’s ability to earn modest commission revenues on those secondary market sales as well access to the data on those people who are buying those tickets.

“Data is important 100 per cent” he said. “We want to be able to send you offers for other game. The data is critical.”

Meanwhile Ticketmaster and other online ticket platforms all have resale platforms built into their service offerings.

For instance for Friday night’s concert by The Weeknd in Toronto the Ticketmaster site had resale tickets – at much higher than face value — clearly marked on their stadium seat map.

Ticketmaster will not flaunt the law against ticket reselling even though it is an entirely legitimate aspect of its business throughout much of the rest of North America.

True North Sports & Entertainment has an exclusive relationship with Hollywood-based Ticketmaster which merged with Live Nation Entertainment in 2010.

It is a standard relationship that virtually all major league sports teams and concert venues have with a handful of online ticket platforms of which Ticketmaster is the largest.

Tickets for Canada Life Centre and Burton Cummings Theatre events sold on Ticketmaster are easily verifiable at the door. While secondary market sales that take place on other platforms like SeatGeak or StubHub are often verifiable many are not.

“It happens at every single event” Donnelly said. “There is someone at the door with a ticket that is invalid that was bought from another platform.”

In addition to being the only jurisdiction in North America where it’s illegal to sell tickets above the list price Manitoba also has no laws regulating the use of automated bots that can buy hundreds of tickets before you can type in your Ticketmaster password.

Ontario B.C. Alberta and Quebec all have bans on bots.

Allin said “There are sophisticated bad actors out there that use software bots that try to circumvent our system to scoop up tickets in order to sell them for higher prices in other marketplaces.”

The province also does not regulate the practice of speculative ticketing.

That’s when tickets are posted for sale –guaranteeing that seat or an equivalent or better one or your money back – even before the tickets are even on sale.

For instance although tickets for Winnipeg Jets games for the 2022-23 season will not be available for sale until Aug. 22 the ticket platform Seat Geek sent out emails to some Jets customers this week offering tickets for several games. (The trick for speculative ticket sales is that they guarantee tickets of the equivalent or better value and do offer money back guarantees.)

Provincial officials would not respond to questions about why it insists on being an outlier.

A government spokesperson said “Ticket resales are regulated under the Amusements Act. In Manitoba it’s prohibited to resell a ticket for any amount greater than its face value. This provision is in place to protect consumers who participate in the ticket sales marketplace.”

Donnelly would not say much about the commission revenue that True North is forgoing because of the absence of the secondary ticket market but he said the city’s application to Hockey Canada to host a World Junior championship a few years ago would have produced at least $100000 less revenue than other bidders because of the absence of resale revenue.

“When you miss six figures of revenue you don’t win” Donnelly said.

There were no fatalities.

A statement released by the Vandenberg Space Force Base did not lead to any revelations about what exactly when wrong but did state the following:

“A Minotaur II+ rocket exploded approximately 11 seconds after launching from Test Pad-01 at 11:01 p.m. PDT Wednesday.”

There were no injuries in the explosion and the debris was contained to the immediate vicinity of the launch pad.

""We always have emergency response teams on standby prior to every launch"" said Col. Kris Barcomb Space Launch Delta 30 vice commander and launch decision authority for this launch ""Safety is our priority at all times.""

“An investigative review board has been established to determine the cause of the explosion.”

The test flight is part of an effort by Lockheed Martin to modify the Mk21 reentry vehicle a Cold War-era munition and part of the United States’ intercontinental ballistic missile nuclear triad. The goal of the effort is to provide a reliable delivery vehicle for the W87-1 nuclear warhead for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system the successor system to the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile system.

The United States Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin the contract in 2019. “It is essential that Lockheed Martin continue our long-standing ICBM partnership with the Air Force to provide them with advanced solutions” a press release from 2019 announcing the award explained.

“We will continue to demonstrate through this TMRR cutting-edge engineering to defeat rogue nation threats"" said John Snyder vice president of Advanced Strategic Programs for Lockheed Martin.

Lockheed Martin previously explained that the company would “work closely with the Air Force and the National Nuclear Security Administration to provide a technically low risk and affordable solution to modify existing Mk21 reentry vehicles with the capability to deliver the W87-1 Warhead for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent Weapon System.”

The failed flight test was one of two test flights. Though the first ended in disaster the second is reported to be scheduled for mid-2023. It is unclear how or if this first failure will affect the second test launch though no doubt there will be a raft of additional safety measures and pre-launch checks to mitigate the risk of a similar launch disaster.

What the implications are for the ground-based component of the United States’ nuclear triad are also unclear. It could be the case that the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system’s 2029 service date could be postponed.

Does New York to Los Angeles in under three hours sound appealing?

The last commercial supersonic flight was almost 20 years ago and even then super-fast flights were only on very limited routes. Most of today's jetliners actually fly more slowly than they did 20 or 30 years ago in order to save fuel.

But that may be about to change. It's still a long shot but as we first reported last November private start-up companies – with a big assist from nasa - may just give us all another chance to fly faster than the speed of sound.

When British Airways Flight 002 roared into the New York sky on October 24 2003 everyone on board - passengers and pilots - knew that something special was coming to an end.

PILOT: Enjoy the moment as you are the last people in the world as passengers to cruise at twice the speed of sound.

The supersonic Concorde a joint effort of the British and French governments was making its last flight after nearly 30 years in the air grounded by a combination of stratospheric costs and safety concerns after a deadly crash in 2000. Even people watching that last landing in London were emotional.

KID (in tears): I just love airplanes.

INTERVIEWER: And there's not going to be anything like Concorde again is there?

KID: Never.

Well you know that old maxim ""never say never?""

Blake Scholl: Supersonic's coming back. And it's gonna be different this time. It's-- it's back to stay.

Blake Scholl is the founder and CEO of Boom. His audacious goal is to build a new supersonic airliner from scratch.

Blake Scholl

Bill Whitaker: Has a private company ever built-- a supersonic aircraft--

Blake Scholl: No.

Bill Whitaker: --anywhere?

Blake Scholl: No nowhere. It's been governments and militaries only.

Boom is not the only American startup company in the new supersonic sweepstakes. Spike is developing an ultra-fast business jet and Hermeus aspires to make a hypersonic plane that would fly five times the speed of sound. But Boom is the only entrant to actually build an airplane.

Bill Whitaker: This is it?

Boom's aircraft

Blake Scholl: That's it.

Bill Whitaker: Oh wow.

So far Blake Scholl and Boom have built this single-seater test plane which they hope will fly this year. The passenger jet meant to follow is called Overture. It only exists in artist renderings but it's real enough for one of America's largest airlines to climb on board.

Bill Whitaker: So is the Overture the plane that United recently ordered?

Blake Scholl: That's right. United just ordered 15 Overture airplanes. So more Overtures than Concordes were ever delivered into service.

Bill Whitaker: Is this United deal like-- a stamp of approval?

Blake Scholl: I think it's incredibly validating. You know when you are United you take-- you take these things really seriously.

Seriously enough to produce a slick promotional video that's already playing on many United flights.

The ad may say supersonic is here but it's not not yet. Blake Scholl is a software engineer who started his career at Amazon not in aerospace but he insists he's going to make it happen.

Blake Scholl: When I look several decades out you know what I want is to be able to be anywhere in the world in four hours for 100 bucks. Now that's not where we start. But that's the end goal.

Bill Whitaker: The Concorde charged thousands-- thousands of dollars for a one-way flight from New York to London. How is it going to be possible for you to have a similar flight experience for $100?

Blake Scholl: You keep iterating. And so the same way-- you know for example electric cars when they first came out they were pretty expensive. But we kept working on them. And the price came down. They got better and better. And so we're gonna do the same thing with supersonic jets. We're gonna keep working on them. We're gonna keep innovating.

Jon Ostrower: This industry needs people dreaming big. That is essential. This industry was built on that.

Jon Ostrower

Jon Ostrower is editor-in-chief of The Air Current a publication that tracks every development in commercial aviation including Boom and Blake Scholl.

Bill Whitaker: He admits that it's-- something like he is proposing has never been done by-- a private company before. But yet he's convinced that he can do it. Do you think he can?

Jon Ostrower: I think you cannot ignore the obstacles that will be on the path to getting there. And I think the amount of money that is-- is required to make this happen-- makes this a very long shot.

Bill Whitaker: How much money will it take?

Jon Ostrower: Probably in the neighborhood of at least $15 or $20 billion.

Ostrower says that's about what it cost Boeing to develop and build and certify a new subsonic airliner. And they already have huge manufacturing facilities Boom doesn't.

Blake Scholl told us he can get Overture built for $7 to $8 billion but that's a lot more than the $300 million he's raised so far. And money's not the only hurdle. Boom and United have promised their new plane will operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel but that doesn't exist yet in anything like the quantities they'll need. Oh and one other thing...

Jon Ostrower: They're gonna need an engine to do this.

Bill Whitaker: And they don't have the engine yet—

Jon Ostrower: They don't have an engine.

Blake Scholl says an engine is on the way from the same company that built the supersonic engines for the concorde.

Blake Scholl: And we are working with Rolls Royce on a-- custom jet engine that will power Overture.

Bill Whitaker: You're working with Rolls Royce. It-- it doesn't ex-- this engine does not exist yet.

Blake Scholl: It is a-- it is a lightly customized engine. And part of that is Rolls Royce's work where they're kind of turning some design knobs.

Blake Scholl doesn't dismiss the skeptics but he points to the example of Elon Musk and says not so long ago no one thought he could build Teslas and reusable rockets.

Bill Whitaker: Where does this passion come from?

Blake Scholl: It's because we stopped making progress on the speed of travel. You know the airplanes we have today are no faster than the ones we had when my parents were growing up. And there is no good reason for that. It doesn't have to be. We can fix it.

Bill Whitaker: When do you expect the first paying customers to fly on one of your planes?

Blake Scholl: By the end of the decade.

Supersonic really only makes sense on flights of 4 or 5 hours or more. But thousands of such routes are out of reach to Boom. The reason is in the very name of the company: The sound of a sonic boom created by a plane breaking the sound barrier.

The first boom was made by Chuck Yeager's X-1 rocket plane when it passed through mach one – about 660 miles per hour - back in 1947.

Bill Whitaker: What is the sonic boom? What-- what generates it?

Mike Buonanno: So when an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound it creates disturbances.

Mike Buonanno is a top engineer at Lockheed Martin's ""Skunk Works"" aircraft design studio in California. Dave Richardson is his boss.

Mike Buonanno and Dave Richardson

David Richardson: A lot of us understand the wake that's generated by a ship or a boat. And so imagine that wake from a speed boat or whatever all those different waves coming to be one large wave.

Mike Buonanno: Those individual disturbances created up by the airplane they combine together to make a loud double bang.

The Federal Aviation Administration tested the impact of that big bang back in 1964 by flying military supersonic jets over Oklahoma City for six months. The outcome? Broken bricks and ceilings frayed nerves and public outrage.

Mike Buonanno: It was just patently obvious that no one was gonna tolerate such a loud noise on a day-to-day basis.

The result was a ban on civilian supersonic flights everywhere in the world other than over open water.

Mike Buonanno: And that basically hit the brakes on the development of commercial air travel in terms of an advancing speed. Up until-- that ban every decade air travel had gotten faster and faster.

The ban remains in place today so if Boom gets its overture in the air it will only be able to serve long transoceanic routes similar to what the Concorde flew.

Mike Buonanno: So if you want to go from JFK in New York to Paris that's-- okay. But for many of us we wanna fly places over land. Here living in Los Angeles almost everywhere I wanna go-- flying east requires over land travel. And that's one of the big problems that we're trying to solve.

Buonanno and Richardson and their Lockheed Martin team have been commissioned by NASA to build a test plane that can fly twice as fast as current airliners without rattling nerves or breaking windows.

Bill Whitaker: Your mission is to get rid of this sonic boom?

Mike Buonanno: That's right. The entire point of the airplane-- is to reduce sonic boom.

The airplane is called the X-59. It will look like this when it makes its first flight later this year. For now it looks like this inside Lockheed Martin's assembly building.

David Richardson: You're looking at the cockpit of the airplane and there's no forward windscreen. This is it.

Every part of the X-59 is streamlined and smooth to disperse sound waves and transform the loud sonic boom into a much quieter ""thump.""

Nils Larson

Nils Larson: If you look at it it's pretty slick. I mean it looks like a dart.

Nils Larson is the NASA test pilot whose job it will be to prove that the X-59 can replace the sonic boom with a simple thump. Later this year he'll pilot some of the early test flights and then its first sound tests.

Nils Larson: That's coming to a town near you. So our researchers are gonna work with the public and we're going to fly over various cities and towns and they're gonna give us the feedback of that thump. Was that thump too loud? You know did you even hear it at all?

Bill Whitaker: So if you are able to fly over populated areas and provide this data then the FAA will use this data perhaps to lift this ban?

Nils Larson: Exactly.

Bill Whitaker: Are we likely to see planes in the future flying supersonic that look like this one?

Nils Larson: I certainly hope so. And I think you will. So there are definite things that you would see if you walked into a commercial you know supersonic airplane here you know ten 12 years from now and you were to look at that you could see you know some DNA that goes back to the X-59.

Larson took us over to NASA's X-59 flight simulator and the first thing we noticed is that there's a TV screen in place of the missing windshield.

Bill Whitaker: For you does it work as well as--

Nils Larson: Yeah I think--

Bill Whitaker: --using your own eyes?

Nils Larson: So far I think it does. About to go through mach one. There's mach one. You know you see--

Bill Whitaker: So we're now going supersonic.

Nils Larson: Yup you're now supersonic.

Larson gave me a turn in the cockpit not to fly supersonic but to land the X-59 which is tricky given that it's shaped like a pencil has no windshield and I'm not a pilot.

Nils Larson: Come up follow them up just a little bit. So pull back just a little bit little bit more. And just hold it right there. Hold it right there. There you go. You just landed the X59. And in the middle--

Bill Whitaker: I landed--

Nils Larson: --of the runway.

Bill Whitaker: --I landed the--

Nils Larson: --that's better than I did. (LAUGH) Sign him up.

Nils Larson will start test-flying the real X-59 later this year. And soon after that he'll be flying it over us. And if it's quiet enough future planes that follow its design lead could eventually fly us lots of places twice as fast as we can get there now.

Bill Whitaker: When might I be able to fly from New York to Los Angeles in a supersonic plane--

David Richardson: So there's-- there's a long line of things that have to happen starting with the X-59. But I think 2035 is your answer if everything marches along the way that it's supposed to.

Bill Whitaker: It's something that people have been trying to solve for-- for decades. Have you guys solved that problem?

Mike Buonanno: We believe we have. It's rewarding seeing it getting built. But I think that real ""aha"" moment for me is gonna be when I hear that first shaped boom from X-59.

Bill Whitaker: Thump thump.

Mike Buonanno: Thump thump.

David Richardson: We won't hear this BANG. And when we hear or don't hear that sound is when we know we did it.

Lockheed Martin and NASA plan the first test flights of their X-59 sometime this year.

For its part Boom has chosen the location for the factory where it intends to build the Overture airliner: Greensboro North Carolina. But it still doesn't have an engine for the Overture.

Another ship to bear the city's name wasn't so lucky,"The crew of the USS Fort Worth during its commissioning in Galveston Texas on Sept. 22 2012. (Lockheed Martin Corporation/TNS)

(Tribune News Service) — “USS” before a ship’s name stands for “United States Ship” and only vessels of the U.S. Navy can carry that designation.

Presently the Navy has one ship in the fleet named for Fort Worth. The USS Fort Worth part of the Freedom class of vessels has been in the news recently because the Navy wanted to scrap it. The pride of Fort Worth is only 10 years old and should be in the prime of life for a warship. But current naval doctrine considers it obsolete. The Freedom class warships are littoral combat ships (LCSs) intended to operate in coastal waters interdicting pirates and other second-class hostiles but the LCS class is no match for the more heavily armed warships it might encounter so the Navy is ready to scrap it.

This is not the first time the Navy has jilted Fort Worth. The city was proud as a peacock in 2012 when the USS Fort Worth was commissioned. This was directly attributable to the influence of long-serving U.S. Rep. Kay Granger aided by a letter-writing campaign to Congress. It didn’t hurt that Fort Worth also has a strong military heritage going back to its 19th century origins. The result was that the Fort Worth was proclaimed as the first Navy ship to carry the city’s name which is only half true.

By tradition U.S. warships are named by the secretary of the Navy guided by long-established criteria. Most public attention is focused on capital ships the largest and most powerful in the fleet. For instance modern aircraft carriers are named for “great Americans” such as presidents and fighting admirals. In the early 20th century the practice was to name battle cruisers for cities.

The battle cruiser was a class of warship only slightly inferior to the battleship in terms of armor and armament but faster allowing it to outrun anything it couldn’t outfight. Battle cruisers had the added appeal of being cheaper to build than the dreadnoughts of the world’s navies while still superior to old-fashioned armored cruisers. Going into World War I the British and Germans led the world in the number of battle cruisers in their fleets.

The U.S. Navy did not have any battle cruisers when it entered the war in 1917 and did not construct any during the war. However the Naval Act of 1916 authorized six vessels of that class to be named for the first vessel of that class the Lexington. They were to be longer and less heavily armed than any battleship on the drawing board but at 34 knots much faster. Navy plans called for building six battle cruisers all at the same time but at four different shipyards. The potential enemy the USN had in mind was the Japanese navy which was at the time on a building spree to make it the second-largest fleet in the world after the British. The U.S. feared Japanese superiority in battle cruisers which could threaten the sea lanes and U.S. territories in the Pacific. The USN possessed no battle cruisers to Japan’s four and more worrisome the Japanese had eight more under construction.

Despite concern in Congress about how much the new ships would cost in scarce post-war dollars the news of their construction was greeted with joy in the cities and states that would be the beneficiaries of the naming process.

One of the six ships was designated “City of Fort Worth.” When the news was released the city made big plans to celebrate the launching at least two years away. The government asked Marion Sansom a Fort Worth cattleman and banker and a member of the Wilson administration ( War Finance Corp.) to name a “sponsor” for the ship another tradition. He tapped Anne Burnett granddaughter of his old cattleman buddy Burk Burnett who at the time was attending school in Washington D.C.

Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels picked Fort Worth over numerous other possible cities because of its political clout in Washington and because it had generously “oversubscribed” the fourth Liberty Loan drive chaired in Tarrant County by Marion Sansom. Anne’s father Tom Burnett and grandfather Burk both declared she would be glad to represent Fort Worth as sponsor for the ship an honor that included christening the new ship with a bottle of champagne when it was launched.

Not generally known even then was that this was the second time Fort Worth was to be recognized with a ship’s name during the war. In 1917 it was proposed to name a ship in the Merchant Marine for Fort Worth. Only a month later the choice of a ship to be named for Fort Worth was upgraded to a battle cruiser the highest recognition any city could receive for a naval vessel a little ironic since the nearest body of water to the city was Lake Worth.

The six keels were laid in 1920 and work was well underway by March 1922 when construction came to a halt the result of agreements in the Washington Naval Treaty between the United States Great Britain France Italy and Japan. That historic treaty placed limits on the size of the signatories’ navies and stopped ongoing construction of new battleships and battle cruisers. The two U.S. battle cruisers in the most advanced stage of construction were converted to aircraft carriers the U.S.S. Lexington and U.S.S. Saratoga which went on to fame in World War II. The other city ships along with their names were relegated to a footnote in naval history.

Thus ended the sad story of the first USN ship intended to carry the name of our city. It took another 93 years to accomplish it but now the Fort Worth name is proudly carried to the major ports in the world.

Still plans to decommission the USS Fort Worth may have only been delayed for a few years not canceled. Those plans represent a double slap in the face to the city since the Fort Worth’s builder was Lockheed Martin the same company that is building the F-35 right here in Fort Worth.

There is a larger irony to the story. In 1922 a ship named for our city fell victim to international politics that kept it from getting off the drawing boards. Exactly 100 years later the Navy decides that littoral combat ships like the USS Fort Worth no longer serve its strategic doctrine and plans to mothball them. Perhaps Fort Worth should build its own navy? Wait it did that once! That is the subject for a future story.

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1cm5pdHVyZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9yZXRhaWwvaXMtbG93ZXMtaG9tZS1kZWNvci1wbGF5LWEtdGhyZWF0LXRvLWZ1cm5pc2hpbmdzLXN0b3Jlcy15b3UtZGVjaWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Lowe's home décor play a threat to furnishings stores? You decide,"GREENSBORO N.C. – The change in consumer buying behavior during the pandemic served to draw a number of new players into the home décor competition. Even Dollar General took the plunge recently unveiling Popshelf an eclectic and slightly more upscale concept offering home décor kitchenware arts and crafts and bath and beauty.

After years of flirting with furnishings the pandemic finally appears to have lured Lowe’s into the fray with the home center giant adding home décor aisles to go along with home improvement and repair supplies. Cited adjacent to paint supplies the home center has devoted approximately six bays to various home décor categories each one measuring eight feet.

Like so many other retailers today Lowes is also now playing in the boxed bed business devoting a full eight-foot bay with prime aisle entry positioning to Serta boxed beds. Prices range from $314.10 for an 8-inch memory foam twin to $599 for a 10-inch Premier king-sized hybrid.

The focus is clearly on portability and impulse shopping with furniture offerings focused on end and accent tables and a few small chests all priced below $200 all under Lowes’ proprietary Allen & Roth brand. Décor offerings are narrow and clearly focused on helping the broadest swath of consumers finish a recently painted or renovated room.

A full 8-foot bay is devoted to decorative accessories wall art and just to tie it together a wall clock. A separate 8-foot bay is devoted almost exclusively to wall clocks. Again the focus is on giving consumers options at a range of affordable price points. The bulk of the in-store assortment is ranges from $20.99 to $49.99 with a few sub-$20 pieces sprinkled in for bargain hunters.

As you might expect with such a small assortment color offerings are few and centered on neutrals. Other than an occasional nod to farmhouse the bulk of the in-store mix is transitional and clearly aimed at reaching a mass audience.

It’s important to note that assortments and space allocation vary by type of store and location. However it’s clear the retailer has recognized that value of targeting consumers’ drive to decorate.

Baseball is a game that has consistently evolved. In fact the only thing that remains constant is the need for change. With more rule changes such as a pitch clock ban of shifts and automatic strike zone on the horizon this will only continue to be the case. There will always be adjustments that have to be made to stay ahead of the pack and adaptability can be what separates the stars from everyone else.

To add to this no baseball player let alone human being is perfect. What does that mean? There is always room for growth. It’s fun to practice what we’re good at but simply minimizing our weaknesses can go a long way to achieving our ultimate goals. In baseball when you’ve been able to get by on your raw abilities this can be difficult to do. That being said every player to make the major leagues has an extraordinary amount of talent meaning that any sort of stubbornness can come back to bite you in a major way.

Okay enough spiritual poetry here! After being an unheralded prospect early into his career Nathaniel Lowe was able to work his way up the ranks to becoming the Rangers starting first baseman following his trade from Tampa Bay. So far his raw abilities have been on full display but is there more in the tank to become a perennial All-Star? That’s the million-dollar question we’ll be looking to answer. What makes Lowe so intriguing? Let’s dive into it!

Nathaniel Lowe: From Unknown To Offensive Star

Every MLB player gets to the show in a different way and the Lowe family is a clear example of this.

Whereas younger brother Josh was a first-round pick by the Rays and a consistently hyped-up prospect older brother Nathaniel had to wait until the 13th round to be drafted by the same team (now that’s a fun fact). While Josh was able to get drafted out of high school Nathaniel had to take a different route. After not receiving any sort of significant playing time during his freshman year at Mercer he then transferred to a junior college performing well enough to receive a chance to play every day at Mississippi State.

From there Lowe thrived posting a .348/.423/.490 slash line while walking more than he struck out. Now a .142 isolated power (ISO) isn’t what you’re looking for from a first baseman but at the same time Lowe’s on-base ability couldn’t be denied. Likely due to the concerns about his power sample size of production and lack of defensive value Lowe had to wait until the third day of the draft to be selected and didn’t appear to be on the radar for general prospect outlets. Initially with just a .114 ISO during his first full minor-league season those concerns seemed to be borne out. Not for long though.

To start the 2018n season the Rays sent Lowe back to High-A where he was a force of nature with a 191 weighted-runs-created-plus (wRC+). Now when players repeat a level we can often see their production slightly inflated but considering Lowe then went to Double-A and posted a 193 wRC+ and then reached Triple-A as a 22-year-old that certainly wasn’t an applicable factor for him. All together he was 78% above league-average (178 wRC+) across those three levels showcasing the type of power (.239 ISO) we hadn’t seen from him previously. Talk about bursting onto the scene in a hurry! Cleary this was enough for many to take notice as the prospect gurus at Fangraphs pointed out in their 2019 report of him:

“The missing element here is that while Lowe had plus raw power the first time we saw him at Mississippi State he didn’t have the kind of swing or approach to get the most out of it. This untapped tool and his plate discipline are the reasons he was a 13th rounder and not a 35th rounder who went back to school for his senior year. In 2018 Lowe did a rare thing: he tried to do more damage at the plate and lift the ball a bit more but was able to keep his contact rates the same while adding game power. Miguel Andujar did this in the Yankees farm system two years in a row and went from an untapped toolsy prospect who was passed over in the Rule 5 Draft to a Rookie of the Year runner-up; Lowe went from the top of the “Others of Note” section last year to one of the top 150 prospects in the game over a 12 month period. Lowe is a fine defender at first but the value here is all in the bat. Because he’s left-handed the downside is a platoon option at 1B/DH though the Rays cycle through those types very quickly. Underlying indicators and TrackMan data suggest Lowe’s very loud 2018 stats aren’t fluky and he may just be a 50 bat with advanced feel for the zone and 60 game power which is a solid regular.”

Still in a crowded Rays farm system featuring three players with the last name of Lowe (I promise I’m not making that up) it was easy for Nathaniel to slip under the radar with Baseball America (97th) the only major prospect outlet to have him as a top-100 prospect. So what did he do? He continued to hit posting a 141 wRC+ in Triple-A before also performing at an above-average clip in 169 MLB plate appearances as well. Now he only played a limited role in 2020 struggling with strikeouts (36.3% K) but he still posted a 103 wRC+ and this was only a 76 plate appearance sample.

Given Tampa Bay’s immense position player depth particularly at first base/designated hitter it was difficult for Lowe to find a clear role on their roster. Thus they ended up trading him to the Rangers in a package including prospect Heriberto Hernandez who at the time was gaining a tremendous amount of helium after an elite showing in Rookie Ball. To move on from such a promising prospect while in a rebuild shows how much Texas thought of Lowe’s ability to develop into a potent offensive contributor; they clearly envisioned him being a part of their next contending team. Perhaps most importantly though Lowe finally had his chance to shine.

Nathaniel Lowe: A Mixed Bag of a 2021 Season

Although the team wasn’t expected to be postseason contenders the 2021 season was still a pivotal one for the Rangers. See they were set to open up their new stadium in 2020 but due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2021 was the first time their fans would be able to attend games there. Thus even if they didn’t have a star-studded team they needed a competitive team in order to take advantage of this “honeymoon window”.

Now with a 60-102 record third-worst in the MLB that did not particularly happen. Certainly though this was not due to Lowe whose 115 wRC+ was the second-highest on the team first if you don’t include Joey Gallo who was traded at the trade deadline. Now in terms of his offensive runs above average (9.5) he was still just middle-of-the-pack (17th) amongst first basemen. That being said there were a lot of encouraging signs.

From the beginning Lowe’s calling card has been his on-base ability and that held up in his first full season. Not only did he demonstrate clear contact ability but he walked at an impressive 12.5% clip leading to a healthy .357 on-base percentage. With a well-above-average 22.9% chase rate with neutral aggression in the zone (66.2%) giving him some of the best swing decisions in baseball. That’s quite the foundation to build upon particularly since power has historically been found to be the one trait that develops the most over time.

That’s where the mixed bag with Lowe’s 2021 season really comes into play. See his 113.9 max exit velocity put him in the top 9% of the league in terms of calculated raw power while Fangraphs gave him a 65/80 raw power grade as recently as 2019. As you’d expect from someone listed at 6’4″ 220 pounds the raw power is very clear so why did Lowe muster just a .151 ISO and fail to hit 20 home runs in 642 plate appearances? This is where the connection between contact quality and contact trajectory comes into play.

When you’re hitting a ground ball in 54.5% of your batted balls it certainly is going to be difficult for you to maximize your raw power as we have seen from Eric Hosmer Yandy Diaz and many others. For Lowe fastballs (56.8% GB) particularly sinkers (68% GB) did him in. Where specifically? With a flat bath path pitchers could neutralize his power lower in the zone as evidenced by his average launch angle by zone quadrant:

Throw a fastball especially a sinker low in the zone and it’s very likely you can get Lowe to hit a worm burner. In fact his lowest barrel rate (6.8%) came against fastballs which pitchers clearly realized as the season went on:

According to Fangraphs no qualified hitter say more fastballs last season than Lowe and for good reason. Unfortunately this didn’t work out well which fell off dramatically after the start of the season:

BARREL RATE BY MONTH

April: 14.3%

May: 10.8%

From June on: 8%

It’s one thing to find success when immediately coming up to the majors but as pitchers discover your weaknesses they’re going to do everything in their power to exploit it. The vast amount of information within the game of baseball is astonishing allowing pitchers to prep for opposing hitters like never before. Clearly Lowe couldn’t quite adapt to how pitchers were attacking him leading to a much higher quantity of ground balls.

Hitting the ball in the air is one way to get to as much raw power as possible. In many cases though nearly as important is pulling the ball. Pulled fly balls have historically performed much better than other fly balls and it makes sense; it’s easiest to pull a ball for a greater distance while you can take advantage of shorter dimensions. This is the Marcus Semien approach to hit for the optimal amount of power though it isn’t something all hitters can achieve. Just take Lowe’s spray heat map from last year as a clear example.

Lowe’s 24.9% pull rate was tied for second-lowest in all of baseball associating him with the likes of DJ LeMahieu Nicky Lopez Myles Straw and Ramiel Tapia. For those hitters who specialize in making a lot of contact and hitting for a high average this is the ideal approach. For Lowe someone with as much measured power as he does this is not the case. As you can see not only was he hitting a lot of ground balls but the few fly balls he did hit were going the other way which is precisely how one doesn’t hit for as much power as one should.

Lowe’s swing decisions were tremendous giving him a clear knack for getting on base. However considering his raw abilities the ceiling was much much higher than the 115 wRC+ he posted last season. Could it all come to fruition this season? So far there are plenty of positive signs even if ultimate outlook is still quite perplexing.

A Promising (and Confusing) 2022

After being arguably the team’s best offensive performer last season it’s safe to say Lowe was surrounded by a team with much more surrounding talent this season. That’s what happens when your team signs Corey Seager and Marcus Semien trades for Mitch Garver and also gets strong returns from Jonah Heim Adolis Garcia and Kole Calhoun. However with the marquee free agents struggling it’s been players like Lowe who have picked up the slack.

Now things weren’t promising initially. Although Lowe had a 124 wRC+ through the first month of the season that was being boosted by a very unsustainable .393 batting average on balls in play (BABIP). In fact when you look at his .088 ISO 3.2% barrel rate and 54.8% ground ball rate there was a lot of reason to be concerned. Since then though things have changed:

Considering the success he was having early on it’s understandable that Lowe may have been hesitant to make a swing/approach change. Clearly though the presence of new offensive coordinator Donnie Ecker who was credited with several of the major hitting success stories the Giants had last year is appearing to have a positive influence on Lowe. Regardless of the reason he’s hitting fly balls in a way we haven’t seen consistently before which is remarkably encouraging.

With that in mind it isn’t a surprise that Lowe boasts a strong 10.2% barrel rate since the start of May. Considering a considerable amount of his gains hitting the ball in the air have been with the fastball this is very encouraging to the point pitches are now attacking him higher with the fastball; his 2.97 feet average fastball vertical height in June was about 0.3 feet higher than it was in April. Add in the fact he’s even pulling the ball (30.6%) slightly more and there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic.

See in addition to hitting more balls in the air Lowe has also demonstrated a much more aggressive approach increasing his chase rate (29%) and zone-swing rate (73.7%) by about seven points each. Consequently he is walking (7.3%) less than ever which is negatively impacting his on-base ability. Ultimately the goal would be for Lowe to be able to mesh added power with the foundation of on-base skills but right now it would appear he’s compensating for his struggles in one area by cutting away from his strengths.

Fortunately there are signs of that changing:

Can we see this trend continue thus balancing Lowe’s on-base skills with a power breakout? That is the hope. ZiPs projects Lowe to post a .270/.351/.447 slash line with a 129 wRC+ which is well within the range of outcomes. If so I’m sure all parties would be quite thrilled with that outcome. In spite of the low walk rate he’s still mustering a 128 wRC+; although projections are split on him there are plenty of reasons to expect him to reach his high range of outcomes.

Overview

Baseball is a hard game on its own. Now add in trying to make adjustments on the fly and the degree of difficulty skyrockets.

At the same time as is the case with all aspects of life change is often necessary. For Nathaniel Lowe the journey has been rocky but since the beginning the foundational skills have always been there. After all any hitter who can make strong swing decisions get on base and hit the ball extremely hard should always garner your attention.

This has been the driving force for Lowe all along but now it’s time for his untapped upside to be realized. After struggling to lift and pull the ball last season he’s showing serious signs of progress this year while also stabilizing some of his early plate discipline warts. When it is all said and done we could easily be looking at one of the more complete offensive first basemen or at least a hitter 25-30% above league average. That’s quite valuable and something that we should not gloss over.

Now we just have to wait to see how the rest of the season turns out for Lowe. Right now though we should be extremely optimistic about the first baseman’s outlook moving forward. The transition to becoming the player he has the potential to be may not be “Lowe hanging fruit” but change is happening! When it’s all said and done the Rangers could have themselves quite a potent lineup in a few years.

The night before his team had lost by seven points at home to a middling Charlotte Hornets squad and the Bucks’ new coach Jason Kidd was angry. Milwaukee who were hovering around .500 were slated to have the holiday off to spend with family but Kidd changed those plans and decided his roster should practice – as punishment. The players had to cancel flights and alert their family of the change – something of course they did not want to do. During the Christmas Eve practice Sanders went full-on. He didn’t lollygag but peeved he also didn’t back away from engaging his coach in confrontation. Afterwards while he was the last one left in the locker room his body started to break down.

“I was cramping from my ears to my toes” Sanders tells the Guardian. “Full body cramps.”

It was the second time that this stress reaction had happened to him during his young career and it forced Sanders to quickly seek medical treatment. Sanders was hospitalized that Christmas Eve and Christmas. He never returned to the Bucks practice facility again despite having signed a four-year $44m contract extension the year before. “I physically and mentally could not get myself back there” he says. “Nothing could get me in the car to go there. I had such a block.” The 6ft 11in center who’d averaged nearly a double-double and almost three blocks per game a few seasons before was now the one stifled. “I didn’t touch a basketball for the next two years. Not a shot not a dribble.”

Sanders was born on 21 November 1988 in Fort Pierce Florida and grew up “in the trenches”. There were gangs seemingly on every street in his neighborhood. His parents split when he was a kid and both suffered from untreated mental health issues. “They had all this trauma” Sanders says “all this pain. They were predisposed to a lot of violence [while] not understanding the power of therapy the power of meditation.”

As a kid Sanders loved to draw. It was his “getaway.” He wanted to illustrate comics and work for Disney. He had a deep interest in the ocean too won a grant to study oceanography and got to ride in submarines. He was tall but didn’t have any particular interest in basketball. But it was a basketball that would save him.

“Because I lived in the projects” Sanders says “automatically where you live there are places you can’t go [due to gang conflicts].” He found that if he rode his bike from his home to his grandmother’s or cousin’s house while carrying a basketball he was left alone. Gangs even brutal ones tend to respect the kids who can use the game to get out of the neighborhood.

“I had a ball everywhere I went” he says. “It was my pass. Like ‘Oh he’s going to play basketball he’s just going to the court. If I didn’t have that ball I would’ve constantly been getting checked. I would probably have had to attach myself to a gang to protect myself. But I didn’t even play.”

It wasn’t until high school that he began to really take to the game. He was already 6ft 6in by the time he was in the 10th grade but he was raw: In his first game he scored on his own basket. But he started watching the pros more. His idol was Tracy McGrady who played for the nearby Orlando Magic. Sanders wore arm bands like him modeled his game after McGrady’s. He soon managed double-digit blocks. Later during his 11th and 12th grades his team was dominant in the region. And as a senior he started playing AAU traveling as far as Las Vegas for games. It was the people he met then that he bonded and later enrolled with at VCU.

Sanders’ college team was a force. During his three years there his squad won 75 games and only lost 27. After his junior year he decided to turn pro and he was selected by Milwaukee with the 15th overall pick. Had he stayed in college he would have played for the VCU team that made the Final Four under coach Shaka Smart. Still he was excited for the NBA. “You shoot a million jump shots and you want to get paid” he says. But in the end the NBA wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. “It was a blessing but it was also a lot” he says. “I come from nothing and then you become the one that has everything. People who are supposed to guide you become your dependents. And you’re too young for that.”

Sanders lacked a support system in the league and his personal life. “You get fed to the sharks in a lot of ways” he says. “You can find yourself in a very vulnerable position … It can feel like a setup it can feel like a trap. I felt so alone. It was so hard to even express what I was going through. At the time in 2012 no one said they had anxiety or depression – maybe Delonte West but everyone was outcasting him.”

During his second year in the NBA Sanders smoked a joint for the first time passed to him by teammates. The drug helped like medicine. But league drug testing led to suspensions rehabs and ostracization. (Today the NBA doesn’t test for weed.)

“Do I gravitate to some pills and other drugs or do I do alcohol?” he wondered then about substances that wouldn’t be detected. Not only that but his need to be creative was no longer thriving. He felt stymied. “I was yearning for support yearning to be heard. But there was nothing in the manuscript for what I was going through at that time.” Sanders became one of the first players to talk about mental health – though now thanks to others such as DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love it’s a much more accepted topic. However when you’re the first to do something you’re often judged harshly for it. “There was no way I was the first one [to have mental health issues]” he says. “But I was the first one to speak up.”

Today Sanders is glad he did. Not just vocally but by publicly stepping away from the game. That choice led to conversations people are having now. “I have three sons that could be in the NBA one day” he says. “To have their mental health be respected – sometimes you got to be the one to step out on a cliff. But it’s worth it.” It wasn’t that he didn’t love the game it was that he didn’t have what he needed while participating in it. “My body and my mind are elite” he says. “But my surroundings and my environment just wasn’t.”

When he decided to walk he had two kids and he knew that if he wasn’t in the right state of mind he couldn’t ensure they would be either. Later he went to another rehab facility. This time it wasn’t one selected by the NBA for marijuana – though even in those he made close relationships with patients who were there for additions to heroin and other narcotics. This one was designed around therapy and emotional wellbeing. That was the last facility he’s been to since.

After two years away from the NBA Sanders sought a comeback. He worked out for a few teams and landed a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016-17 alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. But he still had a rehab stint he’d have to undertake for the league if he was to stay on and the team at the time had its own internal turmoil he says. He lasted only a handful of games before he was waived. Leaving the NBA for good despite still being in his prime in his 20s brought a great deal of criticism. But Sanders doesn’t stress about those comments. His philosophy is that if someone isn’t going to be there at your funeral why care about what they say? “One minute you’re larger than life” he says. “And the next [in their eyes] you’re lower than dirt.”

Still at his peak Sanders who is a member of and continues to work with the NBA Retired Players Association was regarded my many as one of the best defensive players in the league. He was stopping his heroes in the paint players he’d idolized. “I was their nightmare” he says. “I was like ‘I can really play this game. This game is really meant for me!’”

It took a lot to walk away from that. But today though things aren’t always “perfect” Sanders maintains gratitude. He also retains his love of creativity: he has a production company and a publishing company. He’s writing a memoir kids’ books a movie script he runs camps produces music has a foundation and a cannabis line and he even spends summers playing in the Big3. Sanders also keeps relationships with players who deal with their own mental health issues.

“Why I go so hard” Sanders says “is because this has to be a success story. I got to show kids that I made the right choice. That there is a way – more for us to do. That we can be successful without succumbing.

The Holistic funding was revealed by Bloomberg on Tuesday. The Paris-based firm has reportedly raised $200mn (€186mn) in a round that values the company at $370mn (€344mn).

Holistic has big plans for the cash. According to Bloomberg the startup wants to build “multi-agent” models that will enable interactions between different AI systems and “genuine AGI capabilities.”

Holistic also boasts an eye-catching leadership team. It includes four ex-DeepMind engineers and Charles Kantor a former venture resident at Stanford University’s business school who is the startup’s CEO. One of the founders Laurent Sifre was a co-inventor of the seminal DeepMind system that mastered the ancient Chinese game of Go.

The mega-round revealed on Tuesday adds another cash injection to France’s rising AI sector. Led by OpenAI rival Mistral the country has become a European hotbed for artificial intelligence.

The nation also recently added a vital dose of compute power to the mix. Last month Paris-based startup FlexAI emerged from stealth with a €28.5mn war chest and a plan to rearchitect AI infrastructure.

French artificial intelligence is also attracting growing interest from abroad. A day after the Holistic news broke South Korea’s Samsung Medison announced a 126.5bn won (€86mn) acquisition of Paris startup Sonio which develops AI-based fetal ultrasound software.

The deal is further evidence that French AI is attracting global admiration. But that admiration could impede domestic growth.

French AI takes on the world

Although Samsung Medison says Sonio will remain an independent company headquartered in France overseas investors frequently upset the home nations of their acquisitions.

The UK provides a striking example of the consequences. The sales of DeepMind to Google chip designerArm to Japan’s SoftBank and Darktrace to a US private equity firm have taken a toll on the British tech sector and stock market.

France will hope its emerging AI leaders can avoid a similar fate. If the sector is to truly boom the country will need to prove that Europe can not only create top startups but also scale them.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels. Written and directed by Johnny Mack the comedy satire bills itself as “This is not a Tyler Perry Movie.” Expect single digits for the film."

Marriott International has signed an agreement with AKYN Hospitality Group to bring the Courtyard by Marriott brand to Quy Nhon an up-and-coming coastal destination on Vietnam’s south-central coast.

Courtyard by Marriott Quy Nhon will serve as a key component of a new mixed-use development in the heart of the city.

Local and international attraction

Scheduled to open in early 2025 the site promises to deliver high-class experience with international standards for locals as well as domestic and foreign tourists.

Accentuating contemporary design that encompasses comfort and functionality Courtyard by Marriott Quy Nhon is expected to feature 362 thoughtfully designed guestrooms and suites with unobstructed ocean views. Accommodations include family rooms and suites to cater to parents travelling with their children. The hotel is slated to offer three contemporary dining outlets including an all-day-dining restaurant with an open kitchen a café and a lobby lounge.

From wellness to work

Additional design plans call for a 25-m outdoor pool and a well-equipped fitness centre. The hotel’s spa features private treatment rooms a sauna and steam rooms. Catering to families is a kids club featuring an outdoor play area. Other planned facilities include 756 sq m of flexible function space including a large ballroom and four breakout rooms for occasions from corporate conferences to weddings.

For business executives The Residence is a flexible area that can be adapted to a variety of different functions. Largely open plan this inviting space features working zones intimate meeting rooms casual seating clusters and personal booths accompanied by printing stations and an F&B counter to maximise productivity.

Marriott International’s area vice president – Thailand Vietnam Cambodia and Myanmar Jakob Helgen said: “We are pleased to work with AKYN Hospitality Group an avant-garde dynamic hospitality group with an international mindset and local cultural wisdom. Courtyard by Marriott is the perfect fit for Quy Nhon an emerging market with strong potential. This hotel represents a major milestone in the advancement of our expansion strategy in Vietnam.”

AKYN Hospitality Group CEO Tiffany Nguyen Thi Minh Thu commented: “We are delighted to deepen our relationship with Marriott International. By working with the world’s largest hotel group we know our hotel will meet and exceed the highest levels of quality and service for every guest. We are also proud to introduce the well-known Courtyard by Marriott brand to Binh Dinh province. This highly sought-after region attracted five million visitors in 2019 and we fully expect it to become an important business and leisure hub in the years to come.”

True hospitality

AKYN Hospitality Group is also cooperating with Marriott International in several projects including The Westin Resort & Spa Cam Ranh (Khanh Hoa) which will open in late 2022 a five-star hotel in Ho Chi Minh City and a resort in Phuoc Hai (Ba Ria-Vung Tau).

Thu added: “For our long-term strategy AKYN intends to develop high-class brands including hotels and resorts managed by global hospitality management groups and our own new reputed bespoke brand to add value to the personalised service and care offered throughout Da Lat and Ho Tram’s properties.

“The collaboration with Marriott International strengthens our strategic global partnerships. With goodwill clear ambitions and strong commitment I look forward to taking the next steps towards our vision of unlocking new opportunities and delivering true hospitality to the Vietnamese and global tourism industry.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlib3VsZXZhcmQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMy1hY2Nlc3Mtc2VjdXJpdHktbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tdGhlLW1hcnJpb3R0LWRhdGEtYnJlYWNoL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlib3VsZXZhcmQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMy1hY2Nlc3Mtc2VjdXJpdHktbGVzc29ucy1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tdGhlLW1hcnJpb3R0LWRhdGEtYnJlYWNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Access Security Lessons Learned from the Marriott Data Breach,"For the third time in less than five years international hotel corporation Marriott is back in the news with yet another data breach.

According to reports out of Databreaches.net who broke the story Marriott was the victim of a social engineering attack where the hackers convinced an employee at the hotel near BWI Airport to give them access to his computer. The thieves then made off with 20GB of data that included some credit card details as well as personal identifying information (PII) belonging to people who had stayed at the hotel.

The overall sensitivity of the data remains a debate as Marriott’s communications team has denied that anything of high value was taken.

Negotiations between the hackers and Marriott appear to have failed with the hotelier refusing to pay. No word yet from the criminals if they intend to publish anything beyond the scraps that they sent out to Databreaches.net for proof of their activities.

Finding themselves in the headlines again for what by all appearances is a fairly limited incident is suboptimal for Marriott.

Nobody can really confirm the identities of the hackers who hit Marriott this time around. In the past they have been targeted by Chinese intelligence (Starwood hack) where 500 million people had their information stolen. In the 2020 incident with a much smaller 5.2 million folks compromised the guilty party appears to be criminal in nature.

This time around it is hard to tell who is really behind the breach. For the more conspiracy minded-among us BWI is only about 20 minutes away from Ft. Meade and the ransom could have been a cover but there is no evidence one way or another.

What Can We Learn From the Marriott Hacks?

Regardless of whoever is behind this round it is clear that hotel chains like Marriott are ideal targets for malicious hackers.

They hold tons of PII payment information do not have the same regulatory security standards as say a financial or healthcare organization and have very wide attack surfaces with so many employees having (hopefully) varying levels of access.

In this case the hackers did not have to find a vulnerability in the code or try to brute force anything. They used a bit of skullduggery to abuse a legitimate user’s real credentials helping them reach real data and get Marriott back in the headlines.

Given all of these incentives for continued attacks against Marriott (the goose that keeps on giving) and similar organizations what can we learn from these hacks?

MFA is Not Enough In the 2020 attack legitimate stolen credentials were reportedly used to access the data. Multi-Factor Authentication could have been used to reduce the risk of that breach by adding an additional layer of protection but as we see here in this latest case authentication has its limits. The human is still a vulnerable factor here and a well targeted social engineering attack can overcome some of these added security measures. On a technical level an attacker could set up a fake MFA page that would capture the one time password (OTP) that the targeted user would input to access their account. Or they could go the old fashioned route and just trick the user into giving them the desired access as we saw in this latest go at Marriott. Check out a classic clip from Hackers for a great example of this kind of social engineering. These kinds of social engineering tricks are not uncommon. Last year hackers used a victim’s Slack to communicate with EA Games’ helpdesk to skirt around the MFA protections having claimed to have lost their phone at a party over the weekend. MFA like all forms of authentication is very valuable but it is only the first step and requires being backed up with defense in-depth that provides real security. The Bigger the Organization More Opportunities for Hacks Hacks like most kinds of offense are a numbers game. The more attacks that you can launch at a target statistically the greater chances that you will have to eventually succeed. For hackers every identity in the organization is an opportunity to make their breach. The bigger the organization the more opportunities they have to phish or find stolen credentials for someone in your organization and worm their way into your data. As organizations have sped towards the cloud they have accumulated heaps of new identities for each of the new apps and services that they are using quickly multiplying the number of creds that must be secured against compromise. This has created a significant challenge for security teams that have to handle both securing access via those exponentially expanding quantities of identities and monitor for when they show up on a bin site or dark web marketplace. Identify and Protect Your Sensitive Assets Based on the mix bag of more and less sensitive assets that the hackers appear to have made off with in this breach it would seem that the blue team did not do enough to identify what was more sensitive. In general assets deemed as sensitive are generally going to be financials credit card or other customer information source code or IP or access to your development pipeline among many other bits. Understanding what is sensitive and requires extra security attention is very important but it is also hard to do at scale — especially from a prioritization perspective.

3 Tips for Mitigating Risks to Your Identity and Access Layer

Given these takeaways there are a number of steps that you can take to make your organization a harder nut to crack for hackers attempting to target your identity and access layer.

Reduce Privileges to Narrow the Attack Surface — Principle of Least Privilege Attackers insider or external cannot access assets that they do not have privileges to access. Especially in cloud environments like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) access privileges are the microsegmentation that you used to have in your network. The way that we do this is by adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege that calls for only provisioning the minimal amount of access privileges necessary to get a job done. No more no less. The more that you limit an identity’s access privileges the more you narrow your attack surface that a malicious actor can take advantage of in reaching deeper inside your organization’s data. This way when an attacker gains an initial beachhead inside your organization by compromising an identity they will only have access to a limited quantity of assets. Think of it as controlling the blast radius from a security incident when one or more of your organization’s many credentials get popped. Understand Who Else Has Access to Your Environments We are all increasingly interdependent on partners and vendors so their security is our security. Ask how the other organizations that you are working with are securing their identities and access. Are they compliant with common regulations like SOC II PCI-DSS and so on? Do they have any Cloud Security Alliance certifications of audits? Do they have security tools and processes in place? Also be sure to understand what access you have granted them inside your apps and services. Can they see your CRM development pipeline (AWS & GitHub) or have any other kind of access that can leave you exposed? Gaining visibility over what access external partners have requires looking outside of your identity management system and connecting directly to said apps and services to see the access privileges. If you are depending solely on your Identity Provider like Okta then you are only seeing half the story. Monitor Privilege Usage for All Apps and Services It is not enough to simply know what the entitlements are for a given identity either human or machine. You have to see how they are using their privileges. Who is not using their privileges and can have them revoked without impacting their work? Why is someone from dev regularly accessing files from finance? Who has retained their privileges from an old position and now has a serious case of privilege sprawl? And why does Sally still have active access privileges even though she left the company six months ago? Gaining this level of visibility requires a more granular understanding of your access privilege layer but it can help to answer a lot of questions about the unknowns in your environments.

Stay a Step Ahead of the Headlines

Marriott has had a rough go of it the past couple of years and this write up is not meant to add insult to injury.

In at least two cases that we know about the hotelier has had its identities and access abused by hackers leading to them ending up with legal and reputational pains that you wouldn’t wish on your competitors.

Hacks can and will happen. Our goal should be to make it as difficult for hackers to find ways to escalate their privilege and let them leave with as little as possible.

Hopefully following some of these tips can help your organization give a hacker a bad day and avoid some of the pitfalls that have befallen others.

Here's what you need to know about age and work,"With the bear market hitting retirement portfolios hard bonds performing as poorly as stocks and inflation raging what seemed like a sure retirement income may be more of a pipe dream for many older Americans who had left the workforce or planned to soon retire. The economic situation is sending more retirement-age workers back into the labor force. A recent CNBC survey found a majority of retirees would consider returning to work. But finding the right job isn't always easy.

Many companies don't offer the flexibility that many older workers want later in life. Age discrimination is another factor with 78% of older workers claiming to have seen or experienced workplace age discrimination according to 2021 data from AARP. That's the highest level since 2003 when AARP began tracking the data.

Yet many companies are increasingly looking to attract mature workers and with good reason. For one the labor market is as tight as it's been in decades and there are now two open jobs for every worker in the nation and firms are struggling to recruit and retain talent. Research from employee scheduling company Homebase suggests that seniors are more engaged; more likely to look forward to work; more connected to their companies; and less likely to consider quitting. This makes older workers especially attractive in the currently tight labor market said Jason Greenberg head economist at Homebase.

Here are four tips to help older workers find an age-friendly employer.

1. Identify companies committed to hiring older workers

Start with those that have publicly pledged to level the playing field for older workers. More than 1000 companies including Humana Microsoft Marriott International and McDonald's have signed on to the AARP Employer Pledge program. Eligible companies can't have had discrimination lawsuits within the past five years. They must also agree to recruit across diverse age groups and consider all applications equally regardless of age. AARP also offers a jobs board to help match experienced candidates with companies who have committed to having an age-diverse employee base.

The Age-Friendly Institute also certifies companies that are considered best-in-class for workers aged 50 and above. Applicants go through an extensive review and certification process which includes committing to ""meaningful employment development opportunities and competitive pay and benefits for employees 50+."" The list last updated in April includes Aetna Home Depot Macy's Starbucks and Wells Fargo.

Just be aware that these lists can change and don't give you the whole picture so be sure to do your due diligence on any company you are considering said Lance Robertson a former U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Assistant Secretary for Aging who is now a director at Guidehouse a global consulting and IT services provider.

2. Looks for clues in job postings

Older job candidates should look at a company's job ads which can offer insights into the company's culture and if it's really age inclusive said Paul Lewis chief customer officer at Adzuna an online job search engine. Older job seekers should look for language that specifically states the company doesn't discriminate based on age he said.

Quantum computing (QC) represents the biggest threat to data security in the medium term since it can make attacks against cryptography much more efficient. With quantum computing capabilities having advanced from the realm of academic exploration to tangible commercial opportunities now is the time to take steps to secure everything from power grids and IoT infrastructures to the burgeoning cloud-based information-sharing platforms that we are all increasingly dependent upon.

Quantum Computing Threatens All Types of Encryption

Despite encrypted data appearing random encryption algorithms follow logical rules and can be vulnerable to some kinds of attacks. All algorithms are inherently vulnerable to brute-force attacks in which all possible combinations of the encryption key are tried.

According to Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach report 85% of breaches caused by hacking involve brute force or the use of credentials that have been lost or stolen. Moreover cybercrime costs the U.S. economy $100 billion a year and costs the global economy $450 billion annually.

Although traditionally a 128-bit encryption key establishes a secure theoretical limit against brute-force attacks this is a bare-minimum requirement for Advanced Encryption Standard symmetric keys which are currently the default symmetric encryption cipher used for public and commercial purposes.

Businesses can implement quantum-safe cybersecurity solutions that range from developing risk management plans to harnessing quantum mechanics itself to fight the threats QC poses.

These are considered to be computationally infeasible to crack and most experts consider today’s 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys to be generally secure. However within the next 20 years sufficiently large quantum computers will be able to break essentially all public-key schemes currently in use in a matter of seconds.

How Does Quantum Computing Work?

Quantum computing speeds up prime number factorization so computers with quantum computation can easily break cryptographic keys via quickly calculating and exhaustively searching secret keys. A task thought to be computationally impossible by conventional computer architectures becomes easy by compromising existing cryptographic algorithms shortening the span of time needed to break public-key cryptography from years to hours.

Quantum computers outperform conventional computers for specific problems by leveraging complex phenomena such as quantum entanglement and the probabilities associated with superpositions (when quantum bits [qubits] exist in several states at the same time) to perform a series of operations in such a way that favorable probabilities are enhanced. When a quantum algorithm is applied the probability of measuring the correct answer is maximized.

Algorithms such as RSA AES and Blowfish remain worldwide standards in cybersecurity. The cryptographic keys of these algorithms are based mainly on two mathematical procedures — the integer factorization problem and the discrete logarithm problem — that make it difficult to crack the key preserving the system’s security.

Two algorithms for quantum computers challenge current cryptography systems. Shor’s algorithm greatly speeds up the time required for solving the integer factorization problem. Grover’s quantum search algorithm while not as fast still significantly increases the speed of decryption keys that with traditional computing technologies would take time on the order of quintillions of years.

All widely used public-key cryptographic algorithms are theoretically vulnerable to attacks based on Shor’s algorithm but the algorithm depends on operations that can only be achieved by a large-scale quantum computer (>7000 qubits). Quantum computers are thus likely to make encryption systems based on RSA and discrete logarithm assumptions (DSA ECDSA) obsolete. Companies like D-Wave Systems promise to deliver a 7000+ qubit solution by 2023-2024.

Prepare for Quantum Disruption

Quantum technologies are expected to bring about disruption in multiple sectors. Cybersecurity will be one of the main industries to feel this disruption; and although there are already several players preparing for and developing novel approaches to cybersecurity in a post-quantum world it is vital for corporations governments and cybersecurity supply-chain stakeholders to understand the impact of quantum adoption and learn about some of the key players working on overcoming the challenges that this adoption brings about.

Businesses can implement quantum-safe cybersecurity solutions that range from developing risk management plans to harnessing quantum mechanics itself to fight the threats QC poses.

The replacement of encryption algorithms generally requires steps including replacing cryptographic libraries implementation of validation tools deployment of hardware required by the algorithm updating dependent operating systems and communications devices and replacing security standards and protocols. Hence post-quantum cryptography needs to be prepared for eventual threats as many years in advance as is practical despite quantum algorithms not currently being available to cyberattackers.

Quantum computing has the potential for both disrupting and augmenting cybersecurity. There are techniques that leverage quantum physics to protect from quantum-computing related threats and industries that adopt these technologies will find themselves significantly ahead of the curve as the gap between quantum-secure and quantum-vulnerable systems grows.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mastercard announced Saturday that it paused its endorsement deals with Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell after the golfers left the PGA Tour for LIV Golf.

According to ESPN's Tom VanHaaren Mastercard vice president of communications Seth Eisen released a statement saying: ""We have paused the activation of our relationship with Ian and Graeme recognizing the uncertainties around their standing with the PGA Tour.""

VanHaaren noted that Poulter has partnered with Mastercard since 2009 while McDowell has been with the company since 2011.

LIV Golf is financially backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

The country has a history of human rights violations and a U.S. intelligence report determined that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman approved the operation that killed Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

Saudi Arabia has been accused of ""sportswashing"" which is the act of using sports to deflect from a poor reputation in other areas such as human rights.

In addition to the formation of LIV Golf Saudi Arabia has hosted several major sporting events including boxing matches a Formula One race and WWE pay-per-views.

Mastercard is the latest in a long line of companies to suspend or pull its partnerships from golfers who signed with LIV Golf.

Per VanHaaren Rocket Mortgage suspended Bryson DeChambeau's endorsement deal; RBC moved on from McDowell and Dustin Johnson; and WorkDay KPMG and Amstel ended their relationships with Phil Mickelson.

The 46-year-old Poulter has long been one of the top English golfers earning three PGA Tour wins and 10 victories on the European Tour.

IAN POULTER TWO OTHERS WIN SCOTTISH OPEN BAN APPEAL: ‘IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO’

Poulter and McDowell began their relationships with Mastercard in 2009 and 2011 respectively.

Poulter is competing in the Scottish Open this week after a British court granted him a temporary stay from the DP World Tour’s ban on players who competed in the first-ever LIV Golf event in London last month

""I didn’t have any other choice did I? I had to appeal. I’m not going to sit back when I feel it’s slightly unjust"" Poulter said earlier this week. ""It was the right thing to do.""

The bans included fines of around $120000 and barred those players from competing in the Scottish Open the Barbasol Championship and the Barracuda Championship — all events co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour.

The Tour announced its own indefinite ban in May on players competing in LIV Golf events without releases from the PGA Tour or those who resigned their membership to do so.

Several other players have lost sponsorships over the controversy.

The partnership is impactful but it lacked the kind of personally moving component necessary to really help individuals understand what they were doing. To add that special something they reached out to ROSE.

Standing Up to Cancer

From May 1 through July 15 Mastercard will donate one cent for every transaction to SU2C – an organization that helps to fund groundbreaking cancer research. That may not sound like a lot of money but keep in mind that there are some 250 million Mastercards in the US alone with many of those cards being used multiple times each day.

“Mastercard remains committed to our long-standing partnership with Stand Up To Cancer and we’re giving our cardholders a simple way to join us on our mission” said Mastercard North America EVP of Marketing and Communications Rustom Dastoor in a release describing the initiative.

If this sounds familiar the campaign has been publicized through a series of commercials featuring Sterling K. Brown best known for his multiple-year portrayal of Randall Pearson on This Is Us. In the commercials Brown is a barista who explains the promotion to coffee shop patrons before giving them a latte decorated with their own faces.

﻿

“Having personally dealt with cancer in my own family I know how important it is to support this cause and create ways for people to give back that make an impact” Brown said in a release describing the commercial. “The fact that Mastercard is making it so easy to donate through everyday dining and groceries is incredibly special.”

In the commercial the customers’ faces appearing on the latte is amusing but it also shows that they are personally involved in the project. The transaction isn’t just a transaction it’s a special interaction that they’re a part of. Wouldn’t it be great if everyone could do that not just the people in the commercial?

That’s where ROSE comes in.

How ROSE Made it Personal

ROSE is a digital experience company but they shouldn’t need an introduction for regular readers of ARPost. Over the years we’ve covered their branded engagements with companies like KHAITE and Patrón. We’ve also covered the company’s engagements for civic causes like experiences to visualize campaign spending or help us understand Black history milestones.

For an AR activation to accompany the Mastercard and SU2C ROSE went back to the commercial. Snapchat users were presented with a digital Mastercard at a virtual Point-of-Sale system in a virtual cafe.

Brown appeared behind the counter and explained the promotion – personally it appeared to the user. Then just like in the commercial a (virtual) latte appeared on the coffee shop counter complete with foam art of the user’s face. All users had to do was use their phone’s camera to line their face up with a template on their phone screen for a sharable made-for-TV moment.

Go On. Get Your Card Out

So what has the impact been like? We don’t have all of the numbers in yet because the campaign is still running for another two weeks. However we do know that in the period that the ROSE filter was available from June 24 until June 30 it was used more than 10 million times. Further Mastercard has pledged up to $5M for the campaign.

It’s getting harder to tell if your date is who they say they are and that’s before you consider the data security and privacy implications of using the apps on your smartphone.

It’s difficult to maintain privacy when apps such as Hinge Tinder and Bumble need to collect data to match you with potential dates. Then there’s the data you share with other users – including your sexual orientation age and social media information – that could put you at risk if it gets into the wrong hands.

Here’s what you need to know about using dating apps safely and privately while still getting the most out of them.

Should you use your real name in your profile?

When creating a dating profile you’ll need to display some information for potential matches to see. But it’s pretty easy to track someone down online if you know their first name and occupation and you might not be comfortable with this.

Thankfully most dating apps cater for people who wish to maintain some level of online privacy. Bumble for example allows you to use initials shortened versions of your name or nicknames.

To show others you are genuine and allow you to weed out some scammers many apps offer the ability for you to verify your photos via biometrics. Bumble uses artificial intelligence (AI) for verification which shows up as a blue shield on someone’s profile.

However this type of verification only proves the verification selfie and the profile pictures are of the same individual – other details on the profile could be false. To take a well-known example Netflix’s “Tinder Swindler” Shimon Hayut used real photos of himself and would have evaded these checks.

For additional privacy RAINN a US-based nonprofit organisation focusing on protecting people from sexual violence advises using different photos from your social media pages on your dating profile: “It’s easy to do a reverse image search with Google. If your dating profile has a photo that also shows up on your Instagram or Facebook account it will be easier for someone to find you on social media.”

Be careful not to post any personal details such as where you work out or your address. Match Group which owns Hinge and Tinder advises being “vague” when setting up your profile. Once you are chatting to people never provide financial information to anyone a spokeswoman at Match Group warns.

Pros and cons of moving conversations to WhatsApp

Dating apps don’t include end-to-end encryption – the gold standard of security protection that means no one can read your messages even the app maker itself – but messaging app WhatsApp does. Does this mean it’s better and more private to move your conversations to WhatsApp?

The majority of romance fraud takes place on WhatsApp or via text once the conversation has moved off the dating service Hannah Shimko Online Dating Association

Not really. While your WhatsApp messages will be completely private it’s not as easy to root out any bad behaviour which dating apps are good at monitoring to help you stay safe. Bumble and Match recommend keeping conversations within the app so they can monitor any harassment or other bad behaviour.

The Online Dating Association also recommends you remain on the dating service until you feel you know the person you’ve been matched with and ideally after you’ve met them in person. “Dating services have processes to deal with anything harmful happening in a conversation” says Hannah Shimko communications and policy director at the Online Dating Association. “In our research we see the majority of romance fraud taking place on WhatsApp or via text message once the conversation has moved off the dating service and the scammer has freedom to manipulate.”

Dating app safety features include Bumble’s “private detector” which uses AI to detect and blur nude images. Meanwhile Match Group uses AI to proactively detect language that could be harmful. If something is detected in a message a feature asks: “Does this bother you?” and encourages you to report it.

You can easily block and report people through most dating apps before and after you are matched with them.

WhatsApp allows you to block people too but there are other things to consider. Moving to WhatsApp requires exchanging phone numbers which may be trackable via search engines or social media platforms says Jake Moore global cybersecurity adviser at Slovakia-based company ESET. “It is very important to keep conversations within the platform until you are confident.”

Should you link other social media accounts to your data profile?

It’s possible to link your social media accounts to dating apps but should you do this? Most experts think sharing information about your life requires a careful approach. It’s “very unwise” to link your social media accounts to your dating profile says Tom Gaffney principal security expert at security company F-Secure.

Some apps already give you the option to limit sharing your entire social media profile while exposing enough to let other users know you are genuine. For example Bumble allows you to connect your Instagram which will display your last 24 photos but won’t link out to your account reveal your social handle or display any other information such as captions or hashtags.

At the same time logging in via Facebook is a definite no-no because it allows additional data collection by the app even if it’s not displayed publicly. “If you create a login with your Facebook account apps such as Hinge can access Facebook data including your name phone number and marital status” says Gaffney.

With this in mind create separate login details and usernames for your dating accounts using your mobile number or email address when possible.

How can I see how much data dating apps collect?

Dating apps can collect vast amounts of data and this is often shared with third parties such as advertisers.

Before signing up it’s a good idea to go through your chosen app’s privacy policy and take into account what it will use your data for. Hinge’s privacy policy for example describes how collecting data is necessary for using the app and to keep you safe by monitoring behaviour. However it also adds that your information can be used to “provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you”.

If you give it permission the dating app can collect your geolocation data as well as photos and videos. This information can be shared within the Match Group companies.

Bumble’s privacy policy details similar data collection including device identifiers location based on your IP address and your age to share with advertisers.

Once you have signed up one way of finding out the eye-watering amount of information an app has on you is a data subject access request. This is something that’s possible as part of EU and UK data protection regulation.

It’s a good idea to make a subject access request after you’ve been using an app for a few weeks says James Walker chief executive of consumer data action service Rightly. Once you’ve finished using the app it’s best to send a deletion request. “Under EU regulation the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the company has to respond within a calendar month and confirm it has erased all the data it has about you” Walker says.

What else can I do to stay secure and private?

Dating apps can be a security and privacy minefield but there are steps you can take to stay safe. To protect yourself from hackers it’s a good idea to use two-factor authentication such as an authenticator app in addition to strong passwords plus a password manager if possible.

The dating sites themselves offer multiple features to help you stay safe. In Bumble for instance there is the option of using the app in “incognito mode” which allows you to hide your profile and only appear to those whom you have swiped right on.

You should also look at the privacy settings to see what limits you can apply to your profile. Hinge users can customise their privacy settings to control what others see while Bumble uses your location to help match you with people nearby but you can turn this function off in the smartphone app privacy settings.

In the end it’s a trade-off. In order to get the most functionality out of a dating app you’ll have to give up some of your personal data to the app itself. It’s then down to you to limit the amount of data you provide to the dating app as well as to potential matches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjIvMDcvY29uY2FjYWYtdy1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtdXN3bnQtdnMtbWV4aWNvLW1hdGNoLWhpc3RvcnktcHJldmlldy1maXZlLXRoaW5ncy10by1rbm930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Things to Know: Mexico,"With six points through two matches the USA has already punched its ticket to Australia and New Zealand and is guaranteed to finish no worse than second in Group A. The Americans are assured to top Group A with a win or draw against Mexico. Haiti and Jamaica are both on three points and will square off on Monday to determine which of the two Caribbean nations will grab the automatic berth to the World Cup. Due to a superior goal differential a win or draw against Jamaica would send Haiti to its first ever Women’s World Cup while Jamaica needs a victory to secure a top-two finish in the group.



Mexico’s World Cup hopes now hang on a spot in the intercontinental playoff where 10 teams will compete for the final three spots in the expanded 32-team field for Australia/New Zealand 2023. However reaching the intercontinental playoff will be no small feat as Mexico must beat the USA – something it has only done once in 41 all-time meetings between the regional rivals – and must also overtake Jamaica or Haiti on goal differential to climb into third in the group standings.





INSIDE THE ROSTER

Mexico’s roster for the 2022 Concacaf W Championship is comprised of 15 players who play their club soccer domestically in Liga MX Femenil including six from four-time overall champions Tigres UANL and four from reigning Apertura champions Chivas. Forward Alicia Cervantes who plays for Chivas has led the league in scoring each of the past two seasons but has totaled just one shot in 68 minutes of action at the 2022 Concacaf W Championship.



Two players – goalkeeper Emily Alvarado who plays her club soccer in France for Stade de Reims and midfielder Stephany Mayor who plays for Tigres have played every minute for Mexico so far this tournament.



Of the eight players playing their club soccer outside of Mexico five compete in the United States with two college players (Maricarmen Reyes from UCLA and Alexia Delgado from Arizona State) and three NWSL Players.

SERIES HISTORY: USA vs. MEXICO

Monday’s match in Monterrey will be the 42nd meeting all-time between the USA and Mexico which will move Mexico into tie with Sweden for the fourth most common opponent in USA history trailing only Canada (62 games) China PR (58) and Norway (50). The USA leads the overall series with Mexico 39-1-1 and has won the last 15 head-to-head meetings between the teams by an overall margin of 64-4.



The USA and Mexico squared off most recently in the Send-Off Series in July of 2021 prior to the USWNT’s departure for the Tokyo Olympics. The teams played twice in East Hartford Connecticut resulting in a pair of 4-0 wins for the USA on July 1 and July 5.



This will be the first meeting between the USA and Mexico in a competitive match since squaring off on February 7 2020 in the semifinals of Concacaf Olympic Qualifying. The USA won 4-0 behind goals from Rose Lavelle Samantha Mewis (x2) and Christen Press to clinch its spot in the Tokyo Olympics.



Mexico is the opponent the USA has faced most frequently in World Cup and Olympic Qualifying with the teams meeting 13 times previously in Concacaf Qualifying. The USA has won 12 of those 13 meetings with Mexico’s only victory in qualifying – and only win ever against the USA – coming in the last matchup between the teams in Mexico a 2-1 victory for the home side in the semifinals of World Cup Qualifying in Cancun. Mexico’s only other result against the USA came during an October 2007 friendly in Albuquerque New Mexico drawing 1-1.

GROWING THE GAME

Despite disappointing results in its first two games at the Concacaf W Championship women’s soccer has made significant strides in Mexico in recent years. The Federación Mexicana de Fútbol officially launched the Liga MX Femenil in 2017 and the league has shown some tremendous growth and been successful both on the field and in the stands drawing some impressive crowds.



When originally founded Liga MX Femenil had been restricted to allowing only Mexican-born players though in 2018 a rule change allowed teams to sign up to six Mexican-American players and at present teams are now allowed to sign up to four foreign-born players. There are several Americans playing in the league including former U.S. Youth International and UCLA star Mia Fishel (Tigres UNAL) and former Cal-State Fullerton player and Orlando Pride forward Christina Burkenroad (CF Monterrey) who is Mexican-American.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3ZpZXcvMjAyMi1ibGl0emNoYW1wcy1ncm91cC1zdGFnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amari Cooper Triumphs 2022 BlitzChamps Group Stage,"Amari Cooper Triumphs 2022 BlitzChamps Group Stage

Chess.com's newest event BlitzChamps the most ambitious crossover of 2022 commenced on Saturday pitting six NFL all-stars against each other over the chess board in a bid for $100000 for their favorite charity.

Split into two groups of three the participants played a double round-robin where the top two finishers progressed to the championship bracket while the lower-ranked players gain entry into the consolation bracket in which they will vie for redemption.

Wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns Amari Cooper was the standout in Pool A winning both of his matches against Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie and New York Giants outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux. Group B was edged out by NFL legend and headliner of the event Larry Fitzgerald alongside retired cornerback Will Davis who finished ahead of San Francisco 49ers defensive end Arik Armstead.

The championship and consolations finals of BlitzChamps will be decided on Sunday July 10th starting at 1 p.m. PT / 22:00 CEST.

Live broadcast of BlitzChamps hosted by IM Danny Rensch and former NFL player and mathematician John Urschel.

Group A - Amari Cooper Undefeated

The first BlitzChamps matchup saw Thibodeaux take on Awuzie in what proved to be a gripping encounter that the latter won 2-0. The second game of the match is where Awuzie really took hold punishing Thibodeaux for leaving his king in the center and setting up a sneaky checkmate in just 22 moves!

For many of Thibodeaux's fans the result would have come as a surprise given he has his own Chess.com club and has been cited in mainstream media claiming that chess is one of the reasons for his on-field success.

If anything Thibodeaux finishing at the bottom of group A merely indicated that the level of chess on display was remarkably high compared to some of the legendary chess produced by the early stages of the event's predecessor PogChamps.

The second match between former teammates and longtime chess rivals Awuzie and Cooper required a tie-break to split the two which Cooper won in dramatic fashion. The match was certainly the emergence of a tournament frontrunner in Cooper.

Their first game followed a theoretical line of the Sicilian Defense: O'Kelly Yerevan System for six moves but was marred by a mouse slip on move 10 eliciting a hilarious reaction from Awusie.

Ever the sportsman Cooper offered a takeback but in the interest of ""making things interesting"" Awuzie rolled with the punches and despite his opponent's NFL rookie record of being the fastest to record 1000 receiving yards managed to outpace him over the board and force his opponents' resignation with a rolling passed pawn.

The second game saw the two engage in five minutes' worth of banter after Awuzie accidentally pre-removed his queen into oblivion a blunder that cost him the game. Awuzie refusing to move tried to ""ice the kicker"" (in this case Cooper) using football analogies to try and rationally explain his side of the story. The moment immediately became one of the most entertaining pieces of chess content this year. At the time of writing the clip has received over 10000 views on Twitch in five hours.

Despite gaining a good position in the deciding blitz game the cornerback was again unlucky and blundered away from a great position opening up the field for Cooper to run away with the match.

The final matchup of Pool A saw Cooper hit his stride and shut down any chance of Thibodeaux reaching the championship bracket with a sweeping 2-0 victory. Assaulting the New York Giants star's kingside early Thibodeaux was left with no choice but to present his best chess version of the dime defense but was outclassed by a rampant Cooper who played with a CAPS score of 91.9!

Cooper followed up with a solid performance in the final game of the group showing good calculation technique and winning a piece off the back of a forcing combination.

Group B - Davis Tops Group As Overtime King

BlitzChamps headliner Fitzgerald was quick out of the blocks in his first match against Armstead showing poise in his rebuttal of his opponent's kingside escapades.

The second game seemed to be going smoothly for the ""future Hall-of-Famer""; however time pressure got the better of him with checkmate just moves away and he had to settle for a draw. The result was enough to get him over the line with a 1.5-0.5 score.

Armstead recovered well in his second match against Davis who captured his first point of the event with a convincing win.

Unwilling to accept a 2-0 defeat Davis surged in his second game showing acute understanding of the Ruy Lopez and stacking up on a pin to level the match.

After showing great fighting spirit to take the match into overtime Davis proved that he was not a one-trick pony and overcame Armstead with a brilliant remove-the-defender tactic to win his match and secure a spot in the championship bracket.

With both players already guaranteed progression to the championship bracket the match between Fitzgerald and Davis was supposed to be a dead rubber but ended up being of the most exciting of the day. Needing a tiebreak to separate them it was Davis who emerged as the surprise winner after enterprising play through the middle files.

After the match Fitzgerald gave insight into the best chess players in the NFL foreshadowing a potential future edition of this event!

Today's results mean that Cooper will take on Davis while Fitzgerald takes on Awuzie in the championship bracket. If the round games are anything to go by tomorrow's finals will make for great chess theater and give a definitive answer to the big question: Who is the NFL's best in chess?

BlitzChamps is an event where NFL stars will compete in a series of rapid games to prove who has the best moves! The event is happening on July 9 and 10 at 1 p.m. PT with players competing for a piece of the $100000 prize fund for their favorite charity not to mention the bragging rights.

The next tiebreaker is lowest number of points based on the number of yellow and red cards in all group matches followed by the drawing of lots a situation which could come into play in Group B.



Canada and Costa Rica have both qualified for the World Cup and have clinched a spot in the semifinals but the final order of finish in the group will come down to the final match day. The teams will square off a 7 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. local on July 11 at Estadio BBVA and enter the match deadlocked on points (six each) goals scored (seven) goal differential (+7) and total cards accumulated (one yellow card each). Should Canada and Costa Rica tie the match and receive the same number of cards in the match Concacaf will have to draw lots to determine who finishes first in the group.



The other Group B match between Panama and Trinidad & Tobago which will be played at 7 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. local at Estadio Universitario will determine the third-place finisher from that group. Both nations are in search of their first points of the tournament though Panama has the superior goal differential and would secure the inter-confederation playoff berth with a draw.

BALANCED ATTACK STAUNCH DEFENSE LEAD RED WHITE AND BLUE

The USWNT has been in fine form through its first two matches of the Concacaf W Championship opening the competition with a 3-0 win over Haiti on July 4 and following it up with a 5-0 victory over Jamaica on July 7.

The USA leads all teams in the tournament with eight total goals scored which have come from six different players. Alex Morgan – who tallied twice against Haiti – and Sophia Smith – who netted a brace of her own against Jamaica – lead the USA with two goals each and are tied for second in scoring among all players this tournament. Midge Purce Rose Lavelle Kristie Mewis and Trinity Rodman have one goal apiece.



Mallory Pugh leads the USA and ranks second in the tournament with two assists this tournament while Kelley O’Hara Naomi Girma Sofia Huerta and Ashley Sanchez have also tallied assists for the USWNT.



Defensively the USA is one of three teams yet to concede a goal this tournament and has allowed just four shots on goal. The USWNT has now kept a clean sheet in each of its last 30 matches in World Cup and Olympic Qualifying a streak that dates back to its World Cup qualifying campaign in 2010. Defender Alana Cook leads the USA with 180 total minutes played this tournament followed by Pugh (163 minutes) and defender Emily Fox (135).

MEXICO ROSTER NOTES

Mexico was stunned in its first two games falling to Jamaica 1-0 on a header goal from Reggae Girlz star Bunny Shaw and then fell to Haiti 3-0 as Les Grenadières scored on three set plays – two penalty kicks converted by Roselord Borgella (14th minute) and Nerilia Mondesir (67th) and one free kick (which was smashed home by Sherly Jeudy in the 78th) that resulted from a last defender call that led to a red card ejection for Greta Espinoza who will be suspended for the game against the USA.

Mexico is eliminated from qualifying directly to the 2023 World Cup and will need a win over the USA to even have a chance to finish third and earn a berth to the 10-team FIFA Inter-Confederation Playoffs that will send the final three nations to Australia and New Zealand.

The Federación Mexicana de Fútbol officially launched the Liga MX Femenil in 2017 and the league has shown some tremendous growth and been successful both on the field and in the stands and fifteen members of this Mexico roster play in the league.

Of the 14 players on Mexico’s roster playing in their domestic league six play for the four-time overall champion Tigres UANL . Four play for reigning Apertura champions Chivas two play for Club America and one each for Pumas and CF Monterrey.

That leaves eight players playing outside Mexico which includes five playing in the USA three of them in the NWSL and two in college. Defender Jimena Lopez who played at Texas A&M plays with several USWNT teammates at OL Reign midfielder Maria Sanchez who hails from Idaho and played collegiately at Idaho and Santa Clara plays for the Houston Dash and forward Diane Ordonez who was a youth international for the USA and hails from the Dallas area and played at UVA plays for the NC Courage.

Mexico also has several other players with U.S. ties. Defender Bianca Sierra who is a star for Tigres is from Mountain View Calif. and played college soccer at Auburn.

Chiva forward Alicia Cervantes has led the Mexico league in scoring for the past two seasons.

The matches in July of 2021 were first against the USA for manager Monica Vergara who took over in January of 2021. She is the first female head coach in Mexico WNT history. The 39-year-old Vergara who is very much under intense pressure from the Mexican media after the very poor start to this tournament was a long-time member of the Mexican National Team and debuted as a teenager. She was a member of the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup Team as a 16-year-old playing against Germany and Italy. She played against the USA prior to the World Cup on March 28 1999 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnluZXRuZXdzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvcmtzNTFlbHhz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italian soccer fans perform Nazi salute in Champions League match,"Italian fans were caught in the camera lens on Tuesday performing the Nazi salute and making monkey chants and sounds toward the local audience.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Perry has become a national figure for heading up the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus during a speakership battle and his efforts to help Trump stay in power after losing the 2020 presidential election.

REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina

Russia's rebranded McDonald's restaurants temporarily stopped selling french fries citing a potato shortage.

Vkusno & tochka said a poor harvest of the necessary type of potato last year is to blame.

However Russia's agriculture ministry disagrees claiming there isn't any shortage of spuds.

French fries are off the menu for now at rebranded McDonald's restaurants in Russia.

The new chain Vkusno & tochka which translates to ""Tasty and that's it"" has temporarily stopped dishing out the classic side claiming it's facing a potato shortage. The restaurants reopened in June under a new name and new ownership after McDonald's left the country in May in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine.

Vkusno & tochka told Russian news outlet TASS that a poor harvest last year is to blame. Vkusno & tochka also said it's ""impossible to import from markets that could become temporary suppliers of potatoes for enterprises in Russia.""

Russia's ministry of agriculture however begs to differ. In a statement on Telegram titled ""There are potatoes – and that's it"" a clear nod to the fast food chain's name the agency said the country is ""fully supplied with potatoes including processed ones.""

""In addition crops from the new harvest are already arriving which rules out the possibility of a shortage"" the ministry wrote on Telegram.

Vkusno & tochka said fries may not return to its menu until fall. It added that its ""rustic potatoes"" which are thicker than fries may also be temporarily unavailable.

In Japan another fast food giant has made changes to its own menu as it faces a potato shortage.

In addition to this world's top fast-food chain the Chinese robotics company has also worked with other partners across multiple industries to steadily expand its presence in Poland the Netherlands the UK and other European countries. Its robots are deployed across a wide range of scenarios including gas stations retail electronics outlets restaurants and hotels among others.

BellaBot is serving at McDonald's Slovenia.

At the end of 2021 McDonald's Slovenia started gradually introducing dozens of Pudu's BellaBot robots into the workforce in a move to assist restaurant staff with the serving and delivery of food items as well as to perform other duties. The video of BellaBot delivering food at McDonald's has gone viral on TikTok with millions of views worldwide.

The global restaurant sector is currently undergoing significant consolidation as a result of the pandemic raising concerns among restaurant-goers and leading many to rethink their relationship with their dining environment. Expectations for sanitary and safety conditions have grown exponentially. With these concerns in mind McDonald's Slovenia decided to use AI-powered food delivery robots. In addition to lower cost and higher efficiency ""hiring"" the robots also reduced person-to-person interaction and thus the risk of virus transmission. The move has proven a winner with added convenience for customers alongside a boost in the evolution of the brand across the intelligent foodservice ecosystem.

Moreover BellaBot serving as a concrete example of the new intelligent business model has also been engaged in multiple tourism promotion campaigns launched by the government of Slovenia and its tourism offices.

Just since the beginning of the year Pudu Robotics has signed agreements with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Jordan Metro Group's Media Markt Japan's Skylark Group Shell Poland and other well-known brands with international stature. To date Pudu Robotics has shipped over 40000 of its robots around the world. Pudu Robotics' presence being expanded from the foodservice sector into cleaning disinfection and building services is expected to increase the company's user base and pave the way for the creation of robots that enhance both human productivity and daily life quality based on customer demands.

Pushkinskaya Square in Moscow was crowded in mid-June: with large numbers of people gathering for the opening of the new chain near the building where the first McDonald's restaurant in Russia opened in the 1990s.

Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin was also there to visit the opening of a restaurant of the new oddly named chain that was supposed to replace McDonald's.

Sobyanin thanked the management for saving business and jobs and assured the visitors that everything would be the same as before.

But it didn't work out that way. In just three weeks prices have increased by an average of 10% mold has been spotted in buns and expired sauce has been served with fries.

And a couple of days ago news broke that there would be no more fries due to problems with Russia’s potato harvest.

The Russian management although they had worked at McDonald's for years has made some gross errors and the chain is facing a fiasco due to the quality of its management Ukrainian restaurateurs believe.

Russia’s sham McDonald's is not just a restaurant but a symbol of the changes that have taken place in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thirty years later history is repeating itself – but in reverse.

Came in came out

The first restaurant of the U.S. fast food chain opened in Moscow in Soviet times in January 1990.

Russians lined up in kilometer-long queues to buy their first McDonald’s fries and cola. The people's love for the novelty of fast food ensured there was an ""American dream boom"" in Russia. The company opened more than 850 establishments over three decades including 126 in Moscow alone.

The wonderful story ended on Feb. 24. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine the company decided to exit the market. McDonald's suspended operations in early March and announced its withdrawal from Russia in mid-May.

Continuing to do business in Russia is ""no longer appropriate and does not correspond to McDonald's values"" the company said.

The business was sold to Alexander Govor one of the company's local partners who had developed the chain in Siberia on franchise terms.

For Govor fast food is just one of his businesses. He also owns the Grand Medica chain of private clinics in Novokuznetsk and the Park Inn hotel. But the NefteKhimService oil refinery is his main asset.

The new owner decided to restart the chain as quickly as possible and the first restaurants opened their doors on June 12. They came up with a strange name for the establishments ""Vkusno i tochka"" and an equally exotic logo namely two sticks symbolizing French fries and an orange dot symbolizing a burger are depicted on a green background.



Together the stylized ensemble of shapes resembles a person on all fours seen from the side with their head near the ground and buttocks thrust into the air.

While the logo looks well odd it’s the strange name that has many scratching their heads.

""It just hurts the business to name the chain like that"" believes Olga Nasonova CEO of Restaurant Consulting.

The sham McDonald’s menu is similar to the original’s one. For example visitors can order Grand Double Grand and Grand De Luxe burgers nuggets cherry pie waffle cone ice cream milkshake applesauce in the Russian McDonald's clone. Local lemonade is offered in the establishments instead of Coca-Cola products which are not manufactured or supplied to Russia.

Dishes with surprises

""Vkusno i tochka"" has already been involved in scandals three times over three weeks of operation – which is simply unheard for the original McDonald's.

At first Russian Telegram channels posted photos judging by which restaurants started selling beer. Later the chain's press service denied this information saying that the beer had been offered to visitors by former McDonald's franchisees and they had nothing to do with that.

Another visitor to a restaurant in Moscow posted a photo of a burger with mold. In addition a burger without meat was sold to a visitor in a restaurant in Tula.

Even Russian journalist Ksenia Sobchak did not hold back from criticizing ""Vkusno i tochka"" who published on Telegram messenger a photo of expired sauce for fries in a restaurant on Arbat Street in Moscow.

""A follower sent a photo and at first I sat and looked at it whether it was fake or not"" Sobchak said.

""And you know this print from a cucumber seems to say that 'Vkusno i tochka' followed by f***ing logo and f***ing name has lowered the quality of burgers to this level.""

The chain's press service admitted that there were indeed expired sauces and reported that they had been withdrawn from sale.

Why does the Russian clone fail to replicate success of the original McDonald's?

Dmitriy Pogrebytskyy co-owner of the Pesto Café chain in Ukraine recalls how he worked at McDonald's for six-and-a-half years – rising from an ordinary employee to a restaurant manager. The chain has strict standards for management performance product quality and service. Russia has already faced problems with this.

""They’re disrupting the concept and diluting the audience"" Pogrebytskyy said.

""McDonald's is a family restaurant where children's birthday parties are celebrated. But how to do this if the next table is drinking beer?""

Nasonova adds that the problems arising in the new chain are surprising.

""All the management technology and equipment remained"" she said.

""The standards are also known. It's not clear why the new chain is making such stupid mistakes.""

Nasonova believes that the owner will have to close or suffer losses if he takes such an approach to the restaurant business.

The owner however does not appear discouraged by all the problems: Govor has promised to increase the number of restaurants to 1000 within five or six years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtcnVzc2lhLXZrdXNuby1pLXRvY2hrYS1mcmVuY2gtZnJpZXMtc3RvcHBlZC1zZXJ2aW5nLXBvdGF0by1zaG9ydGFnZS0xNzIzMTQy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia's McDonald's Pulls Fries From the Menu After Running Out of Potatoes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/mcdonalds-russia-vkusno-i-tochka-french-fries-stopped-serving-potato-shortage-1723142 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9tY2RvbmFsZHMtcnVzc2lhLXZrdXNuby1pLXRvY2hrYS1mcmVuY2gtZnJpZXMtc3RvcHBlZC1zZXJ2aW5nLXBvdGF0by1zaG9ydGFnZS0xNzIzMTQy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY2FtcC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZGlzYXBwb2ludGluZy1jdXN0b21lcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Went Wrong With Camp McDonald's? — Eat This Not That,"Camp McDonald's is off to a rocky start this week—and it's all Grimace's fault.

The camp kicked off as scheduled on Tuesday July 5 in the McDonald's app. Billed as a ""first-of-its-kind…virtual camp experience"" camp-goers were enticed with promises of food discounts limited-edition merch menu hacks and music performances from a lineup of big-name pop musicians.

McDonald's May Be Ditching This Longstanding Deal & Customers Are Angry

Just a few days in however and it appears Camp McDonald's already has a mutiny on its hands. Day One's big event—the release of a much-hyped Grimace Pool Float—was a swing-and-a-miss: From the looks of it demand for the pool float greatly exceeded expectations leaving some customers waiting in line for multiple hours only to be informed at the end of their wait that the merch had sold out.

Grimace-gate was accompanied by complaints of mismanagement of the menu deals with customers claiming that workers at their local McDonald's were unaware of the Camp McDonald's promos.

While McDonald's has insisted that the fault lies with a third-party merch vendor and not with the McDonald's app the chain has taken steps to remedy the pool float situation promising to ""[reach] out to fans who tried to buy the float (Tuesday) on a first-come first-serve basis to fulfill orders at no cost.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device (HVAD) was designed for patients battling severe heart failure. Once the market leader HVAD is now associated with a number of life-threatening manufacturing defects that resulted in serious adverse patient events including at least 14 deaths.

Several medical technology experts said it was surprising HeartWare remained on the market as long as it did.

""I think the question [at the time] was 'Why hasn't it been pulled from the market yet?'"" said Madris Kinard CEO of Pennsylvania-based Device Events. ""When it happened we were thinking 'Of course. This needed to happen.'""

In 2016 Medtronic spent $1.1 billion to acquire the maker of HeartWare calling it a leading innovator in the cardiac category. The move expanded the company's heart-failure business with the addition of what was then the world's smallest VAD system weighing just 5 ounces and smaller than a hockey puck.

Medtronic’s HeartWare device.

Medtronic's pitch: progressively improve the product with its expertise and size.

Ventricular assist devices are often implanted when a patient needs a heart transplant but no donor hearts are available. Without an implanted device those patients would die.

In the narrow niche of VAD products it had one primary competitor: Abbott Laboratories' HeartMate device.

""These pumps are a last resort"" said Dr. Deirdre Mooney a cardiologist with the Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane Wash. ""It's an essential technology.""

HeartWare and HeartMate rank among the most intricate devices implanted in patients.

""These are complicated devices in a complicated clinical situation"" said Michael Argentieri vice president of transition and business solutions for ECRI a Pennsylvania-based independent nonprofit that tracks the safety of medical devices and technologies. ""This device has basically a propeller in it actually an impeller to pump the blood around.""

But after years of research and development Medtronic halted all sales of the product. What went wrong?

Dr. Alexis Shafii surgical director of heart transplantation at the Baylor-St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston has implanted hundreds of the assist pumps. For several years he said he preferred HeartWare over Abbott's device.

Medtronic's HeartWare was smaller and in Shafii's opinion easier to implant than the Abbott device.

""A lot of good came from the HeartWare pump"" Shafii said.

But when Abbott rolled out HeartMate 3 first available in the U.S. in 2017 it became the market's preferred device with lower thrombosis risks than the Medtronic device. Abbott's VAD sales rose and Medtronic's declined.

Medtronic had been working on product updates since it acquired HeartWare — occasionally inviting doctors like Shafii to visit their operational headquarters in Fridley for a preview.

""They had a lot of stuff in the pipeline"" Shafii said of his visit to Medtronic three years ago.

One product in development was the MVAD (Miniature Ventricular Assist Device) that would have been even smaller than HVAD.

But those updates and new versions never made it to market.

""Medtronic was investing in several updates to the HeartWare system including a new controller that enabled remote patient monitoring and a development program for a fully-implantable LVAD [left ventricular assist device] system"" said Erika Winkels a Medtronic spokeswoman. ""These were in various stages of development but had not yet received FDA approval.""

Sales numbers in the company's fiscal 2020 filing show HeartWare losing ground due to ""competitive pressures.""

According to a securities filing the HVAD system brought in $141 million in revenue for Medtronic's fiscal 2021 — about half of its sales in 2015 which was the last full year as an independent company.

Meanwhile manufacturing defects with the device that predated Medtronic's ownership became harder to dismiss.

FDA data shows 12 recalls — either Class 1 or Class 2 — for HeartWare from May 2013 through July 2016 before Medtronic completed the acquisition.

""There were warnings for years before that device came off the market"" said Dr. Rita Redberg a cardiologist with the University of California-San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine.

Redberg called the FDA oversight of HeartWare ""very disappointing.""

In 2014 the FDA issued HeartWare a warning letter outlining several concerns after an inspection of its plant in Florida. Among the issues the FDA cited was a ""failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action.""

Between 2010 and 2013 HeartWare received at least 27 complaints and reports of two deaths and four serious injuries according to a copy of the FDA warning letter which no longer appears on the agency's website.

Winkels Medtronic's spokeswoman said the company did its standard due diligence before closing the deal.

""Medtronic was aware of the warning letter and reviewed and understood HeartWare management's plan to address open issues from the warning letter"" Winkels said.

Medtronic ceased sales and distribution of HVAD on June 3 2021. By that time Medtronic reported receiving more than 100 complaints related to defects with the pump the FDA said. The problem was blamed for 14 deaths.

CEO Geoff Martha speaking that day at a virtual leadership conference addressed the issue in his opening remarks.

""The Abbott device is better for patients"" Martha said. ""Our system has had a number of quality issues since we acquired it that we haven't been able to completely resolve.""

Martha pointed to a just-published study that found Abbott's HeartMate 3 had a lower mortality rate than HeartWare. The company cited a growing body of evidence that HeartMate patients were reporting fewer adverse neurological events than with its device.

That same day Abbott issued a statement saying it had ""capacity and supply to effectively support the growing demand"" for its HeartMate 3 device. Reports have estimated the cost of a HeartMate device at $95000 and is covered by insurance.

Since the market withdrawal FDA scrutiny has increased. Federal data show 21 separate recalls for different lots of HeartWare devices from June 2021 through today including two new Class 1 recalls — the most serious — last month for welding defects and risk of battery malfunction.

In a statement the federal agency said ""The FDA is continuing to work closely with Medtronic and will take appropriate action to ensure the health and safety of device users remains our highest priority.""

During its fiscal 2022 which ended in April Medtronic took $1.1 billion in charges related to its exit from the HVAD business.

Patients and families that suffered injuries or deaths due to HeartWare face an uphill legal battle due in part to a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that barred lawsuits over any device that had received premarket approval from the FDA.

The case involved a Medtronic device. A New York man was trying to sue over an injury caused when a heart catheter burst during an angioplasty procedure.

""That decision was very bad for patients who are injured by high-risk medical devices"" said Dr. Michael Carome director of the health research group for the Washington D.C.-based Public Citizen a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. ""They really don't have any legal recourse.""

Medtronic previously paid $54.5 million in 2018 to settle claims from HeartWare investors who argued the company misled them about the safety of the device prior to Medtronic's acquisition.

Medtronic said it's committed to the safety of patients who still have the device.

""Although Medtronic no longer distributes the HVAD system we are committed to ongoing quality assessments and control measures to further patient safety and therapy effectiveness"" Winkels said.

Today about 3500 patients still have Medtronic's HeartWare implanted. More than half of those devices were a part of the June recalls.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Here's how,"Every pharmaceutical company is constantly searching for its next blockbuster — the billion-dollar drug that dominates a market brings in hordes of customers and deposits hefty profits in drugmakers’ bank accounts. But with every blockbuster too comes its expiration date.

Pharmaceutical giants including Merck Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie are set to lose key patents on some of their most lucrative drugs this decade. As the clock counts down to the end of that exclusivity more affordable generic and biosimilar alternatives are waiting to enter the market — taking a portion of the giants’ blockbuster business driving prescription prices down and giving consumers potentially better options.

With competition closing in these pharmaceutical companies are bracing for impact. But they’re also prepping their own playbooks healthcare analysts and industry academics say — and looking ahead to both survive business shake-ups and stymy their competitors.

What is a blockbuster drug?

A blockbuster drug is one that generates at least $1 billion in annual revenue — although in more recent years their potential for profits have climbed far higher. Best-selling drugs like AbbVie’s Humira for one have reached annual sales of more $20 billion annually.

“It’s very hard to try to replace that” said Matt Phipps a biotech analyst at investment bank William Blair. “The reason these companies became as big as they are is because they found that one drug that really worked and could drive growth to where they are now.”

Many of these blockbusters are known as small-molecule drugs which make up 90% of all medications sold. Typically when a small-molecule drug — which has a low molecular weight and is typically taken orally — loses it patent it can can also lose up 80% of its sales in one year according to Phipps.

But the upcoming sweep of patent expirations is also set to impact biologic therapies — a class of drugs developed from living materials such as blood proteins plants and microorganisms. These drugs are usually administered through an IV or an injection. Because they’re more complicated to replicate the pace of their diminishing sales is different than that of small-molecule drugs.

In the case of Humira — a biologic used to treat arthritis and other autoimmune conditions — the medication began facing competition from biosimilar alternatives last year. In 2023 sales of Humira fell fell 32% to $14 billion. More recently Humira sales continued to fall 9% to $2.3 billion in the three months ending March 31.

Now pharma giants are taking steps now to prepare for similar revenue losses when their patents start to expire in the next few years. But Big Pharma also has a plan in place — and a well-run playbook for delaying or offsetting impending generic competition.

The first play: File more patents

“Even six months of a $10 billion drug is worth a hell of a lot more than the first six months of a new therapy that’s launching” Phipps said. “Step one is always try to maximize what you have.”

Because drugs are patented years before they get regulatory approval and hit the market pharmaceutical companies try to extend their exclusivity rights as much as possible. Drug companies do this by filing not only patents on their medications but also on the manufacturing process and even how a drug is administered. All those patents add up — and can delay generic versions and biosimilars from entering the market.

But recently this strategy has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. “I don’t know if we’ll see quite as much of that [in the future] as we had in the past 10 years” Phipps said. In April the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the second time challenged what it called “junk” patents or improper patent listings in the Food and Drug Administration’s Orange Book — the official list of FDA-approved drugs.

Melissa Wasserman a professor at the University of Texas Austin who researches drug patent law said this is positive development. “Those patents that are listed in the Orange Book can have a blocking effect” Wasserman said. “You as a generic can’t come on until you basically deal with every patent that’s listed in the Orange Book for that drug.”

Another patenting strategy the companies deploy: Combine drugs then patent those new formulations. In one case Bristol Myers Squibb is losing several key patents in 2028 including its best-selling Opdivo. In 2023 the melanoma-fighting medication alone accounted for 20% of the company’s $45 billion in annual revenue.

In 2022 the company launched Opdualag a combination of Opdivo with the antibody relatlimab-rmbw after the combined drug was found to have increased efficacy for treating melanoma. It was “purely a patent extension technique” Phipps said although the combined medication does make it a bit easier to administer to patients. But sales of Opdualag skyrocketed 72% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024 reaching $206 million.

The second play: Offset losses with newer drugs

“Eventually all your patents run out and generic competition enters” said Mike Perrone a biotech specialist at healthcare management consulting firm Baird. What pharmaceutical companies turn to next he added involves relying on their internal pipelines.

After exhausting their options with patents pharmaceutical companies increase investment in their new and upcoming drugs to offset declining sales. But the timing has to be right given it takes a while for a new drug to reach blockbuster-status revenue.

AbbVie the maker of the world’s once best-selling drug Humira is a good example of this being pulled off properly. When the pharma giant lost exclusive rights to Humira last year sales of the drug fell 32%. But by preparing and launching new potential blockbusters a few years before the patent’s expiration the company has been able to offset Humira’s losses.

AbbVie’s Skyrizi a treatment for plaque psoriasis launched in 2019 saw its sales rise 48% year over year to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of Rinqov a treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis that also debuted in 2019 soared 59% to $1.1 billion.

Meanwhile Merck the maker of Keytruda — which took the title of the world’s best-selling drug from Humira last year with $25 billion in sales — is now deploying a similar strategy. The U.S. FDA first approved Keytruda in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then it’s received approval to treat several types of cancers including lung cancer and carcinoma. In the first quarter of 2024 Keytruda accounted for nearly 44% of Merck’s $15.8 billion in total sales.

With Merck’s patent set to expire in 2028 it’s perhaps no coincidence that this year the company is launching Winrevair a drug for adults who have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. About 1% of the global population has the condition.

One more play: Snap up smaller companies and outsource

In one last strategic move pharmaceutical companies also acquire smaller biotech startups to absorb their drug pipelines. In effect the move allows them to outsource drug research and development — reducing their own financial risk as blockbuster revenue streams dry up.

“[T]he strategy over the past few years had been to buy things that had already been approved and were on the market so you don’t take any risk” Baird’s Perrone said. But companies have become more aggressive as of late he added — and have started to acquire startups based just on clinical trial results.

Take for example Bristol-Myers Squibb which is set to lose patents for three medications this decade: Eliquis Revlimid and Opdivo. Collectively these drugs accounted for 62% of the company’s total first-quarter sales of $11.9 billion this year. Perhaps it’s no surprise that in April during the company’s quarterly earnings report BMS also touted several of its recent acquisitions: Karuna Therapeutics RayzeBio Mirati Therapeutics and an exclusive license agreement with SystImmune.

In another case Merck — facing the expiration of Keytruda’s patent in four years — highlighted last month how it’s expanding its pipeline and portfolio of drugs with the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics.

Ultimately pharmaceutical giants have had a long time to prepare their plays for expiring blockbusters. “This has always been part of the ecosystem in the biotech world” Phipps said. “You never have a true long-term outlook for something. You always have to be innovating.” In other words it’s business as usual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9kYXRhLW5ld3MvbWVyY2stY28taW5jLXN0b2NrLXJpc2VzLW1vbmRheS1zdGlsbC11bmRlcnBlcmZvcm1zLW1hcmtldC1hMWQ1MDgzMy1jNTg1ZTZhMzQyMzbSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL2RhdGEtbmV3cy9tZXJjay1jby1pbmMtc3RvY2stcmlzZXMtbW9uZGF5LXN0aWxsLXVuZGVycGVyZm9ybXMtbWFya2V0LWExZDUwODMzLWM1ODVlNmEzNDIzNg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck & Co.

The gig economy is characterized by short-term contract work performed by independent workers who are paid in return for the ""gigs"" they complete. Example gig platforms include Uber Lyft Instacart Upwork and TaskRabbit. While these platforms bring about more job opportunities and lower barriers to entry growing evidence suggests its generation of significant societal problems including reduced worker well-being and perpetuated biases against already vulnerable populations. Most gig workers lack financial stability autonomy and have low earning efficiency. Prolonged working hours can also cause health issues and limited flexibility.

To address these growing societal concerns this project aims to build a community-centered meta-platform to provide decision support and data sharing for gig workers and policymakers. As a first step we are currently working with local policymakers and organizations gig workers and their advocates to 1.) understand their concerns challenges and considerations related to gig worker wellbeing and 2.) envision alternative futures for the gig workforce that holds platforms and policymakers accountable for promoting fairer and healthier systems. For workers we intend to develop a data-driven and human-centered decision-assistance environment to help them make ""smart"" decisions in navigating and selecting gigs. For policymakers we aim to provide a macro level perspective to aid in balancing their diverse set of objectives and constraints. Through a combination of changes from workers platforms local organizations and policymakers we hope to cocreate more vibrant and equitable working communities and environments for the gig workforce.

They have a16z funding Big ...,"The bad news? Diem was dying. The good news? Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching saw a way they could give it an afterlife.

It was the week before Thanksgiving in 2021 and the pair recall walking out of a meeting at the offices of Meta Platforms formerly Facebook in Menlo Park Calif. and realizing that after a fraught nearly three years the project they had been working on—Meta’s embattled crypto payments network Diem previously called Libra—could perhaps find new life outside the social media giant.

The duo (Ching 42 a software engineer working on the Diem blockchain and Meta’s crypto wallet Novi and Shaikh 36 who led strategic partnerships at Novi) had already been discussing taking the open-source codebase of Diem out of Meta and building it out externally once it was clear regulators would squash Diem. And following that meeting “Avery and I looked at each other…and we said ‘Wow I think we just got the green light’” to build the blockchain outside recounts Shaikh.

By early December Kyle Samani the managing partner and cofounder of crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital recalls relaxing by the pool in Miami after his firm’s summit had just wrapped up. Samani says he forgot he had a call scheduled with a couple of founders to pitch a prospective investment—but poolside he hopped on the phone.

Shaikh and Ching pitched their burgeoning blockchain startup to Samani and “after the phone call was over I walked over to Tushar [Jain cofounder and managing partner at Multicoin] who was like sitting 20 feet away” and explained the conversation he just had with the team at what would later be called Aptos Labs Samani recalls. “And [Jain] was like ‘All right we’re in. Let’s go.’ It was a very fast decision” Samani recounts. Multicoin chipped in a chunk of cash (they invested in equity with token warrants which is a common structure for such deals. Samani declined to provide the size of their investment). Multicoin is also invested in rival blockchain Solana.

Shaikh and Ching’s pitch was effectively taking the Diem codebase “and running with it” recalls Samani which meant building and launching a layer one or L1 blockchain. He believes a competitive differentiator for Aptos is the Move coding language that it uses designed at Meta which he considers to be “very opinionated in how it’s designed and it’s meant to make it harder to have bugs quite frankly.” And after the failure of bringing the technology to life at Meta “I love the fact that they said ‘Fuck this’ like ‘I don’t care what Facebook and the government says we’re gonna go make it happen’” says Samani.

Aptos’s cofounders Shaikh and Ching—who officially left Meta in December and are now CEO and CTO of the Palo Alto–based startup respectively—espouse a grandiose vision of “building a L1 for the next billion users”—but they’re trying to solve a basic problem. Despite numerous layer one blockchains working on making crypto applications easier and cheaper to build and use many of the current options still come with outages high fees and security vulnerabilities. The Aptos blockchain currently in a testing phase (the public and live version is expected to launch later in 2022) is aimed at being a decentralized general purpose blockchain—a safer and more scalable base for builders of things like NFT projects social media and DeFi or decentralized finance.

With ex–Big Tech founders promising technology and the top VC backers in crypto (in addition to Multicoin the startup also attracted Andreessen Horowitz or a16z Katie Haun Tiger Global FTX Ventures and others) to raise its March $200 million round Aptos Labs appears to have many of the ingredients for a recipe for success in the space. The startup raised funds at a valuation that’s reportedly between $1 billion and $2 billion and currently has about 60 employees (the company declined to comment on its valuation).

But in addition to the rapid and disastrous descent of the crypto market over recent weeks the startup is facing another more direct problem: In early March the company and CEO Shaikh were hit with a hefty lawsuit. Shari Glazer an entrepreneur and philanthropist whose family is the Glazer family which owns NFL team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and English football club Manchester United claims along with her firm Swoon Capital that Shaikh and Ching weren’t the only founders of the startup. Instead of Ching she claims she was a “50/50” partner with Shaikh in the venture entitled to half the startup’s “founder’s shares” in equity—what she claims is at least $1 billion.

A chip on their shoulder

On a video call in early May Ching and Shaikh look very dynamic sitting side by side: Ching is fairly clean-cut but casual; Shaikh sports a voluminous head of flowing gray hair (Ching jokes that when he first met Shaikh in person it was like going on a blind date: “He has professional pictures like a suit and short hair and I met him in person [and] I was very surprised.”).

If you ask them the pair describe themselves and each other as competitive.

The duo share a love of basketball: They say they play a pickup game at the Stanford campus on weekends with other basketball enthusiasts at blockchain companies (Shaikh warns that Ching “has an amazing jump shot and he’s not afraid to show it”). The two initially bonded over the sport when they first met in person in late 2021 while working at Meta after only seeing each other over Zoom since Shaikh says he was living on the East Coast at the time.

Ching describes his upbringing in Honolulu as “very relaxed…It was all about prioritizing family and friends and taking time to just enjoy life” he says. Shaikh meanwhile says he was born in Abu Dhabi and that his family immigrated in 1990 to Brighton Beach New York where Shaikh claims he grew up “quite humbly in a basement apartment.”

According to Samani Shaikh and Ching have a “chip on [their] shoulder” he says. “When you can sense that in an entrepreneur it’s usually a very good sign” he posits. In practice that meant neither was prepared to see the work they had done on the Diem project go to waste.

Diem spearheaded by Facebook parent Meta was envisioned as a global digital currency (in the form of a stablecoin) that would enable people to easily and inexpensively make payments and send money around the world. Meta announced the bold project in 2019 which was overseen by a consortium of other companies as an independent group (the Diem Association).

Shaikh and Ching both worked on the digital wallet unit Novi which was a subsidiary of Meta with Shaikh working on strategic partnerships and Ching serving as a principal software engineer focused largely on the underlying Diem blockchain. After over two years of setbacks and grilling at Congress the project thwarted by regulators’ and politicians’ scrutiny had only managed to launch a pilot version of Novi. Shortly after David Marcus the executive who had spearheaded Meta’s crypto efforts declared he was leaving the company by the end of 2021. The stablecoin and the underlying Diem blockchain never publicly debuted. (Diem sold its intellectual property and other assets to Silvergate Bank in January of 2022.)

“I’ve never not launched a product [before] no matter what thing I’ve been a part of” Ching says.

When asked whether Meta invested in Aptos Labs a spokesperson told Fortune the company could not comment due to an “ongoing legal matter.” Aptos Labs told Fortune that neither Aptos nor anyone at the startup was currently involved in litigation with Meta.

Aptos Labs isn’t the only company born out of the carnage of the Diem project. Mysten Labs a startup that’s building Web3 infrastructure from some fellow ex-Meta engineers was founded in 2021 and also garnered backing from some of Aptos’s investors like a16z. Like Aptos Mysten Labs uses the Move language and is targeting speed with its blockchain: a goal of over 200000 transactions per second cofounder and CEO Evan Cheng told The Information last year.

But while CEO Shaikh recounts dreaming up Aptos Labs with his cofounder and fellow Meta colleagues Glazer remembers a different story.

50/50 partners?

According to her and her firm Swoon Capital’s lawsuit against Shaikh and Matonee Inc. (the legal name for Aptos Labs) Glazer claims she met Shaikh through White & Case law partner Pratin Vallabhaneni in the summer of 2021 per Glazer’s deposition transcript (Vallabhaneni declined to comment to Fortune) and through her investment firm Swoon Capital hired Shaikh as a consultant in August of 2021 to help her or her firm find existing blockchains to acquire to repurpose for sports media and entertainment endeavors for $35000 in payment per the complaint. Glazer says she shared her “confidential business plans” with Shaikh. Glazer alleges that at the end of August Shaikh proposed that they modify the plan and instead launch a new blockchain and she agreed to make Shaikh an “equal” partner in the endeavor alleging they agreed to “change their consulting arrangement into a partnership in the Venture.” She alleges they agreed to initially eschew venture investing in lieu of funding she would put up because it would dilute her equity. She claims that she agreed to help Shaikh secure engineers to join the venture and that she would introduce Shaikh to her “extensive” network. According to what Glazer submitted as an email chain shared in the lawsuit where Glazer communicated with Vallabhaneni and included Shaikh Glazer described it as something “Mo and I are going to partner on…directly and do it together.” She further alleges in an affidavit filed for the lawsuit that the pair agreed to bring on “Meta’s lead blockchain engineer” Ching as a “salaried employee” and not a “co-founding partner.”

But as Glazer alleges Shaikh instead sought external funding from VCs including a16z and incorporated Matonee Inc. without her (she alleges they agreed to incorporate it together). She alleges Shaikh cheated her out of her “rightful share” of a partnership in a “blockchain technology venture” claiming that she and Shaikh had an oral agreement that they were to be “50/50 partners” in the venture and that she would initially contribute $10 million or more if necessary and secure an additional $10 million in financing from Fox (a Fox spokesperson told Fortune the conglomerate didn’t end up investing in the startup) per documents attached to the lawsuit to get the project off the ground. Glazer and her lawyers did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

However Shaikh and his lawyers argue that among other things an oral agreement wouldn’t legally hold up. According to the court filings (Shaikh filed to dismiss Glazer’s lawsuit) Shaikh’s consulting contract could only be legally amended in writing (which it was not according to a copy submitted as an exhibit). Shaikh denies there was such an agreement as Glazer described and in filings describes Glazer as a prospective investor in the venture not a cofounder. In what his filing says are WhatsApp messages with Glazer submitted in the filing to dismiss the complaint Shaikh told Glazer of various venture investors who “would be very interested” and told Glazer that $10 million “won’t be enough” to get the project off the ground arguing that she could not have believed that they had an agreement not to bring on other investors early on. He further claims that the alleged investment from Fox puts Glazer’s allegation of being owed an equal share of the equity in the startup into question as it’s unclear what type or amount of equity the conglomerate would have obtained for its investment that would not dilute her share.

Of the lawsuit against Shaikh and Aptos Multicoin’s Samani says his firm stands “behind Mo Avery the entire Aptos team and their technology” and that they believe Glazer’s claims “are without merit” he told Fortune in an emailed statement.

In a statement to Fortune Shaikh wrote the “allegations are filled with material inaccuracies and mischaracterizations that attempt to take credit for the work of others.”

The lawsuit is ongoing and the timeline is murky. But as they fight the litigation Shaikh and Ching aren’t slowing down their plans to launch the Aptos blockchain later this year.

The enterprise blockchain

Up until NFT.NYC in November of 2021 Ching says the team had been “building heads down for a long time and not really engaging very much with the outside” community.

Still working for Meta Ching and Shaikh took their team to the multiday gathering of NFT creators founders and crypto and Web3 groups and Ching remembers sitting in a hotel room in New York talking with the team about all the “cool projects” they were seeing and wondering what they could bring to the space if their project was live. “It was definitely an eye-opening experience for many of us. That changed a lot of our feelings in terms of like how do we best affect this community?”

As Shaikh claims that week proved “really special because it showed our team how rich the Web3 ecosystem is and how desperate it is for this type of technology” referring to Aptos’s blockchain.

For the most part new L1s have billed themselves as one of a handful of things: mainly faster and cheaper alternatives to Ethereum the entrenched leader that still underpins the majority of activity in areas like DeFi but which is often slow and expensive to use. Aptos is no exception as its cofounders claim it will be fast (the startup says it’s already “on our way” to 100000 transactions per second though as of early June it was doing about 10000).

But the bigger question is with many L1s already live and gaining users does the space really need another one?

“You have to be something different or something more interesting than Bitcoin and Ethereum [are] right now” argues Tom Dunleavy senior research analyst at crypto research firm Messari. “What does your L1 bring to the table that tries to occupy the rest of whatever crypto’s market cap is? You know is it going to be more decentralized? Is it going to be faster is it going to be cheaper?”

One thing they knew they needed? A name. When meeting with investors Shaikh and Ching say they didn’t yet have a proper name so the pair were calling the venture “Project XYZ” Shaikh recalls. But early in 2022 Shaikh realized that after much back and forth the startup needed a name ASAP. “I told Avery one night ‘Hey man you just got to come over to my place. We gotta knock this out’” he says referring to his apartment in Palo Alto which he says he just moved into after leaving the East Coast to help set up Aptos in California. He recalls Ching came over “around 9 p.m. or so…I lit the fireplace played some music in the background [lit] some candles and we went into our zen mode.” With the help of some highly caffeinated drinks the pair say they eventually arrived at Aptos the name of a town near Palo Alto that was named after a word from the Ohlone tribes who lived in the Bay Area that meant “the people.” Shaikh says they “thought this was the perfect meaning for what we’re trying to achieve.”

Since its inception the Aptos Labs team has been fairly explicit that it wants to be optimized for enterprises and large companies.

“We want to take the best practices of enterprise grade technology but apply it for the next billion users that are interested in using this technology” Shaikh told Fortune. “If we collaborate with these larger institutions we can meet the next billion users where they are.” Aptos is already laying the groundwork for that to take shape.

In his blog post announcing Aptos’s fundraise in March Shaikh says several companies including Anchorage Binance Blockorus Coinbase Livepeer Moonclave Paxos Paymagic Rarible and Streaming Fast were already engaging with the startup and contributing code. “We’re very excited about a lot of the large institutions being excited about us” Shaikh said.

Shaikh says they are “pursuing partnerships” in key areas like social networks media and entertainment gaming and finance (including traditional finance or TradFi they say). That could include incorporating the blockchain into popular social media apps: Shaikh says he hopes the likes of Snapchat Twitter and Instagram (owned by his former employer) which is starting to test integrating NFTs into its platform would use the Aptos blockchain someday. The startup also announced in April it would work with Google Cloud to help power its node infrastructure or the computer servers that run blockchain networks.

Leaning into enterprise may be a smart move some observers suggest. For the many L1s in the space Messari analyst Dunleavy argues “Right now you’re seeing it’s really a marketing game.” And he suggests the “enterprise level blockchain use case really still hasn’t been solved” yet.

Ching declares they want everyone to use the Aptos blockchain. While large institutions are “key to the picture” he says it’s “not just these large institutions.”

Writing in another language

In early May the Aptos team hosted their first in-person hackathon at their office in Palo Alto—a common type of event in the crypto space that gathers developers programmers and founders to work on projects on a blockchain.

Among those developers was Jason Zhao a Palo Alto–based Stanford graduate who previously worked at DeepMind and Google X and is now the cofounder of a yet-to-be announced Web3 startup. He says he’s been learning and working with blockchain languages like Solidity (used for Ethereum) and Rust (used with Solana) and though he and his fellow developers came across some “quirks” during the hackathon he was “impressed” by the Move coding language Aptos uses “especially given that it’s so early stage.”

During the hackathon Zhao says his team worked on an NFT marketplace project—one of 12 projects that came out of the event according to Aptos Labs.

Aptos’s blockchain which still doesn’t have a white paper uses a delegated proof of stake (PoS) model and the company says it will be fully open and permissionless when they launch the public blockchain later this year. The team says it’s working to make it safe to improve user experience especially for those who aren’t native to the crypto space. In testing on a private network the startup claims it’s been able to update the protocol with no downtime and says its consensus protocol’s safety has been audited and verified.

Per Aptos’s documents the blockchain is designed to be more secure which could help prevent things like denial of service attacks (DoS) something that’s plagued other crypto platforms. So far Ching says the team is testing the network and has built the blockchain with upgrading in mind. Aptos Labs also hasn’t launched a token yet but Shaikh says they’ve looked at various documents for tokenomics or the supply and demand dynamics of a token and are finalizing them planning to design the “most fair” tokenomics possible.

The blockchain isn’t compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) the software used to create smart contracts on Ethereum which is “both an obstacle to overcome” and “kind of like a moat for them” competition-wise according to Messari research analyst Chase Devens because if Aptos is able to attract developers to use their language it will have them “fenced in there.”

At least some developers like Zhao seem to be getting the hang of Move. “I wouldn’t say I’m a master of it but it wasn’t completely like learning a new language. It felt like sort of familiar” he notes.

‘Swimming upstream’

But there’s no mincing words: Aptos’s timing is less than ideal. Top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are down well over 60% so far in 2022 from their highs in November and big algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and token Luna collapsed in May triggering a meltdown. Popular crypto lending platform Celsius Network meanwhile froze withdrawals and is reportedly preparing for potential bankruptcy as it struggles to repay its debts. Even in the private markets investors are predicting crypto startup valuations will cool off from their nosebleed levels.

There are plenty of skeptics like Messari’s Devens who notes that the “recent market conditions coupled with technical developments within crypto have been unfriendly to newer L1 competitors” he told Fortune via email. “Most of the 2021 L1 boom was driven by Ethereum’s high transaction fees and token incentive campaigns for customer acquisition” he noted adding that “the appetite for these dilutive campaigns has dried up and Ethereum’s scaling solutions are beginning to take off. Both of these hurt the value proposition for new L1 systems going forward. Unless your L1 has already established organic activity you’re swimming upstream.”

But Shaikh believes the downturn will weed out unhealthy speculation and hype and allow them to work heads-down on their project. The startup is still dealing with the $1 billion lawsuit and until the Aptos blockchain is public and running later this year the team won’t get a full test of just how secure and scalable its network actually is.

“The bumps come after you launch” notes investor Samani “not before. I’m sure there will be problems.”

For now they’re charging ahead. Or as Samani might describe it: F–k this let’s go make it happen.

The longtime World Wrestling Entertainment impresario Vince McMahon agreed to pay more than $12 million over the past 16 years to suppress allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity the Wall Street Journal reports.

The amount is significantly larger than what was previously known.

Four women — all formerly affiliated with WWE — signed agreements with McMahon 76 that bar them from discussing their relationships with him the Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed.

McMahon stepped down as CEO and chairman of WWE in mid-June during an an investigation into the alleged misconduct and the Journal reported at the time that he had agreed to pay $3 million to a former paralegal who said he sexually harassed her on the job.

His daughter Stephanie McMahon has taken over as interim CEO.

WWE named McMahon's daughter Stephanie interim CEO and chairwoman during the investigation into his alleged misconduct though he continued to oversee the company's creative side. The organization stated at the time that it will have no further comment until the investigation is over.

McMahon has been the leader and most recognizable face at WWE for decades. When he purchased what was then the World Wrestling Federation from his father in 1982 wrestling matches took place at small venues and appeared on local cable channels.

WWE matches are now held in professional sports stadiums and the organization has a sizeable overseas following. It has a broadcast partnership with the Saudi media company MBC Group.

The organization underwent a seismic transformation under McMahon with events like WrestleMania a premium live production that draws millions of fervent viewers.

Revenue last year exceeded $1 billion for the first time and the company has television deals with Fox and NBCUniversal. Last month it announced a multiyear expansion of its original programming partnership with A&E.

WWE stars have become crossover sensations including Hulk Hogan Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and John Cena.

ONE of the most important festivals on the Muslim calendar is Eid al-Adha.

It celebrates Ibrahim sacrificing his son Ishmael under God's command.

2 Muslims gather to perform the Eid Al Adha prayer at the Metlife Stadium in New Jersey the United States on July 9 2022

When is Eid al-Adha 2022?

Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the 10th day of Dhū al-Hijjah.

It is the twelfth and final month of the Islamic calendar.

In 2022 the four-day event will begin on the evening of Saturday July 9 and end on the evening of Wednesday July 13.

How is Eid al-Adha celebrated?

Eid al-Adha usually starts with Muslims going to the Mosque for prayers in new finery.

As it is known as the Festival of Sacrifice a sheep goat camel or cow is usually sacrificed during the period.

This is called Qurbani.

In many countries this is done as part of a public ritual but in the UK it takes place in a slaughterhouse.

The meat is shared equally between family friends and the poor along with a big feast of mostly savory dishes.

Relatives will gather for the celebrations and exchange gifts cards and money as well as donate to charity.

Some Muslims will also travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage which is one of the five pillars of Islam.

Eid means celebration Mubarak means blessed and Eid Mubarak is often used as a greeting over this period.

The saying can be translated as - have a blessed holiday or blessed feast/festival.

It is customary to reply Khair Mubarak which reciprocates the good wishes.

What's the difference between Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr?

Eid al-Adha is the second major Muslim festival after Eid al-Fitr.

While Eid al-Adha is known as the 'Festival of Sacrifice' Eid al-Fitr is also called the 'Festival of Breaking the Fast'.

It is celebrated at the end of Ramadan to mark the end of fasting.

Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings.

Eid al-Adha tends to be predominantly savory and is the holier of the two feasts.

It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca Saudi Arabia and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vamV0c3hmYWN0b3IuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvbnktamV0cy1uZmwtZGl2aXNpb24tcmVhbGlnbm1lbnQtY29uY2VwdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hypothetical NFL division realignment concept brings new rival to NY Jets,"What would a re-aligned AFC East Division look like? How would it affect the New York Jets?

The dead period of the NFL offseason is the perfect time to spitball about hypotheticals.

One hypothetical idea that has been making the rounds on social media is the thought of what the NFL’s divisions would look like if they were more geographically accurate.

Currently the NFL’s division system features quite a few misfits who seem out of place alongside their three division rivals such as the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East and the Miami Dolphins in the AFC East.

What if the NFL improved the geographical accuracy of its divisions?

A recent Reddit post visualized what a realignment of this fashion could look like.

The fan-made realignment proposal features an interesting concept for the AFC East. The Buffalo Bills New England Patriots and New York Jets would stay put but the Miami Dolphins would be replaced by Gang Green’s MetLife Stadium co-tenants: the New York Giants.

Geographically this AFC East setup would make much more sense forming a Northeastern triangle in which three stadiums are all within a relatively short driving distance from one another. Highmark Stadium and Gillette Stadium are separated by a 457-mile driving distance. Gillette is 214 miles from MetLife and Highmark is 358 miles from MetLife.

As things currently stand the Dolphins are out of place in the AFC East sitting on the opposite end of the east coast as their three rivals. Hard Rock Stadium is a 1260-mile drive from MetLife Stadium.

Personally I would be all aboard for two annual matchups between the Jets and Giants. There is so much potential for a heated New York rivalry between these two fanbases – similar to Yankees/Mets Knicks/Nets or any combination of the three hockey teams – but since these squads only meet up every four years there really isn’t a true rivalry. I think it would be loads of fun for the New York sports scene if these teams shared a division.

Here are all eight divisions from the realignment proposed in the fan-made Reddit concept shared above:

AFC East: Bills Giants Jets Patriots

AFC West: Broncos Cardinals Chiefs Raiders

AFC Central: Bengals Browns Colts Titans

AFC South: Buccaneers Dolphins Jaguars Panthers

NFC East: Commanders Eagles Ravens Steelers

NFC West: Chargers 49ers Rams Seahawks

NFC Central: Bears Lions Packers Vikings

NFC South: Cowboys Falcons Saints Texans

Would you be a fan of this hypothetical realignment concept?"

The heated debate has largely been ignored in Nevada where just two casinos are smoke-free and any mention of a smoking ban meets heavy resistance.

More than 20 states have either banned or limited smoking inside casinos. Several states that legalized casinos over the last couple of decades such as Maryland launched with non-smoking casino floors. Many states including Pennsylvania limited smoking in 2020 as part of reopening plans under COVID-19 health and safety guidelines.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said the fear of lost revenues weighs on Nevada casino operators even as other states continue to implement laws that restrict smoking in public spaces.

“I would assume that every state has to move closer toward this inevitability but given that the industry is the biggest employer of jobs in Nevada there appears to be a strong enough fight against this” Beynon said. “I don’t think the Strip would have that large of an impact but in some of the older demographic locals markets I would assume that it could be fairly significant.”

Gaming consultant Andrew Klebanow along with two colleagues at C3 Gaming authored a research report that indicated gamblers haven’t altered their habits since the pandemic even when smoking was eliminated.

The report noted that after the temporary shutdown of the casino industry in 2020 roughly 157 Indian casinos nationwide re-opened as non-smoking properties.

The authors suggested casino customers accepted changes in many areas of the resort industry during COVID such as the end of daily guest room service and the shuttering of buffets.

“Customers readily understood that mask mandates were incompatible with smoking and accepted the prohibition” the authors wrote. “What was surprising was that even after mask mandates were lifted and smoking prohibitions remained in place customers collectively accepted it. Having successfully pushed smoking out of their buildings at no economic cost tribal casino operators have resisted the temptation to re-introduce smoking in their properties.”

Atlantic City casino operators are skeptical. The market which hit a single-year gaming revenue high of $5.2 billion in 2006 has been in a 16-year freefall hitting a low of $2.56 billion in 2015. Last year Atlantic City reported $4.7 billion in gaming revenue but more than $1.36 billion came from New Jersey’s regulated internet casino sites.

Last week Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights which is advocating for the smoking ban legislation in New Jersey touted the C3 Gaming study and also said the legislation has the backing of more than half of the state’s lawmakers.

The organization came to Las Vegas last year to advocate for a similar ban inside Strip resorts.

“We’re trying to build a grassroots effort here” Cynthia Hallett CEO of Americans for Nonsmokers Rights said at the time. “We know it’s a battle and we’re pushing that big stone up the hill. But we don’t believe that hill is that steep anymore.”

But Klebenow who is based in Las Vegas and has 40 years of experience in the casino industry predicted Nevada would be the final state to ban smoking in casinos.

“Individual states that are not dependent on gaming tax revenue for the lion’s share of their budgets will gradually close their smoking loopholes” Klebanow said in an interview. “The eastern states will flip first then maybe the midwestern states. If there is a dramatic resurgence in the pandemic then some Indian casinos will make the move. The second to last state to flip will probably be Mississippi. Nevada will be dead last.”

Avoiding the topic

The voter-approved Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act went into effect in December 2006 and prohibited smoking in most indoor public places and businesses except casinos.

State lawmakers approved changes to several sections of the act during the 2011 legislative session including allowing customers to smoke inside bars taverns and saloons that do not allow patrons under the age of 21. During the 2019 legislative session the law was updated to include vapor products or e-cigarettes.

When pandemic-related health and safety operating guidelines for casinos were implemented by the Gaming Control Board following the state’s 78-day gaming closure customers could only remove face masks for eating drinking and smoking.

MGM Resorts International prohibited smoking inside all areas of Park MGM on the Strip when the company reopened the resort in September 2020. The ban remains in place and Park MGM is the only smoke-free casino on the Strip.

The Fernley Nugget in Lyon County is Nevada’s only other voluntary smoke-free casino.

An MGM Resorts spokesman declined to comment on how the Park’s policy has been accepted by customers and if the company is exploring smoking bans at any of its other nine Strip hotel-casinos.

Most casino company officials contacted for this story declined to comment concerning smoking bans. Station Casinos spokesman Michael Britt said the company offers “non-smoking gaming areas at all our properties.” Other gaming officials noted poker rooms throughout Las Vegas are mostly non-smoking including large poker rooms at Strip resorts and the temporary World Series of Poker space inside Bally’s Las Vegas.

Nevada Resort Association President Virginia Valentine said its member hotel-casinos have “invested heavily” in new technology that circulates fresh air and removes smoke from the casino floors.

“From specialized ventilation and filtration systems to air-handling units located at table games and the bases of gaming devices the industry continues to utilize the latest innovations for the benefit of employees and guests” Valentine said.

She added that most casinos in Nevada’s largest casino markets “cater to the diversity of our guests’ preferences by offering both non-smoking and smoking environments.” Valentine said casinos watch for any changes in customer preferences.

“Our members continually evaluate consumer demand to inform their business practices” Valentine said.

A smoking ban inside Nevada casinos would have at least one vocal supporter – Culinary Workers Union Local 226 which counts more than 60000 members who work in non-gaming areas in Strip and downtown resorts.

Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement the union would poll hospitality workers to gauge their interest in non-smoking casinos. He said the union “welcomed” the news of Park MGM becoming an entirely smoke-free casino.

“It's long overdue for an entirely smoke-free casino in Las Vegas and the Culinary Union is completely supportive” Pappageorge said.

Boardwalk casino operators oppose the ban

The C3 Gaming report predicted smokers wouldn’t flee Atlantic City casinos if smoking were eliminated. Smoking bans are in place in Connecticut and New York and a smoke-free policy was implemented at Rivers Casino Philadelphia. Just four Pennsylvania casinos currently allow smoking.

“Only the most progressive of casino operators have the capacity to rethink the smoking model” Klebanow said. “A casino could adopt a non-smoking policy and support it with a really innovative smoking lounge. Picture a comfortable room adjacent to the casino with a separate ventilation system comfortable seating and other amenities where gamblers could take a break.”

The New Jersey legislation is backed by casino workers and the governor.

But Atlantic City casino operators aren’t convinced. Under current laws just 25 percent of the casino floor can allow smoking which casino operators argue is a property’s most lucrative floor space.

“My roulette and blackjack and slot machine in smoking sections make 50 percent more money than my non-smoking games” Hard Rock Atlantic City President Joe Lupo told CNBC. “That’s a fact.”

Atlantic City casino operators also cite two other research reports on the smoking issue from casino industry consultant Spectrum Gaming and CBRE gaming analyst John DeCree.

Spectrum argued in a report commissioned by the Casino Association of New Jersey that a complete smoking ban could cause an annual gaming revenue decline of between 4.2 percent and 10.9 percent and declines in non-gaming revenue of between 3 percent and 6.5 percent. All told that means New Jersey could lose out on almost $25.7 million in annual tax revenue.

DeCree meanwhile estimated Atlantic City casinos could see gaming revenue declines up to 25 percent.

Both studies looked at smoking bans that were implemented in other states and local markets in the early-to-mid-2010s and prior to the pandemic including Illinois Delaware New Orleans and West Virginia. DeCree noted that Atlantic City has been the only indoor smoking option for entertainment in New Jersey since a statewide ban went into effect in 2006.

“We would not be surprised if the impact in Atlantic City was at the high end or even greater than indicated by some of these case studies for a variety of reasons” DeCree wrote in the report. “Atlantic City casinos have likely been out-earning its share of discretionary entertainment among the smoking population for the past 15-plus years. Atlantic City must pull its customers away from more conveniently located gaming options and the absence of smoking would leave many of its higher value smoking customers without reason to make the trip.”

Klebanow was critical of the Spectrum and CBRE studies because the markets used for comparison had other economic conditions and issues prior to the smoking bans that contributed to gaming revenue declines.

Valentine said the C3 Gaming report “advocates for government intervention in dictating business decisions rather than consumer choice. Further it uses select and subjective commentary from other gaming markets which are incomparable to Nevada’s unique tourism environment to back up its flawed assumptions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYXZlbC1oZWFsdGgtY2hpbmEtYXNpYS0yM2FhOWJkODUwNTJiNTZkNDk3MmZmNjQzNTE1ZTEzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Las Vegas of Asia' tells casinos to grow beyond gambling,"BEIJING (AP) — Losing money due to COVID the American casino giants that helped make Macao the “Las Vegas of Asia” face a fresh challenge: The tiny Chinese territory wants them to help reduce its reliance on gambling by paying to build theme parks and other attractions.

The former Portuguese colony stayed out of business decisions for decades and now is aligning with official strategy on China’s mainland where foreign companies are required to help pay for the ruling Communist Party’s development ambitions profitable or not.

The licenses of MGM Resorts Las Vegas Sands Wynn Resorts and three Chinese rivals that invested billions of dollars in Macao expire in December. Rules released in early July say any that want to operate over the next 10-year period face an added requirement to invest in “non-gaming projects.”

Casinos face still more financial pressure after they were ordered to close this week along with most other businesses while Macao tries to control a renewed coronavirus outbreak. They already were operating under rules imposed in late June that limited the number of their employees to 10% of normal.

Financial analysts expect the Americans to get licenses but the government says bidding is open to anyone.

The territory of 700000 people crowded onto a 30-square-kilometer (12-square-mile) peninsula jutting into the South China Sea near Hong Kong is the biggest global center for gambling but is under pressure from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government to rely less on its dominant industry.

Beijing wants theme parks entertainment and conventions to attract more non-Chinese visitors. Even before tourist travel was shut down to fight COVID in 2020 the mainland was trying to limit the flow of gamblers across the fenced boundary that separates Macao from Guangdong province.

Macao is “dedicated to steering the composition of industries towards adequate diversification” said its economy secretary Lei Wai Nong at a May 31 government meeting.

An added complication for the Americans: Relations between Xi’s government and Washington are strained by disputes over trade technology human rights and other irritants. Other companies have been hit by retaliation for U.S. tariff hikes but Macao casinos haven’t been targeted.

“There is a high risk that at least one if not two may not get a new concession” said Ben Lee managing partner of IGamiX a gambling industry consulting firm in Macao. “Why would 50% of such a dominant industry in Macao be ceded to foreigners particularly Americans?”

Pressure for change comes as Macao faces growing competition for potential non-Chinese gamblers from casinos in Singapore Malaysia and Cambodia.

Financial analysts expect MGM Sands and Wynn to be approved for licenses due to the jobs and tax revenue they generate. Their casino hotels with thousands of employees soar above the narrow lanes of Macao’s centuries-old city center and Cotai a strip of land reclaimed from the sea.

Still the risk an established operator might fail to receive a license “should not be ignored” Fitch Ratings said in a June 16 report.

The Chinese competitors include SJM Holding part of the empire of the late Stanley Ho a competitive ballroom dancer and Macao’s “King of Gambling” who had a four-decade government-granted monopoly on casinos until 2001. SJM is run by Ho’s daughter Pansy.

The others are Melco International run by Ho’s son Lawrence and Galaxy Entertainment Group.

The decision to allow in foreign-owned casinos in 2002 brought a flood of money to Macao once best known in China for its Portuguese-style egg tarts and billions of dollars in profit to their operators. In total the six license holders operate 41 casinos.

Annual revenue from slot machines dice tables and other games peaked at $45 billion in 2013. That was equal to $65000 for each man woman and child in Macao and more than triple Nevada’s 2021 revenue of $13.5 billion.

But revenue was sliding even before COVID hit in 2020. Beijing was tightening controls on how often mainland gamblers could visit. Curbs were imposed on financial transfers to Macao in a crackdown on money laundering and tax evasion.

By 2019 before the pandemic gambling revenue had sunk 19% from 2013′s level to $36.4 billion. In 2020 it collapsed a further 80% to just $7.6 billion. Last year revenue climbed back to $10.8 billion but that is down 75% from 2013.

Macao’s economy possibly the world’s most tourism-dependent has shrunk by half since 2019 according to government data.

The government has appealed to casino operators to avoid laying off employees.

Macao’s appeal is so powerful that Las Vegas Sands Corp. traditionally the biggest global casino operator by revenue sold its namesake Las Vegas hotel in 2021 to wager everything on its six Macao properties and one in Singapore.

The company has invested an estimated $13 billion in Macao. It is in the midst of a $2.2 billion overhaul of one of its hotels.

Betting so heavily on Asia however meant Sands suffered the biggest COVID hit. The company reported a first-quarter loss of $478 million. Revenue fell 21% from a year earlier to $943 million.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. said revenue at its two Macao casinos fell but its Las Vegas properties helped to limit its overall loss to $183.3 million on revenue of $953.3 million temporarily putting it ahead of Sands.

MGM Resorts said its first-quarter revenue of $268 million in Macao was down 76% compared with the pre-outbreak level of $734 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Adding non-gambling assets would make Macao more like Las Vegas where casinos try to attract families and non-gamblers with roller coasters music shopping centers art exhibits and water parks.

""Human cyborg"" is much similar to other individuals who have microchips implanted in them: grain-sized capsules that react to data through radio frequency identifying signals (RFID).

According to experts in the future brain implants may help humans remember things better. Passwords and keys could be replaced by RFID chips or implanted magnets. Exoskeletons could increase human strength and improve a variety of other human capabilities.

What is a Cyborg?

A person with both organic and biomechatronic body parts is referred to as a cyborg (a combination of the words cybernetic and organism). Nathan S. Kline and Manfred Clynes first came up with the term in 1960.

The term ""cyborg"" refers to an organism that has enhanced capabilities due to the integration of a synthetic component or technology that relies on feedback as opposed to bionics bio-robotics or androids. Although humans and other mammals are typically thought of as mammals including cyborgs they might theoretically be any form of an organism.

The introduction to D. S. Halacy's 1965 book Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman described it as a ""new frontier"" that was ""not only space but more fundamentally the interaction between ""inner space"" to ""outer space"" - a bridge between thought and matter.""

Some definitions of the word claim that humans are already cyborgs due to their bodily ties to even the most primitive technologies.

A classic example of a cyborg is a person who has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or synthetic cardiac pacemaker since these machines can deliver electrical stimuli process signals and measure voltage potentials in the body.

They use this artificial feedback system to keep an individual alive. Cochlear implants in particular are cyborg improvements since they mix mechanical alteration with any form of feedback response.

Some theorists use intraocular lenses hearing aids cellphones and contact lenses as instances of how people have been fitted with technology to improve their biological capabilities.

Using this technology it is possible to instantaneously verify that a person is who they claim to be among other things. All the data typically saved in wallets can be stored on an RFID (short-range radio frequency identification) implant.

Implanted microchips are simply cylinder-shaped bar codes that send a specific signal through a layer of skin when they are scanned. Despite occasional human experiments they have primarily been employed to inventory goods identify stray animals and organise livestock.

Robot vs Cyborg

Cyborgs and robots appeared to be science fiction staples and in some ways they are. But the majority of people are unaware that robots and cyborgs actually exist although not in the same form as they are portrayed in popular culture. The possibility of life distinguishes cyborgs from robots as their main distinction. A robot is essentially a highly developed machine.

It frequently involves automation and hardly any connection with people. Cyborgs in contrast are a hybrid of a machine and living beings. It doesn't have to be a person; it may be a dog a bird or anything else that lives.

A cyborg is different from a robot since it has a life component.

The RFID chip

The RFID chip is essentially a tiny two-way radio about the size of a rice grain that can store different kinds of information. The chip is placed beneath the skin and when scanned can offer data such as an individual's ID number which links to a database containing more specific information on the wearer.

An RFID can allow human beings to access public transportation communicate our identifying information as we pass through a security checkpoint and eliminate long lineups at the grocery store checkout.

The first RFID chip was implanted into a human arm in 1998 by Kevin Warwick a professor of cybernetics at Reading University in the UK. The objective was to see if his computer could follow him around the university wirelessly.

When Florida-based Applied Digital Solutions tested implanting its VeriChips which are now known as PositiveID in regular individuals in the early 2000s the technology took off and was approved by the FDA in 2004.

A brief history of technical device implantation

The paper ""Cyborgs and Space"" (1995) written by Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline in 1960 featured an experiment involving a lab rat.

The rat has a tiny osmotic pump implanted that could deliver precisely measured amounts of chemicals as the animal required under various circumstances. Instead of modifying the circumstances in space to create surroundings similar to those on Earth the goal was to create an artificial system that could adapt a living person to those conditions.

A new level of homeostasis was added when a technology gadget was linked to a biological system. Thus it should be able to equip astronauts with bodily-connected technological equipment to facilitate space travel.

The technology is now widely used commercially after many years. It's actually fairly prevalent in Sweden where thousands of individuals have welcomed the technology.

Experts believe that a regulated interaction between biological systems and mechanical equipment that would take care of providing the body with the fuel it needs should fill the role of the organic conditions that exist in the link between human physiological processes and the environment.

The lack of microchips is a consequence of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and the closure of some factories. This situation that has affected many sectors demonstrating the importance of these components.

What are semiconductors?

Before discussing the importance of semiconductors it is useful to understand what they are. They are electronic components that have the property of conducting electricity. It can do so when it is subjected to certain conditions and factors. Therefore it allows current to pass or not to pass depending on what the manufacturer wants. Its function is to collect information process it store it and then transmit it. Microchips are the necessary step in the transformation from analogue to digital.



The materials that make up semiconductors are the key to their behaviour. Yet the most common material is undoubtedly silicon together with germanium which is very similar to silicon although they are not used in their pure form. Their capabilities and technological development mean that they can be found in many industries especially the motor and household appliance sectors. Something that seems so simple turns out to be essential to computers mobile phones cars televisions tablets and actually almost any current machinery that is a part of Industry 4.0.



Microchips can be found in transistors integrated circuits electrical diodes optical sensors lasers and electrical transmission modulators. Their versatility is what has given them the relevance they have today. For this reason during those times when there have been shortages many industries have started to experience issues. The result is that factories cannot maintain high production which can either make their products more expensive or can make them run out of stock.

For example in 2021 Sony was forced to announce that it was unable to increase production of its latest console at the time the PS5 due to a shortage of some parts including semiconductors.

Where are microchips produced?

The production of next-generation semiconductors is concentrated in Asia with countries such as South Korea China and Taiwan leading the way. The Taiwanese company TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) alone produces 56% of all of them according to TrendForce. And curiously despite its importance Europe has remained in a situation of dependency with countries such as Spain having no such manufacturing at all.



This concentration of production has been an issue since the beginning of the pandemic. The cutting of supply lines caused bottlenecks. Semiconductors were not arriving in the required amounts which hampered manufacturing in industries such as the automotive and computer industries. They simply could not finish their products.



Faced with this situation governments around the world are trying to find solutions. In Spain a public investment of 11 billion euro is planned through a PERTE Proyectos Estratégicos para la Recuperación y Transformación Económica (Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation). Europe has also taken action with the European chip law. It consists of a 43 billion euro plan to reduce Europe’s dependence. The aim is to be responsible for 20% of global production by 2030.



Despite all these plans there is another problem to consider: there is a shortage of skilled workers. This fact alone could hinder or derail European strategies. Without human capital the money invested will go nowhere.

Recovery and the search for alternatives as a trend

Given their extensive use microchips have become a key part of modern economy. For example in a vehicle they can be found in the airbag belt pretensioners electronic circuits and proximity sensors. And without them driver safety would be seriously impaired because not using them would be a step backwards for the industry.



When their production cannot cope with the demand shortages of all kinds of finished products begin to occur. The 2020 lockdown led to a boom in purchases of computers and electronics in general. This together with disruptions in supply chains led to escalating prices.



This happened during the second quarter of 2020 there was a halt in car production. There were hardly any semiconductors available as they were destined for other more profitable sectors such as the mobile device and computer manufacturing.

And although in 2021 the situation failed to improve substantially it is expected that by the end of 2022 the production of computer microchips will return to pre-Covid-19 figures. So says the consulting firm Bain & Company although the recovery will be uneven. And although the automotive and industrial sectors were hit the hardest they will be the first to recover in the near future.

In contrast the consultancy expects shortages in other sectors such as the production of video game consoles and computer servers to last until 2024. In response to prior problems and to prevent them from happening again companies are already working on new more efficient and less polluting materials that ensure both an environmentally friendly approach and digitisation. Materials such as graphene help technologies such as 5G realise their full potential. Such developments may be the key to securing the connectivity of the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZGNleGVjLmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2VtZXJnaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIyMzI3MDMxL2luc2VlZ28tYmVjb21lLWEtbG9naXN0aWNzLXN1cGVyaGVyby13aXRoLTVnLWlvdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Become a Logistics Superhero with 5G & IoT,"Most great superheroes have cool gadgets. Captain America has the shield; Wolverine has claws; Thor has Mjolnir; Iron Man has his suit and so on. They use these gadgets to fight evil and protect the universe. Our supply chain and logistics partners are the world’s modern day superheroes because they have been delivering essential rations despite global crises. They fight through supply chain disruptions caused by pandemics natural disasters cyberattacks and everything else to deliver the goods that the world depends upon. Over the last two years during the pandemic the shortcomings of the global supply chain have been evident as we have suffered shortages of goods from computer chips to toilet paper. It impacts enterprises and households 94% of Fortune 1000 companies faced supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic. We need to equip our logistics superheroes with powerful gadgets that they can use to manage chaos and save the universe. The good news is that the technology is already here with 5G the Fifth Generation for broadband cellular networks and IoT the Internet of Things. Both are possible weapons that the Batmans and Robins of the logistics industry can use to save the day.

Digitization of the supply chain for streamlining operations is not new. A Deloitte report states that companies must improve end-to-end supply chain visibility through digitization. The combination of 5G and IoT bring benefits and capabilities that surpass what was previously possible. Just as no single gadget can fight all villains no technology or solution can fix all supply chain issues. We have all admired James Bond for his savvy use of different devices in different situations to beat his foes. Similarly we need to look at the dynamic duo of 5G and IoT.

5G is a wireless connection technology that can deliver multi-gigabit speeds at lower latencies. It can handle many connections per cell tower making it the ideal solution for connecting IoT devices. These IoT devices can relay information pinpoint their location take proactive measures and respond to remote commands depending upon their capabilities. 5G and IoT can combine to perform complex tasks in the supply chain and unlock new efficiencies and enable smarter business decision making.

The ability to track and trace every shipment is essential. Historically supply chains have relied on stale and manual methods of tracking. With 5G and low-cost IoT sensors the entire logistics process can be transformed by bringing near real-time visibility to the state of goods their location conditions and estimated arrival times. This valuable information can help manufacturers prepare efficiently stores can anticipate stocking needs and hand-offs in transportation can occur seamlessly. In the United States around 30-40 percent of the food is wasted due to spoilage from production to delivery. 5G and IoT can trace the risk of spoilage while in transit due to overstocking or equipment malfunction. Temperature and ambient light sensors can indicate if a product has been damaged or exposed to sunlight. This food can be rerouted to a closer destination or the equipment can be repaired saving the products to feed people in need.

5G and IoT can significantly enhance warehouses ports shop floors and factories. They can enable smart inventory tracking autonomous operations and inspections within a location. Automation reduces losses due to missing parts counterfeiting and theft. Crewless vehicles and drones operated via remote control or autonomous vehicles can optimize loading and unloading operations connected via 5G by keeping vehicles in lanes and avoiding collisions. Advanced sensors and high throughput low latency 5G connections can enable autonomous inspection of products by connecting mobile and fixed cameras to AI applications at the edge.

Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) over 5G networks with IoT sensors can provide remote assistance when required. They can allow for visualizing stocking options in warehouses so that businesses can utilize their space efficiently. Mixed (MR) reality can help spot issues before implementation. 5G and IoT-enabled virtual reality can be used for simulations and training so that routes and processes are fully optimized before products are sent.

Manual processes result in bottlenecks and blind spots in the supply chain. Our logistics superheroes need to focus their energy on creative pursuits and reimagining business models to improve efficiency reduce costs and enhance accuracy. Digitization with 5G and IoT will ultimately benefit the consumer. The dynamic duo of 5G and IoT are the perfect gadgets to digitize the supply chain. A McKinsey survey states that nearly 90 percent of supply chain executives said they expect to overhaul their IT within the next five years. Companies must adopt 5G and IoT as gadgets to empower our logistics superheroes to deliver the goods and make the world safer smarter and more sustainable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZGNleGVjLmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2VtZXJnaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIyMzI3MDI1L2ZhcmV5ZS1mYXN0ZXItZGVsaXZlcmllcy1hcmUtZHJvbmVzLXRoZS1hbnN3ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Faster Deliveries: Are Drones the Answer?,"Drones aren’t new and until recently their mention was reserved for military discourse or science fiction discussion. Flash forward to today and they have entered everyday conversation not just as popular gifts for the holidays but as an alternative mode of transport for last mile logistics.

Last mile need for speed

As e-commerce continues its march towards becoming the preferred shopping method across the globe it's become clear online consumers demand faster cheaper more flexible and more sustainable deliveries. Retailers providing such deliveries can realize competitive advantages - such is the case with Amazon’s meteoric rise in recent years a pioneer of low-cost 2-day and same-day delivery.

The key to a good delivery experience lies in the last mile the costliest and most complex leg of the entire supply chain which by some estimates makes up 53% of the total cost of delivery. With traffic congestion costing billions in productivity and gumming up delivery routes driver shortages across the globe and growing concern among consumers for eco-friendly deliveries the last mile has become even more arduous.

Enter the drone. Drones can zip over traffic don’t require drivers and emit zero fossil fuels. Moreover drones can deliver parcels 20 times faster than ground-based transportation according to Vikram Singh CEO of TechEagle.

Household names like Walmart Amazon and Google among others have made it known they’re working towards making drone delivery a reality with the help of partners rolling out drone testing programs across the world.

But will drone delivery enter the mainstream market or is this all just hype?

Where are the drones?

Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he introduced drone delivery back in 2013 and it has been the “next big thing” in delivery management for almost 9 years now. Understandably people wonder when it will reach scale and apply to the general public. There are a few reasons for its slow roll out:

Investment

Drone delivery requires a substantial capital-intensive investment in order to establish a successful program. It needs everything from regulation compliance to drone maintenance investment. It's easier for larger companies to invest in these areas though it's much harder for smaller enterprises to establish a delivery program and achieve scale. Companies can more easily reduce shipping times by a day or two with route optimization or warehouse management making drone delivery an added bonus to speed up delivery but not a necessity. If a company has limited resources to invest in R&D or new technology they’ll go with what they can control now.

But even large companies with the capital means to invest in drone delivery have had to call it quits. Amazon closed its Prime Air office in the UK in 2021 and DHL abandoned its parcel-copter program the same year.

Delivery Cost

In addition to the initial investment drone delivery requires operating costs are not cheap. Amazon estimates it costs roughly $63 per package to be delivered by drone. Compare that to the retailer-turned-logistics company’s cost of delivering goods through third-party logistics (3PL) companies at around $5 per package. Delivering through its own logistics network costs $3.47 per package. For a lean logistics-focused company this cost is huge indicating drone delivery may be best suited for affluent consumers and high-value or time-critical products. Zipline a drone delivery company was able to deliver life-saving medical supplies to rural areas of Rwanda and Ghana reducing delivery times from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Deliveries like these justify the cost.

For companies focused on reducing shipping costs for consumer retail items in the last mile drones may not be the answer just yet.

Urban airspace

Urban areas dense with consumers may seem like a perfect environment for drone delivery to take off but that isn’t really the case. Drone deliveries in dense cities like London or Tokyo may prove challenging as safe consumer-owned landing zones such as a backyard are limited. Coupled with tall buildings complicating low-level flight with government regulated airspace around cities and large airports urban drone delivery becomes a bit more challenging. Washington D.C one of America’s densest urban areas has some of the strictest airspace in the world. Until these navigational and regulatory hurdles can be overcome drone delivery in consumer-rich environments may be off the table.

Large item delivery

Delivering small lightweight items via drone is rather feasible. Delivering large or heavy items like a new flat-screen TV or leather couch is not. Aerodynamics aside in the U.S. drone operators are limited by the FAA to carrying cargo weighing under 55 pounds. This limits the use of drones and inhibits drones from stacking orders and making multiple deliveries in one run.

On the other hand TwinswHeel of France created a drone capable of carrying up to 300kg but it doesn’t yet have the ability to deliver a sofa to a consumer’s home.

Safety

Drones as with all modes of delivery transport pose safety risks to those around them. But because drones are new and driverless they are getting extra attention. The Swiss Post suspended drone delivery service after a drone crashed near a group of school children following a short circuit interrupting the drone’s GPS power supply. Threats to drone safety range from mechanical malfunctions adverse weather conditions birds or perhaps an unsuspecting dog - they’ve always had a rocky relationship with the mailman.

As with any new technology safety and public trust take time to prove.

Drones Today

Consumers see remarkably little of the planning and research logistics firms do behind the scenes and drone delivery is currently happening just not in the way consumers think. Right now drones are not being used to deliver apparel in lucrative urban consumer markets but in B2B segments and for emergency and time-sensitive deliveries in more rural areas. For consumer retail companies seeking efficiencies in the last mile their dollars may be better spent elsewhere in 2022.

It’s worth noting however that less than a third of last year’s automated deliveries worldwide were made by air. Until drones gain widespread adoption it may be more likely for mainstream autonomous deliveries to come from below rather than above.

Widespread adoption

It is reasonable to predict drone technology will reach widespread consumer scale in 3-5 years as initial technology investments are refined government regulations rewritten and operation costs come down.

The key to getting all of these accomplished is to build further upon where drones are today.

Current drone technology must be made more accessible incentivizing drone delivery usage and investment in its development. Companies operating drones today will find the profitability sweet spot of the products best suited for drone delivery based on size demand and timeliness. As the technology reaches scale and delivery costs become reasonable expect drone usage and the product assortments they carry to expand - from standard pharmaceutical deliveries to food deliveries and online retail deliveries. Large item deliveries however may be a ways away.

Drones will have the greatest impact in geographies where it’s difficult for delivery trucks to navigate and troublesome to decipher specific addresses a common environment found across many parts of Asia. Look up and look East in 2025.",,,

Chips are over-supplied. Chip manufacturing has expanded too fast and surpassed demand but also can’t scale up fast enough to meet demand. The chip business is booming. Chip stocks are falling.

It’s a confusing time to figure out what’s going on in the semiconductor industry.

To understand the contradictions in semiconductor supply chains right now it’s important to keep in mind that there are many types of chips built in very different ways. Older generations of chips used to control basic mechanical functions in cars and dishwashers are built using equipment that has been around since the 2000s while the cutting-edge chips that render graphics and run AI models in the latest smartphones and computers require ultra-precise machinery.

The state of the semiconductor sector is so muddled because the production of some types of chips has already ramped up enough to meet demand while manufacturing for other types of chips is still catching up. Overall though these conflicting storylines are a sign that the chip shortage is finally starting to ease.

Semiconductor supply is rising and demand is easing

The overall production of semiconductors is rising around the world. TSMC the world’s biggest chipmaker increased its planned investment in new plants and equipment from $30 billion in 2021 to $44 billion in 2022. China has invested about $50 billion since 2014 to support domestic chip production while US lawmakers are (maybe) on the verge of doling out $52 billion in subsidies and incentives for new semiconductor plants in the US.

Meanwhile South Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance reports that Korean chipmakers are sitting on a rapidly growing stockpile of unsold chips. The country which is the world’s biggest producer of memory chips for electronics like laptops and smartphones hasn’t seen its semiconductor inventory rise this fast since 2018.

Plenty of chips for smartphones and laptops but not for cars

Chipmaker Micron Technologies warned investors on June 30 about a looming glut of high-tech memory chips used in smartphones and laptops. Consumer demand for those devices unexpectedly dropped thanks to rising inflation sagging consumer spending in China and fears of an impending recession according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “Given the change in market conditions we are taking immediate action to reduce our supply growth trajectory” he said.

Micron Technologies predicted that its smartphone division would ship about 130 million fewer chips than expected this year and its PC division would cut sales by about 30 million chips—a 10% drop in both categories. The downturn will last at least half a year chief business officer Sumit Sadana predicted unless a recession hits and brings demand down further.

Meanwhile automakers are complaining they still can’t find enough low-tech chips to keep their assembly lines running at full capacity. GM Toyota and Honda each told investors their sales had slumped in the most recent quarter because of the ongoing chip shortage. Collectively automakers will build an estimated 3 million fewer cars this year for lack of semiconductors.

Semiconductor stocks are feeling recession fears

Investors are watching semiconductor supply rise while contemplating the possibility that inflation or a recession will cause a drop in consumer demand for everything that uses chips including electronics appliances and even cars. As a result chip stocks have been plummeting even though semiconductor sales are still historically high and chipmakers are recording record revenues. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index which tracks big chip manufacturers has fallen nearly 40% this year after doubling in value during the pandemic.

Semiconductor stocks have underperformed even in the context of a slumping stock market.

This is the first of a three-part series titled “Rejuvenating India’s Semiconductor Ecosystem” (RISE) aimed at highlighting some of India’s existing capabilities in the semiconductors and discussing how to maximise them quickly. India's new semiconductor scheme with an initial incentive package of nearly $10 billion was announced towards the end of 2021. By mid-February this year the scheme received three proposals to build new commercial Silicon CMOS semiconductor fab (chip fabrication units); all three are awaiting 'yes/no' decisions from the Central government. Going by the recent statements of Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw the government is in ""advanced stage of evaluation of the applications"" and ""we should have the first agreement signed this year"". Whichever applicant(s) get(s) approved there is very little chance of their new fab in India reaching high volume production before 2026-27. In the mean time it will be worth while to take a closer look at India’s existing facilities and ecosystem with an aim of maximising their productivity and impact for the immediate future. This series titled 'Rejuvenating India's Semiconductor Ecosystem (RISE)' is a thought starter and a call-to-action towards that. The first part will look at Semi-Conductor Lab (SCL) which is India's first and currently the only semiconductor chip fab with full production lines of industry-grade equipment and infrastructure. The second part will look at what can be achieved using 180nm Silicon CMOS technology that SCL has and the third part at the existing R&D fabs in academic and other similar institutions of India SCL Mohali - a brief history Quoting a bit from this report in EETimes published in 2000 SCL originally stood for ""Semiconductor Complex Limited"" a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) in India. ""SCL started production in 1983… A mysterious fire in 1989 knocked out the fab until 1997. The cause of the fire is still unknown but there are suspicions of arson since SCL was designing and developing VLSI technology for the military at the time"" says the report. More interesting is this line ""SCL's revenues in 1999-2000 were about $14 million with a profit of roughly $400000."" . If that is true India had a profitable fab in 2000 despite the fire incident.



The next document that was referred to by this author summarises the 2005 situation - ""..erstwhile SCL Company had accumulated losses of Rs. 132.39 crores as on 31.3.2005 which was more than 50% of its net worth thus making the Company a potentially sick unit. However Government of India taking into account the activities relating to microelectronics and the interests of the employees decided against disinvestment or sale of SCL Company. The Department of Space (DOS) restructured SCL Company into Society namely Semi-Conductor Laboratory Society (SCL Society) registered under the Society Registration Act 1860 on 8.11.2005"" SCL remained ""Semi-Conductor Laboratory"" under ISRO from 2005-06 until 2022 when as per this press release ""SCL Mohali has also been handed over to MeitY from Department of Space and it is being opened up as a commercial fab for wider participation by Indian semiconductor design companies"" . Opening SCL as a commercial fab is a welcome move. Further the government should also revisit the mode of registration of SCL as a 'society' and the ""lab"" that got added to the name together with it. Some of the recent developments and opinions related to SCL (from December 2021 to present) are captured by Swarajya here  here  here and here. Key technologies at SCL Currently as per the SCL website there is a 6 inch (150mm) wafer size fab line for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and an 8 inch (200mm) fab line with 180nm (0.18 micron) process node for CMOS - the latter seems to have been added around 2010-11. A 2010 tender said ""Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) SAS Nagar is operating a 6” Wafer Fab. of 2000 wpm capacity in 1.2 micron /0.8 micron CMOS technology. SCL plans to upgrade its Wafer Fabrication Facility to 8” wafer fab at 0.18 micron technology node. The existing utilities like Ultra Pure Water (UPW) treatment plant and Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) would require commensurate augmentation/expansion to support the 0.18 micron process"" It is interesting that the tender goes into minute details of the requirements for UPW and ETP systems. Anyone who reads through it will be left with no doubt that India is not new to the “ecosystem infrastructure and know-how needed to operate fabs in India”.

Details regarding the addition of the 8 inch (200mm) wafer fab line with 0.18 micron (180nm) technology node are not fully publicly available. However at least two journal papers available in public domain hint that Tower semiconductors of Israel was the industry player that helped SCL in this regard. These publications also give a lot of insight into SCL’s capability and how chips can be designed and fabricated at SCL. These papers are: 1. SCL 180nm CMOS foundry: High reliability ASIC design for aerospace applications : H. S. Jatana and Nilesh M Desai 2015 published by IEEE in 2015 2. From design to tape-out in SCL 180nm CMOS integrated circuit fabrication technology : Joydeep Basu (IIT Kharagpur) published by IETE Journal of education in 2019 This also points out to the possibility that a lot may be common between the 180nm technology of Tower semiconductors and SCL. A design done using the process design kit (PDK) offered by one should be manufacturable at the other as well - in other words SCL most likely shares interoperability with Tower semiconductors for some or all of its 180nm offerings (The flavors that Tower Semiconductor offers within 0.18um can be found here  more on that later) Capacity utilisation and optimisation at SCL The SCL website had a Right To Information (RTI) page with information on a variety of matters - organisation structure decision making process budget and even a list of employees on payroll as of 31 March 2022. However ""Layout Equipment Details and Photographs of Fabrication facility and other Infrastructure"" were under the list of non-disclosure items. The RTI page currently shows ""Page under construction"" though some of the direct links still work. The capacity of fabs are usually measured in Wafer Starts Per Month (WSPM) and there is no publicly available information on what is the possible WSPM for the 200mm wafer size 180nm process node fab line at SCL. Given that the chip orders had so far been limited to some of India’s academic research and space application purposes only the WSPM achieved over the past many years is likely to be much less than what the facility should be able to deliver in theory. The exact number of equipment needed for a certain WSPM can vary from fab to fab based on the technology node and other factors; however an approximate calculation is attempted here based on information available in public domain and some assumptions. The scanners/steppers used for photolithography are usually the costliest. Photolithography is a must-need step for every ""level"" of processing as that is where the design gets transferred (level by level) from the photomask to Silicon wafers (wafer by wafer in hundreds or thousands). 'Level' here refers to say the active area the gate each of the implants contact each of the metals via etc. A 180 nm node typically needs about 25 mask levels of designs to be transferred; the exact number will vary slightly depending on complexity of the chip . See figure below where photolithography is at the centre not all of the other key process steps may be there for every level.

The light source used in the scanner/stepper for photolithography varies depending on the resolution needed - in the case of a 180nm technology levels that have the minimum feature size will need a stepper that has KrF laser (wavelength of 248 nm which is Deep Ultra Violet) as its source whereas levels like the “fat metals” and large area implants can be done using an i-line (365 nm) stepper which is much less costly. Information on the scanner/stepper used at SCL was not directly available on the SCL website however in a “Record of clarifications provided to the queries of the prospective bidders during the Pre-bid Conference held at SCL on February 04 2016..” ISRO clarifies that “SCL has NSR-S204B Nikon Scanner and NSR-2205i14E2 Stepper”. NSR-S204B is a KrF based scanner as per Nikon’s website however the throughput value is not mentioned there. Websites like this and this have quoted a 120 wafers per hour (WPH) number as its standard throughput. NSR-2205i14E2 is an i-line stepper and its datasheet gives a throughput number of 103 WPH. While running in a production line we also need to factor in ""Overall equipment effectiveness"" (OEE) as explained in this paper (summary diagram below).

As elaborated in the paper the goal usually is to achieve an OEE of 60 per cent or more - assuming that and taking a 30-day month as average the combined throughput can be 720hrs X (120 wph + 103 wph) X 60 per cent - that is 96336 full wafer lithographic exposures. Dividing by 25 which is the average number of mask levels in a 180nm chip (design) we get a processing capability of 3853 wafers per month. To achieve that capacity for the 180nm production line of the fab there has to be sufficient number of equipment for the other process steps (etch implant diffusion deposition growth planarization metrology etc) and automation with good overall efficiency. As mentioned before compared to the KrF scanner these equipment are likely to cost much less. Also out of the 25 mask levels it is important to utilise the KrF scanner appropriately for the critical levels that need higher resolution and use the i-line stepper for the others. In other words optimising the loading of the tools is important Interestingly a 2019 “Invitation for Expression of Interest” which is still available on ISRO website said: “Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) .. has an 8 ‘’ CMOS Wafer Fabrication facility comprising 67 processing metrology electrical testing yield and other support equipment. SCL desires to automate the wafer-fab line and through this EOI invites interested and competent parties to submit their proposal for the project”. Further developments on this are not known

Addressing some more factors often brought up as a challenge: This section covers a few arguments that I have heard or read as challenges to a potential rejuvenation of SCL- in some cases suggestions are given as well. a) Are the existing equipment too old and near the end of life ? ASML one of the leading wafer fab equipment makers has a section titled “extending product lifetime” on its website which says ""A well-maintained ASML lithography system can last for decades – almost every system we've ever shipped is still in use at a customer fab”- this is true not just for the lithography equipment made by ASML but of other equipment manufacturers also and for most of the other key fab equipment as well. In fact as per a Nikkei Asia report in April ""Prices of secondhand chipmaking machines have soared over the past two years on ravenous demand"". Fabs around the world will be keen on utilising their existing equipment to the maximum including refurbishment if needed. b) Is there still a market for 180nm ? Is it not an ""outdated"" technology ? Here are some interesting reads - as per a recent article in ComputerWorld “the dearth in chip capacity is mainly for older semiconductors built on legacy logic chips including for example 40nm 90nm 150nm 180nm and 250nm nodes” . The same is reflected in this slightly earlier article in SemiEngineering. In another report this year it is said “200mm Shortages May Persist For Years”. To clarify “200mm fabs manufacture devices at mature process technologies ranging from the 6µm to the 110nm nodes” (so includes 180nm) and as per SEMI the overall 200mm wafer fab capacity is about 6 million wafers a month A more detailed look at product (chips) possibilities at 180nm technology the revenues etc. will be dealt with in the second part of this series

c) Can SCL capture part of the market ? Does it have a good business process/plan ? 4000 wafers a month or over 2 lakh wafers in about 4-5 years is a very small number compared to global capacity. However each wafer will have many chips (how many will depend on the size of individual chip examples in part-2 of this series) and this volume may be able to quench a good amount of India’s domestic needs in the category that can be made using 180nm technology. The aim should also be to try to get some exports - ""Make in India for the world"" At least three factors will be key in this effort: First is to identify products that can be mass produced at SCL. Second is to fine tune SCL’s business plan and operational efficiency to turn it profitable in a few years. Third is to have an attractive business process to be able to match the expectation and satisfaction level of customers. For example tedious tendering processes for every step (example making photomasks from design) may have to be replaced with predetermined vendors. d) Does SCL really need 500-600 employees? Won’t the salary and pension for so many employees and ex-employees make it difficult for SCL to become profitable ? A more accurate answer is possible only based on a detailed analysis of the current employee roles and skill sets however here are some quick thoughts. For the sake of argument let us assume that there are “more employees than what may be an ideal number for reduced operational expenses” - given that SCL is now under MEITY it should be possible to reallocate those not interested to work in a fab to other offices. New opportunities may also arise as part of the government's efforts to grow the semiconductor ecosystem in India including in supply chain management training etc. Apart from opportunities in the government itself it is quite likely that they will be able to find openings in the new private commercial fab(s) that are expected to come up in India in the next few years if they so desire - having worked for SCL as a commercial fab will place them at a unique advantage In December 2021 Gautam Sarkar seemingly an Indian defence enthusiast came up with a compilation titled India’s Semiconductor Research Efforts : The Story So Far. This compilation gave multiple examples of chips fabricated at SCL already. Commercial/Volume production potential for some of those will be examined in part-3 of this series however the fact that they were successfully fabricated at SCL despite it not being fully automated hints at a good percentage of the workforce being quite capable. So. . The brownfield semiconductor chip fabrication facility of SCL at Mohali is an asset which under capable leadership and with proper business plan can be run at much higher capacity commensurate with its operational capability. That will also enhance and reaffirm India’s readiness for the “next wave of commercial fabs”. The government of India has already announced the goal to commercialise SCL. Now Indian business houses should come forward to make it successful through joint venture(s) fabless companies (existing or upcoming) should come up with more products with market value that can be fabricated at SCL in high volume.",,,,,,

This story has been updated. It was originally published on January 15 2018.

Just because you prefer the curved aesthetics of the iPhone doesn’t mean you want to go all-in on the Apple software ecosystem. After all Google and Microsoft make iOS apps that are just as good as Apple’s defaults.

While some apps will require a few extra steps to replace the built-in versions you can make the switch relatively easily especially if you already use Google or Microsoft for your email and other cloud services. And although you can always go back to the Apple versions you may find you simply don’t want to.

How to switch to Microsoft apps

If your computer runs Windows you own a Surface laptop or tablet or you simply like Microsoft products you’ll probably enjoy the company’s iOS apps.

Email calendar and contacts

Start with your email client by downloading Outlook for iOS. In addition to email it can handle your calendars and contacts and works with both Microsoft and non-Microsoft (like say Apple) user accounts. To import any emails calendars or contacts into the app enter your email address when the app prompts you. If you want to add more tap the menu button in the top left then the settings button (the cog icon) choose Add account and then hit Add Email Account.

Calls and messaging

Skype for iOS can take care of all your video calling voice calling and messaging needs. However Apple’s mobile platform doesn’t allow any app to take over SMS duties so you’re stuck with its Messages app. Still the Skype app has a clean look and a comprehensive set of features that includes group chats and group video calls. Your only problem might be getting your friends to use it.

Cloud storage

You can also replace Apple’s cloud storage program iCloud with Microsoft’s OneDrive. When you install the app for iOS it will sync files between your phone and any computer—Windows or macOS—that has the OneDrive desktop client installed. OneDrive also backs up all the photos and videos on your phone though you will have to pay for storage space if you’ve got a lot of files. Prices start at $2 a month.

Digital assistant

When you press and hold your iPhone’s Home or side button Siri is the digital assistant that will launch. You used to be able to install Microsoft’s Cortana on iOS and launch it manually but the company has discontinued its AI’s mobile apps.

Office suite

For your work needs you’ll need to create documents spreadsheets and presentations. Swap Apple’s free Pages Numbers and KeyNote apps for respectively Microsoft’s free Word Excel and PowerPoint apps.

If you’ve already created documents in the Apple apps you’ll need to convert them to a format that Microsoft’s versions can understand. To do so open a file then tap the menu button (three dots in the top right) choose Export and pick the appropriate Microsoft format (Word Excel or PowerPoint). You can also choose how to export the file either sending it via email or saving it to your iPhone’s local storage.

Web browser

If you install the Microsoft Edge web browser on your iPhone you’ll be able to sync bookmarks passwords browsing history and more with an Edge browser you use on a Windows PC. To set Edge as your default browser go to your Settings app tap Edge choose Default Browser App and make sure the check mark is next to Edge not Safari. So when you tap on links in other apps such as Facebook they’ll automatically open in Safari instead of Edge.

Maps

Your iPhone should be fairly well Microsoft-ized by now but for the finishing touch install Microsoft Bing Search which acts as a stripped-down web browser. We prefer Edge for navigating the internet but the Bing app includes a basic map-search feature. That’s as close as you’ll get to replacing Apple Maps with a Microsoft product though because there’s no Bing Maps app for iOS.

How to switch to Google apps

If you’ve decided to take the Google route rather than the Microsoft one start with its signature feature: the Google search app. In addition to searching the internet and Google Maps it provides a feed of news and other information that Google curates based on your previous activity such as your Chrome browsing history. For a more natural conversational approach to Google search install the Google Assistant as well.

Email and contacts

Next install Gmail for iOS. You can pick up your Gmail activity right where you left off on any of your other devices. Alternatively connect Gmail to your Apple email address: Tap your avatar in the top right then Add another account and choose iCloud from the list.

Calls and messaging

Again Apple won’t let you replace Messages as the default SMS app. But you can still manually use Google apps for the same purposes. Try Duo for video calling and Google Chat for messaging phone calls and video chats. While Google Chat remains the most comprehensive option Google continues to add new features to Duo making it a great alternative to FaceTime.

Cloud storage

To back up your data look no further than Google Drive which will sync all your files with computers other mobile devices and your Google cloud locker. For larger files specifically your iPhone photos and videos Google Photos makes backing up a breeze. When you first install the app it’ll ask if you want to back up photos and videos. Keep in mind that everything you save on Google Photos also eats away at the free 15GB of storage space you get from the big G when you sign up. If you need more room you can pay Google for extra space in the cloud which starts at prices of $3 a month.

Office suite

Google has its own office apps for iOS in the form of Docs Sheets and Slides. They interface seamlessly with the web versions so you can keep creating and editing from anywhere.

If you’ve already created documents in the equivalent iOS apps you may need to reformat them to open them with Google’s apps. Launch the appropriate Apple app—Pages Numbers or Keynote—and then open the file you want to transfer. Next tap the menu button (three dots in the top right) choose Export and select Word Excel or PowerPoint. Once you’ve exported the file the appropriate Google app will be able to open it up.

Web browser

Google Chrome for iOS isn’t as full-featured as it is on non-Apple products but you can download it and set it as your default browser: go to your Settings app tap Chrome choose Default Browser App and make sure the check mark is next to Chrome not Safari. Sign into the web browser with your Google account (it should prompt you to do so when you first open the app) and Chrome will carry over all of your bookmarks passwords browsing history and other data from your computer. You can also make sure Gmail links open in Chrome: Open Gmail tap the menu button (three lines) select Settings hit Default apps and check under the Browser heading to ensure the check mark is next to Chrome (tap Chrome’s icon if it’s not).

Maps

Google offers some types of iOS apps that Microsoft doesn’t. For example you can rely on Google Maps to get from A to B quickly and safely and find places of note nearby. If you use the app online or on an Android device you know you’ll also get features such as live traffic updates and a list of favorite “starred” locations. If you need live directions try it in full-screen turn-by-turn navigation mode.

Music and video players

Finally there’s YouTube Music and Google Play Movies & TV which can effectively replace everything that iTunes and Apple Music usually do on an iPhone. They let you stream music films and television shows and even download content for offline access. What you can’t do is purchase new content right from iOS so if you’re buying or renting something new you’ll need to pay up on a computer or other device before the content shows up on your iPhone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVjb3JkLm1lZGlhL21pY3Jvc29mdC1zYXlzLWRlY2lzaW9uLXRvLXN0b3AtYmxvY2tpbmctb2ZmaWNlLXZiYS1tYWNyb3MtYnktZGVmYXVsdC1pcy10ZW1wb3JhcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft says decision to stop blocking Office VBA macros by default is 'temporary',"Microsoft said its decision to roll back a popular change that blocked Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default in a variety of Office apps will be “temporary.”

The company faced significant backlash since it announced on Friday that it would be restoring the feature that was instituted earlier this year.

For years cybersecurity researchers and Microsoft itself said cybercriminals and hackers send macros in Office files to people who unknowingly enable them allowing malicious payloads to be delivered. In many cases malware is delivered and there have been countless instances of data theft remote access ransomware and more.

In February the company said that for macros in files obtained from the internet users will no longer be able to enable content with a click of a button.

“A message bar will appear for users notifying them with a button to learn more. The default is more secure and is expected to keep more users safe including home users and information workers in managed organizations” the company explained in a blog post at the time.

But the company reversed course last week telling The Record that because of “user feedback” they decided to roll back the change “temporarily” while they “make some additional changes to enhance usability.”

“This is a temporary change and we are fully committed to making the default change for all users” the company said in a statement.

“We will provide additional details on timeline in the upcoming weeks.”

The spokesperson added that Microsoft customers can still block internet macros through the Group Policy settings page.

The company would not answer questions about what prompted the change and if it would be restored before the end of the year.

Arctic Wolf’s Ian McShane called the decision “unfortunate and disappointing” noting that it would have been a huge step forward for securing one of the most tried and tested attack paths.

He added that malware like Quakbot and Emotet are distributed through these kinds of malicious docs.

“Whether this was rolled back due to technical concerns or customer feedback office users are less secure today than they were last week; security teams need to be on high alert and re-remind users about the risks of active content in office docs” McShane said.

“While I was surprised to hear that there were plans to address it with a default macro disable I’m even more surprised that those plans are being backpedaled. Overall the question of usability vs. security is a huge problem to solve but the user hurdle of disabled macros is a far smaller price to pay than picking up the pieces of a successful Emotet attack. This attack path has been a well-known problem for decades and unfortunately the approach to mitigating the risk of macros has always been on the end user rather than fix at the source.”

He told The Record that cybersecurity teams should be prepared for a spike in macro based cyber attacks “now that this attack path has been made easier again.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21pY3Jvc29mdC1yZXNlYXJjaGVkLXdoYXQtbWFkZS1lbXBsb3llZXMtdHJ1bHktaGFwcHktb25lLXJlc3VsdC13YXMtc3RhcnRsaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft researched what made employees truly happy. One result was startling,"Collaboration isn't working? (A screenshot from a Microsoft video.) A screenshot from a Microsoft video.

We live to feel good.

That's the American way. We get up every day; we're excited about our lives our jobs and our bank balances.

At least that's what we say -- because a positive attitude is vital to being or appearing to be a success.

Yet is this everything? And has the pandemic incited us to wonder whether we're really so excited about working at all? Even if we're the boss.

Microsoft's deep surveillance.



I've been wondering this for a while as have the people at Microsoft.

I know this because Microsoft's Dawn Klinghoffer and Elizabeth McCune have written about it in the Harvard Business Review.

Klinghoffer is the company's head of people analytics a title that makes her sound like the company shrink. McCune has an even more disturbing title: director of employee listening systems and culture measurement.

Employee listening systems? Shouldn't that be Chief Surveillance Officer?

In essence these two executives seek to discover how Microsoft's employees are feeling about their lives at Microsoft. And indeed about their real lives.

You might think the researchers' priority is employee engagement.

It's such a now word isn't it? Engagement. Brands crave it; companies are desperate for it. It's as if we can't wait to be married to a company but are still waiting for the big day wondering who'll be there.

Microsoft's deep researchers however are over engagement. They discovered it seemed to mask the truth that some employees weren't having such a good time.

""To us this was a reflection that we hadn't yet set a high enough bar for the employee experience"" said Klinghoffer and McCune. ""And it motivated us to do better in measuring what matters.""

Because if you can't measure it does it really matter?

Analyzing the thrive mind.



Their solution was to make their employee survey shorter -- that should have improved engagement -- and try to discover whether there's a definition of thriving.

You may ask what thriving means beyond being the tagline for Kaiser Permanente.

Well for Microsoft it's ""to be energized and empowered to do meaningful work."" (The researchers' italics not mine.)

This is fascinating as only recently I wrote about the owner of a small restaurant which seems to retain an astoundingly happy staff. She suggested that the best way to make employees happy is to give them autonomy.

The Microsoft researchers made a simple discovery about those who really weren't happy at their core. They said: ""Employees who weren't thriving talked about experiencing siloes bureaucracy and a lack of collaboration.

I pause to ask: Does that sound like Microsoft to you?

Stop collaborating so much.



Klinghoffer and McCune were undeterred in their search for the secret of happiness.

They examined those who spoke most positively about thriving at work and work-life balance. They reached a startling picture of a happy Microsoft employee.

They said: ""By combining sentiment data with de-identified calendar and email metadata we found that those with the best of both worlds had five fewer hours in their workweek span five fewer collaboration hours three more focus hours and 17 fewer employees in their internal network size.""

Five fewer collaboration hours? 17 fewer employees in their internal network? Does this suggest that the teamwork mantra isn't working so well? Does it in fact intimate that collaboration may have become a buzzword for a collective that is more a bureaucracy than a truly productive organism?

Klinghoffer and McCune say collaboration isn't bad in itself. However they say: ""It is important to be mindful of how intense collaboration can impact work-life balance and leaders and employees alike should guard against that intensity becoming 24/7.""

If you're a leader you have a way to stop it. If you're an employee not so much.

It's heartening to learn though that perhaps the most important element to making an employee happy at work is giving them time to well actually work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2dldC1hbGwtbWljcm9zb2Z0LW9mZmljZS1wcm9ncmFtcy1mb3ItdGhlLWxvd2VzdC1wcmljZS1ldmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Score the fleet of Microsoft Office programs for the lowest price ever,"Discover startups services products and more from our partner StackCommerce.

The war in Ukraine is “totally scripted” and COVID-19 is “completely fake.” The Boston Marathon bombing? Mass shootings in Newtown Connecticut and Buffalo New York and Uvalde Texas? “Crisis actors” he says.

Wilson a 41-year-old from London Ontario has doubts about free elections vaccines and the Jan. 6 insurrection too. He accepts little of what has happened in the past 20 years and cheerfully predicts that someday the internet will make everyone as distrustful as he is.

“It’s the age of information and the hidden government the people who control everything they know they can’t win” Wilson told The Associated Press. “They’re all lying to us. But we’re going to break through this. It will be a good change for everyone.”

Wilson who is now working on a book about his views is not an isolated case of perpetual disbelief. He speaks for a growing number of people in Western nations who have lost faith in democratic governance and a free press and who have turned to conspiracy theories to fill the void.

Rejecting what they hear from scientists journalists or public officials these people instead embrace tales of dark plots and secret explanations. And their beliefs say experts who study misinformation and extremism reflect a widespread loss of faith in institutions like government and media.

A poll conducted last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that just 16% of Americans say democracy is working well or extremely well. Another 38% said it’s working only somewhat well.

Other surveys reveal how many people in the United States now doubt the media politicians science and even each other.

The distrust has gone so deep that even groups that seem ideologically aligned are questioning each others’ motives and intentions.

On the day before Independence Day in Boston this year a group of about 100 masked men carrying fascist flags marched through the city. Members proudly uploaded videos and photos of the march to online forums popular with supporters of former President Donald Trump and QAnon adherents who believe a group of satanic cannibalistic child molesters secretly runs the globe.

Instead of praise the white supremacists were met with incredulity. Some posters said the marchers were clearly FBI agents or members of antifa — shorthand for anti-fascists — looking to defame Trump supporters. It didn’t matter that the men boasted of their involvement and pleaded to be believed. “Another false flag” wrote one self-described conservative on Telegram.

Similarly when an extremist website that sells unregulated ghost guns — firearms without serial numbers — asked its followers about their July 4th plans several people responded by accusing the group of working for the FBI. When someone claiming to be Q the figure behind QAnon reappeared online recently many conservatives who support the movement speculated that the new Q was actually a government plant.

This past week when a Georgia monument that some conservative Christians criticized as satanic was bombed many posters on far-right message boards cheered. But many others said they didn’t believe the news.

“I don’t trust it. I’m still thinking ff” wrote one woman on Twitter referencing “false flag” a term commonly used by conspiracy theorists to describe an event they think was staged.

The global public relations firm Edelman has conducted surveys about public trust for more than two decades beginning after the 1999 World Trade Organization’s meeting in Seattle was marred by anti-globalization riots. Tonia Reis director of Edelman’s Trust Barometer surveys said trust is a precious commodity that’s vital for the economy and government to function.

“Trust is absolutely essential to everything in society working well” Reis said. “It’s one of those things that like air people don’t think about it until they realize they don’t have it or they’ve lost it or damaged it. And then it can be too late.”

For experts who study misinformation and human cognition the fraying of trust is tied to the rise of the internet and the way it can be exploited on contentious issues of social and economic change.

Distrust and suspicion offered obvious advantages to small bands of early humans trying to survive in a dangerous world and those emotions continue to help people gauge personal risk today. But distrust is not always well suited to the modern world which requires people to trust the strangers who inspect their food police their streets and write their news. Democratic institutions with their regulations and checks and balances are one way of adding accountability to that trust.

When that trust breaks down polarization and anxiety increases creating opportunities for people pushing their own “ alternative facts.”

“People can’t fact check the world” said Dr. Richard Friedman a New York City psychiatrist and professor at Weill Cornell Medical College who has written about the psychology of trust and belief. “They’re awash in competing streams of information both good and bad. They’re anxious about the future and there are a lot of bad actors with the ability to weaponize that fear and anxiety.”

Those bad actors include grifters selling bad investments or sham remedies for COVID-19 Russian disinformation operatives trying to undermine Western democracies or even homegrown politicians like Trump whose lies about the 2020 election spurred the Jan. 6 attack.

Research and surveys show belief in conspiracy theories is common and widespread. Believers are more likely to to get their information from social media than professional news organizations. The rise and fall of particular conspiracy theories are often linked to real-world events and social economic or technological change.

Like Wilson people who believe in one conspiracy theory are likely to believe in others too even if they are mutually contradictory. A 2012 paper for instance looked at beliefs surrounding the death of Princess Diana of Wales in a 1997 car crash. Researchers found that subjects who believed strongly that Diana was murdered said they also felt strongly that she could have faked her own death.

Wilson said his belief in conspiracies began on Sept. 11 2001 when he couldn’t accept that the towers could be knocked down by airliners. He said he found information on the internet that confirmed his beliefs and then began to suspect there were conspiracies behind other world events.

“You have to put it all together yourself” Wilson said. “The hidden reality what’s really going on they don’t want you to know.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZW4ubWVyY29wcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9tb2Rlcm5hLXMtcGVkaWF0cmljcy12YXgtdG8tYmVjb21lLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1hcmdlbnRpbmEtbGF0ZXItdGhpcy1tb250aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna's pediatrics vax to become available in Argentina later this month,"Moderna's pediatrics vax to become available in Argentina later this month

Vizzotti also explained the Ministry was after Moderna's bivariate vaccine against the original and the Omicron variants

Argentina's Health Minister Carla Vizzotti Friday announced her country was about to receive the first batch of 1400000 doses of Moderna's pediatric COVID-19 vaccine to be applied to children between six months and three years of age.

Before Moderna's there were no vaccines for children that age. The shipment is due July 25 and the drug already has the approval of the Anmat sanitary agency.

After Vizzotti's announcement President Alberto Fernández posted on his Twitter account that Argentina becomes the first country in Latin America and one of the first in the world to start vaccinating girls and boys from that age against Covid-19.

Vizzotti also explained the new medication can be used on children aged between 3 and 5 years who have already received Sinopharm's drug. The minister also announced that she hoped that by the end of the year Moderna's bivariate vaccine against the original and the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 for adults will become available. That medication however still needs to go through Anmat's approval.

The President was very happy with this news because since the first day of the pandemic the national government and the Ministry of Health have been working to achieve it and he asked me to communicate it immediately to the families who have been waiting since the beginning of the pandemic to vaccinate their children who make up a very particular population especially children at risk Vizzotti stressed.

I have informed the President that Argentina has advanced all the steps with the Moderna laboratory for its authorization by Anmat and the amendment of the contract and he confirmed that the first shipment of 1400000 pediatric doses will arrive from the week of July 25 to be able to vaccinate children between six months and three years of age she added.

The amendment includes being able to receive from the end of the year pending regulatory authorization whose process has already begun the bivariate vaccine against the original variant of Covid-19 and the Omicron variant for adults Vizzotti also explained.

This process has the endorsement of the National Immunization Commission” explained Vizzotti who also announced shoe would hold a virtual meeting Monday with the Argentine Society of Pediatrics (SAP) to convey data on the new vaccines with technical guidelines for pediatricians nationwide.

In addition ”we are going to hold as always meetings with the Federal Health Council (Cofesa) and move forward with the provincial plans as the doses arrive in order to define the plan for each jurisdiction.

Vizzotti underlined that until now there were no vaccines available in the world for this age group but some three weeks ago the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European agency gave the go-ahead for these vaccines for children under five years of age.

Since we had vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine from three to 11 years of age we needed a booster vaccine for children from three to four years of age and to start the two-dose schedule she added.

When highlighting the importance of vaccination to minimize the impact of the virus the minister estimated that the virus will remain seasonal we will surely have cases every year in winter and most of those cases will be in unvaccinated high-risk people.

Vizzotti also admitted there has been an increase of cases in people over fifty years of age but said that since the beginning of this winter the increase was not of the magnitude of previous years and did not translate into hospitalizations.

Regarding facemasks which are mandatory at the federal level Vizzotti said that we are at the moment when the number of cases is already decreasing with the vaccination we are evaluating in the Federal Health Council and in the Ministry of Health when the obligatory nature could be withdrawn and move on to the recommendation knowing that the population has listened and has taken care of itself.

According to the minister little more than 90 percent of the Argentine population has taken one dose 82% two doses and among those over 50 years of age more than 70 percent have received the first booster dose and we are one of the few countries that are giving the second booster.”

Ramesh Dookhoo Honorary Consul in Guyana for the Republic of Korea presented the vaccines to the Minister of Health Dr Frank Anthony at a simple handing-over ceremony at the ministry’s bond in Kingston Georgetown.

While expressing his gratitude to the South Korean representative Anthony said that although the vaccines will be used primarily for first and second doses it can also be used for booster shots.

“So we’ll use these vaccines as part of our vaccination programme. They’re all adult doses so we’ll be able to use it to give primary doses first and second dose but we can also use it for booster doses.”

He also used the occasion to encourage persons to take their booster shots which are now available for persons 12 years and older and which can be accessed at any of the vaccination sites around the country.

Anthony also emphasised that because of the Omicron variant now present in Guyana persons need to take their booster shots since their immunity from their first two doses can wane and they can become vulnerable to the variant.

The Minister further noted that another donation of the Pfizer vaccine from the United States was expected and another handing-over ceremony will be held early this week for it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXNzb2NpYXRlc3RpbWVzLmNvbS9ndXlhbmEtcmVjZWl2ZXMtNDA4MDAtZG9zZXMtb2YtbW9kZXJuYS12YWNjaW5lcy1mcm9tLWdvdnQtb2YtcmVwdWJsaWMtb2Ytc291dGgta29yZWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana receives 40800 doses of Moderna vaccines from govt of Republic of South Korea,"During the brief handing-over ceremony at the Ministry of Health’s Bond in Kingston Health Minister Dr Frank Anthony welcomed the donation.

When Musk dropped a regulatory filing late Friday saying he was walking away from his $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter Inc. some of the bankers who were backing him felt a mixture of disappointment and relief even with millions of dollars in fees at risk according to people familiar with the matter.

“He did burn bankers for tons of time” said Susan Wolford a former investment banker who was vice chair and ran the tech group at Bank of Montreal. “You have to take this to committee you have to do all the work for something that large.”

While Musk has said he’s walking away Twitter has vowed to keep the deal alive and has threatened legal action.

Many of the bankers had no heads-up from Musk’s camp that the filing was coming with one person saying that for legal reasons the group in the know was kept small. Asking not to be identified because the matter is private they said they had an inkling of Musk’s second thoughts from the first time he tweeted that the deal was on hold in May.

Busted hopes

It was the second time in five years that Musk fielded an ambitious acquisition idea that got Wall Street’s hopes up only to change his mind. In that 2018 episode Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private with the claim “funding secured.”

The Twitter agreement had made it to the announcement stage though with many banks lending their balance sheets and names to his effort led by Morgan Stanley. According to Musk’s Friday filing Morgan Stanley has spent much of the past two months “requesting critical information from Twitter.”

A representative for Morgan Stanley couldn’t be reached for comment.

Fees imperiled

The fee bonanza from the deal is now in peril. Twitter bankers Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were set to earn a combined $133 million in fees once it closed according to filings. Morgan Stanley and the other banks working with Musk were also expected to have a big payday.

Banks and other advisers could still get a small fee even if the deal dissolves—but likely only a fraction of their take if it closed.

Even though they said Musk had lost some credibility most of the bankers who didn’t want to be identified said they would jump at the chance of working with Musk again.

Musk’s business empire is the main reason. SpaceX was worth $125 billion in a fundraising round in May making it the most valuable U.S. startup on record according to data from CBInsights. The bankers who stand to lose out on the Twitter deal still got closer to Musk during this process perhaps allowing them to still feast on fees if SpaceX goes public as expected in the next few years.

Musk owes

“After doing this the bankers can say you kind of owe me now. I didn’t get paid” Wolford said. “They’re in pole position to lead the next deal. He’s informally obliged to pay them with something else.”

Tesla which has a market value of almost $780 billion could also pursue transactions whether it’s M&A or debt financing. Musk’s futuristic brain-computer interface startup Neuralink has also been in fundraising mode and has attracted more money than other companies in the field. Meanwhile his tunneling startup Boring Co. was valued at $6 billion in April.

One banker said it’s hard to ignore the mercurial Musk the world’s richest person even if he shoots from the hip on megadeals. Musk’s personal wealth totals almost $227 billion according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“He’s a once in a lifetime client” said Mark Boidman head of media and entertainment at Solomon Partners. “He’s created some of the most iconic companies of course everybody wants to be his banker.”

While deal teams at the banks toiled over holiday weekends and through sleepless nights to get Musk to the finish line it’s the nature of the business for those efforts to often go to waste they said. Usually that happens before a deal gets announced though one person acknowledged.

Off hook

Some of the advisers were relieved at the prospect of getting off the hook for the billions of dollars they agreed to lend Musk.

Since the merger was announced the financing market for take-private deals has melted down. Banks have been struggling with more traditional technology acquisitions.

The buyout of Citrix Systems Inc. which was expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees could now deliver $1 billion in losses instead Bloomberg News previously reported.

It’s also not the end of journey. Bankers will be closely watching the legal situation play out and haven’t ruled out the possibility that the deal could still close they added. Twitter said within minutes of Musk’s filing Friday that it would seek to enforce its agreement in a Delaware court one that typically frowns on efforts to back out of merger agreements.

Whatever the outcome Musk seems likely to have his choice of bankers whenever he needs them next.

“I would work for Elon Musk any day” said John Chachas founder and a managing principal at Methuselah Advisors.

“He has flaunted convention” Chachas said. “He is unconventional. He has no patience for bureaucracy which he views as value negative. So if people find him frightening maybe that’s an institutional bias against creativity?”

The U.S. Dollar Smile Theory is a popular notion that illustrates that the U.S. Dollar stays positive in good as well as bad market conditions. This theory was created by a former economist and strategist Morgan Stanley and it became popular in 2007.This was the time when the U.S. dollar witnessed a significant boost amidst the global recession. Many times looking at the market conditions people would think the U.S. dollar would fall but surprisingly it continues to grow.The Dollar Smile Theory answers this question.Following are the three scenarios that Morgan Stanley put forward to explain the positive growth of the U.S. Dollar.The Strength Due To Risk AversionThe first reason that the U.S. dollar rise is due to risk aversion. This is a situation where investors rely more on safe-haven currencies such as the dollar yen etc. During this period investors consider the global economy in an unstable position. Hence they are less likely to invest in the risky asset; instead they put their cash on U.S. dollars.Under this scenario the US dollar falls to a new low. The bottom of the smile indicates the dull performance of the currency as the economy struggles with weak fundamentals. Additionally the possibility of falling interest rates also impacts the position of the U.S. Dollar. This results in the market participants steering clear from the dollar.Subsequently the primary motto of the U.S. Dollar becomes to Sell. Investors move from buying the currency to selling it and moving towards currencies that are providing higher yields.The U.S. dollar continues to grow because of the strong economy of the country. After the low a new smile emerges as the economy sees its light at the end of the tunnel. With the signs of the recovery of the economy a sense of optimism spreads through the market.This increases the sentiments towards the dollar again. With the US economy enjoying higher GDP growth the greenback continues to appreciate. This increases the interest rate in the international market.Let’s take a look at the Dollar Smile Theory in reality…As you can see due to the global pandemic which has caused a lot of economies all over the world to suffer the U.S. dollar is acting as a safe haven currency. All countries including the U.S. aren’t doing so great.The key is relative economic growth. If growth from other countries is growing but the U.S. economy is growing even faster then the U.S. dollar will swing upward to the right side.So will the Dollar Smile Theory hold true? Only time will tell!Though the theory is quite relevant and backed by some logic the economy is extremely volatile. So only time will tell how definite the Dollar Smile theory is in the future.In any case this is an important theory to keep in mind. Remember all economies are cyclical. They strengthen then they weaken they strengthen then they weaken and repeat.The key part is determining which part of the cycle the U.S. economy and then compare how it’s doing against the rest of the world .sources:forex.academy .babypips.comthis article is For information purposes only!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZWxvbi1tdXNrLWJ1eS10d2l0dGVyLWJhbmstZmVlcy1tZXJnZXItMjAyMi030gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9lbG9uLW11c2stYnV5LXR3aXR0ZXItYmFuay1mZWVzLW1lcmdlci0yMDIyLTc_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Elon Musk backing out of Twitter deal affects Wall Street,"Hi Aaron Weinman here back from vacation. And Elon Musk was kind enough to wait until I returned to call off his $44 billion pursuit of Twitter.

Let's unpack how this impacts the Wall Street banks that expected a ""nine-figure"" payday from the deal.

Sign up here to get 10 Things on Wall Street in your inbox.

1. Musk's decision to terminate a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter could scupper one of Wall Street's best-ever paydays. The transaction would've been the third-biggest fee pool for a merger or acquisition since 2020 according to data from Refinitiv. It's a hammer blow in what's been a poor year for dealmaking across the capital markets.

Musk said he terminated the agreement to buy Twitter because of ""false and misleading"" numbers of fake user accounts. Musk has questioned Twitter's claims that it has about 5% of spam accounts on its platform but it's going to be a tall order to prove this in court.

Bankers are hopeful a court will force Musk to close the deal otherwise they could miss out on more than $190 million in fees.

That's not including the fees the underwriting banks — Morgan Stanley BofA Barclays MUFG BNP Paribas Mizuho and Société Générale — stand to pocket from selling about $13 billion in debt in the capital markets in the form of high-yield bonds or leveraged loans.

These banks needed just six days to iron out a deal for Musk and Twitter and did it without Twitter's financials. Some even passed on participating in the financing because they were skeptical over Twitter's ability to make money.

But the allure of a billionaire and the deluge of business he provides Wall Street was enough to convince these lenders to do a deal.

""When you're the richest man in the world you can mess around with anyone and people will come back to you. I'm sure the banks will moan about it but they'll probably be there for the next deal. That's the nature of the trade"" one banker told Insider.

With Musk and Twitter destined for a fiery legal battle bankers are hoping the deal crosses the finish line.

The record attempt is scheduled for Tuesday at Basha High in Chandler the supermarket said in a press release. Bakery teams are tasked with putting together over 14000 doughnuts – that’s 900 square feet – in the shape of the anniversary logo.

The record of 7040 doughnuts laid out over 512 square feet was set in January 2012.

Bashas’ said teams will make the doughnuts at different stores Monday morning then take them to the school near Val Vista Drive and Riggs Road on Tuesday morning.

The doughnut challenge is the shortest-lived of the events planned for the 90-dayslong anniversary.

There will be gift card giveaways from July 27-Oct. 4 a community choice charity challenge from July 18-Sept. 23 and random acts of kindness Sept. 17-18.

“Our goal is to express our gratitude and use this milestone as an opportunity to be of additional service to our communities” President Edward “Trey” Basha grandson of the company co-founder said in a press release.

The family-owned chain was officially acquired by California-based Raley’s in December but remains headquartered in the East Valley.

The sale guaranteed the continuation of Bashas’ store service across Arizona and New Mexico while allowing Bashas’ to be a fully formed operating company within Raley’s enterprise.

Bashas’ brands also include Food City and AJ’s Fine Foods.

Called “City Protect” the program updates daily all criminal activity that takes place in the 9-mile town.

Surf City Police Chief Phil Vorhees said the goal is to provide transparency to those living in Surf City and also offer a more accessible route for submitting tips directly related to incidents.

The system costs roughly $4000 a year and is hosted by Motorola Solutions. It’s also used by a dozen other law enforcement agencies in the state the closest being the Wilmington Police Department as well as entities such as Durham Public Schools.

“I think for what we spend and the product we’re getting back it’s well worth it” Vorhees said.

The town had already been contracted with Motorola on its submit-a-tip platform since summer 2020 but upgraded the system last month to City Protect.

When someone logs into the site tiny icons with different symbols pop up. When clicked the icons indicate the type of crime that occurred and the general vicinity in which it happened.

While it doesn’t offer the exact address for victims’ safety Vorhees explained it pinpoints the incident within a one-block radius.

The information includes the date and time the crime occurred as well as the case number. If residents want to learn more they can request a full report from the police department.

“It gives the general public an idea on what police deal with and where things are happening” Vorhees said.

Information can be filtered by date specific crimes and location; however the new system only pulled in data from the last six to eight months. Moving forward more data will be available for searching.

There is also an option to submit a crime tip such as a person of interest leaving the scene a license plate or a description.

“We rely on public information witnesses camera systems to help with investigations” Vorhees said. “Those are two big things.”

He explained many crimes are solved with the help of personal surveillance systems. City Protect includes a camera registration element.

Residents or business owners can voluntarily register a personal camera in turn informing Surf City PD where cameras are located. If officers are investigating a report nearby they know where to go to request accessing footage.

“We’re not trying to log in and watch their house” Vorhees said. “If something happens they would have to voluntarily give us access to the footage. We will have no interaction with their program other than we know it’s there.”

The data pulled from City Protect will not include any traffic citations including DWIs. Vorhees said that could change in the future.

“As time goes by more data will be stored in the system and we will continue to grow it by seeing what works and what doesn’t” he said.

While crime is down overall by 15% in Surf City Vorhees said he plans to use the data to create a heat map of crime to modify patrol schedules and procedures as needed.

But the main takeaway Vorhees hopes to see is residents be more vigilant especially if crime is spiking in their neighborhoods or areas they frequent. For example if there is an increase in the number of cars being robbed he hopes it will signal those living in the vicinity to remember to lock their vehicles upon each exit.

The ASX: SYI ) and ASX: VSO ) are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) operating in the Australian shares sector and aiming to make investing as simple as possible.

The SPDR SYI ETF invests in a diversified portfolio of high-yielding ‘blue chip’ Australian companies – excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs). This ETF tracks the MSCI Australia Select High Dividend Yield Index.

The Vanguard VSO ETF provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of Australian small caps and tracks the MSCI Australian Shares Small Cap Index. This is a low-cost way to access the performance of Australian small-cap shares through a single fund.

See our ASX VSO report – it’s totally free.

Okay so we know what they’re designed to do the sectors and strategies. Now what? One of the quick ways to compare ETFs like VSO and SYI is to study the fee load. No one likes paying high fees if they don’t need to. Here at Best ETFs and Rask Australia we begin by analysing the fees and ‘all in’ costs of an ETF or fund. Our team will score ETFs based on management fees plus any other costs then put them into quartiles by sector strategy and across the entire ETF market.

To make this article easier to digest we’ll just study the fees or ‘management expense ratio’ (MER). Using data for December 2021 the SYI ETF has an MER of 0.35% while the VSO ETF had a yearly fee of 0.30%. So VSO wins on this metric. Keep in mind a more insightful metric to know is the fee quartiles that these ETFs find themselves in (note: quartile 1 is best). Meaning we take all the Australian shares ETFs in our database and put them into 4 quartiles based on their fees. For example any ETF which has a fee below 0.3% would be considered in our first (best) quartile.

Track record

Let’s look at the past results. Keep in mind performance isn’t everything — and past performance is not indicative of future performance. It’s just one part of a much bigger picture. The reason we say performance is not everything is because of volatility of financial markets and the economy from one year to the next. Some ETFs and funds can put in a strong return one year just to generate weak returns the next time around. That’s why we prefer three-year or seven-year track records over one-year track records. It can smooth out the temporary performances caused by external factors. Both ETFs have achieved our three-year performance hurdle. As of December 2021 the SYI ETF had an average annual return of 13.08%. During the same time the VSO ETF returned 20.08%.

One final point: the ETF provider is important. In Australia we believe there are a handful of stand-out ETF providers and many that are mid-pack or very fresh. As you guessed the provider backing the SYI ETF is SPDR. And SPDR ranks highly for our scores of ETF providers and issuers in Australia. We think SPDR is one of Australia’s top 10 ETF providers for advisers and institutions and its ETFs on the ASX provide good exposure to particular financial markets for retail investors. VSO’s ETF provider on the ASX is Vanguard. Vanguard ranks highly for our scores of ETF providers and issuers in Australia. We consider Vanguard to be in Australia’s top three ETF providers for retail investors advisers and institutions.

What it all means

To keep reading about these two ETFs be sure to visit our free SYI ETF report or VSO ETF review.

In summary the VSO ETF ranks better against our internal scoring methodology and by quite some distance against SYI.

Please keep in mind there is much more to choosing a good ETF. That’s why you should now use these skills to find the best ETF you can. If you want the name of our team’s top ETF pick for 2022 keep reading…",,,,,,,,,

The stock market sentiment during last week is fluctuating between fear and extreme fear based on the Fear & Greed Index by CNN.

Yet the tell-tale signs as shown in the market breadth indicator and the price volume analysis of S&P 500 using the Wyckoff method signal a potential big move ahead as explained in the video at the bottom of this post. Also according to the seasonality chart of the U.S. midterm elections for the past 72 years the stock market could be already in the bottoming process as shown in the comparison chart below.

Using Seasonality Chart as Market Bottom Indicator

Although history doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes. That’s why seasonality or cyclical charts are popular as it is invaluable in analysing the stock market. Refer to the seasonality chart by Seasonax below.

In the first half of 2022 the seasonality chart of the U.S. midterm elections has worked exceptional well in S&P 500 as shown in the comparison chart above where the upper pane is the midterm elections seasonality chart based on the data from the past 72 years while the lower pane is the current price of S&P 500.

The downtrend in January was followed by a technical rally and consolidation in February which led to a rally in March. The reversal of the uptrend in April marked the worst down move followed by a relief rally in May. Eventually the downtrend resumed in June and created a lower low.

The direction of S&P 500 in each month since this year followed the midterm election seasonality chart closely. Only the magnitude (both to the upside and downside) and the timing were slightly off such as a lower low (instead of a higher low) was formed in February and March before the strong rally happened. Also the rally in March did not create a higher high compared to January’s as shown in the seasonality chart.

The low formed in June was followed by 3 months of consolidation in a trading range without creating a lower low as shown in the first pane of the chart based on the midterm elections seasonality.

The consolidation between June to September is the bottoming process for S&P 500 before a sign of strength rally breaks above the trading range in October which completes the Wyckoff accumulation structure to start the uptrend.

If the S&P 500 follows the playbook of the midterm elections seasonality chart in the second half of the year bottoming process is likely unfolding already. A potential trading range between 3650-4200 could last until October 2022 as shown below.

Story continues

This is significant because while the market is finding its bottom over the next few months outperforming stocks showing the Wyckoff accumulation characteristics as explained in the video are likely to start moving higher. This is the nature of the leadership stocks which will lead in the next bull market.

Stock Market Breadth Signals the Next Big Move in S&P 500

As mentioned earlier on multiple clues from the market breadth indicator and the price volume analysis suggest the next big move in S&P 500. Watch the video below to find out how to spot those characteristics that are likely leading to the next big move in S&P 500.

Combining with the market bottom analysis using the seasonality chart of the U.S. midterm elections risk-on sentiment could be resumed in the second half of the year. Visit TradePrecise.com to get more stock market insights in email for free.

The original Death Note manga began in 2003 and the anime in 2006. Smart phones were far from the ubiquitous items they are today and if introduced into Death Note’s world now they alone would create a sizable stumbling block for the story. Much of Death Note relies on Light avoiding detection including by being able to hold secret conversations with the Shinigami Ryuk.

While surveillance cameras and the like did play a part in the original manga and anime the addition of smart phones to the world would make it incredibly difficult for either Light or his main rival L to avoid detection. Add to that the proliferation of monitoring technology in major cities and it would mean that any new Death Note series set in present day would have to alter its story in some way to address modern world advancements. Perhaps it’d have to throw out some of the more iconic moments of the original manga in favor of new strategies that Light can employ to avoid detection through smart phones.

If the Duffer Brothers need a guide on how to handle this Death Note itself has provided some helpful guideposts. The one-shot manga sequel The a-Kira Story published in 2020 directly addresses how the world has changed since Light’s story. The manga is set in the present day and sees Ryuk give the Death Note to a new human Minoru Tanaka who specifically states that Light’s (also known as Kira) old tricks wouldn’t work now:



“There’s a security camera on every street corner now and in every train car and buses have dashcams. They’re more sophisticated at investigating cybercrimes. So if Kira tried to get his message out online they’d track him down right away… and the police have tabs on all cell phone calls. Untraceable messages online only happen when TV shows and movies need to write that way to make things dramatic.”



In a-Kira Tanaka avoids the use of the internet all together to try and sell the Death Note. He doesn’t even write in it because he’s so concerned about the possible repercussions. It should be noted that this manga is basically a side story and it’s doubtful the Duffer Brothers will take very much from it. However it at least demonstrates the things they should keep in mind if adapting Death Note for the present day.

Of course this can all be avoided if the Duffers just stick to the mid-2000s for their series or hell they could set it in the ‘80s for maximum Stranger Things synergy. That would certainly be a unique take on Death Note we’ve not seen before. The point is after 20 years of Death Note adaptations the new Netflix series will have to try new things to set itself apart but it also needs to remember what made this story great in the first place.

What do you think the new Death Note series should update about this story? How would you like Do you think they’ll try to make Light/Kira even more sympathetic this time around?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vb3dlbi13aWxzb24tbW92aWVzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Every Owen Wilson Movie On Netflix,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vb3dlbi13aWxzb24tbW92aWVzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZm9ybWVyLW5ldGZsaXgtaWJtLXNvZnR3YXJlLWVuZ2luZWVyLXR1cm5lZC10aWt0b2tlci10YWxrcy1yZXRpcmluZy1hdC0zMNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZm9ybWVyLW5ldGZsaXgtaWJtLXNvZnR3YXJlLWVuZ2luZWVyLXR1cm5lZC10aWt0b2tlci10YWxrcy1yZXRpcmluZy1hdC0zMC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Netflix IBM software engineer turned TikToker talks retiring at 30,"A former software engineer is making a name for himself on TikTok offering advice on careers the tech industry investing and more.

Frank Niu a full-time dad who retired at age 30 after working at IBM Credit Karma Netflix and GrubHub which Amazon just took a small stake in tells FOX Business that his Tiktok account was created in early December of last year to compete with his wife.

My wife had actually started at Tiktok account. She had a couple thousand followers and she was kind of gloating about it saying ""Check it out. I'm so famous."" Like rubbing it in my face"" Niu explains. ""We're both very very competitive people. And so I thought 'Okay you know what? I'm going to start my own TikTok account and I'm going to beat you. Give me until end of the year.'""

Within three to four days of launching his account Niu easily surpassed his wife's follower count. Since then the multi-millionaire has amassed over 748000 followers.

EMPLOYERS ADD 372K JOBS IN JUNE AS HIRING REMAINS STEADY

Niu who grew up in a poor family graduated from Iowa State University in 2013. He landed his first job as a software engineer at IBM in January 2014 where he was given a $74000 salary and $5000 signing bonus.

""I did really well for my group as one of the top performers but after one year they didn't give me a promotion which really made me quite upset"" he explained. ""I actually quit my job before I even found a new one.""

After leaving IBM in June 2015 and losing a portion of his money to day trading Niu moved to San Francisco in hopes of working for a tech startup.

Though he secured a position as a DevOps engineer with the tech firm Dwolla a month after leaving IBM the stint was short-lived as he was laid off in December 2015. During that job he earned a salary of $125000 salary a $5000 signing bonus and stock options.

Two months later he joined Credit Karma as a senior software engineer where he was given a $138000 salary and $100000 stock package. Although Credit Karma ""checked a lot of the boxes"" he was looking for in a company he ended up quitting that job in May 2017 to go run a cryptocurrency startup which ""went nowhere.""

SNAPCHAT UPDATE ALLOWS USERS TO VIEW EACH OTHER'S EXACT LOCATION

As Niu focused on his next move he and his then-girlfriend were thinking about getting engaged and settling down. The couple ended up moving to Chicago where Niu took a job with GrubHub in July 2017 as a senior site reliability engineer earning a $140000 salary a $7500 sign on bonus and a $200000 stock package.

""The job and everything was great"" he said. ""I got really lucky with my stock grants hit like 4x or something so my total salary and compensation shot up to like an insane level.""

Ultimately they decided not to stay in Chicago long-term and have since settled down in Canada. Niu got a job as a tech lead with Netflix in April 2019 which ended up offering him more than $500000 in total compensation. However he reevaluated what was important in his life following a death in the family and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Basically my entire reporting channel at Netflix from like the vice president down to my immediate manager was let go within the span of like two years or so during the time I was working there"" he noted. ""And I got a new manager who as new managers do shake things up. And she wanted me to come back early from paternity leave. And I made it very clear before I left that I was not going to do that.""

In October he took severance from the streaming behemoth and started raising his two kids full-time. At the time of his departure he and his wife had surpassed their goal of reaching $2 million in assets.

""Money doesn't buy happiness but it buys you freedom"" he said. ""I'm able to focus on family or friends or my health or things that I care more about.""

In addition to raising his kids and posting on TikTok Niu and his wife have started a podcast. He's also made his first angel investment with Beacons and has been asked to serve as an advisor at several startups.

Niu's advice for anyone looking to retire early is to work in a high-paying career that allows you to maximize your salary job-hop frequently to ensure you're being paid the highest possible rate in your field live below your means and invest your money.

For new investors getting started he recommends dollar cost averaging into S&P 500 index funds. In order to protect yourself from inflation he suggests Series I Savings bonds.

Niu also emphasizes the importance of not letting fear or negativity get in the way of trying to be financially successful.

""It's the people I've known throughout my life that are the hardest working and have the greatest ambition who've been really able to grab a hold of traditional financial success and be where they are in life. And like none of them made excuses"" he said.

They’re designed to be downloaded so you don’t need an internet connection to play them and there are no ads or in-app purchases so as long as you have a Netflix account you’re good to go. If you’re ready to try out a game or two here’s how to find them.

Start with the right device

Netflix games are only available on certain mobile devices at this time. That’s in contrast to something like the Apple Arcade which is made to be friendly for controllers and set-top boxes like Apple TVs. Netflix games however aren’t available as native downloads on TVs (we’ll address a potential workaround to this below). To start you’ll need either an iOS or an Android device – these are the compatible models:

Any Android phone or tablet that can run Android 8.0 or later

Any iPhone or iPad that can run iOS/iPadOS 15 or later

Since the operating system updates are a key part of compatibility make sure that your device has the latest OS update before you begin. If your onboard storage is especially full you may want to take a moment and clear up some space so you’ll be ready to download.

Choose and download a Netflix game

Step 1: Open up the Netflix app on your mobile device. If you’ve never downloaded it to the device before you can find it in the Apple Store and Google Play Store.

Step 2: Log into your profile and scroll down through Netflix’s rows of categories. These can be a little random but it shouldn’t be long before you come across a new row called Games. If you’re on Android you can also select a separate Games tab which may save a little time. You can then swipe left to move through the list of games. Choose one that looks interesting.

Step 3: The game page will now display. You can check out the summary player modes and age rating and watch some trailers to get an idea of the game. If it’s something that you want to try choose either Install or Get game depending on the platform you’re on. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the download.

Step 4: Depending on the platform and game you may get a Permissions pop-up at this point. Accept it to move on. You may also have to log in with your account password or other information.

Step 5: Here things diverge a little based on the platform. On Android you may get a new app in the app drawer or home screen or you may have to access the game again from the Netflix app. On Apple’s iOS you’ll always get a separate downloaded app on your home screen. Find the game and select it to begin. It should start immediately.

Step 6: Note that you cannot install games if you are using a kid’s profile on Netflix. You actually won’t see games at all. And games may not appear if a profile is set to a certain maturity level that the game goes beyond.

Playing Netflix games on a smart TV

Are you really invested in a TV gaming experience or do you want to share your experience with a group? While you may not be able to get games directly on your TV there’s still a way. Here’s what you can try.

Step 1: Make sure you have a smart TV with casting support for standards like AirPlay and Chromecast casting.

Step 2: When in your game screen on Netflix or in the app look for the small Casting button. Select it to review your casting options (you may have to change permission settings to enable this). Make sure your smart TV is on and online and look for its device name.

Step 3: With your smart TV selected the game should now cast to your larger screen so you can view it there. But that doesn’t always mean that a game will work with a controller. On the Netflix game page scroll all the way down to the section called More details. Here find the Supports controllers section and look to see if it says ""yes."" Games without controller support may be very difficult to play when casting to your smart TV.

According to a report by The Leduc Rep Angela Santiago CEO of The Little Potato Company said: “This is a significant step for The Little Potato Company which my Dad and I founded together in Edmonton more than 25 years ago.

The facility will have solar panels to provide one full gigawatt of power each year and decrease water consumption by recycling and cleaning the water it uses. This was important to Frank Santiago Director of Capital Assets as he designed the machine plan for the new facility.

Olympic gold medallist Michael Klim has revealed he is suffering from an incurable disorder which means he cannot walk unassisted.

The former swimming star was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in 2020 an auto-immune disorder that attacks the myelin sheaths of your nerves and affects function and weakness in the areas of the arms hands legs and feet.

The Sunday Telegraph reported Klim has limited leg functionality needing walking sticks braces and his family members to support him.

“In 2019 I started to get symptoms that I didn’t realise were connected to my diagnosis” Klim told the newspaper.

“I have been dealing with chronic ankle problems and degenerative back issues for quite some time and over the past few years I noticed severe muscle wastage in my legs difficulty with balance some loss of function from the knees down numbness in my thighs and feet to the extent I was unable to stand.”

“Massages cupping and acupuncture help as well as using a tens machine regularly to activate my muscles. I’ve had special orthotics and braces fitted to support my drop foot and weak legs. Without them I can’t walk and need a walking stick” he said.

Picture: Dan Himbrechts

Australia’s typical house build cost has soared more than $94000 in 15 months in its biggest surge since McMansions were taking over our suburbs in 1982.

Shock new figures revealed in analysis by the Housing Industry Association and News Corp Australia show how the price of the new home dream has exploded since July 1970 when the average new build cost just $11543.

The head of the Builders Collective of Australia has warned the latest increases unlike anything he has seen in close to 50 years as a builder could force half the nation’s builders into insolvency.

The staggering growth is also hitting the nation’s mortgage payers with the cost of housing a key component of the inflation figures driving the Reserve Bank of Australia’s 1.5 per cent increase rate hike over the past three months.

Analysis of the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ most recent building approvals data shows the average price of a new house approved in the nation’s private sector in May was $413436.

Remarkably the figures also reveal the cost of building a new home actually declined for the first half of the Covid-19 pandemic to $319259 in February 2021.

HIA chief economist Tim Reardon said this was due to a glut of first-home buyers building smaller cheaper homes after the federal government offered $15000-$25000 HomeBuilder grants before it was concluded in March 2021.

Australia's national average home build cost from 1970 to today. Data compiled based on ABS figures.

But building approvals continued to surge as “the more people stayed at home through lockdowns the more new homes they wanted”.

“We are looking at the fastest rate of growth in the average cost of an approved house build since 1982” Mr Reardon said.

In Victoria which is building more new houses than any other state there was a $32000+ jump in the typical house’s approved construction costs from March to April.

Mr Reardon said he believed cost increases would slow as the nation pulled back from building 150000 new houses in the past year to a more typical 108000 by 2024-2025 but the coming 12 months is likely to be the second fastest growth period in the past 40 years.

Australia’s typical home build has become vastly more expensive since 2021.

Buyers hoping costs will fall with demand have been warned not to wait.

“There have only been five instances of that in 50 years and usually that fall is followed by strong growth” he said.

Builders Collective of Australia president Phil Dwyer has been constructing houses since the 1970s and 1980s when rising home-building costs were driven by buyers’ desires not material prices.

“All of a sudden we had everyone wanting a McMansion rather than a three-bedroom home in the suburbs” he said.

Significant changes to the way the industry works since then have left builders extremely exposed to rising material costs particularly with builders’ margins plunging from around 20-25 per cent to 8-10 per cent.

“And when I started there was a mutual agreement that you would vary the contract because of circumstances and that was generally accepted though not necessarily a given” Mr Dwyer said.

With fixed-price contracts now leaving builders little wiggle room he warned there would be a rise in particularly smaller builders going to the wall in the coming months.

“It could be up as high as 50 per cent in the next 12 months after Christmas” he added.

More established groups with significant reserves to fall back on were more likely to survive he said.

Mr Dwyer added he hoped he was wrong about his predictions but said “I have never seen the cards laid out the way they are at the moment — I have never seen it this bad”.

Housing construction is expected to slow in Australian suburbs in the coming years.

Burbank Homes national general manager Louis Sultan said labour concrete steel and hardware remained problematic for costing.

“So the quicker you can lock in your new home contract the more certainty you will have about what your new home will cost” Mr Sultan said.

In response to rising costs many buyers were now prioritising upfront expenses that will save them money in the future particularly around energy efficiency solar panels and electric vehicle systems plus more water and energy-efficient appliances he added.

Any efforts by the government to stabilise imports and exports would improve supply chains for building materials Mr Sultan said.

Housing Industry Association chief economist Tim Reardon.

Finding ways to get builders onto sites faster after a buyer had purchased a block of land could also help builders quote more accurately.

Mr Reardon said an increase in the number of stage payments currently mandated at five for a typical house would give builders more flexibility without any risk to customers.

Shock new figures revealed in analysis by the Housing Industry Association and News Corp Australia show how the price of the new home dream has exploded since July 1970 when the average new build cost just $11543.

The head of the Builders Collective of Australia has warned the latest increases unlike anything he has seen in close to 50 years as a builder could force half the nation’s builders into insolvency.

The staggering growth is also hitting the nation’s mortgage payers with the cost of housing a key component of the inflation figures driving the Reserve Bank of Australia’s 1.5 per cent increase rate hike over the past three months.

Analysis of the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ most recent building approvals data shows the average price of a new house approved in the nation’s private sector in May was $413436.

Remarkably the figures also reveal the cost of building a new home actually declined for the first half of the Covid-19 pandemic to $319259 in February 2021.

HIA chief economist Tim Reardon said this was due to a glut of first-home buyers building smaller cheaper homes after the federal government offered $15000-$25000 HomeBuilder grants before it was concluded in March 2021.

Australia's national average home build cost from 1970 to today. Data compiled based on ABS figures.

But building approvals continued to surge as “the more people stayed at home through lockdowns the more new homes they wanted”.

“We are looking at the fastest rate of growth in the average cost of an approved house build since 1982” Mr Reardon said.

In Victoria which is building more new houses than any other state there was a $32000+ jump in the typical house’s approved construction costs from March to April.

Mr Reardon said he believed cost increases would slow as the nation pulled back from building 150000 new houses in the past year to a more typical 108000 by 2024-2025 but the coming 12 months is likely to be the second fastest growth period in the past 40 years.

Australia’s typical home build has become vastly more expensive since 2021.

Buyers hoping costs will fall with demand have been warned not to wait.

“There have only been five instances of that in 50 years and usually that fall is followed by strong growth” he said.

Builders Collective of Australia president Phil Dwyer has been constructing houses since the 1970s and 1980s when rising home-building costs were driven by buyers’ desires not material prices.

“All of a sudden we had everyone wanting a McMansion rather than a three-bedroom home in the suburbs” he said.

Significant changes to the way the industry works since then have left builders extremely exposed to rising material costs particularly with builders’ margins plunging from around 20-25 per cent to 8-10 per cent.

“And when I started there was a mutual agreement that you would vary the contract because of circumstances and that was generally accepted though not necessarily a given” Mr Dwyer said.

With fixed-price contracts now leaving builders little wiggle room he warned there would be a rise in particularly smaller builders going to the wall in the coming months.

“It could be up as high as 50 per cent in the next 12 months after Christmas” he added.

More established groups with significant reserves to fall back on were more likely to survive he said.

Mr Dwyer added he hoped he was wrong about his predictions but said “I have never seen the cards laid out the way they are at the moment — I have never seen it this bad”.

Housing construction is expected to slow in Australian suburbs in the coming years.

Burbank Homes national general manager Louis Sultan said labour concrete steel and hardware remained problematic for costing.

“So the quicker you can lock in your new home contract the more certainty you will have about what your new home will cost” Mr Sultan said.

In response to rising costs many buyers were now prioritising upfront expenses that will save them money in the future particularly around energy efficiency solar panels and electric vehicle systems plus more water and energy-efficient appliances he added.

Any efforts by the government to stabilise imports and exports would improve supply chains for building materials Mr Sultan said.

Housing Industry Association chief economist Tim Reardon.

Finding ways to get builders onto sites faster after a buyer had purchased a block of land could also help builders quote more accurately.

Mr Reardon said an increase in the number of stage payments currently mandated at five for a typical house would give builders more flexibility without any risk to customers.

Despite passing away in November 2021 Virgil Abloh continues being present in the sneaker space. In addition to driving countless sales on the after-market thanks to his Off-White sneaker collaborations the late Illinois-native is further expanding NIKE Inc.’s design language.

Recently a green-colored Air Force 1 Mid appeared with typical Off-White details: zip-ties contrasting tabs at the profile swooshes and “deconstructed” builds. The upcoming pair resembles the ultra-exclusive low-top Air Force 1 pairs that Abloh prepped for both the Brooklyn Museum and Louis Vuitton before passing. Although the latest Off-White Nikes feature some of Abloh’s signature touches they also don a previously-unseen logo of a candle holder at the lateral heel an “OFF” in Virgil’s handwriting on the right heel and a graffiti-style “AIR” at the tongue. The shoes’ morphed sole unit exposes a Air Max unit building on the thought process behind the original “The Ten” collection that debuted in 2017.

Enjoy a first-look at the official images and await a drop on Nike SNKRS details as the year continues.

After an acrimonious breakup with the Philadelphia 76ers the All-Star guard landed with the Brooklyn Nets. Simmons did not play a single game this season but he remains supportive of his teammates.

Tonight Simmons showed up to the NBA Summer League in a pair of Nike SB Dunk Lows in the 'Ben & Jerry's Chunky Dunky' colorway. But don't let the delicious-sounding name deceive you - Simmons' shoes were fire. Check out the Twitter video below for a closer look.

Those Dunks dropped in May 2020. As you can tell from the colorful design they were part of a collaboration between Nike and Ben & Jerry's. Despite retailing for $100 they now go for anywhere between $1300 and $2000 on the resale markets.

While Simmons is far more valuable on the court than off the court it is good to see the talented player enjoying himself. The same cannot be said for everyone else in the Nets organization right now.

Kyrie Irving just opted into the final year of his contract but is facing dueling challenges. Kevin Durant requested a trade but the latest reports from around the league indicate that the trade talks are not going anywhere.

Tough volume scorer Wesley Yates kicks off this recap as he put together another great scoring performance on day two. However although the way he collected buckets was exciting he continues to bring a more translatable quality to the table.

WESLEY YATES HAS A KNACK FOR WINNING

There is not much more I can state about the winning ways of Wesley Yates outside of the fact that he has done it at every level. The quality is simply his best attribute. To give more clarity to his background Yates was once regarded as the top player in the class dating back to his elementary school days. There is something to be said about his production and passion to win games since being placed on that radar.

Eric Musselman of Arkansas Steven Pearl and Ira Bowman of Auburn Stephen Gentry of Gonzaga Robert Ehsan of Stanford and Chris Beard of Texas were sitting on the sidelines for both of his games. All of which see his value in helping their programs in the win column.

Also worth noting is his backcourt mate Chris Lockett who caries the same approach no matter the level of adversity he faces. He is a team-oriented prospect who plays with a tremendous amount of energy and feel. Lockett has been seasoned well in the game and the best asset he showed was his effort in making the extra pass. After re-opening his recruitment this summer Big Ten programs Michigan Michigan State and Ohio State have started to get in on him as a prospect. Rightfully so as it was shown today that his game is an ideal fit for the conference.

KAYVAUN MULREADY IS THE NEW NATIONAL NAME

Coming into this weekend I wanted to make sure I spent a significant amount of time focusing on the national 2024 class. After receiving a recommemdation from an assistant coach Albany City Rocks was one of the programs who helped me out tremendously by having two rising juniors playing up on their roster.

While Damarius Owens was intriguing in his own right and projects to be one to monitor due to his size length and shooting touch Kayvaun Mulready was the team's best performer on Friday and by a large margin.

A physical guard at 6-foot-4 Mulready striked me on day one as a player who plays strictly to his strengths and provides all of what his team needs in the given moment. While my initial thoughts were proven to be true he took it all to the max on day two.

The ball had a way of finding him and although he maybe one of the youngest players on his squad his teamates have the utmost confidence that the right decision will be made or a key play will be converted on when it comes to him. There is a lot to like with his mindset of knowing how to play with others as he provides effort guarding the basketball competing on the glass and reading pentration drives for freed spot-up kickout jumpers.

Mulready says Boston College Connecticut Colorado Georgia Tech Marquette Nebraska North Carolina State Oklahoma State Penn State Pittsburgh Providence Virginia and Virginia Tech are the programs he talks with most. Nearly all of which were in attendance for his Friday matchups.

OTHER NOTEWORTHY STANDOUTS

... Although he is a sub-six footer upside does reside in T'Johnn Brown's game. In his first tournament running the point for Team Griffin Brown showed the same level of grittiness on both ends that helped Kimball make a deep run into the state tournament this spring. His upside is in his ability and desire to play for his teammates. Throughout his career Brown has been relied upon to score while simultaneausly locking up opposing teams best players. While he has excelled at both areas over the years his recruitment should expand as his playmaking ability becomes more evident. Already having enhanced his surroundings in his new environment it is safe to say he is making strides in the right direction and is a point guard Division I's should bank on.

... After what was initially a slow start to the grassroots season three-star guard Alex Cotton seems to have found his groove from behind the arc. His growth in confidence showed in how he was surprised on the attempts that he missed from downtown. Missouri State New Mexico Oral Roberts and Stephen F. Austin have all came along with offers in the past 24 hours.

... Potential four-star rising junior Isaiah Abraham has put together a few efficient performances over the past two days. He rebounds scores with opportunity and does not need a lot of touches to get it going from the perimeter offensively. All of this while playing up an age level should easily place him in the conversation for a rankings bump."

Amtrak is seeking to resume passenger service along a Gulf Coast route between New Orleans and Mobile Ala. (Photo for The Washington Post by Emily Kask)

Months after Washington approved billions to significantly expand Amtrak's footprint across the country an early attempt at growth has reached an impasse in a test case that could define the American rail network for a generation.

The escalating clash is playing out on the Gulf Coast where Amtrak wants to restore service 17 years after Hurricane Katrina flooded the region's rail infrastructure. Amid fanfare over federal money as a president nicknamed ""Amtrak Joe"" watches from the White House the passenger rail and the freight railroads that control the tracks are in mediation to resolve disputes over Amtrak's proposed service levels.

At the core of the conflict is a mandate that requires freight railroads to give passenger trains access to rail track and preference over other rail traffic. A federal board is weighing the fate of Gulf Coast passenger service in a triallike process pitting Amtrak against freight railroads. Because Amtrak operates mostly on tracks owned by others the case could set precedent as the passenger railroad embarks on a $75 billion expansion with bipartisan support.

""This is the bellwether case for the expansion of any passenger rail in this country"" said John Robert Smith chairman of the policy organization Transportation for America. ""If the freights manage to kill this proposed service it will send a chill through the rest of the nation aspiring for passenger rail.""

Amtrak's plan for the 140-mile from New Orleans to Mobile Ala. is one of 39 new routes the railroad is pursuing as part of its plan announced last year to reach dozens more cities and towns. The aspirations coincide with Washington's priorities for more rail and alternate modes of transportation supported by the bipartisan infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed last year. The measure includes $66 billion for the nation's ailing rail network.

But any expansion in Amtrak's territory which has remained nearly unchanged during its five decades would boost pressure on freight companies and add trains to shared tracks at a time when the industry is under scrutiny over supply chain disruptions.

""We figured out the money piece"" said Amtrak chief executive Stephen J. Gardner. ""We've solved one-half of the problem and now that puts sort of the spotlight on this relationship with the [host railroads] and how do we find a productive path forward.""

Amtrak's federal aid lessens the financial barriers to launching new train service abating Amtrak's biggest impediment to growth. Negotiating track access is the next hurdle.

- - -

Outside its busy Northeast Corridor Amtrak mostly operates on tracks owned by private railroads. Under federal law it pays the companies to use the tracks -- a sum that according to Amtrak totaled $135 million last fiscal year. The arrangement dates to 1970 when Congress created Amtrak relieving private railroads from their obligation at the time to provide intercity passenger rail service.

Fifty-two years later tension continues to plague that tenant-owner relationship. Amtrak argues the railroads disregard preference for passenger trains saying freight trains caused nearly 900000 minutes of passenger delays last year. The freight industry has countered over the years that Amtrak oversteps its authority.

The two sides occasionally strike accords on service increases and new routes. Some agreements have been transformative as in Virginia where Amtrak and CSX partnered with the state last year on a $3.7 billion rail expansion.

But along the Gulf Coast six years of talks have led nowhere. The Southern Rail Commission -- a panel of state-appointed members from Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama -- has pushed for a decade to bring trains back helping to secure $66 million for improvements. The federal government in 2015 convened a group to evaluate the restoration of service bringing together railroads and the three states that would be served by the line.

Negotiations stalled as Amtrak introduced a service plan that was different than before Katrina with more trains using the corridor during peak hours. The two sides couldn't agree on the capital investment needed to restore service: The Federal Railroad Administration estimated the price tag at $118 million while CSX said it would take $440 million.

CSX which owns most of the track between New Orleans and Mobile said it wouldn't oppose Amtrak resuming pre-Katrina service when long-distance trains arrived overnight three times a week. But the company says more study is needed before Amtrak brings two daily round trips between the port cities including stops in the Mississippi cities of Bay St. Louis Gulfport Biloxi and Pascagoula.

CSX said eight to 10 freight trains traverse the full route daily while other local trains and mechanical equipment use stretches of the line. Officials with the Port of Mobile the city of Mobile and Alabama have raised objections to Amtrak's proposal citing possible effects to the port which city leaders say moves more than 58 million tons of cargo annually.

But Amtrak calls the rail ""a lightly used mainline"" that is far less complicated than Amtrak's Washington-to-Boston tracks which handle about 2200 trains daily.

""Most of the route [in the Gulf Coast] is single track but so is the vast majority of Amtrak's route network"" Gardner said to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) in February. ""Yes it has drawbridges but not as many per mile as Amtrak's Northeast Corridor in Connecticut. Yet somehow we still accommodate 68 trains a day over that route.""

Because the railroads have not agreed to give Amtrak access federal statute tasks the STB an independent federal agency that regulates freight rail with determining whether more passenger trains would ""impair unreasonably freight transportation.""

The Biden administration has taken a prominent seat at pushing Amtrak's petition saying a resolution along the Gulf Coast is key to the future development of intercity passenger rail across the nation. At stake it says is Americans' access to adequate transportation.

""Service delayed is service denied"" Amit Bose head of the Federal Railroad Administration said in February while urging the panel to ensure the ""railroads fulfill their fundamental statutory obligations to allow the expansion and improvement of intercity passenger rail services.""

In a May letter to the STB John E. Putnam acting general counsel at the Transportation Department said efforts such as restoring Gulf Coast rail passenger service are critical to the administration's transportation goals of ""combating climate change ensuring equity in personal mobility and driving economic growth and vitality.""

""Unfortunately despite an extended period of examination and the investment of significant funds Amtrak has been unable to obtain the agreement of the host freight railroads and there is no clear or imminent path to the restoration of this service absent the Board's intercession"" Putnam wrote.

Support for Amtrak is widespread in Louisiana -- home to a terminus stop in New Orleans -- and across Mississippi where four of the six stations would be located. Local officials tout the return of Amtrak as an economic asset to boost tourism and an alternative to traffic-clogged highways.

Alabama leaders however say their port shippers and freight customers would suffer from disruptions to a tightly managed schedule of freight trains. Alabama House leader Mac McCutcheon (R) told the STB he is also concerned the state might have to foot the cost of Amtrak's passenger operations.

The office of Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson declined to comment for this story.

In testimony to the STB Stimpson said it would be premature to grant Amtrak's petition without more study and infrastructure improvements warning that ""any action that stands in the way of the continued efficient and productive operation of the Port of Mobile must be treated with microscopic scrutiny.""

The dispute has sent shock waves among rail advocates where supporters of intercity train service and local leaders who want Amtrak in their communities fear the Gulf Coast dispute could translate into freight companies rejecting passenger rail proposals. Several mayors have made pleas before the board on Amtrak's behalf.

""People literally stop me on the street and tell me how excited they are that we might get passenger rail here in Madison"" Satya Rhodes-Conway mayor of the Wisconsin city said in testimony to the board. ""However our ability to implement Amtrak service here would be imperiled by the precedent set in this decision.""

In the meantime Amtrak is still easing into other markets. Trains will return to Burlington Vt. in July for the first time since 1953. Plans are advancing for more trains between Washington and Virginia's Norfolk and Roanoke areas using tracks owned by CSX and Norfolk Southern. Amtrak is also negotiating with Canadian Pacific to add service between Chicago Milwaukee and the Minneapolis area.

But back on the Gulf Coast the STB in June ordered mediation eventually giving Amtrak CSX and Norfolk Southern a month to reach a settlement after the process begins. The five-member panel has listened to more than 80 hours of sworn testimony examination and cross examination since February. More hearings are expected this summer as the railroads file evidence by a July 13 deadline.

Board members have questioned the transparency of Amtrak and the railroads while admonishing their lack of candor with each other.

""Part of me wants to say both sides should lose but that's really not possible"" Board Chairman Martin J. Oberman said in May. ""I can't make you play nice but I think it would be much more productive if you did.""

In Bay St. Louis a city of white sand beaches an hour east of New Orleans a century-old train depot across from shops and restaurants has been restored to include a Mardi Gras museum. Still missing are the passengers.

In 2005 Hurricane Katrina brought down homes and buildings piers and the marina. As the city recovered a new harbor and a $19 million sea wall were built a decade ago. Antique shops art galleries and restaurants popped up in downtown. The train depot is now the visitor's welcome center and a space for city festivals and events.

""We built back better"" said Nikki Moon a longtime resident of Bay St. Louis whose home and business were destroyed during Katrina. She said the city's comeback is missing an important piece: trains.

""Having this train would show that there is a lot for people to come and see a lot for them to enjoy in the bay"" said Moon a retired innkeeper and regional tourism leader. ""Amtrak coming in would be a game changer for our town and I believe for the entire coast.""

Bay St. Louis population about 10000 relies heavily on tourism. Its small-town feel has been a draw for urbanites in the South fueling growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

City officials say tourists arriving in cruise ships in New Orleans or Mobile could hop on a train to visit the Mississippi coast's beaches and casinos. Nondriving visitors including the international tourists who come to New Orleans would be able to plan a day trip or an overnight stay.

In a corridor where flying between New Orleans and Mobile requires a layover in Atlanta transportation advocates say a three-hour train ride would be competitive with driving.

Amtrak's pre-Katrina service did not offer that choice during daylight hours. The route was so long -- from Florida to California -- that the train arrived in Mississippi during the overnight hours. Proponents say the shorter route during daylight would give roughly 2 million nearby residents an option to commute by train while offering more reliable and frequent service.

""When a train comes through in the middle of the night three days a week people don't really buy into it"" said Kay Kell a member of the Southern Rail Commission. ""This is an area that has been unserved for quite a while and we know a large population would use the train.""

Regardless of whether an agreement between Amtrak and freight railroads is reached through mediation the board could deliver a verdict by the end of summer. Some railroad experts say the case highlights a growing hostility.

""Reasonable people should be able to come to an agreement"" said Robert VanderClute a private consultant who spent 26 years working at Amtrak. ""Collaboration is critical and we had it at one point. I don't know where it went astray.""

Amtrak set up cameras along the route as hearings were carried out this spring live-streaming empty tracks and birds singing in the background under the title ""CSX's Very Busy Gulf Coast Corridor.""

Days earlier Amtrak had argued that freight companies wanted unreasonable investments from the passenger rail and for taxpayers to subsidize infrastructure for the benefit of their shareholders. CSX and Norfolk Southern leaders blasted Amtrak as trying to force itself onto their rails without consideration for the effects on freight customers.

The case is about more than a New Orleans-to-Mobile passenger route CSX president and chief executive James M. Foote said at an STB hearing.

""It's about a new national agenda and Amtrak's desire to change the law and create a new road map proposing new passenger service without working with most carriers or local communities to first add necessary capacity"" he said.

Amtrak's Gardner said the case represents a turning point for American passenger rail. Amtrak's network today he said is smaller than in 1971 even as the nation added 120 million people.

""We need to serve more places serve more people with more trains"" he said. ""We can't let -- as in the case of the Gulf Coast -- years and years go by where the public's will and where the federal government's investment is stymied.""

Special to the Siskiyou Daily News

California elected officials would like to move forward with transferring public lands in Siskiyou and Humboldt counties into a public trust for the Karuk Tribe.

Sens. Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein both of California have expressed support for the Katimiîn and Ameekyáaraam Sacred Lands Act (KASL Act) which was first introduced by U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Raphael) earlier this year.

The legislation would transfer about 1000 acres from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the U.S. Department of Interior to be held in trust for the Karuk Tribe which would re-establish the Tribe as the steward of these landscapes which are viewed as sacred by the Karuk Tribe.

""The Karuk people have been the stewards of these lands since time began” said Josh Saxon executive director for the Karuk Tribe. “The only change in stewardship of these lands after the transfer is the elevation of the Tribe’s ability to ensure our ceremonies are conducted without interruption or interference.”

The Karuk Tribe should have “unrestricted access” to the lands said Padilla in a statement. “Restoring these lands to the stewardship of the Karuk Tribe is a long overdue moral imperative.”

About 95% of the tribe’s aboriginal territory is currently held by the federal government undermining the Karuk people’s “ability to exercise traditional practices that have been passed down since time immemorial” Huffman said in a statement.

“This bill seeks to return sacred ground to the Karuk Tribe correcting an historic injustice. I’ve had the immense privilege and honor of visiting Katimiîn and its surrounding acres – these places are not only majestic they are central to Karuk history religion culture and identity.”

Tribal ceremonies education and social gathering have taken place on the land said Saxon adding he is not aware of the land currently being used for farming ranching or timber harvesting.

""The area proposed in the legislation is the center of the Karuk World” said Saxon.

The contract announced July 8 was a sole-source award for a satellite called ROOSTER short for Rapid On-orbit Space Technology Evaluation Ring. It is based on the Northrop Grumman ESPAStar payload adapter a ring-shaped bus designed to ride as a secondary payload on national security space missions launched by United Launch Alliance and SpaceX.

Northrop Grumman in 2017 won a contract to develop the so-called Long Duration Propulsive ESPA (LDPE) to host small payloads and experiments. The Space Force ordered three LDPE satellites the first of which launched in December with two more scheduled to launch on upcoming national security space missions. The LDPE program was recently renamed ROOSTER.

The new contract is for a 2026 delivery of a ROOSTER “multi-manifest rideshare satellite supporting operational and prototype missions in a geostationary orbit and maturing technology needed to conduct on-orbit refueling for future missions” said the announcement.

The Space Force nicknamed the smallsat ring “the freight train to space” that can insert smallsats into geosynchronous orbit or host dedicated payloads on the ring itself until test completion. The ROOSTER satellites would primarily operate in GEO but the Space Force said cislunar medium Earth orbit and to a lesser extent low Earth orbit are also being considered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2VyaWN0ZWdsZXIvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC90aGUtYWlyLWZvcmNlLWlzLXJldGlyaW5nLW1vc3Qtb2YtaXRzLWdsb2JhbC1oYXdrLWlzci1kcm9uZXMtdG8tYS10ZXN0LXJvbGUtZm9yLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtbWlzc2lsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Air Force Is Retiring Most of Its Global Hawk ISR Drones to A Test Role for Hypersonic Missiles,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2022/07/10/the-air-force-is-retiring-most-of-its-global-hawk-isr-drones-to-a-test-role-for-hypersonic-missiles/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2VyaWN0ZWdsZXIvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC90aGUtYWlyLWZvcmNlLWlzLXJldGlyaW5nLW1vc3Qtb2YtaXRzLWdsb2JhbC1oYXdrLWlzci1kcm9uZXMtdG8tYS10ZXN0LXJvbGUtZm9yLWh5cGVyc29uaWMtbWlzc2lsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1c3RvbmxlYWRlci5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy92ZXJub24tcm9iZXJ0LSVFMiU4MCU5OGJvYiVFMiU4MCU5OS15ZXBzb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vernon Robert 'Bob' Yepson,"Funeral services for Vernon Robert “Bob” Yepson 83 of Ruston will be held at 10 a.m. Tuesday July 12 2022 in the chapel of Kilpatrick Funeral Home in Ruston.

It's a real bummer when a concept car that looks promising doesn't go into production. But when a purpose-built spacecraft meant to traverse another heavenly body doesn't make it it's a tragedy. Why? Because it no doubt took some serious money to get off the drawing board.

In the case of the Grumman Molab the first full-sized manned roving lunar laboratory design commissioned by NASA it couldn't have been an absolute monetary loss as only one full-sized mockup was ever constructed. But that's unusual for the space program as when programs go bust it's often catastrophic for the company in charge. Let's take a look back at the story behind Grumman 's long-lost moon rover.



Today the only Molab mockup stands guard over the Red Planet Café the professionally catered lunch cafeteria inside the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City New York. This Mars-themed cafe serves all kinds of exotic Martian cuisine like cheeseburgers pizza hot dogs chicken strips and that most prized and delectable of Martian delicacies curly fries. All the while museum patrons marvel at the strange-looking moon rover mockup sitting above their heads.



But not once will most of them even consider in an alternate timeline that this thing would have been roving around the Moon's surface conducting groundbreaking experiments in extracting helium-3 from lunar soil to make it into a killer rocket fuel. As opposed to watching endless children and their doting parents bury their faces in a double cheeseburger with extra ketchup or But not once will most of them even consider in an alternate timeline that this thing would have been roving around the Moon's surface conducting groundbreaking experiments in extracting helium-3 from lunar soil to make it into a killer rocket fuel. As opposed to watching endless children and their doting parents bury their faces in a double cheeseburger with extra ketchup or a delightfully greasy slice of pizza . Safe to say the Apollo program was a lot more remarkable in this alternate timeline.



But for how incredible a potential Molab (Mobile Laboratory) on the Moon may have been there appears to be little to no information on the internet regarding the more intricate details of its history had one not literally been sitting right in front of us during our trip to the Cradle of Aviation. Even if we wanted to stoop to reading the Wikipedia article and call it a day the Grumman Molab doesn't even have one. That's how obscure it is.



Photo: Benny Kirk/autoevolution So instead we had to do the most obsolete of activities to get more detailed information than the single blurb on a plaque at the Cradle of Aviation dedicated to its story. Only after rummaging through page 62 of the book Lunar and Planetary Rovers: The Wheels of Apollo and the Quest for Mars by Anthony Young does a more in-depth picture of Grumman's true plans for Molab reveal itself.



It reads at the bottom of the page ""Molab was conceived while NASA believed that there would be two Saturn V launch vehicles to get men and machines to the Moon. This particular vehicle was designed to accommodate two astronauts in a pressurized environment with full accommodations and would permit extended traverses on the Moon lasting days at a time.""



The book also mentions how the term Molab was applied to a number of different rover vehicle concepts in the early to mid-1960s including a design by General Dynamics Bendix Boeing and even



The rear of the vehicle attached to the front cab via an umbilical type connector housed all the equipment two astronauts would need for a hardcore Overlanding-style trip across the Lunar surface to where points of scientific interest could be found. In short the Molab was to launch from a separate Saturn V launch vehicle from that which carried its crew.

But as for Grumman's design the one that was ultimately chosen by NASA it's hard not to get the idea it was designed a bit like a Lunar pickup truck. The main pressurized cabin housed the crew's two-person quarters alongside ample space for scientific experiments.The rear of the vehicle attached to the front cab via an umbilical type connector housed all the equipment two astronauts would need for a hardcore Overlanding-style trip across the Lunar surface to where points of scientific interest could be found. In short the Molab was to launch from a separate Saturn V launch vehicle from that which carried its crew.It'd soft-land on the surface of the Moon after a trans-Lunar injection burn using its sophisticated quad wheels with integrated leaf spring suspension built into each spoke to absorb the impact of landing. Once on the surface the vehicle would await the arrival of its astronaut crew. Under this dual launch program dubbed the Lunar Logistics System (LLS) it was hoped dozens of Molabs and crew could be situated all over the lunar surface as the Apollo program progressed.



With an all-electric drivetrain and a supposed range of 250 miles it would take almost 70 years before a road-going Earth EV could match the purported target range set for the Grumman Molab. Although something tells us 1/6th Earth's gravity does wonders for quelling battery range anxiety.



But it was all for not. As budgetary constraints and a desire to simplify the program as much as possible Grumman instead focused on allowing the Grumman LEM to be able to carry a rover-type vehicle by itself while attached to a single Saturn V launch vehicle under the extended J-class mission initiative.



Thus Grumman's only Molab concept was donated to the Cradle of Aviation stricken here on Earth while it gazes at endless lines of chicken fingers sandwiches burgers etc. and all the endless people lined up to chow down. Not exactly Moon food by any stretch but still undeniably tasty.

Days ago on July 7th during the first test at Vandenberg Space Force Base [VSFB] the rocket exploded 11 seconds after launch.

Immediately after the explosion which was very close to the launch pad debris fell into the area. VSFB officials reported no injuries but said the explosion did cause a fire on North Base. A press release from Col. Kris Barcomb Space Launch Delta 30 vice commander confirms what we know adding that the base’s priority has always been security and after the incident emergency teams responded immediately. At the moment the cause of the explosion is not clear but the base announced that an investigation had begun.

The new US nuclear program includes the phased retirement of 400 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles and their replacement with the LGM-35 Sentinel based on the Minotaur II+e rocket. The launch was scheduled to be the first test supporting the development of the Air Force’s new Mk21A reentry vehicle.

According to the Pentagon’s plans the new intercontinental ballistic missiles should begin entering the equipment of the US strategic nuclear forces in 2029 to replace the outdated Minuteman III missiles that have been in service since the early 1970s.

The missile is being developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation under a contract with the US Air Force for $13.3 billion. The US Department of Defense estimates that the cost of acquiring new missiles will be more than $95 billion.

The United States now has 400 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles each of which can deliver up to three nuclear warheads at a distance of 12000 km. They are the only force-based intermediate ballistic missiles in the triad of US strategic nuclear forces.

Minotaur II+ is a suborbital launch system. At the moment the US Air Force is in stage 3 of its development – launch and flight tests. By July 7 the Minotaur II+ had performed various test launches the last one being the only failed launch.

The Mk21A is the new carrier of the W87-1 nuclear warheads. This model nuclear warhead is extremely powerful. According to available data from open sources its power is equal to 300 kilotons – 15 times more powerful and devastating than the “Fat Man” bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. The W87-1 is part of the W87 family – a warhead with a long history and one of the oldest in the US Army inventory. Sources say the W87-1 has improved security and safety in its use.

The name of the missile [Sentinel] was announced by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall on April 5 2022 in a press release.

NCLH,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL25vcndlZ2lhbi1jcnVpc2UtbGluZS1kcm9wcy1wcmUtY3J1aXNlLXRlc3RpbmcvNzU5MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norwegian Cruise Line Drops Pre-Cruise Testing,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings announced on July 6 2022 that it would drop pre-cruise COVID-19 testing requirements for all its brands beginning August 1 2022. The corporation oversees Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

The announcement does not impact all sailings however. Cruise departures from all homeports in the United States Canada Greece and Bermuda must still follow pre-cruise testing protocols. This is a huge step in returning cruising to pre-pandemic conditions and lightening travel restrictions however and is sure to be welcomed by cruise travelers.

No More Pre-Cruise Testing for Limited Embarkation Ports

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings stated “it will no longer require guests to complete pre-cruise COVID-19 testing unless required by local regulations.”

The policy does not go into effect immediately but instead begins on August 1 2022. Furthermore not all sailings are affected by the announcement.

“The pre-embarkation testing requirement will remain in place for guests currently traveling on voyages departing from destinations with local testing regulations including but not limited to the U.S. Canada Greece and Bermuda” the statement read.

This does mean however that Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises embarking at many European homeports will no longer require pre-cruise tests.

In August Norwegian Cruise Line has voyages setting sail from Amsterdam Barcelona Copenhagen Southampton Reykjavik Rome Stockholm and Venice.

Oceania Cruises has August departures from Reykjavik Malta Lisbon Copenhagen Barcelona Stockholm Paris Rome and Oslo while Regent Seven Seas Cruises has August sailings leaving from Rome Southampton Copenhagen Amsterdam Barcelona and Istanbul.

Normalcy Slowly Returning

This tremendous step will lighten the restrictions on travelers as it can be more difficult to find testing centers in the limited time frames just before a cruise and at-home tests are not always an option.

“The relaxation of the testing policy is in line with the rest of the travel leisure and hospitality industry worldwide as society continues to adapt and return to a state of normalcy” the press statement read.

This does not mean that other health and safety protocols are being relaxed however.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings “continues to strongly recommend all guests be up to date on vaccination protocols and test at their convenience prior to travel” the statement read.

The company also clarified that its SailSAFE health and safety program will continue and be adapted as necessary and each cruise brand will continue to adhere to all local restrictions and guidelines at ports of call.

Cruise travelers should note that these policies are always adaptable and may change at short notice should conditions require stricter protocols. Travelers booked on upcoming voyages should stay in close contact with their cruise line for updated information and changes as their sailing date approaches.

Will Other Testing Requirements End?

Will other cruise lines follow NCLH’s lead and also end pre-cruise testing? No other lines have yet made similar statements or taken steps to completely end testing but several lines have made limited exceptions to testing requirements.

Viking Cruises was the first to end pre-cruise testing fleet-wide beginning June 10 2022 but the exemption only applied to cruises in regions where testing was no longer a local requirement. Because of this the exemption only had limited impact but did position the Viking Cruises fleet to easily end testing as guidelines change in different areas.

P&O Cruises is currently testing limited exemptions with no pre-cruise tests required for sailings from Southampton on its Excellence-class Iona from June 25 through July 23. After that period the testing requirement will be reinstated unless policies are changed further.

Holland America Line is also removing pre-cruise testing requirements for three sailings of Rotterdam from Amsterdam with departure dates of July 10 July 17 and July 24 2022. Like with P&O Cruises Iona the pre-cruise testing will be reinstated after these three voyages.

With Norwegian Cruise Line Holding’s broad announcement applying to all cruises rather than just limited sailings on a single vessel new announcements may be forthcoming.

Additional easing of pre-cruise testing will also largely depend on local guidelines and restrictions. For cruises departing from U.S. cruise ports this means guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may need to change before cruise travelers will no longer need to test before setting sail.

At this time there is no indication that the CDC will make change cruise travel testing requirements soon but the organization is constantly reviewing new data and updating its guidelines.

In a 30-second video posted on July 6 Majorie steps out in a black blazer dress with metallic detailing and a large gold pin closure. She accessorized the look with simple stud earrings and gold heels. Whether or not the blazer was meant to be worn as a dress is unknown but her fashion forward outfit certainly caught Steve’s attention.

After asking the Celebrity Family Feud host if he was ready to head out he couldn’t help to marvel at home stunning Marjorie looked. The snippet showed Steve struggling to find words and instead settled on admiring his wife.

Without missing a beat fans began applauding the pair on social media. Most notably many pointed out how the Judge Steve Harvey star couldn’t keep his eyes off of Marjorie.

“The way he looks at her the entire time 🥺🥰” one person wrote on TikTok. “Got to love that Steve for always admiring his wife and making Majorie know she's the baddest at all times. 💕💚” another added. “Steve is like where do you think you are going looking like 🔥” a different fan said on Instagram.

Steve never missing an opportunity to praise Majorie for everything that she encompasses. Speaking with Good Housekeeping he revealed that she’s the whole package.

“I don’t know if [the world] knows how smart she is” Steve said to us. “A lot of attractive women do not get credit for their smarts and she's a really smart one.”

There have also been some engine issues with two cruise ships the adjustment of Baltic itineraries for two Celebrity cruise ships and anticipation growing for an additional ship to the Carnival Cruise Line fleet.

MSC Seaside Engine Problem

The MSC Seaside cruise ship is suffering from an engine issue resulting in the vessel being unable to reach its maximum cruising speed. The cruise line is informing guests that MSC Seaside will undergo a dry dock to resolve the problem.

The cruise line confirmed in a letter to guests that an electrical issue impacted the engines of the MSC Seaside prior to arriving in Genoa Italy on July 2 2022.

MSC Seaside is still sailing its current voyage which includes multiple debarkation ports with adjusted arrival and departure times due to the cruising speed.

By still sailing guests can still debark at their required port despite a slight change to the itinerary. The July 4 sailing includes stops in Palermo Ibiza Valencia Marseille Genoa and Civitavecchia.

Once the July 4 cruise ends as scheduled on July 11 2022 MSC Seaside will be taken out of service for an immediate dry dock at the Fincantieri shipyard in Palermo for repair.

The 153516 gross ton ship will remain at the Italian shipyard until July 18 2022. From July 19 MSC Seaside will return to service as usual with the engine issue repaired.

Celebrity Cruises Changes Baltic Itineraries

As regional tensions continue to be a concern for travelers and tourists Celebrity Cruises has decided to remove calls to St. Petersburg Russia from its 2023 Baltic sailing itineraries.

In an email sent to travel partners Celebrity Cruises has announced removing St. Petersburg from itineraries next year.

Two Celebrity Cruises vessels are impacted by this change – the 122210-gross ton Solstice-class Celebrity Silhouette and the 130818-gross ton Edge-class Celebrity Apex. Both ships will have four itineraries changed to remove St. Petersburg.

The cruises are not being canceled and the cruise line is working to provide an alternative port of call for travelers to enjoy.

Celebrity Silhouette – May 13 June 5 July 1 and July 24 departures

Celebrity Apex – May 25 June 25 July 19 and August 21 departures

If travelers prefer to cancel their 2023 cruises they will receive a full refund of all monies paid including non-refundable fees but they must request the refund no later than July 19 2022.

As the impacted sailings are not canceled guests can still remain on Celebrity Silhouette or Celebrity Apex to enjoy amazing ports of call even if one of them will not be St. Petersburg.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings announced on July 6 2022 that it will drop pre-cruise testing requirements for all its brands beginning August 1 2022. The corporation oversees Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

The announcement does not impact all sailings however. Cruise departures from all homeports in the United States Canada Greece and Bermuda must still follow pre-cruise testing protocols. This is a huge step in returning cruising to pre-pandemic conditions and easing travel restrictions.

This does mean that Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises embarking at many European homeports will no longer require pre-cruise tests.

In August Norwegian Cruise Line has voyages setting sail from Amsterdam Barcelona Copenhagen Southampton Reykjavik Rome Stockholm and Venice.

This tremendous step will lighten the restrictions on travelers as it can be more difficult to find testing centers in the limited time frames just before a cruise and at-home tests are not always an option. This does not mean that other health and safety protocols are being relaxed.

Norwegian Cruise Line said it “continues to strongly recommend all guests be up to date on vaccination protocols and test at their convenience prior to travel.” The company also clarified that its SailSAFE health and safety program will continue and be adapted as necessary and each cruise brand will continue to adhere to all local restrictions and guidelines at ports of call.

Royal Caribbean International has provided guests with an update on the engine issues with the Quantum of the Seas. Although the problems are not safety-related the cruise line announced last week that it would be changing itineraries.

As the vessel cannot reach its maximum speed Royal Caribbean has decided to skip sailing through Endicott Arm & Dawes Glacier.

While disappointing it does mean that guests do not miss out on any time in port. Impacted guests were already informed that the sailings departing on August 1 August 8 and August 15 had been adjusted.

The issue seems to be that one engine requires repairs while another will soon need scheduled maintenance. Royal Caribbean said Quantum has four engines. One requires some repair and there’s a delay in receiving the parts needed due to supply chain issues.

Additionally. Another engine is scheduled for routine maintenance soon which means a reduction in the overall speed during these sailings.

Carnival Luminosa Latest

Anticipation grows for the Carnival Luminosa which transfers from sister line Costa Cruises in just a few months. Carnival Cruise Line has started the build-up to the new addition to the fleet by launching a new dedicated page and releasing a first-look rendering of what she will look like when sailing for Carnival.

By looking at the newly released render of Carnival Luminosa the iconic whale tail funnel that all other ships in the fleet feature will not be added. The funnel will remain unchanged but still be painted with red white and blue carnival colors.

The new dedicated page allows guests to sign-up and be the first to know about newly released Carnival Luminosa itineraries and promotions. That page is now active and comes just ahead of when the cruise line will officially release the ship’s itineraries based out of Australia.

What we already know about Carnival Luminosa itineraries is that the ship will operate seasonally from October 2022 through April 2023 out of Brisbane Australia.

The vessel will reposition to offer cruises out of Seattle Washington sailing to Alaska from May 2023 through September 2023 before heading back for deployment out of Brisbane for the Winter season.

Carnival confirmed in June that Costa Luminosa will join the Carnival fleet in September 2022 and will begin operations down under in November 2022 following a modest refurbishment.

The ship first entered service in 2009 for Costa Cruises at 92720 gross tons and a guest capacity of 2826.

AMD will debut its next-gen RDNA 3 architecture later this year where rumor has it that the big boy flagship Navi 31-based offering will feature a GPU chiplet-based design... and NVIDIA won't have anything with GPU chiplets and AMD knows that.

In a recent interview with VentureBeat AMD senior vice president corporate fellow and product technology architect Sam Naffziger talked about GPUs using up to 600W of power by 2025 and so much more. But then VentureBeat's last question was a doozy ""Compared to NVIDIA and Intel do you feel like we're in a state of divergence when it comes to designs or some kind of convergence?""

Naffziger replied explaining: ""It's hard to speculate. NVIDIA certainly hasn't jumped on the chiplet bandwagon yet. We have a big lead there and we see big opportunities with that. They'll be forced to do so. We'll see when they deploy it. Intel certainly has jumped on that. Ponte Vecchio is the poster child for chiplet extremes. I would say that there's more convergence than divergence.

Naffziger continued: But the companies that innovate in the right space the soonest gain an advantage. It's when you deliver the new technology as much as what the technology is. Whoever is first with innovation has the advantage"".

Now if you're up to date with this all... I reported back in July 2017 (5 years ago now!) that NVIDIA was rumored to shift over to multiple GPUs on future GeForce graphics cards... more on that here. It hasn't happened yet but AMD will have multiple GPU chiplets on its upcoming Navi 31-based graphics cards according to rumors but NVIDIA will be sitting with a monolithic GPU design for Ada Lovelace.

The previous question from VentureBeat -- As far as the concern that we were running into walls with things like Moore's Law hitting limits and other physical limitations looming how concerned are you about that at this point? -- had Naffziger replying with: ""I'm concerned in the sense that it drives new dimensions of innovation to get the efficiencies. The silicon technology is not going to do it for us"".

He continued: ""We've seen this coming for a long time. Like I said lead times are long. We've been investing in things like the Infinity Cache chiplet architecture and all these approaches that exploit new dimensions to keep the gains coming. So yes it's a big concern but for those who prepare in advance and invest in the right technology we have a lot of opportunity still"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9hbGxlZ2VkLW52aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MC1kZXNrdG9wLWFuZC1tb2JpbGUtZ3B1LXBjaS1pZHMtbGVhay1vdXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alleged NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 desktop and mobile GPU PCI IDs leak out,"NVIDIA preparing multiple GeForce RTX 40 desktop and mobile GPUs

NVIDIA Ada GPUs will come in many forms and variants the alleged list suggests.

PCI ID device list can be very informative before hardware releases. This is due to the fact that NVIDIA and AMD do not operate with real SKU names this soon. The ID on the other hand may be exclusive to certain SKUs which helps in tracking specific devices.

This is where the new updated posted by LaptopVideo2Go might be useful as shared by @harukaze5719. Without going into details the list is based on the appearances of these devices in software. Those IDs are later added to the public PCI ID list which is then picked up by websites like LV2G and us. Rest assured not all of those IDs will make their way to the final SKUs it is more a roadmap of what is being tested.

Desktop RTX 4090

According to this leak the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU would carry an ID of 2684. This is the first partially confirmed ID probably because of status of RTX 40 GPU development—this model is set to launch first. This GPU is based on a cut-down AD102 GPU with alleged 16384 CUDA Cores and 24GB of GDDR6X memory. This card will be the flagship of the next RTX 40 series till ‘Ti’ part launches.

Alleged GeForce RTX 40 GPUs Source: PCI ID List

Mobile RTX 40 Series

More interestingly there is also a list of RTX 40 mobile SKUs supposedly called GN21-X series (the 21 was easy to predict as GN20 is Ampere). However the GN part suggest these are all mobile SKUs which is interesting considering how far away are we from the supposed launch of a new mobile graphics architecture.

But here’s the intriguing part those IDs were published by user “Faintsnow” (example here) who already shared GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 TI IDs weeks before launch. This user clearly has information on mobile RTX GPUs in advance so there is a strong possibility that those code names do in fact reflect the new RTX mobile 40 lineup.

; AD102

NVIDIA_DEV.2684 = “NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090”

It’s worth adding that hardware leaker @kopite7kimi added some information on proposed GN21-X series lineup. He only pointed out that GN21-X11 is indeed based on AD103 GPU but it may not be called RTX 4080 MObile.

GN21-X11 is based on AD103. So I don't think it will be called RTX 4080 Mobile.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Desktop Graphics Cards and Mobility GPU PCI IDs Leaked GeForce RTX 4090 Confirmed

The GPU IDs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series lineup which will be based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture were published over at LaptopVideo2Go and discovered by @Harukaze5719. The PCI IDs include several desktop and mobility SKUs which are expected to launch around this fall & the start of next year but don't expect all of the GPUs mentioned here to be launched in the market as some device IDs are set for preliminary engineering boards that never go out to retail.

So starting with the PCI Device IDs first up we have the 'NVIDIA_DEV.268' which is said to be the top GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card that will be based on the AD102 GPU architecture. The RTX 4090 will be the flagship offering for 2022 offering almost 100 TFLOPs of compute performance that's hinted in previous leaks.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The Geforce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. It is likely that we may get 500W+ custom designs as we saw with the RTX 3090 Ti.

GN21-X11 is based on AD103. So I don't think it will be called RTX 4080 Mobile.

And X9 AD104 X6 AD106 X4 X2 AD107.

The rest of the lineup is a mix of various NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Mobility GPUs which will be based on various GPU SKUs such as the AD103 AD104 AD106 & AD107 chips. Following is the complete breakdown. According to leaker Kopite7kimi the GN21-X11 series SKUs will feature the AD103 GPU which will be followed by the GN21-X9 with AD104 GN21-X6 with AD106 and GN21-X4/X2 with the AD107 GPUs. The GN20 series was part of the Ampere family so it's easy to conclude that the GN21 lineup will be part of the Ada Lovelace family.

; AD103 - GN21-X11 Series

NVIDIA_DEV.2717 = “NVIDIA GN21-X11”

NVIDIA_DEV.2757 = “NVIDIA GN21-X11”

; AD104 - GN21-X9 Series

NVIDIA_DEV.2785 = “NVIDIA AD104”

NVIDIA_DEV.28A1 = “NVIDIA GN21-X2”

NVIDIA_DEV.28E0 = “NVIDIA GN21-X4”

NVIDIA_DEV.28E1 = “NVIDIA GN21-X2” via LaptopVideo2Go

A truth. The power limits:

AD102 800W;

AD103 (DT) 450W AD103 (Mobile) 175W;

AD104 (DT) 400W AD104 (Mobile) 175W;

AD106 (DT) 260W AD106 (Mobile) 140W.

But I don't think we need to use the full power cap. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 18 2022

In a previous breakdown by the same leaker it was reported that the NVIDIA AD103 Mobile SKU will have a max power limit of 175W which will also be retained for the AD104 SKUs the AD106 GPU will have a 140W power limit while the AD107 will end up somewhere around or under the 100W range. The GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are expected to launch in Q4 2022 while mobility GPUs are expected around CES 2023.

The games will be adding NVIDIA DLSS and ray-traced lighting.



Support for NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing in Steelrising and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum means a GeForce RTX-based graphics card desktop PC or laptop PC will deliver the ultimate experience in those titles with the highest levels of performance the smoothest gameplay and the highest-fidelity graphics.

The developers of Steelrising and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum have been working hand in hand with NVIDIA to include two advanced technologies in its games: ray tracing (RT) which adds realism to the games through improved light and shading; and Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) NVIDIA’s critically acclaimed AI-powered tech that boosts performance without compromising image quality.

AI technologies and ray tracing are revolutionizing the way we play and create and at the forefront of this game-changing movement is NVIDIA RTX the fastest and most advanced platform for bleeding-edge applications and games.

Steelrising depicts an alternative version of history after the Storming of the Bastille. The player embodies Aegis Marie-Antoinette’s automaton bodyguard as she fights through Paris in an alternate history where machines are suppressing the French Revolution. Spiders’ combat-focused game is planned for release on 8 September on PC PlayStation5 and Xbox Series X|S.

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure. Take on a perilous journey as Gollum chasing the only thing that is precious to him. Climb leap and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly but also torn by his split personality. It is up to you to decide whether the darker side of Gollum takes over or if there is a spark of reason left in what once was Sméagol.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk1MjQ0LW52aWRpYS1kbHNzLXVwc2NhbGluZy10ZWNoLW5vdy1hdmFpbGFibGUtb3Zlci0yMDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia DLSS upscaling is now available in over 200 games,"In brief: Just as AMD is celebrating a year of availability for its FSR upscaling tech Nvidia's DLSS is close to turning four. Developers haven't been too quick to adopt either technology but Team Green claims bragging rights for being the first to reach the 200 game milestone.

Last year AMD introduced its FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) technology --- the much-awaited answer to Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). Since then several developers have implemented FSR into their titles and Team Red claims over 110 existing and upcoming games support its upscaling tech – that's between FSR and FSR 2.0 though the former of which is generally inferior.

The company achieved this level of support relatively quickly. However DLSS is still superior when considering the number of released games and applications that can leverage it. As of writing Nvidia claims there are no less than 200 titles that can leverage DLSS for a healthy performance boost.

Nvidia's DLSS will also be available in upcoming titles like Warhammer 40000: Darktide Steelrising and A Plague Tale: Requiem. This month Loopmancer Hell Pie and others will also come with support for DLSS allowing cards like the RTX 3060 and RTX 3070 to achieve high frame rates even at 4K with ray-traced reflections and ray-traced ambient occlusion enabled.

PCGamingWiki has a neat list of all the games that support FSR DLSS or both. It's worth noting there are still over 40 games that were announced to support DLSS but have yet to receive it including the following:

A Plague Tale: Requiem

ARK: Survival Evolved

One could argue that AMD has achieved a relatively faster adoption rate for FSR than Nvidia has managed with DLSS while also being able to run on a wide range of hardware from both companies. Meanwhile support for Intel's XeSS is expected to land in titles like Death Stranding Director's Cut Ghostwire: Tokyo Enlisted and Dolmen sometime in the coming months."

Dutch bank trialling new NEAR technology for app

Working together with Samsung and NXP Semiconductors - a tech company based in Eindhoven - ING is working to develop a so-called peer-to-peer payment method dubbed NEAR that allows their customers to make a payment simply by pointing their smartphone at the individual to which they wish to transfer funds.

Kind of like Apple's AirDrop technology NEAR works by recognising other smartphones in your vicinity that also have the ING app downloaded. The user simply has to select the payee from the list and voilà! The money will be sent directly to their bank account.

“With this new technology you can make a peer-to-peer payment to acquaintances as well as strangers simply by holding your phone close to each other” says Thijs Janssen from the ING Factory. “Users no longer have to exchange their personal data and this makes paying each other even faster and easier where customized technological payment innovations are developed in co-creation with business customers.”

The future of online banking in the Netherlands?

The Dutch press has already compared NEAR to the exceedingly popular payment platform Tikkie but ING points out that unlike its predecessors NEAR is much quicker and easier to use and a lot more versatile.

“Users no longer have to search for each other's username email address or phone number when they want to buy something at a market make a donation at a collection point or split a restaurant bill with friends” the bank explains on its website.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Carson Hocevar came in third Stewart Friesen finished fourth and Christian Eckes fifth.

It was a race filled with plenty of drama as Kligerman driving his No. 75 Henderson Motorsports Chevrolet and the current points leader Smith trying to keep up with each other from the start all the way to the end.

It was Kligerman's first Camping Truck Series win in five years (Talladega in 2017) and third victory of his Truck Series career (Talladega in 2012).

""I hope the fans enjoyed that race because I was totally blacked out"" said an exuberant Kligerman. ""Zane and I had a hell of a race. He kept it clean the whole time. What a cool thing to finally win a road course. It's taken me over a decade. It's just an amazing day. This hasn't sunk in yet.""

The 31-year-old Kligerman was in full control most of the way as he led 56 of the 67 laps on the road course. Kligerman spoke about the hard-earned victory over Smith who has the most wins (3) in the Truck Series this year and has been the season's most consistent driver as he heads into the final regular season race in two weeks in prime position to clinch the Camping Truck Series regular season championship.

""We raced each other super clean. He's a hell of a talent. He's on the fast track to winning the cup and he's going to be around for a very long time"" said Kligerman who also earned an extra $50000 in the final race of the Triple Truck Challenge bonus program. ""I felt like I passed him clean. I did it multiple times in the race. That's how I race.

""Because the series has become so close it's taking more aggression and me being more aggressive at times but I've never been a driver that's going to knock someone off. I wanna race you straight up and I wanna beat you. The fans got a cool show because we did that.""

Kligerman who is a part-time driver credited his Henderson Racing team for its efforts given the limited resources it has compared to the other racing teams it competes with in the Truck Series.

""It's just a testament that if you put a group of really talented human beings together what they can achieve"" said Kligerman who has worked as a NASCAR commentator on NBC since 2015. ""We pick our tracks races and places we feel like I can make a difference. That's road courses short tracks and super speedways.

""That's how we pick them because we have to be smarter but really cerebral in how we go about doing things. We're part-time for a reason. We do this on a fraction of a budget against the teams were up against. We don't have the funding of a full team. We got to maximize our resources do the best we can and make sure the places we go we have our ducks in a row. It's rewards like this that make it huge for us.""

Kligerman made known that he would love to race full-time next season to compete for the Truck Series championship and that racing is still his passion.

""I'm 31 but I know I have a lot left in me"" said Kligerman. ""I've launched businesses before done the TV thing hosted TV shows and did a lot of different things in a short amount of time. But when you're a racer and you don't race you're trying to replace it. It's just in you. I thought in my late 20s that maybe I could put it aside because it wasn't going well but I realize no matter what I do racing is what I love to do.""

Other feature winners on the program presented by KOZL were Rob White (O'Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Cars) and Dustin Hodges (Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modifieds).

Schultz of Sedalia won for the seventh time overall in 2022. After a pair of fourth-place feature runs earlier in the season at Lucas Oil Speedway Schultz said it was sweet to break through in the tough field.

""We've had a good car for a long time"" Schultz said. ""I've got to thank Bobby and Sherry (Russell) for letting me drive it. We've been right up near the top two or three all the time but just hadn't been able to get one here.""

After two mishaps before an official lap could be completed Schultz grabbed the lead from fellow front-row starter Colson Kirk with JC Morton running third.

Six-time track champion and 2022 points leader Kris Jackson started eighth in the feature but already advanced four spots when a caution stacked the field after lap six. Meanwhile Andy Bryant also was zooming through the field after his heat-race win was went away due to a technical disqualification and he was fifth by lap eight after starting 20th.

But Bryant would advance no further and neither would Jackson. The race remained caution-free the rest of the way and Schultz held on for his first Lucas Oil Speedway feature win of the season.

Schultz beat Kirk by 1.1 seconds with Morton capturing third Jackson taking fourth and Bryant a distant fifth.

White earns narrow Stock Car triumph: Scoring his first O’Reilly Auto Parts USRA Stock Car feature win of the season Rob White held off fellow Lebanon resided William Garner by less than a half-second.

Rob White went around the outside of Christopher Sawyer for the lead on lap four after Sawyer led the opening four laps. Garner moved in second one lap later and engaged White for the lead sticking to the back bumper of the leader until the end as the race clicked off caution-free over the final 18 laps.

White held on to prevail by .411 seconds or about a car length.

""I think us Lebanon boys got 1-2-3 tonight"" White said in victory lane. ""I'd like to thank my family. My wife's not here but I want to thank her and ... just everybody that helps. This is awesome.""

Bryan White Rob’s son finished third with David Hendrix fourth and Ed Griggs in fifth.

Late pass sends Hodges to USRA Modified win: Dustin Hodges worked and worked and could not get by leader Eric Turner on the outside. So Hodges switched strategy coming to the white flag and made a diving low-side pass for the lead.

The Centralia driver made the pass hold up going on to beat Turner by .673 seconds to score the Cedar Creek Beef Jerky USRA Modified victory for his first Lucas Oil Speedway win.

“We’ve been working hard on getting it done here at Lucas Oil Speedway for many many years and finally got it” Hodges said.

Front-row starting Cody Brill beat Turner on the drop of the green and led the first five laps before Turner gained the top spot on lap six with Hodges moving into the runner-up position by circuit 10 of the 20-lapper.

Hodges could get alongside Turner on the outside in turns three and four but couldn't get past. He said he looked up at the video board with laps running out and knew he had to do something.

""Man I knew I was way faster than he was and I was just trying to do it up through the middle"" Hodges said. ""He kept drifting all the way up. I didn't want to get into him. I knew I was running out of laps so I had to take it.

""The car is phenomenal right now. That's two-for-two for the weekend. It's awesome.""

Hodges also won on Friday night at Callaway Speedway. He has six feature wins overall this season.

Brill finished third with Tracy Wolf fourth and Jason Pursley fifth. Points leader Dillon McCowan who was DQ’d in tech after a heat-race win started 14th and rallied for sixth.

Diamond Nationals next on the dirt: The 16th annual CMH Diamond Nationals presented by Summit Racing Equipment are up next Saturday night featuring the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series along with the Lucas Oil MLRA. Also on the program will be USRA Modifieds and USRA Stock Cars.

That’s why it’s so strange that Texas crude producers are facing a sand shortage of more than 1 million tons and prices that have jumped 150%.

Frack sand which gets blasted through shale rocks to unlock oil and natural gas is averaging $55 a ton up from $22 at the end of 2021 data from energy-research firm Lium show. Demand is climbing as oil explorers turn the taps back on after Covid-driven cutbacks.

Advertisement

But like in so many pockets of the economy the recovery is sparking a mismatch. Sand suppliers have seen disruptions labor shortages and trucking bottlenecks. The chief executive officer of U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. the largest publicly traded frack-sand miner has dubbed the tight market “sandemonium” and said his company is sold out.

That’s where Steve Brock and his upstart sand-mining operation Nomad Proppant come in. Since the early days of the shale revolution more than a decade ago fracking operators have relied on mined sand that’s delivered to their sites by truck - across distances as long as 100 miles. Brock Nomad’s chief commercial officer wants to turn that model on its head.

Advertisement

His idea: Why not just use the sand that’s right under your feet?

Nomad has developed machinery that can go directly to the frack wells (give or take 10 to 20 miles) vastly reducing the burden of freight costs and the time-consuming process of trucking.

“We’re not brain surgeons here - all we’re doing is finding the best spots and washing and delivering the sand” said Brock 34. “Frankly that it took us this long to get here is pretty wild.”

Brock left his job at Covia one of the world’s biggest frack-sand miners in February 2020 to help start Nomad. It launched its first mobile sand mine in West Texas last month after the huge surge in prices. He calls the timing “very lucky.”

It’s sand scarcity even more than price that’s the big hurdle for oil drillers. Irving-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co. the Permian’s biggest producer said it expected oil and natural gas output would take a hit last quarter because of sand issues. Things are so extreme that some oil companies are shipping sand in by train from Wisconsin at almost double the cost.

Whether Nomad and rivals like Hi-Crush Inc. one of the original frack-sand pioneers that’s now also introduced mobile units can help solve the sand squeeze could play a significant role in the global energy markets.

While drillers in the Permian have shown restraint in ramping up oil production the last thing the world needs is for sand problems to place even more limitations on their output. The U.S. the world’s top oil producer and among the biggest liquefied natural gas exporters has become an even more important supplier in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s struggles to meet production targets. Meanwhile deficits in energy supplies - and the resulting surge in prices - are among the biggest drivers of the dramatic rise in inflation across the planet.

Advertisement

“You cannot take sand for granted” said Chris Wright CEO of Liberty Energy Inc. the second-biggest frack-services provider. Without enough “I’m quite concerned about global balances for oil gas and food - those are intimately tied.”

Total U.S. demand for frack sand is currently about 5% higher than the roughly 25 million tons being produced according to industry consultant Enverus which estimates a shortfall of roughly 1.3 million tons.

Brock of Nomad says that by carving into the earth about 15 feet deep across 40 acres one of his mobile units can produce about 1 million tons. And since the units are mobile Nomad doesn’t need to limit itself to the huge dusty dunes of traditional mines.

“We can find deposits that previously wouldn’t make sense if you thought you’re stationary because maybe this deposit only has 3 million tons” Brock said. “That can give me two years’ worth of work and then I can move over 2 miles to the next spot.”

The rebound for sand prices is emblematic of the inflation spreading across the Permian. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase estimate costs for U.S. shale companies are soaring at a rate of 25% or almost triple the headline inflation rate.

A lot of that’s driven by shortages. There aren’t enough steel pipes not enough drilling rigs not enough bulldozers - and critically not enough people. Occidental Petroleum Corp. CEO Vicki Hollub has said worker shortages along with supply-chain snarls explain some of why US oil drillers aren’t significantly expanding production.

Turning sand into a mobile business tackles another area of supply-chain bottlenecks: trucking.

Because Nomad can dig up sand close to where it’s needed a single 18-wheeler can make multiple trips back and forth from the mobile mine to the well in one day. That means as few as 10 trucks total are needed down from the roughly 70 used in traditional deliveries from mines. That brings a significant drop in freight costs. But even more critically in the Permian where labor is extremely tight and the unemployment rate is hovering just above 3% it means needing fewer truck drivers.

As Brock puts it: “You solve that issue you solve a lot of problems.”

Devon Energy Corp. one of the region’s biggest explorers is among those already turning to mobile mines. The company is working with Hi-Crush to develop its unit. The pilot project will sit on a roughly 5-acre pad site and account for a quarter of Devon’s total sand needs in the Delaware Basin in the western half of the Permian.

“It gives us a sense of security with our supply” said John Raines vice president of Devon’s Delaware Basin business unit.

It’s also helping to spark a revival for companies like Hi-Crush which went into bankruptcy during the sand-bust days of 2020.

“It’s definitely our growth engine” Hi-Crush CEO Dirk Hallen said of the company’s three mobile units and plans to roll out more later this year. With fracking operators now consuming almost three times as much sand each month as they did five years ago Hallen said demand is likely to stay strong.

And Brock of Nomad points out that mobile units will be able to meet demand faster than traditional mines because not having to truck as far also means eliminating the time-consuming step of drying.

After sand is dug up it gets washed and then left to air dry in piles for a few days. At stationary mines it then gets blasted in giant drying machines. That way when trucks are loaded they’re carrying as much sand as possible. But Brock says since his trucks only go a short distance he can skip the machine drying eliminating pricey equipment.

The cost savings were a key part of Nomad’s pitch as the company was getting off the ground during the depths of the pandemic when Brock says prices were so low that sand was a “four-letter word” and not just literally.

“When you get crunched and you need to start saving some money” he said “you start getting creative.”

Warren Buffett has lived through 26 periods where the S&P 500 was in a bear market. Eleven of them came after he first invested in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.41%) (BRK.B 0.30%) in 1965.

The legendary investor has led Berkshire to trounce the market during the past 57 years. His decisions made during major downturns made a big difference in his overall performance. Here's what Buffett does in bear markets -- and you should too.

1. Don't be afraid

One of Buffett's most famous quotes is: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful."" During bear markets many investors are fearful. But that's exactly the time when Buffett isn't afraid at all.

In 2008 and 2009 the stock market reeled as the U.S. economy experienced what would be called the Great Recession. Anyone who lived through this time knows how scary it was for most investors.

However Buffett wrote in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders after the dust settled ""It's been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend."" That's almost certainly still his view during the current bear market.

2. Put your money to work

In that shareholder letter Buffett also wrote ""We've put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years."" He wasn't exaggerating.

At the beginning of 2008 Berkshire's cash position stood at $44.3 billion. Over the next two years the company retained operating earnings of around $17 billion. But Berkshire finished 2009 with a cash stockpile of $30.6 billion. Buffett practiced what he preached by being greedy when others were fearful.

Guess what the multibillionaire is doing in this bear market? Putting Berkshire's money to work. So far in 2022 Buffett and his investment managers have bought 16 stocks. He's especially loaded up on shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.08%). Berkshire now owns a 17.4% stake in the oil and gas company. Oxy has been a big winner with its shares more than doubling year to date.

One common denominator in all the stocks that Buffett buys is that he looks for high-quality businesses at an attractive price. As he wrote in early 2009 ""Whether we're talking about socks or stocks I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.""

That's a smart approach for all investors. Most stocks are available right now at a discount to their prices last year. However not all of them have quality underlying businesses.

3. Think long-term

Regardless of what the economy or the stock market is doing Buffett always maintains a long-term perspective. During the dark period in the midst of the Great Recession he wrote to Berkshire shareholders:

Amid this bad news however never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past... America has had no shortage of challenges. Without fail however we've overcome them. In the face of those obstacles -- and many others -- the real standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven-fold during the 1900s while the Dow Jones Industrials rose from 66 to 11497. Compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during which humans secured only tiny gains if any in how they lived. Though the path has not been smooth our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has and it will continue to do so. America's best days lie ahead.

The current state of affairs isn't nearly as bad as it was in 2008 and 2009. This bear market presents a huge opportunity for long-term investors who aren't afraid to put their money to work.",,,,,,

Morehead City rally sinks Pilots

Despite another excellent pitching performance by Jay Cassady the Peninsula Pilots saw a three-run lead evaporate in a 5-4 loss Saturday night to Morehead City before 1020 at War Memorial Stadium in Hampton.

Cassady struck out seven and yielded five hits a run and a walk in five innings. The Christopher Newport left-hander was in line for a victory before the Marlins scored twice in the seventh and twice more in the eighth with losing pitcher Mason Miller charged for all four runs.

VMI’s Ty Swaim went 3 for 4 with two runs for the Pilots (14-19 Coastal Plain League 3-7 in its second half). He Michael Robertson and Jack Dragum had Peninsula’s RBIs and Trey Morgan scored twice.

Braeden O’Shaugnessy had four of the 10 hits for Morehead City (25-9 7-3) which won the East Division first-half title and leads the second-half standings.

In the seventh two walks and a wild pitch preceded Zack Miller’s two-run double which trimmed the Pilots’ lead to 4-3.

In the eighth McGwire Tuffy singled advanced on an error and scored the tying run on Colton Becker’s groundout. Dylan Rogers singled home pinch runner Sean Johnson with what proved to be the winning run.

Brennan Armstrong Courtesy of Scott Taetsch/USA TODAY Sports

Brennan Armstrong's 2021 quarterback campaign was one for the ages. He shattered the UVA program records for single-season total offense passing yards passing touchdowns and completions. Given his incredible output last season Armstrong has set himself up to take over several of the UVA all-time career passing and total offense records as he returns for a third season as Virginia's starting quarterback.

Armstrong is currently third on UVA's all-time career total offense list with 7720 yards. Shawn Moore is in second with 7897 total yards and Bryce Perkins is the current record-holder with 7910 total yards. Just 190 yards separate Armstrong from Perkins on the leaderboard. For context Armstrong averaged 391.7 yards of total offense per game in 2021 so he should break the record in UVA's season opener against Richmond on September 3rd.

Matt Schaub currently holds Virginia's all-time career passing record with 7502 yards and Brennan Armstrong is in second with 6824 yards. Armstrong who averaged 370.8 passing yards per game in 2021 needs 678 passing yards to catch Schaub so he will likely do so in week two at Illinois (Sept. 10) or in week three against Old Dominion (Sept. 17).

Armstrong's 51 career passing touchdowns is third all-time in UVA program history trailing Shawn Moore with 55 and program leader Matt Schaub with 56 touchdowns. Needing just five TDs to tie the record and six to break it Armstrong is on track to reach that milestone within the first three weeks of the season.

Armstrong is also within striking distance of the program record for most career 200-yard passing games. With 18 such games on his résumé Armstrong is just two games behind Matt Schaub's record of 20-career 200-yard passing games. It is very possible that Armstrong will need only the first three games of the 2022 season to tie and break that record as well.

Armstrong is already Virginia's all-time leader with 11 300-yard passing games and six 400-yard passing games. He also owns the three highest single-game passing totals in UVA history and is responsible for seven of the top ten. Each of those seven games took place in just 11 starts in the 2021 football season.

Chips are over-supplied. Chip manufacturing has expanded too fast and surpassed demand but also can’t scale up fast enough to meet demand. The chip business is booming. Chip stocks are falling.

It’s a confusing time to figure out what’s going on in the semiconductor industry.

To understand the contradictions in semiconductor supply chains right now it’s important to keep in mind that there are many types of chips built in very different ways. Older generations of chips used to control basic mechanical functions in cars and dishwashers are built using equipment that has been around since the 2000s while the cutting-edge chips that render graphics and run AI models in the latest smartphones and computers require ultra-precise machinery.

The state of the semiconductor sector is so muddled because the production of some types of chips has already ramped up enough to meet demand while manufacturing for other types of chips is still catching up. Overall though these conflicting storylines are a sign that the chip shortage is finally starting to ease.

Semiconductor supply is rising and demand is easing

The overall production of semiconductors is rising around the world. TSMC the world’s biggest chipmaker increased its planned investment in new plants and equipment from $30 billion in 2021 to $44 billion in 2022. China has invested about $50 billion since 2014 to support domestic chip production while US lawmakers are (maybe) on the verge of doling out $52 billion in subsidies and incentives for new semiconductor plants in the US.

Meanwhile South Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance reports that Korean chipmakers are sitting on a rapidly growing stockpile of unsold chips. The country which is the world’s biggest producer of memory chips for electronics like laptops and smartphones hasn’t seen its semiconductor inventory rise this fast since 2018.

Plenty of chips for smartphones and laptops but not for cars

Chipmaker Micron Technologies warned investors on June 30 about a looming glut of high-tech memory chips used in smartphones and laptops. Consumer demand for those devices unexpectedly dropped thanks to rising inflation sagging consumer spending in China and fears of an impending recession according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “Given the change in market conditions we are taking immediate action to reduce our supply growth trajectory” he said.

Micron Technologies predicted that its smartphone division would ship about 130 million fewer chips than expected this year and its PC division would cut sales by about 30 million chips—a 10% drop in both categories. The downturn will last at least half a year chief business officer Sumit Sadana predicted unless a recession hits and brings demand down further.

Meanwhile automakers are complaining they still can’t find enough low-tech chips to keep their assembly lines running at full capacity. GM Toyota and Honda each told investors their sales had slumped in the most recent quarter because of the ongoing chip shortage. Collectively automakers will build an estimated 3 million fewer cars this year for lack of semiconductors.

Semiconductor stocks are feeling recession fears

Investors are watching semiconductor supply rise while contemplating the possibility that inflation or a recession will cause a drop in consumer demand for everything that uses chips including electronics appliances and even cars. As a result chip stocks have been plummeting even though semiconductor sales are still historically high and chipmakers are recording record revenues. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index which tracks big chip manufacturers has fallen nearly 40% this year after doubling in value during the pandemic.

Semiconductor stocks have underperformed even in the context of a slumping stock market.

In its statement Intel said that ""Unfortunately Chips Act funding has moved more slowly than we expected and we still don't know when it will get done.""

Reuters

However the company also said that they are still trying to start the project’s construction by this year and manufacturing is expected to start by 2025.

What is the Chips for America Act?

Reuters

In a bid to revive the semiconductor industry in America the U.S. Senate has approved $52 billion for the CHIPS for America Act in 2021. However the bill is pending in the House of Representatives for approval.

The two houses are yet to resolve some differences in the bill. According to Newstack ""The House legislation includes trade proposals that are not in the Senate bill while the Senate bill authorizes an additional $200 billion to accelerate competition with China. That is not in the House version""

Reuters

The bill aims to encourage renewed investment in manufacturing over the next decades. According to the US Congress website the bill promotes investment and provides incentives to the US semiconductor manufacturing along with research and development.

It further provides an income tax credit for semiconductor equipment or manufacturing facility investment through 2026. It also includes the establishment of a Manufacturing USA institute for semiconductor manufacturing.

The manufacturing capacity of the US has fallen down from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2021. The reason behind this drop is that the US government was not investing and providing incentives to the manufacturer like other countries.

Why has Intel delayed its project?

Intel estimated the plant could cost as much as $100 billion and committed an initial investment of $20 billion.

Reuters

Intel has committed to the investment with a backdrop that the U.S. government would pass the Chips Act which will eventually lead to many relaxations through grants and tax incentives.

But now delays in approval of the bill made Intel pause until policymakers pass the legislation in order to get the future clarities.

The Russia-Ukraine war impacted the supply chains as oil prices are touching the sky. It also impacted the supply of semiconductors.

What are Semiconductor Chips and why are they crucial?

Unsplash

Semiconductor Chips are the prominent component that powers electronic items that exist in your surroundings. The electricity can be controlled using semiconductor chips in various electronic items like cars laptops smartphones etc.

These chips are very significant in the functioning of all modern electronics and ICT products. They are basic building block parts of contemporary automobiles household gadgets and essential medical devices.

Reuters

The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in the high demand for these chips as online activities increased worldwide.

However it is not easy to increase the manufacturing of chips on short notice because it takes time to set up chip factories. A report published in Bloomberg quint tells ""Manufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories dust-free rooms multi-million-dollar machines molten tin and lasers.”

Their 29–57 record entering Sunday’s games is the worst in MLB this season. So is their average home attendance of 8559 fans per game.

The team is wrestling to build a new ballpark in Oakland and is flirting with Las Vegas in case that plan fizzles.

How might their fate be different if they had an owner such as Joe Lacob who has enjoyed four championships in the past eight seasons as primary owner of the Warriors?

It’s a fair question to ponder as a San Francisco Chronicle report brings to light the fact that he apparently was rebuffed from buying the A’s many years ago. Lacob apparently had a deal in place to buy the team from Stephen Schott for $180 million. Instead the MLB commissioner at the time Bud Selig approved a sale to one of his college fraternity brothers Lew Wolff and John Fisher in 2005.

Lacob doesn’t mince words about how he thinks the ballpark situation would’ve played out under his control.

“I had the A’s done” Lacob told the Chronicle. “It was just taken away from me. You know what everyone’s confident in their own abilities obviously. I think we would’ve had a stadium a long time ago if I had bought it. That’s just me.”

Lacob also told the Chronicle that he remains interested in buying the A’s. In fact he told the newspaper that a “standing offer” has existed for him to buy the team from the Fisher family which purchased Wolff’s share of the club in 2016 for more than 10 years.

“I’ve had a standing offer to buy the A’s from John Fisher for I don’t even know how long. Over a decade” Lacob told the Chronicle. “It’s up to him; it’s his business.”

Lacob also unsuccessfully tried to buy MLB’s Angels and Dodgers before acquiring the Warriors according to the Chronicle. He told the newspaper that his status as a baseball outsider hurt his chances in those bids.

Lacob then bought a stake in the NBA’s Celtics and became acquainted with power players around the league. Those contacts helped him purchase the Warriors with Peter Guber for $450 million in 2010.

“When the Warriors came up in 2010 I had an advantage ironically—maybe my only advantage—over [Oracle Corporation co-founder] Larry Ellison which was I knew everybody in the league really well” Lacob told the Chronicle. “It’s interesting. The reaction to what happened with the A’s kind of helped me get the Warriors.”

According to a report by The Leduc Rep Angela Santiago CEO of The Little Potato Company said: “This is a significant step for The Little Potato Company which my Dad and I founded together in Edmonton more than 25 years ago. With the incredible support of our community we are honoured to continue to grow our business here and provide a fresh nutritious food to families across North America.”

The state-of-the-art potato packaging facility in Leduc County will replace the current plant in Edmonton. It will allow the company to offer a wider variety of products and utilize the latest technology to ensure the highest quality of potatoes.

The facility will have solar panels to provide one full gigawatt of power each year and decrease water consumption by recycling and cleaning the water it uses. This was important to Frank Santiago Director of Capital Assets as he designed the machine plan for the new facility.

Read an excerpt below.

Scribner

I never wanted to be famous not really. It was more that fame was the necessary precondition for and inevitable byproduct of the thing I really did want which was to be the first woman President of the United States.

I know there's nothing more pathetic than a person talking about a dream that never happened one that never even came close. It just makes you look like a fool. But being President wasn't some girlish fantasy of mine some cute little idea that dissolved at the first contact with reality.

Being President was my ambition not my dream.

There's a difference.

And it wasn't a crazy ambition. Whatever it is that a person needs to reach a goal like that I had it in me I know I did. Even back in high school. Especially then. I was smart I was tough I had an incredible capacity for hard work and I believed in myself. No Imposter Syndrome for me. And beyond that was my actual superpower which was that I wanted it more than anyone else. Trust me you didn't want to get in my way.

I could see the path laid out in front of me. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Georgetown and worked as a congressional intern for one glorious summer. I remember how amazing that felt flashing my ID nodding to the security guard as I entered the Capitol Building in my navy blue pants suit like I'd willed it to happen like I'd granted own secret wish.

I went straight from undergrad to law school also at Georgetown because I knew what I wanted and where I needed to be.

I saw myself as a budding prosecutor. Those were years when being tough on crime was considered a virtue and that suited me just fine. I liked rules and laws—I still do—and I believed that people who broke them should be punished to the fullest extent possible. Eventually a high profile case would come my way and I would go on TV and talk about order and justice and the righteous vengeance of the state and people would remember my name. When the time was right I would run for office. Congresswoman Flick. Senator Flick. Attorney General Flick. And who knows maybe even…

In a conversation with The Open Up Podcast Patton who has portrayed Iris West on the series since 2014 explained that she wanted to leave the show “as early as season two” because she felt “severely unhappy” amid a slew of harassing messages online from fans.

The Flash actress explained that signing on for the show and “changing the way people view the superhero genre and creating spaces for women of color that have never had that” was “a lot of responsibility” that came with “a lot of attention.” She noted it was “also a very dangerous place to be in when you’re one of the first and you’re receiving so much backlash from it and there is no help.

“Now people understand it a little better and they understand how fans can be racist — especially in genre — misogynistic all of that. But at the time it was kind of just like ‘That’s how fans are but whatever'” Patton said. “Even with the companies I was working with The CW and WB I think that was their way of handling it. I think we know better now. It’s not OK to treat your talent that way — to let them go through abuse and harassment.”

Patton alleged “there were no support systems” at the time and “it was just free rein to get abused every single day.”

“There were no social media protocols in place to protect me; they just let all that stuff sit there” she added. “It’s just not enough to make me your lead female and say ‘Look at us we’re so progressive we checked the box.’ It’s great but you’ve put me in the ocean alone around sharks.”

In order for changes to be made Patton stressed that there had to be “people in positions of power who understand my experience and understand the Black experience the Black female experience who can say ‘OK she needs protection.'”

“I think any time you hire anyone who is a minority of any kind you have to be prepared to protect them” Patton explained. “Because in the real world we are not protected. Just because you put us on a fancy Hollywood TV set or film set with the hair and makeup and you assume we’re safe we are not safe.

“It’s like if I get pulled over at 2 a.m. in Jackson Mississippi by a white cop. Do you think he gives a shit that I’m Candice Patton from The Flash? It doesn’t matter” she added. “We still need protection because the world sees us in a certain way. When I step onto set and everyone working around me is white I’m not protected and I will never be protected. And that’s not to say everyone has bad intentions but they have blind spots and that can also contribute to my harm. It’s been a learning experience I’m sure for companies and corporations and productions.”

Patton shared that she was also more affected by the “day-to-day stuff” and the “protocols put in place” alleging that she was not treated equally when compared to others. “I remember asking my publicist I was like ‘Do you think you could get The Flash account to follow me?'” she recalled. “Back when I cared about that shit and wanted to be included.”

While continuing to reflect on her early days starring in the series Patton said she remembers being severely unhappy and recalled feeling like she was “not going to make it through.” The actress said she ultimately stayed not just because of contractual obligations but due to feeling “a huge responsibility” given her fans “loved this character.”

“It was such an iconic casting such an iconic role and I knew how much this meant to so many people that I felt a responsibility to stay in a space and a place that was probably very toxic for my mental health” she said. “In staying in going through a lot of that adversity I’ve learned so much. I’m so much tougher.”

Patton said that everything is “more leveled out now” and since then there have since been more conversations around these issues. As for her future on the show the Flash star shared that the next season of the CW series will “likely will be my last” so she can move forward and “break free” from a character identity she’s been “attached to for so long.”

“I think a part of her needs to die so that I can live” she said.

Following the interview Patton shared her appreciation for the podcast on social media “for creating a safe space for me to talk about things I’ve never really spoken about.”

“My sincerest hope is that the industry only continues to get better and more inclusive” she continued. “I’m deeply optimistic about the future. Despite the trials I am so grateful for being a part of the journey and hopefully moving the needle even if it’s just a millimeter. Nobody’s perfect myself included so thank you to everyone who has listened with an open heart and mind.”

Inside away from the elements Mr. Gaesser pondered what the coming year might bring for farmers.

As tractors and planters throughout the Midwest rolled into fields like the ones near his house earlier this year Mr. Gaesser 69 was hopeful that soaring grain prices and heightened global demand for food would translate into robust revenues. But he also expected that sharply higher costs for fuel fertilizer and other necessities would cut deeply into profits.

And then there is Big Food.

Companies like PepsiCo Cargill Walmart and General Mills are trying to convince farmers like Mr. Gaesser to adopt new climate-friendly agricultural techniques through a variety of financial incentives and programs. They have good reason. Together these companies have pledged that at least 70 million acres or roughly 18 percent of the nation’s total cropland an area about the size of Nevada will be operated using regenerative agriculture techniques by 2030.

Through photosynthesis plants — whether corn or trees — convert carbon dioxide from the air into energy that is stored in the soil. Regenerative farming techniques such as planting a cover crop during the fall allows that process to continue throughout the winter months when the soil would normally be bare.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbWVsbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VuLXVzL3N0b3J5L2R5c3BlcHNpYS1hbmQtcGVwc2nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Pepsi Ever Cure the Dyspepsia It Was Created to Treat?,"Early marketing efforts leaned much harder on the soft drink’s alleged abilities to calm indigestion and stomach aches as opposed to Super Halftime shows and Beyonce. The thing is it might never have had contained the eponymous ingredient to do so

When it first hit the market Pepsi-Cola was pushed as much as an indigestion remedy as a soda. In fact multiple advertisements from soda shops in the early 1900s claimed that it would cure a customer’s indigestion or it would be free.

It allegedly could do so because of its most prominent ingredient — pepsin. To that end a 1902 advertisement that was developed with at least the blessing of Pepsi inventor Caleb Bradham referred to it directly as “Pepsi-Cola (The Pepsin Drink)” just in case that direct connection wasn’t obvious from the name itself. Other ads were more explicit about it being a dyspepsia cure.

That said it had other ingredients too — e.g. acid phosphates special oils and the juices of fresh fruits. And so when the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed Pepsi tried to have it both ways — and get one up on its coked-up competitor Coca-Cola in the process — by referring to itself as “The Original Pure Food Drink.”

But did the pepsin in Pepsi really cure dyspepsia?

A better (and more surprising) question is “Did Pepsi actually contain pepsin in the first place?” Several authoritative sources will tell you outright that Pepsi never did including the official website of the Original Pepsi Store in New Bern North Carolina and The Encyclopedia of Pepsi-Cola Collectibles. Other sources have attributed the belief that Pepsi once contained pepsin to “hearsay.”

Honestly though it seems a lot more like a bold-faced lie:

1907 Pepsi ad listing pepsin as the ingredient that aids digestion

What is pepsin anyway?

The commercial version of pepsin is isolated and extracted from the stomachs of hogs or pigs. Historically speaking it was the very first enzyme to be isolated from animal tissue. While the original sellers of pepsin products marketed them as a digestive marvel they appear to have danced around its point of origin frequently using statements like “It’s also found in the stomach of animals like the ox calf etc.” The “etc.” is clearly a placeholder for where the pepsin actually originated — a hog’s stomach which is a location that members of certain swine-averse religions definitely would have avoided.

Specifically pepsin helps the body to break down protein so that it can be more easily absorbed by the small intestine. Since pepsin is an enzyme already produced in the human stomach most people wouldn’t need additional pepsin in order to break down the protein entering their bodies. Even with modern pepsin supplements and medications patients will be advised to only take them with a protein and to never take them on an empty stomach.

Supplements containing anywhere from 20 to 700 milligrams of various concentrations of pepsin are often recommended. How that translates into the “teaspoonful (of the) essence (of) pepsin” that every glass of original Pepsi-Cola was said to contain is a mystery. We can’t know if that amount was far too much far too little or just right. (Regardless of the dosage Pepsi would now be committing the modern equivalent of medical malpractice if it failed to arrive with an admonishment to only consume it on a stomach full of protein.)

Two of the telltale signs that you might be in need of a digestion aid on the level of pepsin would be indigestion and diarrhea. Coincidentally two of the reliable signs that you’ve been supplementing with too much pepsin also include indigestion and diarrhea. Therefore the habitual use of a pepsin-laced soda might eventually end up curing and then reigniting the sort of dyspepsia it was intended to combat in the first place.

So if there was no pepsin in Pepsi does that mean it couldn’t fix indigestion?

It probably could have depending on the root cause of the indigestion. Modern research has at least very strongly suggested that carbonated water on its own is capable of improving swallowing ability increasing bowel movement frequency and alleviating constipation symptoms. However if these benefits hold up under closer scrutiny they’d also apply to the drinkers of all carbonated beverages not just Pepsi fans. It also has nothing to do with pepsin.

Some of Pepsi’s other early claims — that it “tones the liver thereby purifying the blood” and is “proven by actual test to be one of the greatest milk producers for mothers on the market” — are such bullshit they’re not even worth interrogating.

Now if for some reason Pepsi still contains pepsin the company would certainly be required to disclose it on the packaging (which it doesn’t). For now though I want to know what the statute of limitations is on the free Pepsis those drug stores were promising to dissatisfied customers. Because I think I feel my tummy rumbling.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzU3NDM5MjEvYnJpc2stZHJhZ29uLXBhcmFkaXNlLXNwYXJrbGluZy1pY2VkLXRlYS_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS81NzQzOTIxL2JyaXNrLWRyYWdvbi1wYXJhZGlzZS1zcGFya2xpbmctaWNlZC10ZWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?...,"SMOOTH DRINK Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?

Its success in developing covid medicines has given the drugmaker unusual weight in determining U.S. health policy. Based on internal research the company’s executives have frequently announced the next stage in the fight against the pandemic before government officials have had time to study the issue annoying many experts in the medical field and leaving some patients unsure whom to trust.

Pfizer’s 2021 revenue was $81.3 billion roughly double its revenue in 2020 when its top sellers were a pneumonia vaccine the cancer drug Ibrance and the fibromyalgia treatment Lyrica which had gone off-patent.

Now its mRNA vaccine holds 70% of the U.S. and European markets. And its antiviral Paxlovid is the pill of choice to treat early symptoms of covid. This year the company expects to rake in more than $50 billion in global revenue from the two medications alone.

Paxlovid’s value to vaccinated patients isn’t yet clear and Pfizer’s covid vaccine doesn’t entirely prevent infections although each booster temporarily restores some protection. Yet while patients may recoil at the need for repeated injections — two boosters are now recommended for people 50 and older — the requirement is gold for investors.

“Hopefully we could be giving it annually and maybe for some groups that are high-risk more often” CEO Albert Bourla told investors this year. “Then you have the treatment [Paxlovid] that will let’s say resolve the issues of those that are getting the disease.”

Just last week the Biden administration agreed to buy another 105 million doses of Pfizer’s covid vaccine for the fall booster campaign paying $3.2 billion. At $30.47 a dose it’s a significant premium over the $19.50-a-dose rate the government paid for the first 100 million. The vaccine is being modified to target early omicron variants but newer variants are gaining dominance.

Because the virus keeps mutating and will be around for a long time the market for Pfizer’s products won’t go away. In wealthier countries the public is likely to keep coming back for more like diners at an all-you-can-eat restaurant sated but never entirely satisfied.

The reliance on Pfizer products at each stage of the pandemic has steered the U.S. response including critical public health decisions.

When last year Bourla suggested that a booster shot would soon be needed U.S. public health officials later followed giving the impression that Pfizer was calling the tune. Some public health experts and scientists worry these decisions were hasty noting for example that although boosters with the mRNA shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech improve antibody protection initially it generally doesn’t last.

Since January Bourla has been saying that U.S. adults will probably all need annual booster shots and senior FDA officials have indicated since April that they agree.

Albert Bourla Pfizer CEO

At a June 28 meeting of FDA advisers considering a potential fall vaccination campaign Pfizer presented studies involving about 3500 people showing that tweaks to its covid vaccine allowed it to elicit more antibodies against the omicron variant that began circulating last December. But most of the advisers said the FDA should require the next vaccine to target an even newer omicron variant known as BA.5.

That would mean more work and expense for Pfizer which called on the FDA to enable it to make future changes to the covid vaccine without human trials — similar to how annual influenza vaccines are approved. “If such a process were implemented responses to future waves could be substantially accelerated” said Kena Swanson Pfizer’s vice president for viral vaccines.

FDA officials at the meeting did not immediately respond to the suggestion.

As societies abandon other efforts to control covid’s spread such as mask mandates and physical distancing Pfizer’s prospects look even brighter especially now that the company has brought out the first oral covid treatment Paxlovid.

“People are going to get out there” Angela Hwang president of Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group told investors May 3. “We know with all of that infections are going to increase and that’s the role that Paxlovid can play.”

During a recent investor call a Pfizer official could spin the recent reports that the virus can hide from Paxlovid into good news predicting that as with the vaccine patients may need multiple courses.

Immunocompromised patients “may carry this virus for a very very long time” Dr. Mikael Dolsten said in the investor call. “And we see that area as a real new opportunity growth area for Paxlovid to do very well where you may need to take multiple courses.”

Pfizer has spent handsomely to bolster its influence during the pandemic. Since early 2020 it has shelled out more than $25 million for in-house lobbying and payments to 19 lobbying firms pushing for legislation to protect its products and promote more robust U.S. vaccination programs.

Pfizer’s donations to political candidates in the 2020 cycle were larger than those of any other drug company totaling about $3.5 million with the greatest share going to Democrats. Joe Biden got $351000; Donald Trump just $103000.

Unlike Moderna Sanofi Novavax and Johnson & Johnson which got billions of dollars in U.S. support Pfizer did not seek government money to develop its vaccine saying it would work independently.

Pfizer did benefit from $445 million the German government provided to BioNTech Pfizer’s partner in developing the vaccine. And in the end Pfizer relied substantially on U.S. government logistical support according to a new book by former Health and Human Services official Paul Mango.

Pfizer recorded $7.8 billion in U.S. revenue for its covid vaccine in 2021. The government has options to buy 1.6 billion Pfizer vaccine doses and has so far bought 900 million of them including 500 million purchased at not-for-profit prices to be donated to poor countries.

Pfizer’s terms in the contracts exclude many taxpayer protections. They deny the government any intellectual property rights and say that federal spending played no role in the vaccine’s development — even though National Institutes of Health scientists invented a key feature of Pfizer’s vaccine said Robin Feldman a patent law expert at the University of California.

“The agreement could set a precedent” in which another company could cite Pfizer’s contracts to argue the government has surrendered any rights to an invention she said.

The government also has agreed to buy about 20 million five-day courses of Paxlovid for $530 each.

Prices for the covid drug and vaccine will go up once the pandemic period is over Bourla said at a January event “to reflect the cutting-edge technology.”

Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo declined to respond to specific questions about Pfizer’s influence on pandemic policy. She released a statement saying that “since Day 1 of this pandemic we have been laser-focused on working collaboratively with all relevant stakeholders to bring to the world two medical breakthroughs. In doing so we have moved at the speed of science complied with the strict regulatory processes and relied on our scientists’ expertise and manufacturing prowess.”

There is little question that the company ripped a scientific home run in responding rapidly to meet the medical needs created by the pandemic. It used artificial intelligence to track the spread of the virus and find the best places to recruit volunteers for its vaccine trials and deployed rapid drug-screening tools to develop Paxlovid.

Its success with the covid vaccine has raised hopes for a Pfizer vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus a danger to babies and older adults. The company is also moving toward seeking licensure for shots that protect against Lyme disease and hospital infections.

Pfizer had long shunned the vaccine business with its historically modest financial returns. It dropped out of human vaccine production in the late 1960s after the recall of its disastrous measles vaccine which sickened scores of children after exposure to the virus caused unexpected reactions with antibodies stimulated by the shot. The company returned to the field in 2009 when it bought Wyeth which was making a highly effective and uncommonly profitable vaccine against pneumonia and ear infections.

Now Pfizer is a new kind of global powerhouse. In 2021 alone the company hired nearly 2400 people. “We are a household name right now to billions of people” Bourla said in January. “People are trusting the Pfizer vaccines.”

The company’s power worries some vaccinologists who see its growing influence in a realm of medical decision-making traditionally led by independent experts.

During a recent investor call analyst Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets asked whether the world was “kind of walking blindly into recommending boosters” so frequently.

Data from Israel which uses only Pfizer’s vaccine and has provided most of the studies that have led to vaccination booster recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that third and fourth doses of the mRNA vaccines increase antibody levels that quickly wane again. Added boosters saved some lives in the over-60 population but the data is less clear about the benefit to younger adults.

When President Biden in September 2021 offered boosters to Americans — not long after Bourla had recommended them — Dr. Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a developer of a vaccine for an intestinal virus wondered “Where’s the evidence you are at risk of serious disease when confronted with covid if you are vaccinated and under 50?”

Policies on booster recommendations for different groups are complex and shifting Offit said but the CDC rather than Bourla and Pfizer should be making them.

“We’re being pushed along” he said. “The pharmaceutical companies are acting like public health agencies.”

The finding comes from a large Israeli study that analyzed data on elderly people in care homes who received four shots comparing them to those who only took three. It was conducted during last winter’s coronavirus outbreak which was dominated by the Omicron variant.

The fourth shot of Pfizer’s vaccine slashed the chance of hospitalization for COVID by over 60% and delivered a 34% reduction in chances of infection according to the study which was conducted by Tel Aviv University Ben Gurion University and the Health Ministry. It was published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

“The most important message here is that the fourth dose was protective for the most frail elderly people who are in residential facilities” epidemiologist Prof. Khitam Muhsen of Tel Aviv University one of the study’s authors told The Times of Israel. “Fourth shots reduce hospitalization and death — they’re lifesavers.

“The results are very good and very reassuring especially as before the fourth dose we didn’t know whether it would help especially against Omicron which is so much harder for vaccines to fight as it has so many more mutations than previous variants.”

Muhsen said that the results vindicate Israel’s decision in December to administer fourth doses also known as second boosters before most others around the world did.

“They confirm that the policy adopted by the State of Israel was the correct one” she said. “The decision to vaccinate at-risk populations with the fourth dose was a wise choice that saved a lot of human lives.”

The study covered some 40000 elderly Israelis who live in institutions supervised by the Ministry of Health’s Senior Shield program a task force launched by Israel’s government to oversee the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the country’s geriatric facilities.

It compared 24088 residents of Senior Shield facilities who received a fourth dose of the Pfizer vaccine with 19687 residents who were vaccinated with the first three doses four months or more prior to the follow-up but who chose not to take the fourth shot.

Muhsen commented: “What we learn is that while immunity wanes over time the fourth dose does enhance neutralizing antibodies over and above the impact of the third dose. I strongly recommend that elderly people take the fourth dose.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHJ1bXAtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1hbGFza2EtcmFsbHktMjAyMi030gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90cnVtcC1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLWFsYXNrYS1yYWxseS0yMDIyLTc_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Donald Trump said he is 'not allowed' to say the word 'vaccine',"Former US President Donald Trump speaks during a ""Save America"" in Anchorage Alaska on July 9 2022 Patrick T.

Former President Donald Trump avoided using the word ""vaccine"" when talking about COVID-19 at an Alaska rally.

Trump has previously been booed by his supporters when talking about vaccines.

His endorsement of vaccines has put him at odds with his base.

Former President Donald Trump avoided using the word ""vaccine"" while talking about COVID-19 at a rally in Anchorage Alaska on Saturday.

""We did so much in terms of therapeutics and a word that I'm not allowed to mention"" Trump said.

""But I'm still proud of that word because we did that in nine months and it was supposed to take five years to 12 years. Nobody else could have done it. But I'm not mentioning it in front of my people.""

Trump has often boasted about his administration's handling of COVID-19 and taken credit for the vaccine roll-out.

However his endorsement of vaccines has put him at odds with his base. He has been previously booed at rallies when talking about vaccines such as when he revealed that he got the vaccine booster shot and encouraged his followers to get vaccinated.

Despite Trump's pride in the vaccines vaccine uptake was much lower in Trump-voting counties Axios reported.

Many of the former president's most loyal supporters are skeptical or fiercely opposed to taking the shots.

Republicans in general are far less likely than Democrats to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and are also significantly less concerned about the health impacts of the virus data shows.

Operation Warp Speed the Trump administration initiative to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines as quickly as possible was widely considered to be a success.

However Trump has wrongly taken full credit for the vaccines AP Fact Check noted. While the Moderna vaccine was a major beneficiary of the scheme Pfizer's vaccine was not developed under the government initiative.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

With the 2021-2022 Virginia athletics season officially completed we enter the college sports offseason optimistic for things to come for the Cavaliers next season. But with the fall seasons still a couple of months away we have time to take a look back at some of the incredible athletic accomplishments achieved by UVA student athletes during the 2021-2022 sports year in a series called Highlight Hoos.

So far we've covered Diana Ordóñez (Virginia women's soccer) Mia Barnett (Virginia cross country and track & field) Leo Afonso (Virginia men's soccer) Brooklyn Borum (Virginia volleyball) and Amber Ezechiels (Virginia field hockey).

Today we take a look at the last year of impressive accomplishments of the Virginia swimming dynamic duo of Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass representing both UVA and Team USA.

Olympic Trials - June 2021

Traveling back to just over a year ago this was a moment both Kate Douglass and Alex Walsh catapulted themselves to the national spotlight. As the reigning 2021 NCAA national champions the two Wahoo swimmers set their sights on the Tokyo Olympics.

Both swimmers participated in the 200-meter individual medley at the Olympic Trials in Omaha Nebraska. After solid performances in the heats and semifinals on June 15th Douglass and Walsh were in good positions for the final race where the top two swimmers earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.

The final event was a nail-biter to say the least. After the first 50 meters Alex Walsh was in fourth place and Kate Douglass was in second. Walsh used a strong backstroke and breaststroke leg to take the lead at 150 meters while Douglass had fallen to third place. In the final 50 meters Douglass used a strong freestyle to catch up. Walsh finished first with a time of 2:09.30 and Douglass finished two hundredths of a second behind her for second place. She edged out Madisyn Cox by two hundredths of a second as well showing how an infinitesimal margin can mean the difference between joy and heartbreak in swimming. Walsh and Douglass were in Cox was out.

While both Douglass and Walsh qualified for the Olympic Trials in other events they were not in the top two finishers of those races which meant their one shot at an Olympic medal in Tokyo would be in the 200 IM.

Tokyo Olympics - July 2021

Douglass and Walsh had become Olympians for the first time but their work wasn’t done yet. The 200 IM race had a similar structure with heats semifinals and then the final race with the top eight swimmers. Kate Douglass was seeded first heading into the finals and Alex Walsh was seeded third.

The 200 IM once again proved to be a thriller with swimmers changing places throughout the race and no clear winner until they touched the wall. Walsh and Douglass stuck with the pack in the first 50 meters and then Alex Walsh made her move during the backstroke and breaststroke as she did in the trials. In the freestyle lap four swimmers were neck and neck for the three medals. Walsh and Japan’s Yui Ohashi battled it out in lanes three and two respectively with Ohashi taking the victory by .13 seconds and Walsh taking second. Kate Douglass used a strong finish to beat Great Britain’s Abbie Wood by .09 securing the bronze medal. The UVA teammates embraced in the pool after securing the silver and bronze medals and cementing their names in USA Swimming history.

NCAA regular season - November 2021 - January 2022

Back at the collegiate level both swimmers showed why they were Olympians. With matching Olympic rings tattoos Douglass and Walsh dominated the regular season. In the six meets Douglass and Walsh swam in Walsh won or was part of 18 winning events and Douglass won or was part of 20 winning events. While a few of these races are counted twice as Douglass and Walsh dominated in relays a lot of these were individual victories which helped propel the women’s swim team to a dominant regular season.

15th FINA Short Course World Championships - December 2021

Kate Douglass attended the 2021 FINA Short Course World Championships in Abu Dhabi and had a successful performance with two gold medals two silver medals and a bronze medal. She took home gold in the 200-meter freestyle relay and 400-meter freestyle relay. After swimming in the heats she also earned silver medals in the women’s 200-meter medley relay and the mixed 200-meter medley relay. Finally Douglass won bronze in the 200-meter individual medley.

ACC Championships - February 2022

Virginia won its third-straight ACC Championship in February and its two biggest stars shined bright at the start of the postseason.

Alex Walsh won three individual events: the 200-yard individual medley the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard breaststroke. She set UVA and ACC records with the 200 breast as well as a UVA record on the 200 free. Walsh also was part of the winning 400 medley relay 400 freestyle relay and 800 freestyle relay. Virginia’s 400-yard medley relay team broke an NCAA US Open (fastest time in the U.S) and American (fastest time by an American) record. All of these accomplishments led to Walsh being named the ACC Women’s Most Valuable Swimmer in the meet.

Kate Douglass earned Women’s Swimmer of the Year honors in the ACC for her performance during the regular season but she also excelled at the ACC championships. She won individual titles in the 50 freestyle 100 freestyle and 100 butterfly and also won four relays. She was part of the record-breaking 400 medley relay with Walsh and she also contributed to the NCAA US Open and American record time in the 200 medley relay and 200 free relay. Finally Douglass also was victorious in the 400 free relay.

Women’s NCAA Championships - March 2022

Walsh and Douglass were the driving force behind Virginia’s second consecutive national championship. They both won three individual events and joined forces to win three relays and then Douglass earned a relay win in the 200 medley relay and Walsh came in second in the 800 free relay.

In the 400 medley relay and the 400 free relay that included both Douglass and Walsh Virginia set NCAA US Open and American records. The 400 medley relay record actually tied the record from the ACC Championships made by the exact same group. They also won the 200 free relay together.

Douglass set NCAA US Open and American records in both the 50 freestyle and 200 breaststroke at the national championships and she set an American record in the 100 fly. In the seven total events she participated in she won all seven and broke a record in five of them. Even more impressively she set American records in three events that were each different strokes and different distances a feat never before accomplished at the NCAA Championships.

Walsh took home the individual title for the 200 IM the 400 IM and the 200 fly in her accomplished meet including an NCAA US Open and American record in the 200 IM. She won six out of the seven events she participated in.

Honda Sport Award - April 2022

The Honda Sport Award is given to the top female athlete in 12 different sports and then the winner is eligible to win the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year award. Both Kate Douglass and Alex Walsh were named among the four finalists for the award along with Katharine Berkoff and Tarrin Gilliland. Douglass ended up winning the award giving her the title of the best female collegiate swimmer.

U.S. International Team Trials - April 2022

The Phillips 66 International Team Trials took place at the end of April in Greensboro North Carolina and was the selection meet for the 2022 FINA World Championships. Alex Walsh competed in three events and Kate Douglass competed in four after choosing to skip two events she could have swam due to meet scheduling.

Alex Walsh set a US Open record with a time of 2:07.84 in the 200 IM and won gold guaranteeing her a spot on the FINA World Championship team. She also came in fifth in the 100 breaststroke and sixth in the 200 freestyle.

Kate Douglass placed second in the 200 breaststroke to earn her roster spot and also finished fourth in the 100 butterfly and fifth in the 50 freestyle showing how versatile of a swimmer she can be yet again.

19th FINA World Championships - June 2022

A few weeks ago Douglass and Walsh finished competing for Team USA in Budapest Hungary for the FINA World Championships the biggest swim meet in non-Olympic years.

Douglass earned a bronze medal in the 200 breaststroke finishing behind USA teammate Lilly King and Australia's Jenna Strauch. She also added a bronze medal in the 400 freestyle relay along with teammates Torri Huske Erika Brown and Claire Curzan. She swam in the heats of the 400 mixed freestyle relay which ultimately won a bronze medal so she can add that to her medal haul as well.

Walsh set a personal best in her signature race of the 200 IM with a time of 2:07.13 and took home the gold medal at the World Championships. She also swam in the heats for the 800 freestyle relay and the 400 medley relay which both ended up winning gold so Walsh walked away with three gold medals from the meet.

The 160000-square-foot Pinnacle Bank Sports Complex is being planned for a site just off Interstate 80 at the U.S. Highway 281 interchange. The first phase will feature six indoor courts for basketball and volleyball and batting cages for baseball though it’s being designed with expansion in mind.

About $10 million has been raised locally with another $10 million being sought statewide according to Johnny Dorn vice president of Cresa a real estate firm working on the project who is a former University of Nebraska-Lincoln baseball player.

Youth sports market

The goal of the sports complex is to attract regional tournaments to Grand Island and tap into a national market for youth sports that has grown to a $19 billion-a-year industry.

“Each time a parent has to travel for their child’s sporting event or practice that money leaves Hall County” said Tino Martinez president of the board of the nonprofit Pinnacle Bank Sports Complex.

“We want to invest here in Hall County to keep the kids and the money locally” said Martinez who also coaches basketball at Grand Island Central Catholic High School.

A state-of-the-art training center for local athletes would also allow parents in the area to avoid long drives to volleyball and basketball training centers in Lincoln according to Kristin Maser who drove two daughters back and- forth to the Capital City for club volleyball.

“We put a lot of miles on our car over the last eight years” Maser said. “It would just be nice if the kids from Grand Island would have the opportunity to have really good training and play locally here.”

The Grand Island facility could also be used for dance wrestling cheerleading yoga/exercise classes and other community events.

‘Shovel ready’ funds

Two large outdoor complexes for youth sports tournaments have broken ground recently in the Omaha area.

The Nebraska Multi-Sports Complex in La Vista and the MD West ONE Sports Complex in Valley were major recipients recently of state grants through the state’s “shovel-ready” program designed to help projects by nonprofit organizations disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding for the program came from the Biden Administration’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA).

The La Vista project received $12.7 million while the Valley complex got $3.8 million. A field house planned by the Columbus Community Hospital also got $12.7 million.

That compares to just under $116000 for the Grand Island sports center forcing backers there to explore other sources of funding.

Recently Grand Island officials including Mayor Roger Steele toured the UBT Sports Complex in Elkhorn and the Iowa West Field House in Council Bluffs Iowa to better understand what works and what doesn’t in such facilities.

Dorn said they learned that while improving practice and tournament facilities for local youth athletes is critical hosting multi-team regional tournaments is what brings greater revenue.

Economic impact

According to Dave Taylor of the Grand Island Area Economic Development the Pinnacle Bank Sports Complex has the potential to generate $4 million to $6 million per year in new visitor spending which includes overnight stays and meals.

The mayor said the sports complex will also be an ideal “new gateway development” for Grand Island providing a stronger link between I-80 and the city of 51000.

Dorn said that it’s possible that ground could be broken for the facility yet this year but spring 2023 is probably more realistic. He said no state or county funds are being sought for the project but said it is possible that sales taxes generated by new development in the immediate area of the Sports Complex could be tapped to help finance the facility.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Carlson suggested that the Department of Natural Resources be moved up to northern Minnesota.

It is not at all clear how fleshed out his idea was but the general idea makes sense. There are around 3000 DNR employees in the Twin Cities area while most of the lakes rivers streams wetlands and forests are in northern Minnesota.

Of course there are many little DNR stations all over northern Minnesota. It just makes sense though that their supervisors also live up here for closer on-site management.

It also makes sense in terms of an equitable distribution of the state’s employees if they are as spread around the state as the taxpayers are.

For example it would make sense if the Division of Land and Minerals was located in Hibbing. The Division of Fish and Wildlife was located in the lake country of Brainerd and the Division of Forestry was located in Bemidji. Certainly the city of Bemidji is sizeable enough of a city to host them.

A reorientation of divisions of this magnitude should probably be thought of as a 20-year plan. It would take time for the agency to develop its planning time to plan for office building space time for employees to adjust to living at the other end of the state.

When new employees are hired it would be with the understanding that they would soon be transferred up north to a specific location. Older employees would have time to plan their retirement or their transfer to positions remaining in the Twin Cities.

RELATED: Quick tips on Pioneer letter to the editor submissions

Relocations would begin in the first five-year period depending on which northern communities are most able and most willing to host the move — along with taking into account the speed and success of planning within each division.

The 20-year plan would need a dedicated northern advocate who would organize support among Iron Range politicos and facilitate discussions with DNR and administration personnel.

That’s why it’s so strange that Texas crude producers are facing a sand shortage of more than 1 million tons and prices that have jumped 150%.

Frack sand which gets blasted through shale rocks to unlock oil and natural gas is averaging $55 a ton up from $22 at the end of 2021 data from energy-research firm Lium show. Demand is climbing as oil explorers turn the taps back on after Covid-driven cutbacks.

But like in so many pockets of the economy the recovery is sparking a mismatch. Sand suppliers have seen disruptions labor shortages and trucking bottlenecks. The chief executive officer of U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. the largest publicly traded frack-sand miner has dubbed the tight market “sandemonium” and said his company is sold out.

That’s where Steve Brock and his upstart sand-mining operation Nomad Proppant come in. Since the early days of the shale revolution more than a decade ago fracking operators have relied on mined sand that’s delivered to their sites by truck - across distances as long as 100 miles. Brock Nomad’s chief commercial officer wants to turn that model on its head.

Advertisement

His idea: Why not just use the sand that’s right under your feet?

Nomad has developed machinery that can go directly to the frack wells (give or take 10 to 20 miles) vastly reducing the burden of freight costs and the time-consuming process of trucking.

“We’re not brain surgeons here - all we’re doing is finding the best spots and washing and delivering the sand” said Brock 34. “Frankly that it took us this long to get here is pretty wild.”

Brock left his job at Covia one of the world’s biggest frack-sand miners in February 2020 to help start Nomad. It launched its first mobile sand mine in West Texas last month after the huge surge in prices. He calls the timing “very lucky.”

It’s sand scarcity even more than price that’s the big hurdle for oil drillers. Irving-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co. the Permian’s biggest producer said it expected oil and natural gas output would take a hit last quarter because of sand issues. Things are so extreme that some oil companies are shipping sand in by train from Wisconsin at almost double the cost.

Whether Nomad and rivals like Hi-Crush Inc. one of the original frack-sand pioneers that’s now also introduced mobile units can help solve the sand squeeze could play a significant role in the global energy markets.

While drillers in the Permian have shown restraint in ramping up oil production the last thing the world needs is for sand problems to place even more limitations on their output. The U.S. the world’s top oil producer and among the biggest liquefied natural gas exporters has become an even more important supplier in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s struggles to meet production targets. Meanwhile deficits in energy supplies - and the resulting surge in prices - are among the biggest drivers of the dramatic rise in inflation across the planet.

“You cannot take sand for granted” said Chris Wright CEO of Liberty Energy Inc. the second-biggest frack-services provider. Without enough “I’m quite concerned about global balances for oil gas and food - those are intimately tied.”

Total U.S. demand for frack sand is currently about 5% higher than the roughly 25 million tons being produced according to industry consultant Enverus which estimates a shortfall of roughly 1.3 million tons.

Brock of Nomad says that by carving into the earth about 15 feet deep across 40 acres one of his mobile units can produce about 1 million tons. And since the units are mobile Nomad doesn’t need to limit itself to the huge dusty dunes of traditional mines.

“We can find deposits that previously wouldn’t make sense if you thought you’re stationary because maybe this deposit only has 3 million tons” Brock said. “That can give me two years’ worth of work and then I can move over 2 miles to the next spot.”

The rebound for sand prices is emblematic of the inflation spreading across the Permian. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase estimate costs for U.S. shale companies are soaring at a rate of 25% or almost triple the headline inflation rate.

A lot of that’s driven by shortages. There aren’t enough steel pipes not enough drilling rigs not enough bulldozers - and critically not enough people. Occidental Petroleum Corp. CEO Vicki Hollub has said worker shortages along with supply-chain snarls explain some of why US oil drillers aren’t significantly expanding production.

Turning sand into a mobile business tackles another area of supply-chain bottlenecks: trucking.

Advertisement

Because Nomad can dig up sand close to where it’s needed a single 18-wheeler can make multiple trips back and forth from the mobile mine to the well in one day. That means as few as 10 trucks total are needed down from the roughly 70 used in traditional deliveries from mines. That brings a significant drop in freight costs. But even more critically in the Permian where labor is extremely tight and the unemployment rate is hovering just above 3% it means needing fewer truck drivers.

As Brock puts it: “You solve that issue you solve a lot of problems.”

Devon Energy Corp. one of the region’s biggest explorers is among those already turning to mobile mines. The company is working with Hi-Crush to develop its unit. The pilot project will sit on a roughly 5-acre pad site and account for a quarter of Devon’s total sand needs in the Delaware Basin in the western half of the Permian.

“It gives us a sense of security with our supply” said John Raines vice president of Devon’s Delaware Basin business unit.

Advertisement

It’s also helping to spark a revival for companies like Hi-Crush which went into bankruptcy during the sand-bust days of 2020.

“It’s definitely our growth engine” Hi-Crush CEO Dirk Hallen said of the company’s three mobile units and plans to roll out more later this year. With fracking operators now consuming almost three times as much sand each month as they did five years ago Hallen said demand is likely to stay strong.

And Brock of Nomad points out that mobile units will be able to meet demand faster than traditional mines because not having to truck as far also means eliminating the time-consuming step of drying.

After sand is dug up it gets washed and then left to air dry in piles for a few days. At stationary mines it then gets blasted in giant drying machines. That way when trucks are loaded they’re carrying as much sand as possible. But Brock says since his trucks only go a short distance he can skip the machine drying eliminating pricey equipment.

The cost savings were a key part of Nomad’s pitch as the company was getting off the ground during the depths of the pandemic when Brock says prices were so low that sand was a “four-letter word” and not just literally.

“When you get crunched and you need to start saving some money” he said “you start getting creative.”

History of The Arena

Under the leadership of then-Wolfpack coach Jim Valvano the concept for a new basketball arena to replace the Wolfpack’s longstanding residence Reynolds Coliseum originally surfaced in the 1980s. The NCSU Trustees authorized the construction of a 23000-seat arena in 1989.

The North Carolina General Assembly established the Centennial Authority in 1995 to serve as the arena’s governing body. State appropriations neighborhood donations and university fundraising were used to pay for the project. The then-Hartford Whalers who would later change their name to the Carolina Hurricanes agreed to relocate in 1997 when the Centennial Authority refocused the project to become a multi-use arena.

An estimated $158 million in construction costs were incurred between that year and 1999 with the majority of the money coming from a levy on hotels and restaurants. The state of North Carolina contributed $18 million while the Hurricanes agreed to pay $60 million of the price.

The Hurricanes received operational management of the facility as part of the agreement. After a protracted hunt for a corporate sponsor the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (or ESA)—known as such from 1999 to 2002—was renamed the RBC Center. For an estimated $80 million RBC Bank the Royal Bank of Canada’s US business purchased the 20-year naming rights.

PNC Financial Services purchased RBC Bank’s US assets on June 19 2011 and in anticipation of regulatory agency clearance the company also acquired the name rights to the arena.

A name change to PNC Arena was authorized by the arena’s landlord Centennial Authority on December 15 2011. The new name became official on March 15 2012. More than 400 personnel are on duty at PNC Arena for security and refreshments on an average hockey day.

The Tree Hill High School Ravens played in an NCHSAA championship game there in a season four episode of The CW’s One Tree Hill which also featured the arena in fictitious media. In a College Jeopardy episode from 2005 the venue was also used for game shows. On October 29 1999 the Hurricanes and New Jersey Devils played in Raleigh’s inaugural NHL game. This was the building’s opening night.

The Hurricanes hosted the Devils in games 3 4 and 6 of the 2001 Stanley Cup Playoffs. However the Hurricanes fell to the Devils in game 6. This was the first playoff series to be played in the Entertainment and Sports Arena.

The 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs and Finals were held in the ESA (then known as the RBC Center) however the Hurricanes fell short in the championship game.

In Loving Memory ~

It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Michael (Mike) Robert Procter 79 of 150 Mile House BC on February 6 2024.

He moved on to working in the industrial sector and became highly skilled in his trade. High in demand he worked in the construction of new sawmills and in various plants all throughout BC. Later he worked at several local sawmills and contracted throughout the area.

Over all those years Mike made many friendships that endured for the rest of his life.

He went on to marry Cheryl Midnight and they had two children Chris and Jody.

Mike had a penchant for fast cars nice trucks and fine guns. He enjoyed hunting fishing and classic car restoration. He traveled to horse shows throughout BC AB and briefly the US winning many trophies with their champion Arabian show horse Star-Sirza.

In the mid-80's Mike met his life partner Betty Johnson and in the 90's they settled in the 150 Mile area. Mike and 2 good friends purchased the 150 Mile Hotel a rich piece of history in the Cariboo. Together they revived it into the 150 Mile Roadhouse & Pub. For years the establishment was a notable and lively gathering place where many good times were had.

Mike was a hardworking generous man who was always willing to help his friends and family.

He had a great sense of humour he was always up to something and he was entertaining to be around. Throughout his life he was fortunate to have made many friends many acquaintances and to have many great stories to tell. Mike will be sorely missed by his family and friends.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

The group dubbed ""Liberty Alliance"" says it is ""committed to fighting back against the Woke agenda that is permeating all across Missouri.""

""The first step in fighting back is uncovering their crazy ideas – from Critical Race Theory to grooming toddlers with sexually explicit books"" the organization states on its website. ""That is why we have officially launched the Woke Heat Map – an interactive tool designed to expose the insane actions of the radical Left. This map will alert Missourians of craziness happening in their own communities.""

As of this writing the group has cataloged twelve individual instances of wokeness. One of the map's ""hotspots"" links to an article about a pro-life display at Saint Louis University that was reportedly vandalized. Another directs users to a tweet by U.S. Senate candidate Eric Schmitt who expressed concern over a school district in Arnold using a diagram of a ""Genderbread Person"" to break down the differences between gender identity gender expression biological sex sexual attraction and romantic attraction.

Liberty Alliance's map isn't the first of its kind. Over the years numerous right-wing groups have created rankings watchlists and cluster maps to keep track of the left's alleged influence in healthcare and education as well as Corporate America.

Last October Salon reported on a custom Google map created by trans activist Erin Reed that provides those seeking hormone replacement therapy with the names and locations of nearly 800 informed consent clinics throughout the country. By February of that year Reed told Salon her map was repurposed by anti-trans activist Alix Aharon as a resource for organizing protests against doctors who provide gender-affirming care. That new map called ""The Gender Mapper"" was quickly taken down over apparent copyright infringement. However a new one has since appeared in its place cataloging roughly 200 clinics in total.

On its website The Gender Mapper accuses ""Big Gender"" of testing ""experimental medication"" on ""confused and vulnerable children.""

""GenderMapper volunteers work in secret around the world to collate evidence and document what is occurring"" the site adds. ""Gendermapper volunteers are unsung [sic] heros- and data is our truth.""

Right-wing groups have also sought to crack down on left-wing ""indoctrination"" on college campuses.

Notable among them is Turning Point USA a conservative youth advocacy group which runs a ""Professor Watchlist"" designed to keep right-wing students abreast of ""college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.""

""The project"" its website says ""is comprised of published news stories detailing instances of bias propaganda or speech infringement on college campuses.""

The site allows users to submit tips and search for professors by name or university. Some professors on the list include activist Angela Davis linguist Noam Chomsky author Ibram X. Kendi and former FBI Director James Comey. As of 2016 there were roughly 200 academics on the list.

Alliance Defending Freedom has its ""Viewpoint Diversity Score"" a 50-company index that ""evaluates corporate policies practices and activities to determine whether companies respect their stakeholders' freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief as a standard part of doing business."" The list specifically breaks down each company's support of free speech in the market the workplace and the public square analyzing everything from political giving to DE&I (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) policies.

On the index companies like Facebook and Meta – which face baseless accusations of anti-conservative bias – have notably lower scores than most. None of the firms included on the list score higher than a 35 out of 100.

""The results of our inaugural Business Index reveal that there is much work to be done. Company scores ranged between 2% and 35% with the average overall score an abysmal 12%"" wrote Jeremy Tedesco senior vice president of corporate engagement for ADF in The Wall Street Journal.

The unprecedented leak to the Guardian of more than 124000 documents – known as the Uber files – lays bare the ethically questionable practices that fuelled the company’s transformation into one of Silicon Valley’s most famous exports.

The leak spans a five-year period when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick who tried to force the cab-hailing service into cities around the world even if that meant breaching laws and taxi regulations.

During the fierce global backlash the data shows how Uber tried to shore up support by discreetly courting prime ministers presidents billionaires oligarchs and media barons.

Leaked messages suggest Uber executives were at the same time under no illusions about the company’s law-breaking with one executive joking they had become “pirates” and another conceding: “We’re just fucking illegal.”

On Monday Mark MacGann Uber’s former chief lobbyist for Europe the Middle East and Africa came forward to identify himself as the source of the leaked data. “It is my duty to speak up and help governments and parliamentarians right some fundamental wrongs” he said. “Morally I had no choice in the matter.”

The cache of files which span 2013 to 2017 includes more than 83000 emails iMessages and WhatsApp messages including often frank and unvarnished communications between Kalanick and his top team of executives.

Q&A What are the Uber files? Show The Uber files is a global investigation based on a trove of 124000 documents that were leaked to the Guardian by Mark MacGann Uber's former chief lobbyist in Europe the Middle East and Africa. The data consist of emails iMessages and WhatsApp exchanges between the Silicon Valley giant's most senior executives as well as memos presentations notebooks briefing papers and invoices. The leaked records cover 40 countries and span 2013 to 2017 the period in which Uber was aggressively expanding across the world. They reveal how the company broke the law duped police and regulators exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments across the world. To facilitate a global investigation in the public interest the Guardian shared the data with 180 journalists in 29 countries via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The investigation was managed and led by the Guardian with the ICIJ. In a statement Uber said: ""We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.""

In one exchange Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry. “I think it’s worth it” he shot back. “Violence guarantee[s] success.”

In a statement Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion he was involved in such activity would be completely false.

The leak also contains texts between Kalanick and Emmanuel Macron who secretly helped the company in France when he was economy minister allowing Uber frequent and direct access to him and his staff.

Macron the French president appears to have gone to extraordinary lengths to help Uber even telling the company he had brokered a secret “deal” with its opponents in the French cabinet.

Privately Uber executives expressed barely disguised disdain for other elected officials who were less receptive to the company’s business model.

After the German chancellor Olaf Scholz who was mayor of Hamburg at the time pushed back against Uber lobbyists and insisted on paying drivers a minimum wage an executive told colleagues he was “a real comedian”.

When the then US vice-president Joe Biden a supporter of Uber at the time was late to a meeting with the company at the World Economic Forum at Davos Kalanick texted a colleague: “I’ve had my people let him know that every minute late he is is one less minute he will have with me.”

After meeting Kalanick Biden appears to have amended his prepared speech at Davos to refer to a CEO whose company would give millions of workers “freedom to work as many hours as they wish manage their own lives as they wish”.

The Guardian led a global investigation into the leaked Uber files sharing the data with media organisations around the world via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). More than 180 journalists at 40 media outlets including Le Monde Washington Post and the BBC will in the coming days publish a series of investigative reports about the tech giant.

In a statement responding to the leak Uber admitted to “mistakes and missteps” but said it had been transformed since 2017 under the leadership of its current chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi.

“We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values” it said. “Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”

Kalanick’s spokesperson said Uber’s expansion initiatives were “led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal policy and compliance groups”.

‘Embrace the chaos’

The leaked documents pull back the curtains on the methods Uber used to lay the foundations for its empire. One of the world’s largest work platforms Uber is now a $43bn (£36bn) company making approximately 19m journeys a day.

The files cover Uber’s operations across 40 countries during a period in which the company became a global behemoth bulldozing its cab-hailing service into many of the cities in which it still operates today.

From Moscow to Johannesburg bankrolled with unprecedented venture capital funding Uber heavily subsidised journeys seducing drivers and passengers on to the app with incentives and pricing models that would not be sustainable.

Uber undercut established taxi and cab markets and put pressure on governments to rewrite laws to help pave the way for an app-based gig-economy model of work that has since proliferated across the world.

In a bid to quell the fierce backlash against the company and win changes to taxi and labour laws Uber planned to spend an extraordinary $90m in 2016 on lobbying and public relations one document suggests.

Its strategy often involved going over the heads of city mayors and transport authorities and straight to the seat of power.

In addition to meeting Biden at Davos Uber executives met face-to-face with Macron the Irish prime minister Enda Kenny the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and George Osborne the UK’s chancellor at the time. A note from the meeting portrayed Osborne as a “strong advocate”.

In a statement Osborne said it was the explicit policy of the government at the time to meet with global tech firms and “persuade them to invest in Britain and create jobs here”.

While the Davos sitdown with Osborne was declared the data reveals that six UK Tory cabinet ministers had meetings with Uber that were not disclosed. It is unclear if the meetings should have been declared exposing confusion around how UK lobbying rules are applied.

The documents indicate Uber was adept at finding unofficial routes to power applying influence through friends or intermediaries or seeking out encounters with politicians at which aides and officials were not present.

It enlisted the backing of powerful figures in places such as Russia Italy and Germany by offering them prized financial stakes in the startup and turning them into “strategic investors”.

And in a bid to shape policy debates it paid prominent academics hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce research that supported the company’s claims about the benefits of its economic model.

Despite a well-financed and dogged lobbying operation Uber’s efforts had mixed results. In some places Uber succeeded in persuading governments to rewrite laws with lasting effects. But elsewhere the company found itself blocked by entrenched taxi industries outgunned by local cab-hailing rivals or opposed by leftwing politicians who simply refused to budge.

When faced with opposition Uber sought to turn it to its advantage seizing upon it to fuel the narrative its technology was disrupting antiquated transport systems and urging governments to reform their laws.

As Uber launched across India Kalanick’s top executive in Asia urged managers to focus on driving growth even when “fires start to burn”. “Know this is a normal part of Uber’s business” he said. “Embrace the chaos. It means you’re doing something meaningful.”

Kalanick appeared to put that ethos into practice in January 2016 when Uber’s attempts to upend markets in Europe led to angry protests in Belgium Spain Italy and France from taxi drivers who feared for their livelihoods.

Amid taxi strikes and riots in Paris Kalanick ordered French executives to retaliate by encouraging Uber drivers to stage a counter-protest with mass civil disobedience.

Warned that doing so risked putting Uber drivers at risk of attacks from “extreme right thugs” who had infiltrated the taxi protests and were “spoiling for a fight” Kalanick appeared to urge his team to press ahead regardless. “I think it’s worth it” he said. “Violence guarantee[s] success. And these guys must be resisted no? Agreed that right place and time must be thought out.”

The decision to send Uber drivers into potentially volatile protests despite the risks was consistent with what one senior former executive told the Guardian was a strategy of “weaponising” drivers and exploiting violence against them to “keep the controversy burning”.

It was a playbook that leaked emails suggest was repeated in Italy Belgium Spain Switzerland and the Netherlands.

When masked men reported to be angry taxi drivers turned on Uber drivers with knuckle-dusters and a hammer in Amsterdam in March 2015 Uber staffers sought to turn it to their advantage to win concessions from the Dutch government.

Driver victims were encouraged to file police reports which were shared with De Telegraaf the leading Dutch daily newspaper. They “will be published without our fingerprint on the front page tomorrow” one manager wrote. “We keep the violence narrative going for a few days before we offer the solution.”

Kalanick’s spokesperson questioned the authenticity of some documents. She said Kalanick “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion that he was involved in such activity would be “completely false”.

Uber’s spokesperson also acknowledged past mistakes in the company’s treatment of drivers but said no one including Kalanick wanted violence against Uber drivers. “There is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today” she said. “But one thing we do know and feel strongly about is that no one at Uber has ever been happy about violence against a driver.”

The ‘kill switch’

Uber drivers were undoubtedly the target of vicious assaults and sometimes murders by furious taxi drivers. And the cab-hailing app in some countries found itself battling entrenched and monopolised taxi fleets with cosy relationships with city authorities. Uber often characterised its opponents in the regulated taxi markets as operating a “cartel”.

However privately Uber executives and staffers appear to have been in little doubt about the often rogue nature of their own operation.



In internal emails staff referred to Uber’s “other than legal status” or other forms of active non-compliance with regulations in countries including Turkey South Africa Spain the Czech Republic Sweden France Germany and Russia.



One senior executive wrote in an email: “We are not legal in many countries we should avoid making antagonistic statements.” Commenting on the tactics the company was prepared to deploy to “avoid enforcement” another executive wrote: “We have officially become pirates.”

Nairi Hourdajian Uber’s head of global communications put it even more bluntly in a message to a colleague in 2014 amid efforts to shut the company down in Thailand and India: “Sometimes we have problems because well we’re just fucking illegal.” Contacted by the Guardian Hourdajian declined to comment.

Kalanick’s spokesperson accused reporters of “pressing its false agenda” that he had “directed illegal or improper conduct”.

Uber’s spokesperson said that when it started “ridesharing regulations did not exist anywhere in the world” and transport laws were outdated for a smartphone era.

Across the world police transport officials and regulatory agencies sought to clamp down on Uber. In some cities officials downloaded the app and hailed rides so they could crack down on unlicensed taxi journeys fining Uber drivers and impounding their cars. Uber offices in dozens of countries were repeatedly raided by authorities.

Against this backdrop Uber developed sophisticated methods to thwart law enforcement. One was known internally at Uber as a “kill switch”. When an Uber office was raided executives at the company frantically sent out instructions to IT staff to cut off access to the company’s main data systems preventing authorities from gathering evidence.

The leaked files suggest the technique signed off by Uber’s lawyers was deployed at least 12 times during raids in France the Netherlands Belgium India Hungary and Romania.

Kalanick’s spokesperson said such “kill switch” protocols were common business practice and not designed to obstruct justice. She said the protocols which did not delete data were vetted and approved by Uber’s legal department and the former Uber CEO was never charged in relation to obstruction of justice or a related offence.

Uber’s spokesperson said its kill switch software “should never have been used to thwart legitimate regulatory action” and it had stopped using the system in 2017 when Khosrowshahi replaced Kalanick as CEO.

Another executive the leaked files suggest was involved in kill switch protocols was Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty who ran Uber’s operations in western Europe. He now runs Uber Eats and sits on the company’s 11-strong executive team.

Gore-Coty said in a statement he regretted “some of the tactics used to get regulatory reform for ridesharing in the early days”. Looking back he said: “I was young and inexperienced and too often took direction from superiors with questionable ethics.”

Politicians now also face questions about whether they took direction from Uber executives.

When a French police official in 2015 appeared to ban one of Uber’s services in Marseille MacGann Uber’s chief lobbyist in Europe the Middle East and Africa turned to Uber’s ally in the French cabinet.

“I will look at this personally” Macron texted back. “At this point let’s stay calm.”

Key features of the Act include the establishment of (i) a system to ensure stable supplies of critical materials (ii) a system to ensure stable provision of services using critical infrastructure (iii) a system that supports the development of critical technologies and (iv) a secret patent system. The Act will enter into force on or before February 18 2023.2

Overview of the new Act

Purpose of the Act and establishment of a basic policy

The Act consists of seven chapters with 99 articles and several supplementary provisions. Its purpose is “to promote economic measures related to ensuring national security comprehensively and effectively” by establishing the four systems explained below “as economic measures to ensure national security.” It also mandates the formulation of “a basic policy relating to the promotion of national security through integrated economic measures.”3 Please note that the Act cautiously avoids using the term “economic security” and instead declares as its purpose the promotion of economic measures aimed at ensuring national security.

The Act requires the government to approve a basic policy (“Basic Policy”) on foundational matters related to the implementation of integrated economic measures and publish it without delay.4 The Prime Minister if necessary may require the submission of documents providing information explanations and opinions to the heads of the relevant ministries/agencies.5 The Prime Minister may require reporting on implemented measures.6 Additionally the Act includes a provision stating that regulatory measures shall be taken under the Act “to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure national security in light of their impact on economic activities.”7

System ensuring stable supplies of critical materials

The Act establishes several support measures that aim to ensure stable supplies of materials that significantly affect the existence ordinary lives and economic activities of the Japanese public.8

First the government will solicit expert opinions and formulate basic guidelines on ensuring stable supplies of specified critical materials (“stable supply guidelines”) based on the basic policy. The government is then required to publish the stable supply guidelines without delay after cabinet approval is granted. Under the Act “specified critical materials” are defined as “materials indispensable to the existence and relied upon for the lives and economic activities of the Japanese public that are procured or manufactured from raw materials procured largely from foreign countries and with regard to which the government acknowledges that ensuring a stable supply is particularly necessary to prevent the impairment of national security by external activities.”9 Although a cabinet ordinance will further specify each “specified critical material” an expert meeting on the Act cited pharmaceutical products and semiconductors as examples. One important point to note is that “raw materials components facilities equipment devices and programs” (“raw materials etc.”) are excluded from the definition of “specified critical materials” under the Act and thus the specifications will be made at a product level. Having said this the support measures cover both products and raw materials etc.

After the designation of “specified critical materials” by cabinet ordinance the ministers responsible for these materials will formulate implementation policies to ensure stable supplies of them.10 It is expected that specific support measures and their duration will be included in the implementation policies.11

An individual or a company that intends to secure stable supplies of specified critical materials or raw materials etc. may prepare a “secure supply plan” that includes the building of new production facilities diversification of supply sources stockpiling development of production technologies and/or development of alternative materials etc. The secure supply plan must then be submitted to and certified by the responsible minister.12 After certification the individual or company will be eligible for various support measures including (i) subsidies for the above activities13 (ii) interest subsidies for financial institutions that grant loans to the individual or company14 (iii) the provision of funds to specified financial institutions by the Japan Finance Corporation (so-called “two-step loans”)15 (iv) the purchase of shares of a company newly established by a small or medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) that will engage in the above activities16 and (v) granting credit insurance to SMEs.17

Moreover where the minister responsible for a specified critical material l has difficulty ensuring a stable supply of it through the above measures the minister may designate the material a “specified critical material requiring special measures” and take necessary measures including stockpiling.18 The minister may then transfer lend or otherwise make these materials available at prices lower than current market prices where the minister finds it particularly necessary. The minister may do so where prices for the relevant materials have increased significantly as a result of existing or prospective supply shortages caused by external actions.19 The minister may also require other ministers to investigate the imposition of anti-dumping duties countervailing duties or safeguard measures where the minister finds sufficient evidence of material/serious injury to Japanese industry caused by the importation of subsidized or dumped foreign products or increased importation of these products as a result of unforeseen developments.20

The minister may further request that an individual or entity including a company under the minister’s jurisdiction submit a report or other documentation regarding the status of the production importation sale procurement or storage of the specified critical material or raw material etc.21 The individual or entity receiving the request is required to make its best efforts to respond.22 According to several media reports under the original Act a criminal penalty in the form of a fine not exceeding JPY 300000 (approximately USD 2500) could be imposed on an individual or entity that failed to respond. However due to opposition from ruling party lawmakers and industry groups the penalty was removed and the obligation reduced to the making of best efforts.

Most provisions under this chapter will come into effect within nine months of the official publication of the Act (May 18 2022).23

System ensuring stable provision of services using critical infrastructure

Articles 49 to 59 of the Act provide a preliminary review system for the introduction of critical equipment into critical infrastructure or the entrustment of maintenance or management of critical equipment modeled on the US24 and German25 systems. This is one of the main pillars of the new Act.

The government first formulates basic guidelines relating to ensuring the stable provision of specified social infrastructure services (“stable provision guidelines”). The government is then required to publish the stable provision guidelines without delay after cabinet approval is granted.26 The ministers responsible for “specified social infrastructure businesses”27 will designate individuals meeting criteria established by ministerial order as “specified social infrastructure business operators.” Specified social infrastructure business operators are those who engage in a specified social infrastructure business where the discontinuation or the degradation of the functions of their “specified critical equipment”28 would endanger stable provision of specified social infrastructure services and thereby impair national security and public safety.29 Specified social infrastructure businesses operate in sectors already designated under the Act.30 It is expected that specified social infrastructure business operators will be limited to those whose operations exceed a certain threshold (eg number of users domestic market share etc.) and lack substitutability (eg due to geography the particularities of the business etc.).

A specified social infrastructure business operator is required to file a plan with the minister with jurisdiction over its business prior to introducing specified critical equipment from other business operators or entrusting maintenance or management of critical equipment to other business operators.31 The business operator must then refrain from introducing or entrusting maintenance or management of the critical equipment until 30 days have passed from the day on which the minister receives the plan.32 The minister may extend this period to up to four months from the day on which the minister receives the plan.33 The minister may then issue a recommendation that the filer modify the substance of or discontinue the plan where the minster finds that the specified critical equipment is likely to be used as a means of “specified obstructive conduct”34.35 If the recipient of the recommendation fails to comply with it without a legitimate reason the minister may order the modification or discontinuation of the plan.36 A person that has introduced or entrusted the maintenance or management of specified critical equipment without filing after making a false filing or in violation of a modification or discontinuation order will be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years and/or a fine of not more than JPY one million.37 Overall although the scheme resembles the review of inward direct investment under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act the penalties are slightly lighter because in principle infrastructure business operators are free to introduce equipment and choose suppliers. The new regulations have been introduced strictly for economic security reasons.

The Act is ambiguous on the important matter of how and from what perspective the government will conduct these reviews. However a report from a council meeting that discussed the contents of the draft Act states that these judgments will be based on information regarding suppliers outsourcing contractors equipment supply chains and subcontractors. This recognizes the limitations of specifying equipment critical to national security in advance. The council meeting report also points out that in order to ensure predictability for business operators the government should establish guidelines that describe the basic policies and criteria for the reviews as clearly as possible.

The provisions regarding the designation of specified social infrastructure business operators will come into effect within one year and six months of the official publication of the Act (May 18 2022). The review-related provisions will come into effect within one year and nine months of official publication.38 Please note that Article 52(1) will not apply to a business operator until six months have passed from the day on which it is designated a specified social infrastructure business operator.39

System supporting the development of critical technologies

Articles 60 to 64 establish a system that supports the development of critical technologies.

The government first formulates basic guidelines concerning promotion of the development of specified critical technologies and the appropriate use of outcomes (“technical development guidelines”). The government is then required to publish the technical development guidelines without delay after cabinet approval is granted.40 Specified critical technologies are defined as “technologies that may be critical to the maintenance of future public life and economic activity where unjustifiable use of said technologies information used in their development or failure to stably use them due to external action resulting from dependence on goods or services that make use of such technologies obtained from a foreign country could impair national security and public safety.”41 Specifically the government currently considers space marine quantum and AI technologies to be ” specified critical technologies.”

The ministers responsible for the provision of government resources for the development of specified critical technologies are required to establish and appoint members to a council for each project with the approval of a representative of the project based on the technical development guidelines.42 Members of the council are obliged to make efforts to provide necessary documents explanations and opinions etc.43 They also have a duty to maintain secrecy similar to that of public officials.44 Any council member who divulges secrets in violation of this duty will be punished by imprisonment with labor for not more than one year or a fine of not more than JPY 500000 (approx. USD 3890).45 The council members will determine how the research outcomes will be handled. Council members are permitted to acquire intellectual property rights including patent rights under the four conditions found in Article 17 of the Industrial Technology Enhancement Act.

In addition the Act contains a provision establishing a new think tank to conduct necessary research and study in order to promote the development of specified critical technologies and the appropriate use of research outcomes.46 It is expected that the think tank will be established in FY 2023.

The provisions of this chapter will come into effect within nine months of the official publication of the Act (May 18 2022) (Supplementary Article 1).

Secret patent system

Articles 65 to 85 establish a so-called “secret patent system” similar to those in use in most other G20 countries.47 As explained below Japan’s new system suspends patent examinations. It consists of two-stage examinations by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the Cabinet Office.

The government first solicits expert opinions and formulates basic guidelines concerning the non-disclosure of patent applications (“non-disclosure guidelines”). The government is then required to publish the non-disclosure guidelines without delay after cabinet approval is granted.48

The JPO conducts the initial examination when reviewing patent applications by determining whether they fall within a technological area in which inventions if made public would likely impair national security and public safety because of external action (“specified technological areas”). The JPO then sends the relevant patent applications if any to the Cabinet Office within three months of their submission.49 Applicants may ask the JPO to send their applications to the Cabinet Office.50 Because the JPO reviews around 300000 applications every year it will not conduct a detailed review and will instead simply flag applications that may fall within a specified technological area and therefore require further review. Although the specific technological areas will be designated by a cabinet ordinance it is expected that only a limited number of dual-use technologies in addition to single-use technologies such as nuclear arms and weapons will be designated. Submission of patent applications that fall within the specified technological areas in foreign countries is prohibited (Article 78(1)) and inventors may apply for a prior determination as to whether their inventions fall within such technological areas by paying a fee of JPY 25000 yen (approx. USD 200).51

When conducting the second examination (“security examination”) the Cabinet Office considers several elements such as (i) whether an invention if made public would likely impair national security and public safety because of external action and (ii) potential impacts on the development of industries if the invention is designated (“security designations”).52 During the examination process the Cabinet Office may ask for documents information explanations and/or other cooperation from the relevant government agencies or external institutions with special knowledge. The Cabinet Office in principle consults with the heads of the relevant ministries.53 If the Cabinet Office decides to make a security designation it issues a notice asking the applicant to submit documents describing the management conditions for the invention.54 The applicant must submit the documents within 14 days of receiving the notice.55 If the applicant fails to do so the Cabinet Office will reject the application after granting the applicant an opportunity to explain.56 If the Cabinet Office finds it appropriate to secure information regarding the invention it designates the invention a “secured invention” and notifies the applicant and the JPO of the security designation.57 Extension of the security designation period is reviewed every year.58

Several restrictions apply to secured inventions. For example (i) patent applications for secured inventions cannot be waived or withdrawn59 (ii) applicants must obtain the Cabinet Office’s permission before working the inventions60 (iii) disclosure of the details of the inventions is prohibited61 (iv) applicants are obliged to take necessary and appropriate measures to prevent leakage of information concerning the inventions62 (v) other business operators are required to obtain the Cabinet Office’s approval before handling information concerning the inventions63 and (vi) the submission of patent applications for the inventions in foreign countries is prohibited.64 Applicants will be compensated for these restrictions in the form of payment for a “normally occurring loss” by the government.65

The provisions of this chapter will come into effect within two years of the official publication of the Act (May 18 2022) except for the provisions regarding the non-disclosure guidelines.66

Key points for businesses

We suggest that businesses that manufacture or produce specified critical materials or raw materials used in them consider whether they will submit a plan and acquire certification. In making this decision they should consider the burden of formulating the secure supply plan conducting the related work and the reporting obligations. In general companies should consider taking advantage of support measures in order to mitigate financial burdens or risks regarding potential projects that align with their business strategies. However they should carefully consider whether to apply for the support measures if a potential project does not necessarily align with their business strategies or if they would be required to change their business strategies in order to be eligible for the support measures. Vendors and companies to whom maintenance or management of specified critical equipment is outsourced should prepare documents containing an overview of their specific businesses and component suppliers etc. in advance in order to minimize the potential impact on their businesses. Moreover companies that are designated specified social infrastructure business operators would be advised to introduce equipment within the permitted transition period of six months to the extent possible. Companies should first clarify their areas of competition and areas of cooperation with regard to cutting-edge technologies and they should actively participate in councils to develop specified critical technologies that fall within these areas.

Companies that have inventions that may fall within technological areas subject to the secret patent system need to carefully consider the costs of the restrictions before filing a patent application and decide whether to file it or treat an invention as a trade secret. Furthermore companies unsure about whether their inventions fall within technological areas subject to the secret patent system are advised to use the prior determination system.

They suspected the ride-hailing service was improperly declaring that it owed no provincial sales tax and helping some drivers dodge that tax and the federal GST.

On May 13 2015 they got a search warrant and the next day they raided the company's premises. But at 10:40 a.m. at two Uber offices in Montreal investigators noticed company laptops smartphones and tablets suddenly all restarted at exactly the same time.

Worried that data on the devices might be being manipulated from afar the agents powered them down. They seized 14 computers 74 phones and some documents according to court records obtained by CBC/Radio-Canada.

Uber's Quebec general manager at the time Jean-Nicolas Guillemette told the investigators that he had contacted engineers at the company's headquarters in San Francisco who had encrypted all the data remotely.

What happened in Montreal was far from an isolated incident but a tactic Uber used to try to thwart authorities in cities where it was trying to establish its business according to documents found in the Uber Files a large new leak of internal records from the gig-economy company.

The leaked records show how the company that launched itself as a luxury ride service in San Francisco in 2010 tried to surmount legal and political obstacles through a complex choreography of lobbying cultivating influential allies dodging authorities and ignoring the rules when they appeared inconvenient.

While Quebec tax authorities were executing a search warrant at Uber’s offices in Old Montreal on May 14 2015 computers and electronic devices were encrypted remotely and rebooted by engineers at Uber headquarters in San Francisco. (Radio-Canada)

The leaked files contain 124000 records including 83000 emails iMessages and Whatsapp exchanges between Uber's most senior executives as well as memos presentations and invoices. The records spanning from 2013 to 2017 shed light on a period when Uber was aggressively expanding and operating illegally by ignoring taxi regulations in many cities around the world including in Canada.

The files were leaked to The Guardian and shared with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists  a non-profit newsroom and network of journalists whose media partners include CBC/Radio-Canada the Toronto Star the Washington Post the BBC and Le Monde.

In a statement to the ICIJ Jill Hazelbaker a spokeswoman for Uber acknowledged ""mistakes"" and ""missteps"" that culminated five years ago in ""one of the most infamous reckonings in the history of corporate America"" but that the company had changed its practices since 2017.

Thwarting authorities

The leaked files reveal that a ""kill switch"" as it was referred to internally and an encryption software were also deployed in France the Netherlands Hungary Romania and India as government authorities raided company offices to enforce tax transportation and other laws.

The ""kill switch"" would remotely cut access to the company servers located in San Francisco and prevent government authorities from getting company files while local staff would still appear to be collaborating with investigators.

According to a 2015 leaked email from a legal director for Uber in western Europe the company was particularly concerned that authorities could get access to their list of drivers making it ""much easier for the taxman regulators and police to terrify our supply"" and enforce against it. ""If we hand over the driver list our goose may be cooked"" he added.

In one of the first such uses of the kill switch that shows up in the leak when France's competition and consumer agency raided the company's Paris offices in November 2014 Uber's European legal director at the time sent out an email titled ""Kill Paris access now"" at 3:14 p.m. local time. Thirteen minutes later an engineering manager wrote back: ""Done now.""

During a July 2015 raid by the French tax agency Mark MacGann the top Uber lobbyist in Europe advised Thibauld Simphal then head of Uber France that employees play dumb when the kill switch is activated according to leaked text messages.

""Try a few laptops appear confused when you cannot get access say that IT team is in [San Francisco] and fast asleep.""

The French manager responded: ""Oh yeah we've used that playbook so many times by now the most difficult part is continuing to act surprised!""

MacGann told the Guardian he was just following orders. ""On every occasion where I was personally involved in 'kill switch' activities I was acting on the express orders from my management in San Francisco"" he said.

Simphal now Uber global head of sustainability said all his interactions with public authorities were conducted in good faith.

During an April 2015 raid on its Amsterdam offices Uber's manager for Western Europe emailed a company engineer: ""Kill switch in [Amsterdam] asap please.""

Uber's co-founder and then-CEO Travis Kalanick was looped into the email chain. Seven minutes later he wrote: ""Please hit the kill switch ASAP.... Access must be shut down in [Amsterdam].""

In a statement sent to ICIJ a spokesperson for Kalanick said that the former CEO never authorized any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country.

He said Uber like other businesses operating overseas used tools to protect intellectual property and the privacy of its customers and ensure due process rights in the event of an extrajudicial raid.

Kalanick's spokesperson also said that the protocols do not delete any data and that all decisions about their use were vetted and approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments.

After the Montreal raid Uber went to court to dispute the validity of the search warrants obtained by Revenu Québec.

A Quebec Superior Court judge ruled that the warrants were valid. He also mentioned that the remote shutdown and encryption of electronic devices ""bears all the hallmarks of an attempt to obstruct justice"" and that a judge could reasonably conclude that the company was seeking to hide evidence of illegal conduct from tax authorities.

It's unclear what happened next with the investigation. A spokesperson for Revenu Quebec told CBC/Radio-Canada that the agency can't comment on current or past investigations.

Uber eventually reached an agreement with Revenu Québec under which the company would collect the GST and QST on behalf of its drivers and remit the amounts to tax authorities.

Uber today trades as a public company worth $42 billion US — about the same as CIBC.

It says it operates in more than 10000 cities and more than 70 countries. Its name has become a byword for ride-hailing apps in the many markets where it dominates and it has branched into food delivery.

But at a bird's eye level the leaked records underscore that there was nothing inevitable about the company's meteoric rise since its launch in San Francisco in 2010.

Uber's deliberate strategy to establish itself would bring a lot of headaches too. In a 2014 leaked presentation the company characterized these issues as ""the pyramid of shit"" formed by layers of direct litigation administrative procedures regulatory investigations and driver lawsuits.

Uber sought political allies to help it get around those hurdles and to keep pushing forward.

'Backchannel route around Montreal'

When the UberX service launched in Montreal in 2014 Mayor Denis Coderre immediately publicly pronounced that ""of course it's illegal.""

Behind the scenes Uber's head of policy development sent an internal email saying: ""This was fully anticipated and known but we're working with the province and Quebec City as a back channel route around Montreal.""

When Unifor Canada's largest private sector union called for the Ontario government to intervene after UberX launched in Ottawa in October 2014 the same policy manager wrote: ""We have met with and continue to meet with relevant provincial cabinet ministers to head off this issue.… We are meeting relevant provincial ministers across provinces in Canada.""

The next month the City of Toronto decided to pursue an injunction against Uber for allegedly violating its taxi and limousine regulations.

The same day mayor-elect John Tory issued a media release criticizing the city's decision  saying: ""Uber is a technology whose time has come and which is here to stay.""

A leaked internal memo suggests that Uber's policy team had ""worked to secure [the] extremely positive response"" from Tory.

On Oct. 4 2014 John Baird the federal minister of foreign affairs in Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet complained on Twitter and Facebook of having waited 75 minutes for a cab in Ottawa. He publicly called on the city to allow Uber which had started operating illegally in the capital.

A few days later Uber's policy team claimed to have ""secured the foreign minister of Canada as a public endorser"" according to a leaked internal memo.

Baird's spokesperson Michael Ceci said the former minister ""has no recollection of Uber Canada staff contacting him.""

Uber also sought to influence elected officials and public opinion in Alberta.

In Edmonton when UberX launched in December 2014 an internal memo sent to policy and communications staff noted: ""Policy secured the popular former three-term mayor Bill Smith as our Rider Zero a favourable op-ed in the Edmonton Journal by well-known Edmonton businessman Chris LaBossiere and friend of the current mayor favourable tweets from Uber-supportive Edmonton city councillor Michael Walters and met with the deputy chief of staff to the mayor (second formal meeting to date) where it was confirmed that the mayor 'is there' with respect to ridesharing.""

Earlier that fall another pro-Uber op-ed appeared in the Journal signed by David MacLean who was then vice-president of Alberta Enterprise Group a business lobby organization. An internal Uber email a week later suggests the company's policy and communications team had ""worked with"" the organization on the piece.

Michael Walters and David MacLean did not respond to a request for comments from CBC/Radio-Canada.

Chris LaBossiere said in an email that Uber did indeed contact him about writing an op-ed but he said he wrote the piece because he supported shaking up Edmonton's taxi industry and also believed ride-sharing in general could help reduce impaired driving.

When some Calgary city councillors pushed for a regulatory framework for ride-hailing services like Uber the company launched its service there before new rules were adopted.

""Anticipating that the framework will make it hard for us to operate we are planning to launch this Thursday"" an internal memo says.

A spokesperson for Uber Canada told CBC/Radio-Canada that in the early years Uber met with elected officials ""to brief them on the technology"" and whenever someone expressed support for regulating the industry it was noted.

Katie Wells a postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. who has published papers about Uber said much of the company's behaviour can be understood as a product of a libertarian world view preferring small government with power concentrated in the hands of corporations calling many of the shots.

""They think they're better than the state"" Wells said. ""What they've done through all this lobbying work is they try to eviscerate the state — they try to evade it they try to lessen it they try to say: 'Don't worry about it we'll take care of that.'""

'Violence guarantee success'

Many cities tried to shut Uber down by seeking injunctions impounding vehicles and issuing fines to drivers.

In an internal email from 2014 Uber's head of global communications at the time Nairi Hourdajian wrote ""sometimes we have problems because well we're just f--king illegal.""

When approached by ICIJ Hourdajian declined to comment.

The taxi industry was outraged and staged protests in many cities including Montreal where some taxi drivers disrupted traffic at the Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and pelted Uber drivers with eggs and snowballs.

In 2015 a protest in Paris turned violent with vehicles set on fire and rocks thrown at Uber drivers.

As Paris taxi drivers staged another protest in January 2016 Uber's then-CEO Kalanick wrote in a group text message that the risk of violence against its drivers should not be a deterrent: ""I think it's worth it.. Violence guarantee success"" and added ""these guys must be resisted no?""

""I believe that particular instruction from Travis was dangerous and selfish"" a former Uber executive told The Guardian. ""He was not the guy on the street who was being threatened who was being attacked.""

During the 2016 protests a Paris lawyer acting on behalf of Uber sent an email asking to set up a meeting with the French prime minister referring to the ""tense context"" of ""violent action"" by taxi drivers.

Kalanick's spokesperson said he never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety.

Kalanick's lawyers denied he exploited violence by taxi drivers to try to obtain regulatory changes beneficial to Uber.

Kanalick resigned as CEO in 2017 amid scandals of sexual harassment racial discrimination and bullying within the company that had not been addressed under his watch.

Hazelbaker a spokeswoman for Uber told ICIJ that Uber completely changed how it operates in 2017 after facing high-profile lawsuits and government investigations that led to the ouster of Kalanick and other senior executives.

""We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values"" she said adding that the ""kill switch"" has not been used to thwart regulatory action since 2017 and such software ""should never have been used"" that way.

Powerful allies

In France Uber was not only facing angry cab drivers but also a hostile government that was not very welcoming of Uber's model and law-skirting attitude.

But the ride-hailing giant had an ace in its pocket.

On Oct. 1 2014 a new law came into force imposing longer training for Uber drivers and banning Uber Pop a popular service that allowed drivers with smaller cars to offer ride-hailing services.

The same day top Uber leaders including CEO Kalanick held a confidential meeting with Emmanuel Macron France's minister of economy and industry at the time.

Coming out of the meeting the Uber leaders were ecstatic. ""In a word: spectacular [...] a lot of work to come but but we'll dance soon"" MacGann Uber's top lobbyist in Europe wrote in an internal email to colleagues. ""Wicked meeting with Macron this morning. France loves us after all.""

In October 2015 regional authorities in Marseilles banned Uber drivers from operating in the city's downtown core around train stations and the airport. MacGann reached out by text message to Macron.

""Could you ask your cabinet to help us understand what is happening?""

Macron answered: ""I will look into this personally. Give me all the facts and we will decide by this evening. Stay calm at this point I trust you [...] let's stay in touch.""

That evening the head of local national police began to reverse course promising to clarify the order. Twelve days later authorities issued a new order saying that the ban applied to unlicensed and unregulated Uber drivers in the jurisdiction. Authorities denied receiving any pressure from Macron's ministry.

Internally Uber took credit for the reversal. ""Ban reversed after intense pressure from Uber"" said a leaked email.

In response to ICIJ's questions Macron's office said the French services sector was in upheaval at the time because of the rise of platforms like Uber which faced administrative hurdles and regulatory challenges. The office did not respond to questions about Macron's relationship with Uber.

Hired former government officials

In 2016 alone Uber had a proposed global lobbying budget of $90 million US according to the leaked documents. It paid friendly academics who published favourable research.

It hired an army of former government officials and political staff around the world including in Canada.

Adam Blinick currently senior director of public policy and communications was initially hired onto Uber's Canadian public policy team less than a year after quitting the Stephen Harper government as deputy chief of staff and director of policy to the public safety minister.

A spokesperson for Uber Canada said that Blinick was not involved with any matters related to Uber while in government and that he checked with the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner prior to accepting his first role outside government.

Jean-Christophe de Le Rue served as communications director to the federal public safety minister from 2013-15 before heading to Uber as a senior communications associate. An internal email noted he ""will be helping us win hearts and minds particularly in Quebec and Alberta. He will certainly have plenty of battles to fight — with court injunction and regulatory proceedings in Edmonton and tax authority raids and hundreds of car impoundments in Montreal.""

De Le Rue didn't respond to CBC/Radio-Canada.

The leaked files also show the global scale of Uber's ambitions. Memos mention hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending on consultants and lobbyists in countries like the United Arab Emirates Egypt Ghana Kenya Jordan and Nigeria.

Existing buildings will be razed.

The ShopRite and a separate PNC Bank branch will remain until a 72000-square-foot structure is ready for the new ShopRite in Fall 2023.

“That was one of the requirements and we wanted it to continue at the property as part of any development because there has been a grocery store on this site forever” said Drew Gorman managing partner at MCB.

A Wawa will also be built along with another 14000 square-foot building for retail.

A 130000 square-foot self-storage facility and five-story apartment complex with 173 units will go up by the end of 2024 where ShopRite now sits.

Samsung will be using Snapdragon processors worldwide for its next-gen Galaxy S23 smartphones according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Samsung has typically shipped Galaxy phones to the U.S. market with Snapdragon chips while those in Europe and other international markets often housed Samsung's own Exynos chipset.Samsung used Qualcomm to supply around 70% of the chips for the Galaxy S22 series according to a recent report. In the past the Korean tech company has typically used Snapdragon in its U.S. marketed smartphones while using Exynos in international markets. But it seems that Samsung may be dropping its Exynos processor entirely for its next generation flagship Galaxy smartphones.Back in February of this year early reports did not paint a flattering picture of the Exynos 2200  when compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The prevailing theory at that time was Samsung had to throttle back the GPU on the Exynos 2200 in order to avoid overheating and maintain adequate battery life.If the move to exclusively use Snapdragon does happen it could very well be due to performance power efficiency or both. Qualcomm's SM-8550 more than likely to be named the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 reportedly has stronger performance than Samsung's upcoming Exynos chip. According to Kuo the Exynos 2300 ""can't compete"" with the next generation Snapdragon. He also suggests that Qualcomm will gain an even higher share of the high-end market with its upcoming SM-8550.The Exynos chip has not had a good track record in the last couple of years. In 2020 fans of Samsung started a petition that garnered tens of thousands of signatures asking the company to stop using the Exynos chips in its devices. The call for the end of Exynos by fans was brought on by ongoing performance battery life and thermal issues often found on the Exynos versions of Samsung's flagship devices. Following the petition Samsung stated that both ""Exynos and Snapdragon processors go through the same strict and rigorous real-life testing scenarios in order to deliver a consistent and optimal performance over the entire lifecycle of the smartphone.""While Samsung may be dropping the Exynos in its Galaxy devices the company's Mobile President TM Roh said in a town hall meeting back in April that it was working on making a new application processor that will be ""unique"" to Galaxy smartphones. We will just have to wait and see what all of this means in the coming months as more leaks and rumors are surely to surface about the Galaxy S23 series.Top Image Credit: Samsung",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9zYW1zdW5nLW1heS1kcm9wLWV4eW5vcy1jaGlwcy1mcm9tLWdhbGF4eS1zMjMtMTc1ODM4Nzk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung's next Galaxy S flagship could drop Exynos chips from global variants,"Samsung’s next Galaxy S series phone could mark the end of an era. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo  the company is likely to single-source the processor for its next S series flagship from Qualcomm. That would be a significant departure for Samsung. Over the years the company has used both Snapdragon and Exynos SoCs in its flagship phones.

The model you got would depend on where you lived. In the US Galaxy S and Note series phones have exclusively come with Qualcomm chips much to the envy of Samsung customers in Europe and Asia. In the past in nearly every situation where Samsung has offered both Snapdragon and Exynos variants of its phones the former have either outperformed the company’s in-house chips or provided better battery life. Qualcomm processors tend to also offer a more stable experience when it comes to apps and games .

1. Qualcomm will likely be the sole processor supplier for Samsung Galaxy S23 (vs. 70% shipment proportion for S22) thanks to the next flagship 5G chip SM8550 made by TSMC 4nm. — 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) July 8 2022

Kuo suggests that reality has become too hard for Samsung to ignore. “S23 may not adopt Exynos 2300 made by Samsung 4nm because it can’t compete with SM8550 in all aspects” he wrote on Twitter  referring to the next flagship chips from both Samsung and Qualcomm. Kuo adds such a decision would further cement Qualcomm’s dominance in the Android market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3Mvc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktczIzLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tZXh5bm9zLTIzMDAtNWctbW9kZW1faWQxNDEyNjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Galaxy S23 will only be powered by Snapdragon on Samsung Exynos 5G modem issues,"Samsung is running its early Black Friday sale with an extended trade-in program meaning you can get up to $600 off when you bring in your old S21 Ultra and it can be one with a cracked screen too. Then there's a $225 instant discount going on at the Samsung Store or a $50 upgrade to the 512GB model.





Mr. Kuo however reveals the reasoning behind this change of heart turns out to be far from throttling or thermal management issues of the upcoming Exynos 2300 chip that is supposed to go into the S23 but rather Qualcomm's superior 5G modem integrated with the upcoming SM8550 (likely to be called Snapdragon 8 Gen 2) chipset that can hardly be replicated by anyone at the moment.

All Galaxy S23 models could come with Snapdragon X70 5G modem





At the MWC 2022 expo Qualcomm announced the next generation of its award-winning 5G modem technology the Snapdragon X70 . Built on the 4nm fabrication method of TSMC the Snapdragon X70 will be in the Galaxy S23 and other 2023 flagships yet it will be sampling to customers in the second half of the year and phones with the next-gen 5G connectivity will be on the market by year's end.





Instead of upping the Gigabit download speeds as it did with the previous Snapdragon X65 X60 X55 and X50 generation Qualcomm decided to stick with the 10 Gigabit rating of the modem that is currently in phones like the Galaxy S22 series and instead focus on decking the new modem out with extra features and AI capabilities. Qualcomm says that this is the the world’s first 5G AI processor in a modem-RF system. Here's what the new X70 AI module do according to Qualcomm:





Snapdragon X70 unleashes advanced capabilities such as Qualcomm 5G AI Suite Qualcomm 5G Ultra-Low Latency Suite Qualcomm 5G PowerSave Gen 3 and 4X

sub-6 carrier aggregation to achieve unmatched 5G performance.

Harnessing the power of AI to enable breakthrough 5G speeds coverage low latency and power efficiency to fuel the 5G Connected Intelligent Edge

World’s only comprehensive 5G modem-RF system family capable of supporting every commercial 5G band from 600 MHz to 41 GHz offering flexibility to OEMs for

Unmatched global band support and spectrum aggregation capabilities including world’s first 4X downlink carrier aggregation across TDD and FDD mmWave-sub-6 aggregation

Standalone mmWave support to allow MNOs and service providers to deploy services such as fixed wireless access and enterprise 5G without needing sub-6 GHz spectrum

Unmatched uplink performance and flexibility with uplink carrier aggregation and switched uplink support across TDD and FDD

True global 5G multi-SIM including Dual-SIM Dual-Active (DSDA) and mmWave support

Upgradeable architecture allowing rapid commercialization of 5G Release 16 features through software updates

Apple is trying to develop a 5G modem chip of its own but has run across Qualcomm's suite of insurmountable patents around the technology for instance. Samsung says Mr. Kuo can't technologically match the upcoming flagship 5G modem in the SM8550 chip that is made by TSMC on its frugal 4nm method both in performance and in power efficiency.





This is why it may ultimately decide to simply go with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2  or whatever Qualcomm calls it and continue ironing out the kinks of its own 5G chipset. The big winner here is of course Qualcomm which will sell many millions of high-end Snapdragon SoCs than it would have if Samsung threw Exynos 2300 in the mix.





"" Qualcomm/SM8550 will gain more market share in the high-end Android market in 2023. The economic recession affects the high-end market less so the market share gain will significantly benefit Qualcomm and TSMC "" tips Ming Chi-Kuo and now the only thing left for us to do is wait and see what the future holds for Samsung's Exynos.

That's the second time we are hearing that Samsung will go Snapdragon all the way after a Korean publication tipped back in the spring that Samsung won't use Exynos for both the S23 and the next S24 series",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vOXRvNWdvb2dsZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8wOS9nYWxheHktczIzLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tY2hpcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galaxy S23 reportedly goes for Snapdragon chips globally,"Samsung’s Galaxy flagships have long used two different chips depending on where you buy them but it seems the Galaxy S23 series will be an outlier in that regard using Snapdragon chips globally.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Samsung has plans to use Snapdragon chips in the Galaxy S23 in all regions compared to using Qualcomm to supply around 70% of the chips for the Galaxy S22 series.

Historically Samsung has generally used Snapdragon chips in the United States and some other major markets but Exynos in many international markets across Europe and Asia.

This year’s swap to the SM-8550 likely to be branded as Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is apparently due to Qualcomm’s stronger performance over Samsung’s upcoming Exynos chip. The Exynos 2300 “can’t compete” with the next Snapdragon chip according to Kuo. He further predicts that Qualcomm will gain further market share in the high-end Android market with this upcoming chip.

Back in 2020 Samsung fans ran a petition that amassed tens of thousands of signatures demanding that the company stop using Exynos chips. That was spurred by the ongoing performance battery life and particularly heat issues often found on the Exynos versions of Samsung’s flagship phones. In a statement at the time Samsung said that both “the Exynos and Snapdragon processors go through the same strict and rigorous real-life testing scenarios in order to deliver a consistent and optimal performance over the entire lifecycle of the smartphone.”

Fast forward to earlier this year when Samsung announced the Exynos 2200 after rumors that the chip had been canceled due to performance concerns. The chip ended up releasing with similar raw performance to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 but still had some issues with games and apps as well as some software bugs.

While the Galaxy S23 will use Snapdragon chips solely according to this report Samsung did say earlier this year that it plans to make a new chipset “unique” to Galaxy smartphones. It still remains unknown how that special chip would be different from Exynos designs.

Deadline reports that Raymond James will play the role of Joe Colombo alongside Forest Whitaker who is set to return as Bumpy Johnson.

“Colombo represents the new mob forward-thinking progressive and tired of the old mob rules and regulations. He sets out to remake the mob in his own image: brash brilliant and able to work with the diverse players in the narcotics and prostitution rackets” Raymond-James’ character description reads.

“He wants a true partnership with Bumpy Johnson but when that becomes impossible he will seek other allies in the competition for who will become the true ‘Godfather of Harlem.'”

Raymond-James is not the only new actor to join the cast of the critically-acclaimed series.

The amount of NFL records and career marks Tom Brady is setting is incredibly impressive. But there is one mark he is closing in on that would be truly mind-blowing.

CBS Sports noted Friday that Brady is close to setting the record for most playoff wins against an NFC team.

Brett Favre holds the record with 12 playoff wins against NFC opponents. Favre achieved 11 of his 12 wins while serving as quarterback of the Green Bay Packers and an additional win with Minnesota.

Brady meanwhile is tied for second along with Joe Montana and Drew Brees. What’s stunning is that Brady spent most of his career in the AFC while Favre Montana and Brees spent the majority of their careers in the NFC and thus had many more opportunities to achieve such wins.

Brady got six of his playoff wins over NFC teams in the Super Bowl while a member of the Patriots. Then he racked up three more wins during his first season with the Bucs which culminated in his seventh Super Bowl victory. And he got a 10th playoff win over an NFC team last season.

If Brady leads the Bucs to the Super Bowl in the upcoming season he will have added three more to his total and set the record. With two more playoff wins he would tie Favre.

For a guy who has only played two seasons in the NFC Brady setting that record would be nothing short of incredible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9saWZlLzIwMjIvMDcvY2xheW5lLWNyYXdmb3JkLW1vdmllLWZpbG1lZC1pbi1hbGFiYW1hLXRvLXNjcmVlbi1hdC1zaWRld2Fsay1maWxtLWZlc3RpdmFsLmh0bWzSAX9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbC5jb20vbGlmZS8yMDIyLzA3L2NsYXluZS1jcmF3Zm9yZC1tb3ZpZS1maWxtZWQtaW4tYWxhYmFtYS10by1zY3JlZW4tYXQtc2lkZXdhbGstZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clayne Crawford movie filmed in Alabama to screen at Sidewalk Film Festival,"The Sidewalk Film Festival has announced its first nine movies for 2022 and “The Integrity of Joseph Chambers” is on the list.

The new film which stars Alabama native Clayne Crawford of “Lethal Weapon” fame was filmed in his hometown of Clay in 2020. Crawford 44 serves as one of the producers as well.

Sidewalk also confirmed festival screenings of “A Walk With Joey” a sports documentary with Alabama ties plus “The Automat” “Mija” “The Thief Collector” “The Sun Rises in the East” “Peace in the Valley” “Funny Pages” and “Good Girl Jane.”

More movies will be announced for the festival in the weeks to come. Sidewalk in its 24th year is set for Aug. 24-28 at several venues in downtown Birmingham including the Sidewalk Film Center and Cinema.

Here’s a look at the first batch of films on the agenda:

“THE INTEGRITY OF JOSEPH CHAMBERS”

Sidewalk says: “Director Robert Machoian and Alabama’s own Clayne Crawford last collaborated on ‘The Killing of Two Lovers’; their latest shot in Alabama is another deeply tense thriller about modern masculinity gone awry. Crawford plays the title character a man fearful of imminent societal collapse who seeks to prove he can make it on his own during a hunting trip. But when things go terribly wrong Joseph Chambers has to prove his mettle in unexpected ways.”

The cast includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan of “The Walking Dead” Michael Raymond-James of “True Blood” and “Once Upon a Time” Jordana Brewster who appeared with Crawford in the “Lethal Weapon” TV series and Crawford’s sons Colt and Hix. “The Integrity of Joseph Chambers” made its debut on June 9 at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.

“A WALK WITH JOEY”

Sidewalk says: “Joey Hale survived a brain tumor at a very young age and defied all odds to mount a recovery thanks to some needed inspiration from his beloved football team the San Diego Chargers and a close friendship with former Auburn player Lionel ‘Little Train’ James. Now Joey pays it forward to others all around the Birmingham area and beyond bringing smiles to his customers at Publix and ministry and charity to those less fortunate. ‘A Walk With Joey’ is a fond portrait of a true Alabama original whose life has touched thousands.”

The documentary was directed by Dana Lynn Falletta and J. Neil Bloomer. Watch the trailer here.

“THE AUTOMAT”

Sidewalk says: “‘The Automat’ is a fond remembrance of Horn & Hardart a more than 100-year-old chain of popular fast food restaurants at which customers would select a menu item from rows of coin-operated windowed compartments and eat their meals at communal tables. For generations these restaurants were New York fixtures; this documentary interviews many of its most famous former customers including iconic comedian Mel Brooks and the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.”

The documentary was directed by Lisa Hurwitz.

“MIJA”

Sidewalk says: “This remarkable documentary from Disney and Nat Geo follows Doris Muñoz a young Mexican-American woman working as a music talent manager for a hot new artist and providing a key source of income for her undocumented parents and her brother who has been deported. But as circumstances force her business to evolve she meets Jacks Haupt another hungry young artist from a mixed-status family for whom making it in show business isn’t just a dream — it’s a necessity. Part confessional part crowd-pleaser ‘Mija’ shines a light on these first-generation Americans hustling to make it big and give their families a ticket to a better life.”

The documentary was directed by Isabel Castro.

“THE THIEF COLLECTOR”

Sidewalk says: “In 1985 a priceless painting was cut from its frame at the University of Arizona Museum of Art and stolen in broad daylight. It resurfaced 32 years later — but you wouldn’t believe me if I told you where it was found. ‘The Thief Collector’ tells the unbelievable story of a heist with the unlikeliest of perpetrators examining the complicated motives of its audacious criminals with bubbly flair in a film everyone will be talking about.”

The documentary was directed by Allison Otto.

“THE SUN RISES IN THE EAST”

Sidewalk says: “In 1969 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn prominent Black activists and educators founded The East a pan-African cultural organization established to enrich the lives of children and promote Black self-determination. This documentary tells its story as The East grew to include a school publisher clothing shop and bookstore — and changed the lives of parents and students alike by giving a neighborhood the tools it needed for empowerment.”

The documentary was directed by Tayo Giwa.

“PEACE IN THE VALLEY”

Sidewalk says: “A young mother is suddenly widowed when her husband is killed in an act of heroism during a mass shooting incident. The wrenching (and unfortunately constantly) timely drama ‘Peace in the Valley’ focuses on the aftermath as the family struggles to rebuild their lives. Anchored by an excellent lead performance from Brit Shaw and Sidewalk fixture Michael Abbott Jr. in a dual role this sensitive work tries to find meaning in the violent meaninglessness of the new American normal.”

The narrative feature was directed by Tyler Riggs.

“FUNNY PAGES”

Sidewalk says: “A young cartoonist drops out of school to make it on his own in the seedy margins of Trenton New Jersey in this dark comedy from A24 and producers Josh and Benny Safdie. The directorial debut of actor Owen Kline ‘Funny Pages’ is a grimy and gleefully tasteless look at a subculture of comic book-obsessed young men.”

“GOOD GIRL JANE”

Sidewalk says: “A lonely teenage girl falls in with the wrong crowd in this stunning debut feature from Sarah Elizabeth Mintz. Rain Spencer stars as the title character who meets a group of trendy friends and starts experimenting with drugs in the aftermath of her parents’ divorce. But Jane soon falls under the sway of a charming older man — and things spiral out of control. You may think you know this story but you’ve never seen it done quite this well. ‘Good Girl Jane’ won Best Narrative Film and Best Performance for Spencer at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival.”

The Sidewalk festival typically includes an opening night film on Friday plus two full days of screenings on Saturday and Sunday. Earlier in the week a handful of “Spotlight” films get screenings at the Sidewalk cinema 1821 Second Ave. North on the lower level of the Pizitz building.

Tickets for Sidewalk 2022 are on sale via the festival website priced at $75 for a weekend pass (Aug. 26-28) $220 VIP (Aug. 26-28). Day passes are $30 for Aug. 26-28. Tickets for a single film are $15. Tickets to Spotlight Films (Aug. 22-25) are $15.

Ticket prices typically increase as the festival dates get closer."

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Desktop Graphics Cards and Mobility GPU PCI IDs Leaked GeForce RTX 4090 Confirmed

The GPU IDs for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 series lineup which will be based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture were published over at LaptopVideo2Go and discovered by @Harukaze5719. The PCI IDs include several desktop and mobility SKUs which are expected to launch around this fall & the start of next year but don't expect all of the GPUs mentioned here to be launched in the market as some device IDs are set for preliminary engineering boards that never go out to retail.

So starting with the PCI Device IDs first up we have the 'NVIDIA_DEV.268' which is said to be the top GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card that will be based on the AD102 GPU architecture. The RTX 4090 will be the flagship offering for 2022 offering almost 100 TFLOPs of compute performance that's hinted in previous leaks.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The Geforce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. It is likely that we may get 500W+ custom designs as we saw with the RTX 3090 Ti.

GN21-X11 is based on AD103. So I don't think it will be called RTX 4080 Mobile.

And X9 AD104 X6 AD106 X4 X2 AD107.

I told you their power comsumption beforce but no names.

Thank you for your information. 👍👍👍 — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) July 10 2022

The rest of the lineup is a mix of various NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Mobility GPUs which will be based on various GPU SKUs such as the AD103 AD104 AD106 & AD107 chips. Following is the complete breakdown. According to leaker Kopite7kimi the GN21-X11 series SKUs will feature the AD103 GPU which will be followed by the GN21-X9 with AD104 GN21-X6 with AD106 and GN21-X4/X2 with the AD107 GPUs. The GN20 series was part of the Ampere family so it's easy to conclude that the GN21 lineup will be part of the Ada Lovelace family.

; AD103 - GN21-X11 Series

NVIDIA_DEV.2717 = “NVIDIA GN21-X11”

NVIDIA_DEV.2757 = “NVIDIA GN21-X11”

; AD104 - GN21-X9 Series

NVIDIA_DEV.2785 = “NVIDIA AD104”

NVIDIA_DEV.27A0 = “NVIDIA GN21-X9”

NVIDIA_DEV.27E0 = “NVIDIA GN21-X9”

; AD106 - GN21-X6 Series

NVIDIA_DEV.2820 = “NVIDIA GN21-X6”

NVIDIA_DEV.2860 = “NVIDIA GN21-X6”

; AD107 - GN21-X4 / X2 Series

NVIDIA_DEV.28A0 = “NVIDIA GN21-X4”

NVIDIA_DEV.28A1 = “NVIDIA GN21-X2”

NVIDIA_DEV.28E0 = “NVIDIA GN21-X4”

NVIDIA_DEV.28E1 = “NVIDIA GN21-X2” via LaptopVideo2Go

A truth. The power limits:

AD102 800W;

AD103 (DT) 450W AD103 (Mobile) 175W;

AD104 (DT) 400W AD104 (Mobile) 175W;

AD106 (DT) 260W AD106 (Mobile) 140W.

But I don't think we need to use the full power cap. — kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) June 18 2022

In a previous breakdown by the same leaker it was reported that the NVIDIA AD103 Mobile SKU will have a max power limit of 175W which will also be retained for the AD104 SKUs the AD106 GPU will have a 140W power limit while the AD107 will end up somewhere around or under the 100W range. The GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards are expected to launch in Q4 2022 while mobility GPUs are expected around CES 2023.

Decent 1080p gaming performance

Good keyboard and touchpad

Conservative good looks

Affordable Cons Confusing configurations

Poor battery life

Ho-hum screen

Gaming laptops tend to be expensive and the chip shortage has only made that situation worse in recent years. HP’s new Victus 15 slides in with options well under $1000 that attempt to provide a fix to that problem.

While the larger Victus 16 gets you up to an RTX 3060 the Victus 15 tops out at an RTX 3050 Ti — and starts at a budget-tier GTX 1650 which is what my review unit included. Despite having the latest 12th-gen CPUs we don’t normally recommend gaming laptops with graphics that are quite that bottom of the barrel. While our unit lacked in performance there are some configurations in the lineup that could make the Victus 15 a solid purchase — especially considering the alternatives.

Design

Like the Victus 16 the Victus 15 has a design that carries over a few elements from HP’s Omen lineup but maintains a more conservative aesthetic. The Victus logo shares the Omen logo’s basic geometry cutting off and retaining the bottom portion. The logo shows up on the lid and in the venting above the keyboard. Otherwise the Victus 15 has simple lines and few gamer-oriented elements. The rear vent has a bit of a fighter jet look but from the front and sides you wouldn’t be blamed for mistaking the Victus 15 for a mainstream budget laptop. That perception extends to the thin side bezels and reasonably small top bezel that contrast with the massive chin at the bottom of the display.

There are three available colors Mica Silver (dark gray) Performance Blue and Ceramic White. The Victus 15 doesn’t look exactly like a smaller version of the Victus 16 — the rear edges are more rounded giving a sleeker look. It’s not unusual for gaming laptops to strike a more mainstream look. Other examples include the Razer Blade 15 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. If you want a laptop that looks like a gaming machine you’ll want to consider something like the Asus ROG Strix G15 that’s a gamer through and through.

HP didn’t set out to make a thin and light gaming laptop but it didn’t make the thickest or heaviest either.

The Victus 15 is made of all plastic just like the Victus 16. Also like that laptop it has a lid that’s quite bendable. The keyboard deck also comes with a bit of flex although the smaller model is a bit more solid. The hinge works well allowing the lid to be opened with one hand and avoiding any serious wobble during intense gaming action. Overall the Victus 15 is slightly improved over the Victus 16 but it falls well short of more expensive machines like the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro and the Razer Blade 15.

Even given the large chin on the bottom of the display the Victus 15 is sized like the typical 15-inch gaming laptop . It’s fractions of an inch narrower and shallower than the Lenovo Legion 5 for example and just as thick at 0.93 inches. The HP is slightly lighter at 5.06 pounds compared to 5.3 pounds. The Acer Nitro 5 a similarly priced gaming machine is about the same size but thicker at 0.94 inches and lighter at 4.85 pounds. HP didn’t aim to make a thin and light laptop but it didn’t make the thickest or heaviest either.

Connectivity is robust with one exception. There’s a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports a full-size HDMI 2.1 port an Ethernet connection a 3.5mm audio jack and a full-size SD card reader. The one glaring omission is Thunderbolt 4 which we’ve seen on laptops at this price point. Wireless connectivity is either Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 or Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 depending on the configuration.

Price and configurations

Affordable gaming laptops are tough to come by these days especially ones that are actually worth buying. As with all cheap laptops  though digging into the configurations is key — and unfortunately HP has created a confusing lineup with the Victus 15 offering preconfigured models via retailers that utilize different Intel CPUs than you can buy via HP’s configure-to-order (CTO) system.

The preconfigured models range from a $600 (on sale from $880) configuration with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU 8GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and an Nvidia GTX 1650. My review unit was similar though it cost $800 and includes a Core i5-12450H and a 144Hz Full HD display. At the high end is the $1000 (on sale from $1100) model with a Core i7-12650H 16GB of RAM  a 512GB SSD and the Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti. Other options include the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H and the RTX 3050. These higher-end options will give you far better performance.

You can configure the Victus 15 at HP.com which lets you spec out your laptop in finer detail ranging from $870 on the low end to $1230 on the high end. There are two primary competitors that price out closely to the Victus 15: The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 and the Acer Nitro 5. The Nitro 5 is $50 more expensive when configured similarly while the IdeaPad Gaming 3 comes with the latest Ryzen processor for $900.

Performance

The most important distinction is that the Core i5-12450H is a 45-watt 10-core (four Performance and six Efficient) and 12-thread CPU compared to the 45-watt 12-core (four Performance and eight Efficient) 16-thread i5-12500H. The Core i7-12650H is a 45-watt 10-core (six Performance and four Efficient) 16-thread CPU compared to the Core i7-12700H a 45-watt 14-core (six Performance and eight Efficient) 20-thread CPU. We’ve only benchmarked the Core i7-12700H but looking at the Geekbench 5 database the Core i5-12450H and Core i7-12650H are (as expected) slower than their higher-core and higher-thread counterparts.

We haven’t tested a 28-watt P-series Core i5 but again looking at the Geekbench 5 database it seems to be faster than the Core i5-12450H in my review unit. It’s worth noting that the Victus 15 couldn’t quite keep up with laptops running the 28-watt Core i7-1260P with its 12 cores (four Performance and eight Efficient) and 16 threads of which we’ve reviewed quite a few. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is also faster than the Core i5 in my review unit.

Accordingly the Victus 15’s productivity and creativity performances were mixed. It had the second-slowest Geekbench 5 results in our comparison group well behind the Core i7-1260P in the MSI Prestige 14 and the core i7-11800H in the HP Victus 16. The same held with our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265 although the differences weren’t as significant. At the same time the Victus 15 was more competitive in the Cinebench R23 benchmark producing the third-fastest single-core score and beating the MSI Prestige 14. The Victus 15 was again behind most of the pack in the PCMark 10 Complete test that runs through a range of productivity multimedia and creative tasks.

The Victus 15 can handle demanding productivity workflows and some low-end creative tasks.

Finally in the Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark that runs in a live version of Adobe’s Premiere Pro the Victus 15 again fell behind the MSI Prestige 14. That laptop was configured with the RTX 3050 a faster GPU than the GTX 1650 in the Victus 15 and the Pugetbench benchmark is heavily influenced by GPU performance. However it wasn’t GPU performance that held the HP back. In fact the Victus 15 tied the Prestige 14 in the GPU section of the benchmark and it was in the CPU-dependent video playback section that the HP was much slower.

Overall mainstream performance was still solid for an $800 laptop. The Victus 15 can handle demanding productivity workflows and some low-end creative tasks. But you’ll see faster results by ordering via the CTO system. Interestingly the Omen Gaming Hub app has a performance tuning section but the GTX 1650 version of the Victus 15 doesn’t have a performance setting which is disappointing.

Gaming

Gaming performance was mostly in line with expectations given the GTX 1650 GPU. These are the lowest-end graphics cards you can find in a gaming laptop  so your expectations should be low when firing this up. First the Victus 15 had the lowest 3DMark Time Spy test in our comparison group as expected. It was considerably lower than the MSI Prestige 14’s RTX 3050 also as expected.

The Victus 15 performed OK in most of our benchmarks at 1080p and higher graphics settings. It managed playable frame rates in Civilization VI and Fortnite but just barely in the latter case. You’ll need to drop down to a lower setting to play Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The results aren’t listed in the table below but the Victus 15 managed to hit 45 frames per second (fps) in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p and Ultra graphics with DLSS turned off.

Overall the laptop averaged greater than 30 fps in most of our benchmark titles. Of course that’s the bare minimum fps for gaming so you’ll want to configure the RTX 3050 Ti to get more comfortable frame rates at higher graphics.

Display and audio

There are three display options for the Victus 15 all non-touch 16:9 Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS. They include a 250-nit 60Hz panel a 250-nit 144Hz panel and a 300-nit low blue light panel. My review unit was equipped with the 144Hz display and it seemed OK to me when I powered on the laptop and used it during my testing. The colors were muted but the contrast seemed deep enough and the display didn’t get terribly bright.

That’s pretty much what my colorimeter confirmed. Brightness was indeed low at 236 nits below our 300-nit threshold while the contrast was good at 1150:1 above our preferred 1000:1. Colors weren’t very wide at just 65% of sRGB and 49% of AdobeRGB and accuracy wasn’t great at a Delta-E of 3.04 (2.0 or less is considered the minimum for creative work). The Victus 16’s display was brighter and had wider and more accurate colors and only the Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey‘s display was worse.

These results aren’t terrible for a laptop that’s $800 or less but they become less palatable as you approach $1000. The display is fine for productivity work and gaming primarily thanks to the high contrast but creators will find it lacking.

Two downward-firing speakers provide the audio putting out plenty of volume with just a hint of distortion at the top end. Mids and clears were high but there was zero bass meaning you’ll want to wear some headphones for intense gaming and binging sessions.

Keyboard touchpad and webcam

There’s no per-key RGB lighting with the Victus 15 as HP is apparently reserving that for its Omen gaming lineup. Instead there’s just a single rather bright backlight setting. There’s plenty of spacing and the keys with their gamer-oriented font are large enough. I found the switches to be ligh with a nice click at the bottom which should work nicely for gamers even if it’s not a mechanical keyboard. Overall the keyboard felt much like the one on the Victus 16 which shouldn’t be a surprise.

The touchpad was large and had a surface that offered a touch of resistance. It was responsive and reliable for Windows 11 ’s complement of multi-touch gestures and the clicks were solid and confident without being too loud.

The webcam is a 720p version and it performed about as well as the typical laptop webcam. That is it was OK with good lighting but lost details in low light.

The Victus 15 doesn’t support Windows 11 Hello passwordless login. There are no fingerprint reader or infrared camera options which is disappointing.

Battery life

My review unit packed in just 52.5 watt-hours of battery which isn’t a lot for a 15-inch laptop with a discrete GPU. If you order a higher-end model via HP’s CTO system you can get a 70 watt-hour battery. I wasn’t expecting much in the way of battery life.

Unsurprisingly the Victus 15 didn’t do well. It managed just 4.25 hours in our web-browsing test that cycles through a series of popular and demanding websites and it only managed five hours in our video test that loops a local Full HD Avengers trailer. In the PCMark 10 Applications test that’s the best measure of productivity battery life it couldn’t quite make it to five hours. The average laptop in our database at least doubles those results.

The Victus 15 performed similarly to most of the gaming laptops in our comparison group. Only the Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey and the Razer Blade 14 with its AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX had meaningfully longer battery life.

Our take

Rating the HP Victus 15 is challenging given its wide range of configurations. The $600 configuration (on sale from $870) with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H and a GTX 1650 provides a lot of value and will likely provide similar performance to my review unit. Speaking of that the configuration I reviewed justifies its $800 price but barely.

In the end the Victus 15 performed well enough and is built solidly enough to make it a solid new entry in the budget gaming arena. You’ll just want to compare the available options before making your choice.

Are there any alternatives?

The best alternative to the Victus 15 is the Victus 16. It’s a little larger but it can also be configured with a much faster GPU and its display is slightly better. For just $100 more you can get a configuration with an AMD Ryzen 5 6600H and RTX 3050 that’s probably faster than my review unit.

There aren’t many other gaming laptops under $1000 that have made the switch to Intel 12th-gen CPUs. One that has is the Acer Nitro 5 which has a more aggressive gaming design and similar configuration for a couple of hundred dollars more.

The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 is another alternative offering a similarly conservative design and similar components for just a bit more money than the Victus 15. You’ll want to look for the newest AMD Ryzen 6000 models.

How long will it last?

Despite a little bending in the lid and flexing in the keyboard deck the Victus 15 is a well-built budget gaming machine. It should still last for years of hard gaming. The industry-standard one-year warranty remains as disappointing as ever.

Should you buy it?

Yes. The Victus 15 is a good value as long as you make your selection carefully from among HP’s confusing purchasing options.

NEW YORK – Research from the department of Immunology & Inflammation in the pharmaceutical company Regeneron was published recently in the prestigious scientific journal Nature Cancer and uncovered the different identities that the cells of the immune system acquire in the fight against cancer.

During cancer initiation and progression cancer cells continuously interact with the cells of the immune system of the patient. Although in the initial disease stages the immune system keeps cancer under control once the efficacy of the immune system declines disease progresses. The molecular mechanisms that transform effective immune cells into dysfunctional ones are poorly understood.

The investigator Dr. Nikos Kourtis and colleagues under the leadership of Dr. Dimitris Skokos Senior Director of the department of Cancer Immunology at Regeneron mapped the molecular identities of immune cells in renal cancer. By analyzing patient samples at the single-cell level they profiled immune cells derived from tumor at multiple levels. The scientists discovered extensive heterogeneity in the molecular identities of T lymphocytes a critical immune cell population in the battle against cancer. “We understand for the first time and with unprecedented resolution the various states of immune cells in patients with renal cancer and why the immune system stops working efficiently” said Dr. Kourtis.

Remarkably the scientists found that a molecular pathway that up until now was known for its beneficial role in the biology of T cells acquires a new function in cancer and leads to death of T cells. Also the investigators discovered molecular signatures that can predict the life expectancy of the patients with renal cancer. “Our study opens the road for precision medicine and selection of patients for personalized therapies based on the molecular identities of the patient’s immune cells” said Dr. Skokos.

As part of this study researchers identified novel potential mechanisms that drive dysfunction of T cells during cancer progression. According to Kourtis and Skokos these results may help the design of novel drugs aiming at immune system reinvigoration in the fight against cancer.

The article in Nature Cancer is also available online: https://go.nature.com/3IlROoF.

The Greek scientists spoke with The National Herald about their research.

When asked about their background where in Greece they grew up and studied Dr. Kourtis said “I grew up in Athens and graduated from the department of Biology of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Next I obtained my PhD from the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB) and the University of Crete. Then I moved to the U.S. to continue my training as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University (NYU). In 2019 I joined Regeneron where I do research on cancer immunology in Dimitris’ ‘Cancer Immunology’ team.”

Dr. Skokos told TNH: “I was born in Athens Greece. I received my PhD and master’s degrees in molecular immunology from the Pasteur Institute University Paris 5 Rene Descartes School of Medicine and my BSc in cellular immunology and physiology from University Paris France. Prior to joining Regeneron I was a post-doctoral fellow at the Rockefeller University working with Ralph Steinman (Nobel Laureate 2011) and Michel Nussenzweig. I joined Regeneron in 2008 as Staff Scientist and now I serve as Senior Director of Cancer Immunology. My team is responsible for developing the next generation of combination immunotherapeutic strategies including the costimulatory bispecific antibodies and other foundational antibody medicines to treat cancer.”

When asked if they were always interested in pursuing a career in science Kourtis said “I was always curious about the cause behind the observation. Science keeps us excited 24/7 and I cannot imagine myself doing anything different. I am the first person in my family who went to university but for my parents my education was always the absolute priority so I owe everything to them.”

Skokos said: “The reason for choosing a career in science and medical research was my curiosity of human disease development and the desire to find a cure with the hope of potentially saving patients’ lives.”

When asked about this specific research project they told TNH: “We started working on this project just before the beginning of the pandemic. Despite the challenges we encountered along the way the talent the motivation and commitment of Regeneron’s scientists enabled us to generate an important and meaningful dataset. We are very happy to share our findings with the rest of the scientific community.”

Of the real-world implications of their research they said: “The advancement and availability of single -cell technologies enables us to investigate with unprecedented resolution how immune cells fight cancer. In our study we found that not all immune cells are equally effective in attacking cancer. By better understanding which patients may require a boost of their immune response we may be able to design appropriate drugs to support the fight against cancer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvY2lldHlmb3JzY2llbmNlLm9yZy9pc2VmL2F3YXJkcy9wZWdneS1zY3JpcHBzLWF3YXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peggy Scripps Award for Science Communication,"Society for Science is proud to honor Peggy Scripps through a $10000 award.

The DRC is also hosting over 500000 refugees and asylum-seekers (mainly from Burundi the Central African Republic and South Sudan).

The factors driving internal displacement are often complex and interconnected from conflicts climate related shocks disasters to rising rates of violent crime.

In the DRC the protracted conflicts in the Eastern Provinces of Ituri North Kivu and South Kivu as well as renewed tensions in the central southern regions of Kasai and Tanganyika have been the key source of displacement in the country forcing millions of people to leave their homes often on multiple different occasions.

As the inter-communal conflicts in the Eastern Provinces roll into their second decade and tensions and violence over the use of land and exploitation of natural resources continue including through the many armed groups active in these regions more displaced families are forced to depend on humanitarian assistance in order to survive.

Untying the ‘Gordian knots’

As we know humanitarian assistance – although necessary to alleviate suffering in the short term - is not enough to solve the deep-rooted structural challenges driving internal displacement.

The need to find durable and long-lasting solutions to the issue of internal displacement in the DRC could not be more urgent.

Finding coherence and redressing the balance between humanitarian peacebuilding and development action is critical and is the first of many steps necessary to build longer lasting solutions to internal displacement and meet the needs of the millions of people stranded in IDP sites.

Over the past few years we - the UN country team in the DRC as well as the Humanitarian Country team - have been working closely with the Government of the DRC and provincial authorities along with other development humanitarian and peacebuilding partners to implement the humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

By working in coordination with national and international partners this nexus-based strategy moves away from the project centric approach to tackle the key structural causes of internal displacement – what I have come to refer to as the ‘Gordian knots.’

Building on my recent experience in Haiti as the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator and Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General I’ve also come to recognize the importance of working with national authorities to scale up and implement existing public policies in order boost the country’s development trajectory.

Planting the seeds of development

At the center of this approach is the recognition that after 20 years of reliance on the humanitarian community and the presence of UN’s peacekeeping forces (MONUSCO) which play an essential role in protecting civilians we need to open up more space to development actors in the DRC – and work in a more balanced way to address both the symptoms and drivers of displacement.

Even during the current period of crisis and escalating violence I’ve come to see just how important it is to plant the seeds of development and address the underlying vulnerabilities which have uprooted so many families across the country in the first place.

During several visits to Tanganyika province which has high levels of IDPs I was struck by just how many different factors - both the symptoms and drivers of displacement - are at play including high levels of food insecurity the difficulty to access services competition over the region’s wealth of natural resources and escalating violence against civilians. ]

I spoke with many IDPs during these visits to Tanganyika province each of them sharing their own story of displacement and explaining the tough conditions they currently live under. Here are some of the things they told me.

‘The thing we want most in the world is to return home to cultivate our land but the security conditions are not there yet – and so we have to continue to live in these difficult conditions.’

‘We want peace to return because only lasting peace can allow us to return to our villages.’

Finding a lasting solution to forced displacement in this part of the country clearly requires the involvement of many different actors – peacebuilders humanitarians development partners and local government – all working together towards one common game plan and collective outcomes.

Development can have an important multiplier effect helping to strengthen local actors and systems boost local economic development and support a return of State authority.

Working with local organizations including NGOs and civil society organizations is key. We must continue to walk the talk on localization

In eastern DRC a region which has over relied on humanitarian actors for the provision of social services and public infrastructure in the past empowering local state actors is a key step to building more sustainable solutions to displacement and one which we at the UN country team will continue to prioritize in the years ahead.

A hopeful road ahead

The UN Secretary-General’s Action Agenda on Internal Displacement marks an important step in this direction.

Building on the recommendations from the High-Level Panel on Internal Displacement at the end of 2019 the Action Agenda sets out a series of commitments for the UN system to step up its engagement and build longer lasting solutions to internal displacement by placing prevention protection and local partnerships at the centre.

The challenges ahead for the DRC are significant but I am hopeful that the new Action Agenda alongside the nexus-based approach will ensure that displaced communities are further protected local authorities strengthened and development actors brought to scale”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jZzZ6ZHY0MHZ5dm_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2c2emR2NDB2eXZvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Day of Commemoration events held in Republic of Ireland,,,,,,,

Denise Pesina 48 also allegedly left Crimo III 21 in a hot car when he was a toddler and completed 100 hours of community service for driving under the influence in 2012.

Lake County court documents shed additional light on Crimo III's troubled childhood and his mother's tumultuous past.

On Monday the 21-year-old was accused of killing at least seven people and injuring dozens more after climbing on top of a roof above a July Fourth celebration and then opening fire.

HIGHLAND PARK FOURTH OF JULY SUSPECT GREW UP WITH BOOZY PARENTS WHO OFTEN CALLED 911 TO HOME: DOCUMENTS

""If you're growing up in that kind of traumatic environment it can create an imbalance"" said John Kelly a criminal profiler and psychotherapist who has interviewed numerous killers. ""There's no question about it.""

He said early childhood is most important to a person's formative years but brain development can continue into their mid-20s.

In August 2002 when Crimo III was a toddler Pesina allegedly left him in a hot car for 27 minutes while shopping at Toys ‘R Us.

""Defendant left Robert Crimo III unattended in a motor vehicle while the motor vehicle was parked in a Toys R-US (sic) parking lot 1610 Deerfield Road Highland Park Lake County Illinois for about 27 minutes while the windows were rolled up the car was off and the temperature outside was about 79"" the warrant reads. He was 2 at the time.

That landed her a conviction for endangering the life or health of a child a Class A misdemeanor.

""If nobody cared about him as a child growing up then he didn’t have that empathy"" Kelly told Fox News Digital Friday. ""Why does he have no remorse or no guilt or no empathy for other human beings? I’ve seen this in a lot of serial killers because they were abused.""

And in 2012 Pesina was sentenced to a year of probation and 100 hours of community service for driving under the influence after getting pulled over with a flat tire and a BAC of .21%. She had a ""strong odor of alcohol on breath and failing [field sobriety tests]"" a police officer wrote in a report at the time.

HIGHLAND PARK FOURTH OF JULY SHOOTING: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

She completed her community service in ""a very commendable fashion with a good attitude"" according to a letter from her supervisor.

The charges are in addition numerous 911 calls to the Illinois family’s home on McDaniels Avenue in which the parents repeatedly blamed each other for verbal arguments. Many of the disputes ended with Robert Crimo Jr. Crimo III's father leaving for the night either voluntarily or at the request of police and he was arrested at least once.

HIGHLAND PARK FOURTH OF JULY PARADE ATTACK: SHOOTING SUSPECT'S FATHER NOT IN THE CLEAR YET POLICE SAY

One shocking case came before Crimo III was born involving Pesina's ex-boyfriend Steven Brown.

In 1999 Pesina sought an order of protection against Brown whom she accused of sexually assaulting her 4-year-old daughter Crimo III's half-sister. The girl's father had previously died of carbon monoxide poisoning according to court documents. She also had to sue to establish paternity so that the child could have a share of her father's estate.

The mother and daughter each went to counseling and Pesina spent time hospitalized ""due to the physical abuse of Steven Brown."" Pesina also alleged that Brown harassed her and her daughter by making ""unwanted phone calls and appearances at their place of residence.""

Pesina had other issues with men besides her husband while Crimo III was growing up.

A man named David Daniels is named in several police reports at the family’s home claiming to be Pesina’s ""boyfriend"" which she disputed.

She also accused a neighbor William Hollander of making unwanted advances to her and Crimo Jr. called police one night to tell them the neighbor gave his wife a bottle of wine.

Police also visited the family home twice in 2019 due to alleged threats made by Crimo III although his parents declined to file complaints and no crimes were charged.

Had police or the parents had intervened then Kelly argued Crimo III may not have been able to legally purchase the four firearms he later picked up including the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle that he allegedly used during the massacre.

""The way it usually works is he would’ve been arrested he would have to get a lawyer"" Kelly said. ""The prosecutor would have said ‘Get him into counseling and get us some reports on him. We want to make sure he’s not a danger.' … He would’ve been evaluated for mental health and at that point in time I don’t know if he would have still been able to buy the rifle.""

The first incident in April came after Crimo III allegedly threatened to kill himself. The second was for threats to kill his family. Later that year he applied for an Illinois Firearm Ownership ID with his father's sponsorship.

""I've seen this a million times where alcoholic parents then feel guilty because they were drinking and carrying on and fighting and everything while raising the kid and their guilt causes them to be enablers"" Kelly the criminal profiler said. ""And what that all means with him is I don’t know everything because all the information isn’t out there but that could create a situation where the father would be enabling him by helping him purchase the rifle.""",,,,,,

It was early 2021 and the pandemic had devastated the neighborhood forcing dozens of stores and restaurants to close. The rise of anti-Asian hate crimes had shaken residents and local business owners.

But Ms. Yu believed that a bookstore was just what the neighborhood needed.

She raised around $20000 on GoFundMe enough to rent a narrow storefront — a former funeral supply store — on Mulberry Street in downtown Manhattan. A neighborhood grant gave her $2000 for shelves and books. And in December she opened Yu and Me Books which specializes in titles by and about immigrants and people of color.

The store was profitable within four months Ms. Yu said.

Yu and Me Books is one of more than 300 new independent bookstores that have sprouted across the United States in the past couple of years in a surprising and welcome revival after an early pandemic slump. And as the number of stores has grown the book selling business — traditionally overwhelmingly white — has also become much more diverse.

“People were hungry for a place focused on Asian American and immigrant stories” said Ms. Yu 27 who worked as a chemical engineer and supply chain manager before opening the store. “That’s something I was always searching for when I went to bookstores and I wanted people to come here and not have to search.”",,,,,,,,,

Much like cruise line loyalty programs reward you for sailing cruise casinos offer additional perks for your shipboard gaming activity.

Each of the three largest cruise lines has its own casino rewards programs. Royal Caribbean has Club Royale Norwegian Cruise Line has Casinos at Sea and Carnival Cruise Line has Players Club. You'll need a players card with each program to earn status and rewards which is either your cruise card or a separate card you get once you sign up.

If you'd like to nab everything from free drinks to free cruises from your casino play you'll want to sign up for these cruise line casino rewards programs the next time you sail. For even greater benefits discover how to leverage onboard benefits from your elite status elsewhere and follow these tips to get the most out of your time on the gaming floor at sea.

Basics of cruise casino loyalty programs

Cruise-based casino programs operate similarly to their land-based counterparts but with a few crucial differences. You can earn rewards and status for your gaming activity on board a cruise ship and the more you wager the more you'll accrue of both. Like most loyalty programs you'll only earn rewards if your qualifying activity is tracked so remember to use your players card whenever you gamble.

Earning rates vary and aren't always disclosed but the industry standard is for players to earn 1 redeemable point and tier credit for every $5 wagered on reel slots and every $10 wagered on video poker machines. These rates are explicit on both Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line cruises.

Earning rates for table games depend on what you're playing how much you bet and how long you play but since the house edge is lower you can expect to earn less per dollar wagered than you would playing slots. Note that some games (like Texas Hold 'em and coin pushers) aren't eligible to earn rewards.

One major difference from many land-based casinos is that cruise ship casino programs reward you exclusively for gameplay; you won't earn points or benefits from dining shopping or any other onboard activities. Cruise lines instead offer separate loyalty programs that reward guests for sailing activity though some benefits overlap between the two programs.

You can typically redeem earned points for free play or credits to your onboard bill; specifics and minimum redemptions vary by loyalty program. The cruise lines are not transparent about the points-to-dollars conversion rate for credit.

Royal Caribbean Club Royale

(Photo courtesy of Royal Caribbean International)

Club Royale membership is open to guests 18 years or older on most sailings; you must be 21 or older to play on Alaska voyages. You can enroll by using your SeaPass card at an eligible slot machine or presenting it to casino management at a gaming table. You can also enroll before sailing by calling a casino representative at 888-561-2234 or (if you have sailed previously with Royal Caribbean) through the Crown & Anchor Society.

Club Royale offers four status tiers based on gaming activity during the program year which starts April 1 and ends March 31 of the following calendar year.

Choice (1 tier credit).

Prime (2500 tier credits).

Signature (25000 tier credits).

Masters (100000 tier credits).

Choice status lets you redeem points as free play or as credits to your onboard expense account (with a minimum redemption of 5000 points). You'll also begin earning Instant Cruise Rewards Certificates which range from a $100 discount to a complimentary cruise (minus port taxes and fees).

Prime status waives convenience fees up to 5% and gets you complimentary drinks in the casino. At this level you'll also get an annual complimentary cruise in an interior cabin on select sailings (again minus taxes and fees). Signature status gets you complimentary Wi-Fi for one device and upgrades the annual complimentary cruise to a balcony cabin.

Finally the top-tier Masters status adds a slew of perks like priority entertainment access and dining reservations an onboard credit of up to $100 luggage delivery access to exclusive events and a further upgrade to a grand suite on your annual complimentary cruise. You can view a full list of benefits with more details on the Club Royale site.

While you can accrue tier credits for the duration of the program year Royal Caribbean does not carry over redeemable points from one cruise to the next. Unredeemed points expire at the end of each voyage so don't miss the deadline to cash out (typically the night before debarkation).

Norwegian Cruise Line Casinos at Sea

Casinos at Sea is separate from Norwegian's Latitude Rewards program and is open to guests 18 years or older. You can enroll at the casino host desk (which is worth a visit anyway as I'll discuss later). Casinos at Sea offers five status tiers based on gaming activity during the program year which again runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.

Jade (0 points) .

Pearl (5000 points).

Sapphire (15000 points).

Ruby (35000 points).

Elite (100000 points).

Jade status allows you to redeem points as free play or toward onboard expenses like spa treatments specialty dinners and credits to your final bill. The minimum redemption is just 1000 points on sailings of four days or fewer and 2500 points on sailings of five days or more.

At the Pearl level you get a $100 onboard credit complimentary house drinks in the casino free play when sailing in your birth month and stateroom amenities like complimentary candies or dessert delivered to your cabin. At this level you'll start earning discounts on staterooms.

Mid-tier Sapphire status gets you waived convenience fees and priority disembarkation on top of a bump up to complimentary premium drinks a $200 onboard credit and better stateroom discounts. Ruby status adds another step up to larger stateroom discounts and complimentary Ultra drinks along with waived cash advance fees and a complimentary internet package of 400 minutes or 1250MB.

You'll find the high-end benefits when you earn top-tier Elite status which further augments some of the benefits already mentioned and adds a complimentary shore excursion (up to $300 per person for two guests) private transfers and waived service charges.

Note that while Casinos at Sea operates on Norwegian Cruise Line as well as sister cruise lines Oceania and Regent Seven Seas Cruises the benefits described above are specific to Norwegian only. Check the full list of benefits to see which ones apply to your trip.

One feature that sets Casinos at Sea apart from Club Royale is the option to carry points over from one cruise to the next. Points expire 18 months after they're earned rather than at the end of your trip so regular cruisers can build up a sizable balance over time. However if you'd like to redeem points for credit to your onboard bill Norwegian specifies a weirdly tight redemption window which is 6 to 9 p.m. on the last day of your cruise.

Carnival Cruise Line Players Club

The Players Club is available to guests 18 years or older. You can enroll when using your Sail & Sign card in the casino either by inserting it in a slot machine or presenting it to a dealer at a table game.

Unlike with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian (and even Carnival's own VIFP loyalty program) status tiers in the Carnival Players Club are not well defined. Carnival doesn't publish details of how casino perks are earned or redeemed specifying only that ""comps are extended on board based on your level of play.""

However Carnival does advertise four tiers of invitation-only cruise packages with rewards similar to what you'll find in other cruise casino programs so you can get a sense of the available benefits even if the threshold to unlock them is unclear.

At the lower end Getaway cruise packages offer extras like complimentary drinks in the casino premier boarding and special treats or gifts delivered to your room. The mid-tier Premier and Ultra packages come with added perks such as invitations to special events and priority debarkation while the top-tier Elite packages add luxury benefits like a complimentary airport transfer and shore excursion as well as VIFP Club Platinum status for the duration of your cruise.

Ultimately Carnival's path to status is less straightforward than in the other programs but the perks of playing are comparable.

How to leverage casino status for cruise benefits

Your existing status with land-based casino and hotel programs may also qualify you for perks on your next cruise.

The MGM Rewards program offers members a variety of benefits on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises. These range from discount offers and welcome amenities for Sapphire and Pearl members to onboard credits of up to $300 and annual complimentary cruises for Platinum and Noir members. You'll need to validate your MGM Rewards status and request these benefits at the time of cruise booking (at least 10 days before departure).

This creates an opportunity to parlay your World of Hyatt elite status into benefits with both MGM and these two cruise lines with its status match offer. However note that the MGM Platinum and Noir cruise benefits are exclusive to members who earned their tier based on gameplay and other eligible spending; status earned by matching from another program won't cut it.

Caesars Rewards doesn't offer onboard benefits to its elite members but it does offer stateroom discounts as high as 30% on Norwegian Oceania and Regent Seven Seas cruises. Like with MGM and Hyatt you can match your Wyndham Rewards status to Caesars to access these savings.

Finally Carnival offers a chance to earn complimentary cruises and benefits when you show proof of loyalty status with other casinos via the Players Club Fun Match program. One cool aspect of this program is that Carnival considers status from any casino not just the big names so status you've earned at smaller local venues is worth entering.

I tested this myself by submitting proof of my Caesars Rewards Diamond and MGM Rewards Gold status. Within a few days I got an offer for a complimentary interior room with free drinks in the casino and onboard credit.

4 tips to help you play the game

Whatever your status level these suggestions can make your casino experience more rewarding.

Make friends with the casino host

If you plan to spend a lot of time on the gaming floor get acquainted with the casino host early on. While comps and tier benefits are generally prescribed based on your gameplay the casino host has some autonomy to offer perks at their discretion.

They may be able to comp select onboard purchases like meals and shopping expenses and they can always answer questions help you navigate the program and explain which benefits you have and haven't earned. Being on good terms with the host certainly won't hurt.

Look for enrollment and promotional bonuses

Cruise casinos frequently offer incentives to get you in the door such as free bets or matched play; inquire at the host desk if you don't see them advertised elsewhere.

Another common promotion is to load free slot credits to guests' accounts at the start of a trip but these typically expire after the first day or two so use them quickly or lose them.

Finally check whether your cruise offers a ""learn to play"" session which may come with complimentary drinks and casino chips for both novice and experienced gamblers.

You can play with credit — for a fee

Cash is king at the casino but if you're wary of traveling with a big stack of bills you may be able to play by charging your linked onboard account instead. That account settles at the end of your trip along with the rest of your folio using whatever credit card you have on file which means you can effectively earn credit card rewards for casino gaming.

Using a card that earns bonus points on travel purchases is a nice cherry on top of your wins if you come out ahead or it can at least lessen the sting of your losses if you don't. However the cruise line may add a convenience fee for such charges so confirm you're not paying extra before you complete the transaction.

Understand that the odds are against you (even more than usual)

Cruise ship casinos routinely offer game variants that favor the house more than is customary. After all you're a captive audience; it's not like you can go gamble next door instead!

Expect to see rules like blackjack that pays 6 to 5 (instead of 3 to 2) roulette with triple zeros and reduced payouts on slots and video poker machines. The bright side of this is that you'll generally encounter lower minimum bets than you would at brick-and-mortar casinos especially compared to the Las Vegas Strip.

Bottom line

While it's fun to earn perks casino play is not an efficient path to earning elite status. If you're earning 1 tier credit per $5 wagered on reel slots you'd need to bet $12500 or $25000 to reach first-tier status with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian respectively and a whopping $500000 to reach top-tier status in either program. Those figures refer to the amount wagered and not the amount won or lost but if you (generously) assume a payout rate of 90% then you can expect to lose about $50000 reaching the top tier. With that in mind the perks of status seem a lot less perky.

You could beat the odds and end up a winner with status to boot but ultimately playing in the casino solely to earn elite benefits is a losing proposition. Instead think of these programs as a way to get some extra rewards out of whatever gaming you already planned to do.

If Japan’s Best Car can be believed Toyota thinks so and it’s dusted off the circa 2015 Toyota S-FR concept for production with the help of Daihatsu and Suzuki—two small car specialists the former of which is a Toyota subsidiary. Do we want to believe?

Advertisement

Of course we love the MX-5; we are enthusiasts who love sporty cars and Toyota’s no stranger to the segment. The last car it built in this class was the MR-2 Spyder a nominal Miata competitor that appealed to the quirkier and more hardcore enthusiasts. It had less curb appeal and more “budget Elise” mojo. But the S-FR (well the concept which is old) has one thing the MR2 Spyder doesn’t: undeniable cuteness. Rather than an amphibian shape made out of Duplos the S-FR is funky and organic—more Kermit and less Kerbal.

Forbes’ Japan-based reporter put hands on the exclusive Best Car report and from this we understand that the appeal of shared development costs and partner automakers is what makes the revival feasible. Well rumored revival. The evidence is thin to be clear. The Daihatsu Vision Copen apparently previews the bones of a future S-FR and seems an appropriate basis; the windshield surround and the doors look very S-FR. It’s rounded and cute. Toyota-izing it would be a simple task.

After all if Daihatsu is making a small convertible already it wouldn’t be difficult for Toyota to create a larger more powerful version at a different price point. Bringing in Suzuki’s small engine expertise would help reduce costs as well. Consider the BMW underpinnings of the latest Supra and the co-development of the GR86 and the Subaru BRZ. Toyota has signaled it won’t build a sports car without some aspect of it being shared or already in existence.

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs."

Salesforce debuts Marketing Cloud Engagement on Hyperforce in India

Salesforce announced that Marketing Cloud Engagement on Hyperforce will be available in India",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIxODM4ODUvYWlybGluZXMtYXJlLXBpbG90aW5nLWEtcHJvZ3JhbS10by1zZWxsLXplcm8tY2FyYm9uLWZsaWdodHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines are piloting a program to sell “zero carbon” flights,"Business travel is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions in the corporate world.

The business software vendor Salesforce for instance generated 146000 metric tons of carbon emissions—roughly equal to the annual emissions of 18000 US homes—just by flying its employees around the world to client meetings and conferences in 2019. For comparison that’s about 60% as much carbon as all of Salesforce’s data centers generated that year hosting cloud computing services for over 150000 clients.

Salesforce has vowed to cut its carbon emissions to zero by 2040. To reach that goal the company will have to find a more climate-friendly form of business travel. That’s why Salesforce is one of dozens of companies experimenting with buying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates which are designed to give business travelers a way to book carbon-neutral flights. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has backed the concept and is designing an accounting framework that would allow airlines to sell SAF certificates to their biggest corporate clients.

If it works proponents say the scheme could help companies cut their carbon emissions jumpstart the market for lower-carbon jet fuels and create a pathway to decarbonize the airline industry by 2050.

The World Economic Forum’s SAF certificate framework

SAF is a category of jet fuels that releases between 50% and 80% less carbon than standard petroleum-based jet fuel. Right now SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of the fuel used in commercial flights because it’s more expensive than standard jet fuel and supply is very limited. But if there were an economic incentive for manufacturers to produce more SAF and for airlines to buy more of it the aviation industry could cut its carbon emissions considerably.

To create that economic incentive the WEF—along with airlines and some of their largest business travel customers—are designing a system they’ve dubbed “SAF certificates.” Under the proposed system companies like Salesforce could buy SAF certificates from airlines to offset the carbon emissions generated by their employees’ business travel. Airlines would use the money they make from selling these certificates to buy a certain amount of SAF instead of traditional jet fuel. By replacing a set amount of jet fuel with lower-carbon SAF the airline would reduce its carbon emissions by a clear measurable amount.

If the program is designed well—with transparency oversight and clear accounting—a company like Salesforce could buy SAF certificates and meaningfully reduce its business travel emissions to zero.

Airlines and their biggest corporate travel clients have been testing out the concept since 2021. Last year 11 companies including Boston Consulting Group Nike and HP bought enough SAF certificates from United Airlines to subsidize the purchase of about 3.4 million gallons of SAF (about 0.1% of United’s fuel consumption). In February JetBlue announced four companies including Salesforce will buy enough SAF certificates to subsidize 325000 gallons of SAF (0.05% of JetBlue’s 2021 fuel consumption).

The WEF has used data from some of these early transactions to design an accounting system for tracking how much each SAF certificate sale helps reduce carbon emissions. The organization plans to publish its accounting rules in September and test them out with a new round of experimental SAF certificate sales later this year. The WEF aims to establish a global SAF certificate market which meets the standards of environmental watchdogs like the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) by 2024.

What are sustainable aviation fuels?

Many types of fuel can count as SAF including biofuels made from corn algae used cooking oil municipal trash sewage and other forms of waste or synthetic fuels like liquid hydrogen created using renewable electricity. The key requirement is that all these fuels must emit at least 50% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel.

For now most SAF is biofuel made from used cooking oil which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions (pdf) by as much as 84% compared to conventional jet fuel. But there simply isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to meet the airline industry’s fuel consumption according to Mike McCurdy an engineer who heads the energy advisory department at consulting firm ICF. McCurdy estimates there’s enough readily available kitchen grease out there to produce 3 to 5 billion gallons of fuel a year split between SAF and biodiesel for trucks. Commercial airlines by comparison used 95 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2019.

Meeting the airline industry’s fuel needs through SAF will require fuel producers to refine the process for converting woodchips crops and household food waste into biofuels. But those fuel sources will require years of research and construction to scale up and become cost competitive. For instance one of the earliest alcohol-to-jet-fuel facilities operated by the alternative fuel startup LanzaJet aims to produce just 10 million gallons of SAF per year from corn ethanol when it opens at the end of 2022.

The SAF market’s chicken-and-egg problem

The SAF market needs billions of dollars in investment to scale up production to replace conventional jet fuel. But the market is stuck at an impasse. Airlines are reluctant to buy SAF because it typically costs about twice as much as conventional jet fuel. And manufacturers are reluctant to produce more SAF because airlines don’t want to buy it.

SAF certificates offer a way to break the impasse and start a virtuous cycle. If business travelers were to subsidize the extra cost of buying lower-carbon fuels airlines would be willing to use them. Greater demand from airlines should incentivize manufacturers to produce more SAF. As manufacturing scales up costs would fall and eventually SAF could become cost competitive with petroleum-based jet fuel according to Eliot Lees vice president for clean transportation at ICF.

“The challenge is priming the pump and getting this new renewable jet fuel into the fleet as quickly as possible” said Lees. “If you wait for the market to do it it’s going to be a challenge to meet the emissions target that both the federal government is pushing and the industry is trying to achieve.”

“If you wait for the market to do it it’s going to be a challenge to meet the emissions target that both the federal government is pushing and the industry is trying to achieve.”

“Priming the pump” starts with a handful of companies that collectively fly millions of employees around the world each year. Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Boeing Deloitte JPMorgan Chase McKinsey Microsoft Netflix and Salesforce are the founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) a group of corporate business travel giants committed to buying SAF certificates to push airlines and fuel manufacturers to ramp up SAF production and use. “Because there is significant concentration in demand for flying especially around corporate [travelers] we believe we can send a very strong signal to the market and help create the market for SAF” said Tarek Helmi who leads Deloitte’s work on sustainable energy.

Recent spikes in oil prices have brought SAF and conventional jet fuel closer to cost parity: The average US price of SAF is $8.33 per gallon compared to $7.33 per gallon for conventional jet fuel. But even small price premiums for SAF can be a big barrier for airlines according to Lees. “Aviation is a highly competitive industry with very small margins that there’s significant pressure to maintain and jet fuel makes up 30% of airlines’ costs” he said. Paying an extra dollar a gallon for fuel would eat into airlines’ margins at a moment when even the biggest firms are struggling to break even.

The SAF certificate accounting challenge

Before the WEF can help establish a trusted global market for SAF certificates it will need to create a transparent carbon accounting system. The certificates won’t have any value unless the businesses that buy them have can prove they are truly reducing carbon emissions as much as they say they are. Otherwise companies that buy SAF certificates will face the same accusations of greenwashing that plague the carbon offset market.

The best way to create that trust is through a clear consistent accounting system that wins the endorsement of recognized authorities on corporate carbon cutting schemes. Getting those organizations’ buy-in is crucial for convincing companies to spend money on SAF certificates according to Andrew Chen who heads the aviation decarbonization team at the Rocky Mountain Institute an environmental consulting group that helped found SABA and is working with the WEF to design the SAF certificate accounting system it plans to publish in September.

“The Science Based Targets Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are going to look at that suite of documents and say ‘Is this legit? Have they really thought through all of this? Do they have an accurate accounting approach?’” said Chen. If SBTI and GHGP aren’t satisfied companies will have a hard time justifying SAF certificate purchases.

So far the groups have been cautiously supportive of the WEF’s efforts. SBTI endorsed the sale of SAF certificates (pdf) to business travelers as a way to cut carbon emissions in August 2021. But the organization noted “the practicalities of corporate SAF procurement and accounting are currently poorly defined in the market” and stressed the need for more standard accounting practices before it could throw its full weight behind any SAF certificate scheme.

First airlines need to demonstrate that they used their certificate money to buy additional SAF on top of whatever quantity of SAF they were already legally required to buy. The EU for instance is considering a rule that would require airlines to buy jet fuel blended with at least 2% SAF by 2025. Airlines would have to buy that legally mandated amount of SAF first and then buy even more to fulfill their SAF certificate commitments.

Second airlines need to create clear consistent pricing for certificates across the industry. In early SAF transactions prices have ranged widely. Deloitte published a report detailing its experience buying SAF certificates from American Airlines Delta and United Airlines between February and April 2021. The consulting firm wrote that it paid an average of $130 per metric ton of carbon emissions avoided—but the prices ranged by more than $90 a ton between airlines and none of the airlines offered clear breakdowns explaining how they set their prices.

“We paid what we believe to be the price premium for sustainable aviation fuel over [conventional jet fuel] but it’s certainly not a transparent market yet” said Lisa Newman-Wise Deloitte’s climate chief of staff.

How can the airline industry reach zero emissions by 2050?

Ultimately SAF alone won’t get the airline industry to cut its carbon emissions to zero. Even if airlines replaced every drop of jet fuel they use with SAF they’d only reduce their emissions by 50% to 80%. To reach net zero airlines will have to replace their existing fleets of jet-fuel-burning planes with new models that can run on electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.

But those airplanes haven’t been invented yet. It will take decades for established planemakers like Boeing and Airbus or startups like ZeroAvia to develop a new generation of zero-emissions jets that can carry hundreds of passengers long distances. In the meantime airlines will keep buying conventional planes that burn jet fuel and those planes will stay in the sky for an operating life of up to 30 years.

SAF offers a way to bring down the airline industry’s emissions now as a bridge between the current generation of heavily carbon-emitting planes—which contribute more than 2% of all global greenhouse emissions—and that future generation of yet-to-be-invented zero-emission planes.

“This is what has to happen if we want to enjoy the benefits of an economy that is connected by aviation in the future and one that doesn’t create unacceptable climate impacts” said Chen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY2FuLWVsb24tbXVzay1iZS1mb3JjZWQtdG8tYnV5LXR3aXR0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can the courts force Elon Musk to buy Twitter now that he doesn't want it?,"Elon Musk claims he is ""terminating"" his agreement to buy Twitter. But ""terminating"" a $44 billion corporate merger agreement isn't as simple as saying ""Hasta la vista baby"" and smoking it with a pistol. So Twitter for its part is on the verge of waging legal warfare and somewhat bizarrely trying to make Musk finish buying the company whether he wants to or not.

But can the courts really force this transaction to be completed when one party wants out? And is that actually the outcome Twitter wants?

For what it's worth it's what Twitter is signaling it wants at least for the time being. Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor apparently tweeting on behalf of Twitter's board of directors of which he is a member claims his fellow board members are dead set on ""closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk"" and that Twitter ""plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement.""

""We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery"" Taylor added referring to a state court where disputes like bankruptcy are sorted out by an official with the title ""chancellor"" instead of ""judge."" The ""Delaware"" part is because Twitter is incorporated in the state of Delaware  instead of California where it's headquartered.

So to recap: Twitter's shareholders are dragging Musk to an obscure (to most people) court in Delaware in the hopes that a chancellor will force him to take Twitter off their hands at the amazingly generous price of $44 billion. As of this writing Twitter's market capitalization was closer to $28 billion so you can sort of see why Musk might not want this.

But according to Ronald Gilson professor of law and business at Columbia University this is far from the only possible outcome. ""One resolution is for Musk to pay Twitter an amount that reflects the loss from Musk not completing the purchase"" Gilson told Mashable. ""The fight is ultimately about money"" he pointed out.

So the legal proceedings may it seems come down not to a trial but to a squabble about Musk's actions having deprived Twitter's shareholders of a yet-to-be-determined sum of money along with exactly what that sum is and whether or not he's legally required to cough it up. ""There are a lot of questions embedded in how dueling experts will calculate that amount but the Chancery Court has a lot of ways to get the two sides to negotiate in order to avoid a trial"" Gilson said.

The two parties finding a compromise in order to avoid a trial would be a relatively mundane outcome. But Gilson continued ""my understanding is that the acquisition agreement was written to severely limit Musk’s ability to do precisely what he is now doing.""

Indeed the actual text of the agreement includes language about a legal concept known as ""specific performance"" an alternative to awarding damages in a dispute that under the right circumstances would require the transaction to be completed. Matt Levine a legal columnist at Bloomberg wrote on Saturday  ""I like Twitter’s odds — its odds of getting specific performance and making Musk close the deal — in court but I don’t think anything is a certainty at this point.""

Musk claimed his whole Twitter acquisition was ""on hold"" back in May because he claimed Twitter had deceived him — and by extension the world — about the number of bots on their service. Many commentators treated this like a transparent stalling tactic  but it's also a fairly serious allegation that could be construed as fraud. In June  Twitter lavished Musk with data in order to put his spambot fears to bed.

If we take Musk at his word Twitter's avalanche of data did not calm his fears at all. In fact he's apparently more certain than ever that they are knowingly flogging a service that is overrun with spambots. The letter Musk's lawyers wrote to Twitter attempting to break off the deal claims that Musk has been making a good faith effort to work out an accurate count of ""monetizable active daily users"" or ""mDAUs"" as opposed to spambots and he's not happy about what he found.

""While this analysis remains ongoing all indications suggest that several of Twitter’s public disclosures regarding its mDAUs are either false or materially misleading"" the letter says. Now the spambot claim in the letter looks like it's going to be a major pillar of the legal argument Musk's lawyers are going to make in that aforementioned Delaware court.

If that doesn't work and the two sides don't compromise it looks like Musk really might become the new owner of a bird-themed social media website that he no longer wants.

And according to Gilson ""Musk may well be playing a weak hand.""",,,,,,

Michael and Katie Goldberg of Manhattan claim they “would never have entered into or continued the transaction” according to a complaint filed June 28 in Westchester Supreme Court against KOSL Building Group Mamaroneck and owner Bobby Ben-Simon “had they known the true state of affairs.”

“If I had to summarize” Ben-Simon said in a brief telephone discussion “it is a frivolous lawsuit 100% because everything was done legally and these people simply did not perform and there are consequences for not following signed documents.”

The Goldbergs wanted to build a house on Cooper Road in Scarsdale and in January they began discussing a deal.

Ben-Simon of North Greenwich Connecticut represented himself as a prestigious local builder according to the complaint who had developed hundreds of luxury properties and run a company with “exceptional financial and operational wherewithal.”

Mrs. Goldberg agreed to buy the land from KOSL and the couple agreed to hire the company to build a house to their specifications.

Ben-Simon allegedly said he was unaware of any land use disputes regarding the property. Everyone understood the complaint states that the Goldbergs would get financing and the builder would cooperate with the lender.

The couple paid a $210000 deposit on a land contract and $328800 deposit on a construction contract.

KOSL and Ben-Simon immediately defaulted on their obligations the Goldbergs claim by refusing to give the lender the house plans; three references from previous projects; or KOSL’s credit litigation operational and licensing histories.

Eventually some information was provided according to the complaint but it was incomplete or inaccurate. Instead of providing house plans for exampleÂ KOSL offered plans for a different house it had previously planned to build on the property.

The Goldbergs discovered that Ben-Simon and his companies had been sued recently according to the complaint by investors home buyers and vendors claiming they were owed millions of dollars.

KOSL formed in 2019 “did not and could not have had the financial or operational experience or wherewithal” that Ben-Simon had represented the complaint states and the company appeared to be on the brink of insolvency.

The couple claims they tried to resolve the dispute but Ben-Simon demanded that the land deal close by June 27 and claimed entitlement to both deposits.

The Goldbergs are accusing Ben-Simon and KOSL of fraud by misrepresenting and omitting significant facts to induce the deals; breach of contract by ignoring their obligations such as cooperating with the lender; and breach of the duty of fair dealing by preventing them from “receiving the fruits of their contracts.”

They are asking the court to declare that they have no obligations under the construction contract and that they are entitled to both deposits. They are demanding unspecified monetary and punitive damages.

“At the end of the day” Ben-Simon said “it’s about the facts. … I believe a red line was crossed here and there will be severe legal consequences.”

The company donated about $150000 of pet food.

According to Better Choice Company the efficiency of its supply chain allowed it to support the donation despite the supply chain challenges heavily impacting the industry at large. The company donated nearly 65000 lbs of dry and wet cat and dog food from its Halo Pets brand.

“We’ve partnered with Greater Good Charities for many years and are proud to support their efforts in times of need” said Scott Lerner chief executive officer of Better Choice Company. “When our industry experiences supply chain challenges shelters are often the first impacted so we felt that this was the right time to act.”

Greater Good Charities is a global nonprofit that strives to support people pets and the planet. The nonprofit has recently focused its efforts on Ukraine striving to support those impacted by Russia’s invasion of the country and supporting pet food manufacturer Kormotech’s Save the Pets of Ukraine initiative.

Another tweeted: ""What are thoseeee.""

There were also pleas for Thiago to tell pal Busquets to give the sandals back to his wife.

One person added: ""Why is Busquets wearing his nan's shoes?""

But in its latest ‘update’ on efforts being made to improve Firefox Snap performance the company may at last deliver a real-world speed boost to back those claims up.

Startup time of the Firefox Snap is up to 50% faster on fresh installs than before.

The first key improvement is courtesy of Mozilla developers who have tweaked the browser’s behaviour to only load one locale (aka language pack) on first start based on system settings rather than loading in all languages available.

Canonical’s Oliver Smith says this change “significantly reduces the initial setup time. Our testing shows an average reduction of about 6 seconds on modern systems with fast storage.”

A second speed boost comes by way of compression algorithms. Firefox uses libraries from the gnome-3-38-2004 and gtk-common-theme Snaps which during launch it has to decompress to access.

By switching the compression algorithm used from the slower XZ to the faster LZO (which is what the Firefox Snap itself uses) there’s an instant speed boost. Better yet this change benefits all Snap apps that make use of these GNOME and GTK libraries such as the Chromium Snap.

The next batch of startup time optimisation is going to look at multi-thread CPU decompression for Squashfs software rendering and pre-caching.

Want to see if it’s made an improvement on your system? You can install the app GNOME extension to measure app startup times on Ubuntu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9yb3lhbC8xNjM4MDIzL0thdGUtbWlkZGxldG9uLW5ld3MtbGF0ZXN0LXBpY3R1cmVzLUtlbnNpbmd0b24tcGFsYWNlLWV4aGliaXRpb24tdXBkYXRl0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzcy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFsLzE2MzgwMjMvS2F0ZS1taWRkbGV0b24tbmV3cy1sYXRlc3QtcGljdHVyZXMtS2Vuc2luZ3Rvbi1wYWxhY2UtZXhoaWJpdGlvbi11cGRhdGUvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Never-before-seen snap of Kate Middleton goes on show at Kensington Palace this week,"Kate Middleton seen in yellow dress as players enter court

The photo is tipped to show the Duchess of Cambridge’s “natural warmth” as she speaks to a young girl. Kate will be smiling and holding a posy of flowers in the photo a close-up of the Duchess after the Sandringham Christmas service in 2014. The photo will be unveiled as part of Historic Royal Palaces’ Life Through A Royal Lens exhibition.

Kate Middleton news: Never-before-seen snap of Duchess goes on show at Kensington Palace

The collection reveals a series of never-before seen images of the Royal Family that were taken by the public. This will include a photo of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh when they were dating in 1977. Another will depict the Prince of Wales on horseback during a polo match in the mid 1980s. Kate’s new snap was taken by Amy from London who explained the event. She said: “I’ve often been to Sandringham with my aunt to see the royals on Christmas Day as my family lives nearby in Lincolnshire. “Kate was asking a young girl about her Christmas dinner plans and had been given so many flowers she could barely hold them all.

The new pic shows Kate's warmth towards children

“It was so worth getting up early and standing in the cold to take this photo which I think shows Kate’s natural warmth and affinity towards children.” Nearly 1000 images were submitted following an appeal to the public to share their own memories of the Royals in the Platinum Jubilee year. Of these 50 were chosen to be displayed. The Kensington Palace exhibition also includes work by renowned photographers Norman Parkinson Rankin Annie Leibovitz and Cecil Beaton. Another image shows the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh driving past crowds of well-wishers in Derby during the Silver Jubilee of 1977. The monarch is seen in another photo smiling broadly despite the rain at the opening of The Lowry theatre and gallery complex in Salford in 2000.

The impediments were substantial for the team from the American company L3Harris which also had experience with spyware technology. They started with the uncomfortable fact that the United States government had put NSO on a blacklist just months earlier because the Israeli firm’s spyware called Pegasus had been used by other governments to penetrate the phones of political leaders human rights activists and journalists.

Pegasus is a “zero-click” hacking tool that can remotely extract everything from a target’s mobile phone including messages contacts photos and videos without the user having to click on a phishing link to give it remote access. It can also turn the mobile phone into a tracking and recording device.

NSO had acted “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States” the Biden administration said in announcing the blacklisting in November barring American companies from doing any business with the Israeli firm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTgyMjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Predicting potential wildfire severity across Southern Europe with global data sources,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722018228 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTgyMjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc291dGhlcm4tY2hhcm0td2hhdC1pcy10aGUtanVwaXRlci1pc2xhbmQtY2x1Yi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern Charm: What Is The Jupiter Island Club,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vc291dGhlcm4tY2hhcm0td2hhdC1pcy10aGUtanVwaXRlci1pc2xhbmQtY2x1Yi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

But there’s at least one other complication in the mix: negotiating new pilot contracts.

Each of the nation’s largest carriers is in the process of trying to strike a deal with pilots. In some cases airlines appear ready to pay substantially higher wages with two major airlines recently offering to raise pay more than 14 percent in the next year and a half.

But money alone may not be enough. Pilot unions are also demanding changes that they say would improve operations and their members’ quality of life particularly as flight disruptions throughout the recovery have left pilots feeling frustrated and overworked.

They may be well positioned to get what they want industry analysts say. A brewing pilot shortage was worsened during the pandemic when airlines encouraged thousands of pilots and other workers to accept buyouts and early-retirement offers. Now with the industry hiring pilots at record numbers but struggling to attract train and retain them their unions are pushing hard for broader changes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzA5L2FpcmxpbmVzLXVyZ2VkLXRvLWxldC1mYW1pbGllcy1zaXQtdG9nZXRoZXItb24tcGxhbmVzLWJ5LXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWRlcGFydG1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airlines urged to let families sit together on planes by Transportation Department,"The Transportation Department on Friday urged airlines to make it easier for families to sit together on planes at no extra charge.

The department said in a notice to airlines that the carriers “should do everything that they can to ensure the ability of a young child” 13 or younger to sit next to an older family member.

The agency said it will monitor airlines starting in November and might propose new regulations.

The trade group Airlines for America said carriers “have always worked to accommodate customers who are traveling together especially those traveling with children and will continue to do so.”

The Transportation Department said it has received more than 500 complaints in the last five years about families unable to sit together. However that is only about 1% of all complaints against airlines and is dwarfed by gripes about refunds and flight problems.

There is no existing law that requires airlines to make seat assignments for families that would upgrade a passenger to a more expensive seat at no extra charge. BOEING/AFP via Getty Images

In 2016 Congress prodded airlines to let kids sit next to a family member at no extra charge but the Trump administration Transportation Department did not draft rules on the matter and neither has the Biden administration.

The department said Friday that airlines could do several things to help relatives sit together including assigning adjacent seats at booking or setting aside areas for families.

Increasingly airlines charge extra for desirable seats to boost revenue. The 2016 law does not require them to make seat assignments that would upgrade a passenger to a better cabin or seat if there is an extra charge for that seat.

The department also issued a bill of rights for airline passengers with disabilities a summary of existing laws that travelers can use as a reference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25wdWJsaWNtZWRpYS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3cy9zY2hvb2wtc2hvb3RpbmcvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC80MjgzNTMvdXZhbGRlLXJlc2lkZW50cy1tYXJjaC1mb3ItdW5oZWFyZC12b2ljZXMv0gGDAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25wdWJsaWNtZWRpYS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3cy9zY2hvb2wtc2hvb3RpbmcvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC80MjgzNTMvdXZhbGRlLXJlc2lkZW50cy1tYXJjaC1mb3ItdW5oZWFyZC12b2ljZXMvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uvalde residents march for ‘unheard voices’,"Uvalde residents including the father of one of the children killed in the mass shooting in May organized a march and rally to remember the victims Sunday evening. They gathered at Robb Elementary School Sunday evening and marched through 105 degree temperatures to the plaza in downtown Uvalde for a rally for accountability and increased school safety as well as gun reform.

A couple hundred people endured the 105 degree heat Sunday in Uvalde to call for gun control and protest the botched police response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary in May. Twenty-one people were killed in the shooting including 19 children.

The event was organized by Javier Cazares the father of one of the victims 9-year-old Jackie. He gave the families a platform to call for change.

Families activists and community members met at Robb Elementary and marched nearly a mile to the plaza downtown.

They chanted ""Not one more child! Not one more child! Not one more child!""

Once they made it downtown a representative of every one of the 21 victims lined up at the front. Some said a speech. Others simply said the name of the child or sister they lost.

The official narrative of what happened on May 24 has changed many times over the past month and a half. Most recently a report commissioned by the Texas Department of Public Safety found that a Uvalde police officer had the chance to stop the mass shooting at Robb Elementary before it began something Don McLaughlin said is false.

There is also still disagreement between DPS and local officials about whether Uvalde CISD Police Chief Pete Arredondo was the incident commander at the time of the shooting and what DPS’ role should have been with more than 91 state troopers in the area as law enforcement waited more than an hour to confront the gunman.

Like many relatives of the victims Laura Morales is frustrated by the conflicting information state and local officials have provided over the weeks since the shooting. She's the aunt of 10-year-old Eliahna Torres one of the 19 children killed.

""I want to know what happened. I want to know what was said” she said. “I want to knowwhat was the holdup? Where was the action?""

The chairman of the state legislative committee investigating the shooting recently requested a video of the 77 minutes police waited in the hallway be released to the public — but he said the local district attorney denied his request.

Others at the march pointed out that easy access to guns in the U.S. and in Texas is what made this shooting possible.

“All this pain and grief we feel sadly could have been prevented” said Faith Mata sister of Tess Marie Mata — a 10-year-old girl who was killed in the shooting. “But a war weapon is more important to our current governor than the life of his people.”

Vincent Salazar Sr. grandfather of 11-year-old Layla Salazar — another victim in the shooting — said he cannot stay quiet about the politics around guns.

“We cannot keep this under the rug no more. There are too many people who got hurt here and are still grieving. I know I grieve every single night for these children including my own granddaughter” Salazar said. “With that said we have to have the courage to move on but let’s do it for the right reasons. Let’s vote for the right reasons and not the pocketbook. Please people we need to go out and vote.”

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening.

The firings are among a few dozen cases around the US where workers have alleged they have been fired from the coffee retail chain during a union organizing campaign at their store. More than 180 Starbucks corporate retail stores in the US have voted to unionize and more than 300 have filed for union elections.

Ryan Dinaro a shift supervisor at the 16th and Tremont store in Denver who worked at Starbucks for around four years was fired shortly after his store won their union election in May along with four other workers at his store and five others at two other Denver stores according to the union.

Dinaro explained the union organizing campaign started in January after seeing Starbucks workers in Buffalo New York win their union election in December 2021. He said they were organizing in response to safety concerns policy changes and pay problems as inflation and rising prices hit Dinaro and his co-workers.

“Partners are selling their blood at the store myself included I’ve sold my blood to get some extra money” said Dinaro. “What we’re simply asking for is safety in the workplace adequate pay to address the strain inflation is placing on us and the ability to have a say on unilateral policy changes that affect us.”

He argued that leading up to the union election and after it Starbucks increased management presence in stores and began strictly enforcing company policies where nine workers involved in union organizing at the stores in Denver were fired in just a few weeks after the union election wins.

Dinaro claimed the firings were in retaliation for union organizing.

“I came in late the second time in six months and Starbucks decided that is enough to fire me. They decided that they’re going to enforce attendance and punctuality very hard in my case” he said. “It’s an attack on our legal rights to organize. We’re addressing these violations through all the legal channels and all the public channels we can but they’ll get away with it for a while because the courts are slow.”

Hannah 28 who requested to keep her last name anonymous for fear of discrimination from prospective employers was fired from her job days after her Starbucks store on Holly Street and Leetsdale Drive in Denver voted to unionize.

She explained that leading up to the union election her store had a constant presence of managers from outside the store who were constantly surveilling and scrutinizing workers. In five years at Starbucks she rarely saw district or regional managers who were suddenly at her store on a regular basis.

“Every single day for three months I walked in expecting to be fired. For five weeks in a row they would sit me down with a district manager and manager interrogating me about what happened on this day what about this customer interaction and they were just taking notes and some of them were complete blatant lies that they made up” she said.

Hannah described the surveillance and constant scrutiny as harboring a toxic work environment that she said forced many workers to quit. Other complaints included reducing store hours enforcing policies such as dress codes or whether a worker clocked in a minute early or a minute late and denying all her time off requests.

“They were clearly trying to get me out of there because I was the most vocal about unionizing and encouraging others to be pro-union” she added. “They do not care about their workers. They call us partners. They treat us like garbage when we ask for the teeniest bit more.”

Monique McGeorge 60 worked at the Holly Street and Leetsdale Drive Starbucks location in Denver for more than a year before she was fired shortly after workers at the store voted to unionize.

Semi-retired and working part-time McGeorge strongly supported her younger co-workers who wanted to unionize. She said after the union vote the store reduced its hours and the presence of outside managers in the store significantly increased.

“People were getting written up for little incidents and it was mainly people that were supporting the union” said McGeorge. “The Starbucks culture has changed and they’re going to do what they’re going to do to not have the union and it’s blatantly obvious. I just cannot believe the amount of people that have been fired just in the Denver area alone because they’ve supported the union.”

McGeorge explained her firing resulted from getting a write-up while working the drive-thru short-staffed.

“They fired me and I’ve been there 15 months with no write-ups. I’ve never been in trouble” said McGeorge who noted an outside manager was the one who told her she was fired after working a shift on 24 May. “When they gave it to me I just laughed at him. I said ‘You guys are really cleaning house aren’t you?’ Because it was pathetic.”

Pronouns are some of the most frequently used words in the English language as it’s a way we address or refer to others in our everyday conversations and routines. Other than a person’s name it is one of the main ways that people can identify and express themselves. Additionally pronouns allow us to respect identities across the gender spectrum by giving individuals the opportunity to self-identify and connect with others as their authentic selves.

Over the last three decades Starbucks Canada has been committed to creating a safe community for our partners (employees) and customers where differences are embraced and building a culture that fosters a sense of belonging. Creating these safe spaces includes the right to self-identify and be addressed by one's chosen names and pronouns.

In 75 countries worldwide the green apron is a symbol of Starbucks that signals a warm welcome and expert coffee craft from the over 300000 baristas who wear one daily. Earlier this year Starbucks made pronoun pins available for all partners in Canada to wear on their green apron to further foster an inclusive environment in our stores that honours and respects all the identities of our partners.

This small but profoundly impactful addition to a partner's green apron celebrates the Pride our partners show in their stores daily. Through this we are not only supporting our partners of the LGBTQIA2+ community to be their authentic selves at work but we're also helping to reduce the stigma associated with gender pronouns.

Pronoun pins for all partners strengthen the foundations we are building upon for a better future for our LGBTQIA2+ partners and community. Steven (he/him) Co-Chair of the Starbucks Canada Pride Network

""We're giving partners an environment to be proud of and thrive in by simply empowering them to be who they are. With these pins we can move quickly beyond an introduction and build strong relationships with others as our true selves"" shares Starbucks Canada's Pride Network Co-Chair and a partner of over a decade Steven (he/him).

Toronto-based partner Blair (he/they) feels similarly about our push for more resonant inclusion. ""Pronouns are incredibly important in my store. It's good that everyone is clear about their pronouns so we can respect one another and make sure we're all seen and heard. We're all beautiful individuals and we feel safe expressing our identities in our café and that respect is mirrored with our customers!""

By understanding the importance of personal pronouns and normalizing the use of gender-inclusive language we can all take the very important step toward respecting people's identities accepting all people as they are and creating a sense of belonging where everyone is welcomed. Last year Starbucks partnered with Interligne to share best practices for pronouns to help create a safer and more inclusive space for everyone which have been supported by the company at large. This includes normalizing mentioning your own pronouns when you introduce yourself and indicating your pronouns in email signatures at work.

Starbucks is a long-standing supporter and ally of the LGBTQIA2+ community affirming every way people may choose to identify. We believe that being proud of who we are—in and out of the workplace—extends beyond a few months in the year.

A screenshot from a Chick-fil-A ad.

Some ideas sound so good in theory.

Yet when put into practice they bring with them unforeseen complications. Problems even.

I'm concerned then that Chick-fil-A customers may shiver a touch on learning of the chicken chain's latest -- and possibly greatest -- creation.

Chick-fil-A has a big problem. Its drive-thrus are both extremely inefficient and immensely popular.

They're slow. They cause traffic jams. They cause the chain to be slurred as a public nuisance.

Why Chick-fil-A estimates that a third of its customers leave the drive-thru line before buying anything because they're fed up with waiting.

So the company is trying something new. Well new to Chick-fil-A. It's introducing a drive-thru lane exclusively for mobile orders.

Yes if you had the spontaneous urge for a fried chicken sandwich you may be in a long long line. You may also look over your shoulder and see some fellow Chick-fil-A customer breeze through another line grab their food and go.

Now where have you seen this before? That's right Starbucks. Where you stand in line hoping to have a quick chat with your friendly barista. Meanwhile some surly person pushes through grabs their pre-ordered drink without so much as a thank-you and wafts away to surl at someone else.

I almost forgot to give you the big sell. Chick-fil-A's big sell that is.

Jonathan Lassiter a senior integration leader on Chick-fil-A's Service and Hospitality team crowed: ""The express drive-thru lane is a game-changer for our busy customers and our team members.""

So the customers are busy but the team members aren't? What an odd juxtaposition.

Lassiter calls this ""a more streamlined experience."" Some might prefer to describe it as ""a force-the-customers-to-download-our-app experience.""

The Chick-fil-A method is slightly less simple than that of Starbucks. At the latter you just walk up to the mobile orders find your name on a cup or a bag and off you go.

At Chick-fil-A you'll have to pull up at the so-called Express lane pull out the app scan a QR code and only then get your order "" from a friendly restaurant team member.""

Lassiter explained that this is still better than talking to a friendly restaurant team member: ""The lengthiest part of our drive-thru ordering process is the brief wait to get your order taken. The express lane cuts down ordering and payment time significantly granting customers access to greater speed ease and convenience when they want it most.""

Chick-fil-A believes this new creation is a step forward in personalization. Which some might snort is the tech word for dehumanization.

In its testing Chick-fil-A says its Express customers have loved it so much they've chosen that lane again. Which perhaps shows that humans are now far more interested in speed and convenience than in say interactions with other humans.

Around 60 Chick-fil-A restaurants are enjoying the new Express service. Naturally Chick-fil-A promises more. However talk to many a Starbucks barista and they may tell you that this dedication to app orders isn't quite the nirvana it seems.

People can sometimes make too many mobile orders at the same time causing a flood with no respite. Then they get angry when their order isn't ready at the promised time. Then they get angrier because it's the morning and they haven't had their coffee yet.

Now it's one thing to be without your coffee it's another when you're just plain hangry. I fear for many of the friendly team members when they're trying to say ""my pleasure"" and all they get is a grab of the takeout bag and a grunt akin to that of a dog with colic.

Still this is the trend for fast food isn't it? Inspired by the pandemic all fast food chains are becoming little more than vending machines. You roll up you speak to a machine you pay and you go.

What may be fascinating however is how much this new system will erode Chick-fil-A's brand image.

When you're known for your (extremely) friendly customer service will that be eroded as the customer experience becomes less personal? Or rather less human?

Or is the love of the product so great that customers really don't care that much about the human side of things?

Perhaps they just say they don't.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29sLmNvbS90aGUtYXNjZW50L3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZXMvc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLXJld2FyZHMtbWVtYmVycy1jYW4tZ2V0LTUwLW9mZi1hLWRyaW5rLWV2ZXJ5LXR1ZXNkYXktaW4tanVseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks Rewards Members Can Get 50% Off a Drink Every Tuesday in July,"Find out how to get 50% off your Starbucks beverage on Tuesdays in July.

He could walk the white sands fish the emerald green waters and never had to worry about traffic. Even though Panama City Beach was yet to have a name he was one of the first residents with the beach all to himself.

His name was Teddy. And he was a hermit.

More on St. Andrews:'Back to nature': St. Andrews State Park reopens youth group campground with $60K grant

Now:St. Andrews' renaissance is here: What projects to expect and when they're coming

Teddy Tollefsen wasn't always a hermit but he was always a fisherman. He was born in 1882 in Trondheim Norway. He left home at 14 to sail the seas and first came to America in 1906 after fishing waters around the world. Tired of working for others Teddy began fishing for himself first settling in Pensacola before moving on to St. Andrews where he hoped to try his luck fishing for red snapper.

A life and St. Andrews history changed

In 1929 the Bahamas Hurricane made an unwanted visit to Panama City and changed Teddy's life forever. On Sept. 30 of that year the storm made an unexpected sharp turn to the northeast and made landfall near Panama City with winds gusting over 100 mph. Two deaths were reported in the area one in Panama City and one in Wewahitchka.

Much of the Teddy's history is a mix of fact and fiction or maybe failing memories from old-timers who would see him around old St. Andrews. So separating the fact from fiction is an adventure almost a century later.

Take the night of the hurricane. One published account says Teddy stayed with his boat all night in the storm finally clinging to a tree and dodging debris as the storm swept his boat out into the bay. But another account says Teddy left his boat at Courtney Point for higher ground to ride out the storm.

The stories converge when Teddy went looking for his boat in the morning only to find it was gone. He would spend the day combing the area before finding what was left of his beloved boat across the bay in an area that is now part of St. Andrews State Park.

His 26-foot 5-horsepower livelihood was beyond repair. It also was his home and everything he owned. So Teddy made a decision to take apart the vessel and build a new home.

With wood from the boat and an endless supply of driftwood from the hurricane Teddy built a 9-foot by 12-foot cabin that would become his home for the rest of his life. For 25 years visitors would recount Teddy saying ""The boat wrecked here so we've stayed together.""

Over the years Teddy added more and more things to his home including a wood cook stove a table a bunk and a battery-operated radio. He lighted his shack with lanterns and decorated it with numerous nautical artifacts he would salvage from shipwrecks around the bay.

He added a small storehouse for his fishing equipment and built a pier to launch his skiff for the 4-mile journey over to St. Andrews. He would make a living selling his fish or trading for tea sugar grits and oatmeal especially oatmeal. He was fond of oatmeal and would eat it once or twice a day.

Teddy would make the trip to town about every six weeks. He had 11 chickens he kept around for the eggs and a one-eyed rooster to keep them all in line. He would recall to a reporter in 1953 how he never had a need for ice. He would just dig down into the sand until he reached a cool damp level to keep his eggs and other food items fresh.

He also had a pet pig who loved to go boating.

Where once a wilderness stood

To understand how Teddy became a hermit you have to forget about Panama City Beach as you know it. In 1929 things were much different around Bay County sort of one-sided. If you lived in Bay County you lived in Panama City St. Andrews or somewhere east of the brand new Hathaway Bridge. The west side of the bridge was a wilderness laced only with sand dunes and sea oats.

Initially you would have to cross 6 miles of sand to get to Teddy after crossing over the new bridge. Or you could maneuver a boat 4 miles across the bay. So Teddy's access to people slowed to a trickle.

Bill McNeil grew up in St. Andrews where he lived for 84 years before he passed away in May.

""I can remember as a kid going over the new bridge to the beach"" McNeil told The News Herald earlier this year. ""There wasn't a thing over there nothing but that old hermit.""

Over time Teddy's legend as the St. Andrews Hermit would grow just as the beach would evolve.

In 1933 the Army Corps of Engineers began construction of a deep-water channel through the peninsula and created the jetties that border the gateway to the Gulf of Mexico. Even though it took more than a year of construction Teddy was allowed to stay.

When World War II broke out Teddy's home and the area around it was incorporated into a military reservation. Large gun batteries were brought in to protect the city. Through it all he was allowed to stay.

And when St. Andrews State Park was established in 1946 Teddy was given special permission to live out his life on the government property.

During the next eight years more and more people would come to the beach as the park itself became a destination. Teddy became good friends with Claude Willoughby the park's superintendent. Many of the details of Teddy's life have been documented over time due to the friendship between the two.

In 1954 Willoughby was on a tour of the park and stopped by to check on Teddy only to find him sprawled on the floor of his shack. He would die later that day at a Panama City hospital.

Inside the shack Willoughby found a tin with enough money for Teddy to be buried in Greenwood Cemetery. Reports say 100 people attended his funeral including Tallahassee dignitaries.

Teddy lives on

Later Willoughby took down the shack and removed all the evidence that a hermit once lived on the sand. He saved many of the items and the park put them on display inside the nature and welcome center.

Pictures and Teddy's identification card are in that display So are netting shuttles a telescope a boat horn and an alarm clock. The display is on the wall in a corner not far from a stuffed deer and an owl.

On the west end of the park's campground 75 feet from the water between campsites 101 and 102 the scrub oaks and sand dunes have reclaimed what was once Teddy's rustic home.

A new shower and restroom facility for campers complete with indoor plumbing sits just a few feet away.

State and 220 S. State. Located at the corner of W. Adams St and S. State St the unanimously approved resolution may lead to a potential landmarking of the towers teeing up a standoff between the City of Chicago and the federal government.

Presented through an informational presentation during the commission’s July meeting the buildings have come into the spotlight after Congress approved $52 million for the demolition of the two towers. Since the announcement of the funding extensive press coverage has followed including the addition of the buildings to Preservation Chicago’s annual Most Endangered Buildings list and Landmarks Illinois’ similar endangered buildings list. According to landmarks staff the two towers were suggested to the Program Committee for landmark designation and a large number of communications to staff have been made requesting landmark designation.

Located at 202 S. State the Century Building holds the corner of W. Adams St and S. State St. Built in 1915-16 with Holabird and Roche as the architects the 16-story white terracotta tower remains relatively unchanged. Built from 1911 through 1913 the Consumers Building stands at 220 S. State and was designed by Mundie and Jensen out of white terracotta. Adding to the concentration of terracotta-clad skyscrapers both buildings are part of the National Register’s Loop Retail Historic District.

With the Dirksen Courthouse building sharing the block with the towers the General Services Administration (GSA) purchased the Century and Consumer Buildings in 2005 alongside the other State St-facing structures on the block. The Berghoff is the only establishment on the block not owned by the federal government. An RFP was issued by the GSA in 2015 for the towers but the development did not move forward.

Hon. Rebecca Pallmeyer chief judge of the Northern District of Illinois joined the meeting to answer questions and represent the district court. Pallmeyer outlined the government’s plan to demolish the towers and replace it with open green space citing security concerns for the courthouse and the effort to create a security buffer zone. While advocating that the demolition would open up the State St corridor and execute Mies van der Rohe’s vision for an open plaza that would open up to State St Pallmeyer acknowledged the legal obligations for the court and GSA to seek viable alternatives before going through with demolition.

During the discussion Commissioner Burns asked if the Chicago Archives Center proposal spearheaded by Preservation Chicago had been formally submitted and presented to the GSA. Pallmeyer stated that to her knowledge no formal proposal has been submitted but she would like to have it be presented to them. The plan calls for the adaptive reuse of the towers into archive space for religious organizations which could provide a center for religious studies and research in addition to storage space.

As also mentioned by Pallmeyer a letter submitted by the GSA outlined the process required before demolition. The GSA and district court will go through several reviews to explore viable alternatives to demolition. Expected to begin late this summer or early in the fall a public process will include community meetings to discuss the buildings. At the local level landmarks staff will now prepare a report for the next Commission on Chicago Landmarks meeting which may lead to an official preliminary landmark report setting up a potential landmark recommendation to the City Council.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xsYW5kc2VudGluZWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvZmlmdGgtdGhpcmQtYmFuay1maW5kcy1idXllci1oaXN0b3JpYy1idWlsZGluZy1kb3dudG93bi1ob2xsYW5kLzEwMDEyMjMzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fifth Third Bank finds buyer for historic building in downtown Holland,"HOLLAND — Fifth Third Bank has sold its historic building in downtown Holland.

Plans for the three-story office building at 36 E. Eighth St. remain unclear. The sale included two additional parcels behind the building which hold a parking lot and a drive-thru that exits on Ninth Street according to reporting from MiBiz.

The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs shows Holland Lakeview Holdings is owned by Corporation Service Company. The president treasurer secretary and director of Corporation Service Company is Bruce C. Young a partner at the firm.

The historic property was listed in October 2021 by NorthStar Commercial LLC. The listing was removed from the company's online property inventory by February.

The decision to list came after years of consideration by Fifth Third Bank over what to do with the space. The building is known as one of Holland's architectural gems.

The space began its life as People's State Bank which opened two days before Christmas in 1905 at 29 E. Eighth St. before moving to its permanent location in 1928. The ornate building ""reflected the lavishness of an Italian palace with an Art Deco-style"" according to research by local historian and Holland resident Steve VanderVeen.

The founding directors of the bank were W.C. Walsh John H. Kleinheksel George P. Hummer Douwe B. Yntema Arend Visscher C.J. Lokker and Bastian D. Keppel.

The building is listed by the city as a landmark property.

When the series was initially launched we did not have the MSRP/ RCP for the SoCs. At the time the big question was down to price. Now we have that information and it appears as though these small chips are not immune to inflation with a caveat. Let us get to it.

Intel Atom C5000 Series Updated with Pricing Inflation Takes Hold

When we originally looked at the new Atom C5000 SKUs we had a fairly good grasp of the storage-focused C5100 series and the networking-focused C5300 series. Intel will be pushing its QuickAssist Technology in the coming quarters and we already have in the pipeline two pieces showing some of the dramatic offload benefits as an update to our Intel QuickAssist at 40GbE Speeds: IPsec VPN Testing and OpenSSL and Setup Tips pieces from 5-6 years ago. The Atom line has changed to embrace acceleration and that is reflected in the new parts. Still we did not have pricing.

With the latest update we were able to add pricing into the equation and it seems as though Intel is using $213 as the base recommended price for 4-core models and $299-320 for the 8-core parts. That puts the per-core pricing in the $37.38 to $53.25 range.

To us it seemed a bit higher than we remembered so we added these to the 4 and 8-core Atom C3000 series SKUs we had numbers for.

What we saw is that the RCP for the new chips has gone up. Just taking an average of the SKUs above 4 cores in the Atom C3000 line were $20.35 and in the Atom C5000 series they are fixed at $53.25. On the eight-core parts it was less dramatic with the C3000 average of $24.44 and the C5000 average of $38.25. roughly doubled for the quad-core parts and the eight-core parts.

Again a big part of the increase is not just the cores themselves but the other features of the SOCs.

We discussed the acceleration in the Intel Atom C5000 and P5000 Acceleration Including Networking and QAT piece but those accelerators mean fewer PCIe-based components smaller packages but also higher TDPs. Not adding a 25W PCIe accelerator and an extra NIC means that the net costs can go down especially with the C5300 series but the SoC prices go up.

Final Words

At this juncture prices have increased on just about everything so the Atom C5000 series is no different. Still these increased prices will mean more expensive end devices in some classes since the floor to get into a 4-core Atom has gone from $64 to $213. It seems like Intel will need to have something like the Jasper Lake series STH has been doing reviews of recently to provide a lower-cost and lower-acceleration solution in the market that cannot handle $200+ pricing on Atom C series SoCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All the different 5G ranges explained,"If you’ve been thinking 5G seems more complicated than the cellular technologies that came before you’re not entirely wrong. 5G promises faster performance better coverage and ubiquitous connectivity to power the next generation of autonomous cars and smart devices. To accomplish this it needs to push the boundaries of what was possible with older cellular technologies.

This also requires 5G to operate across a much wider range of frequencies. After all we’re talking about a technology that has the potential to replace wired broadband connections and even many traditional Wi-Fi networks. In the future a 5G network won’t be something you merely fall back on when a better connection isn’t available — it may very well be the best connection you can get.

So what frequency does a 5G network operate on? There’s no single straightforward answer to that but it’s also not as complicated as it appears at first glance. 5G networks use many different frequencies but these can all be grouped into three specific ranges each with its own pros and cons.

The speed and range trade-off

Before we discuss the frequency ranges used by 5G it’s essential to understand why so many different frequencies are needed. The answer to that question is something you may have already experienced in your own home.

Modern Wi-Fi routers operate on two frequencies: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. If you’ve ever tried to get the best Wi-Fi coverage in your home you’ve probably encountered a fundamental reality of how radio waves work. You’ll get slower speeds when connected to your 2.4GHz network but you can also stay connected even when you stray farther away from the router. On the other hand the 5GHz channel gives you much better performance but you may not make it to the other end of your house.

While these naturally have a much shorter range than cellular radio towers the same principles apply. Higher frequencies can carry more data but don’t travel as far and don’t penetrate solid objects nearly as well. Lower frequencies go much farther and are less prone to interference but they’re also much slower.

Mobile network operators need to consider these same tradeoffs when building their 5G networks. The highest-frequency 5G signals can provide insanely fast wireless speeds but can’t cover much more than a city block. At the other end of the spectrum low-frequency signals can go for miles but don’t offer performance that’s noticeably better than older 4G/LTE technologies.

Sub-6 versus mmWave

When 5G was rolling out the industry divided the frequencies into two generally broad ranges: Sub-6GHz (Sub-6) and millimeter wave (mmWave).

As the name implies the Sub-6 frequencies were intended to include all those below 6GHz while the 5G mmWave spectrum started at around 24GHz and went up from there.

In practical terms early Sub-6 5G rollouts stayed mainly below the 2GHz range. Since these frequencies were already used by 4G/LTE and even older 3G networks carriers already had the necessary licenses to use them. This made it easy to quickly roll out 5G on top of their existing networks and that’s precisely what T-Mobile and AT&T did.

Specifically AT&T and T-Mobile set up their 5G networks on the same 850MHz and 1.9GHz (1900MHz) frequencies used by the earliest “2G” GSM networks and the 700MHz and 1.7GHz (1700MHz) frequencies that came into use with the 3G and LTE rollouts. AT&T also ran some 5G services in the 2.3GHz range while T-Mobile went down to 600MHz to get even better coverage for its “nationwide” 5G network.

Meanwhile Verizon decided to go in the opposite direction with its initial 5G rollout using the much faster 28GHz mmWave frequency. This allowed Verizon to boast the fastest speeds; a 2020 OpenSignal report had Verizon well in the lead globally with average download speeds of 506Mbps since it had no Sub-6 5G networks to pull down its score. However the extremely limited range of mmWave frequencies meant fewer than 1% of Verizon customers even saw the company’s 5G network appear on their smartphones.

The challenges of low-band 5G

Low-band 5G let AT&T and T-Mobile get their networks up and running very quickly as they didn’t have to wait for new licenses plus they could also piggyback on existing 4G infrastructure. However it’s that latter point that made early 5G performance so underwhelming for many folks.

To make 5G and 4G peacefully coexist on the same frequencies carriers had to turn to a technology known as Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). This new 5G capability allowed it to yield the airwaves to older 4G traffic.

The problem with this is that 4G networks know nothing of DSS; 4G hadn’t been taught how to share so it was always up to 5G traffic to politely step aside whenever 4G traffic showed up. In other words older and slower 4G signals always got priority over newer and faster 5G.

This means that in addition to being hampered by the limited capacity of lower frequencies low-band 5G networks also had to contend with making way for all the 4G traffic on those airwaves. It’s little wonder that early 5G networks couldn’t deliver speeds that were noticeably faster than 4G.

Even when Verizon finally turned on its low-band Nationwide 5G network in late 2020 to bring 5G to the other 99% of its customers its 5G performance was so poor that some experts recommended folks switch off 5G on their smartphones to save battery life.

New mid-band spectrum changes the game

Following those initial rollouts two things happened that showed industry experts may have erred in lumping all sub-6GHz frequencies into a single “Sub-6” category.

Both of these involved the use of a higher frequency mid-band spectrum although the carriers approached it from two different angles.

Thanks to its 2020 merger with Sprint T-Mobile had an ace up its sleeve. Sprint had made the unusual choice of running its 4G/LTE network almost exclusively on a swath of 2.5GHz spectrum well above the range used by the other carriers and older GSM and 3G networks.

However instead of keeping this older 4G/LTE network around T-Mobile surgically decommissioned all Sprint’s towers freeing up that 2.5GHz spectrum to be used exclusively in new 5G rollouts. This gave T-Mobile faster frequencies to play with that wouldn’t be burdened by 4G signals. Hence 5G traffic had a clear path on those airwaves without the need to employ DSS to yield to older 4G traffic. This became the backbone of T-Mobile’s 5G Ultra Capacity network.

AT&T and Verizon weren’t quite so lucky. While AT&T had some 2.3GHz spectrum it didn’t have enough to make a difference. Instead both carriers had to wait until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) freed up some more spectrum in what’s now known as the C-band range.

An FCC auction in early 2021 saw Verizon drop $45.4 billion to secure as much of this spectrum as it could. AT&T also spent over $23 billion and even T-Mobile picked up a piece of the pie for $9.3 billion. This gave the carriers the right to run 5G networks on frequencies between 3.7GHz and 3.98GHz.

Both carriers began putting this new spectrum to good use earlier this year and the higher frequencies are already proving themselves more than capable of delivering the speeds that 5G promised in the first place. While T-Mobile has a head start thanks to its earlier 2.5GHz deployments Verizon is catching up fast and AT&T isn’t much further behind.

While these mid-band and C-band frequencies are still well below 6GHz they’re in an entirely different class from the low-band frequencies that initially defined the Sub-6 range.

Where does mmWave fit in?

Although the mid-range spectrum has distinguished itself as the sweet spot for 5G offering the best mix of range and performance there’s still a place for mmWave in 5G rollouts.

Verizon may have made a tactical error by putting all of its eggs in the mmWave basket but it had the core of a good idea. Only mmWave can provide the reliability and performance needed in densely populated areas.

AT&T and T-Mobile perhaps understood this better. Both rolled out mmWave more strategically covering places like stadiums concert halls airports and other places where thousands or tens of thousands of people are likely to congregate.

It’s in situations like this where mmWave shines. The higher capacity of the 28GHz and 39GHz frequencies used for 5G mmWave means more bandwidth for many more devices. If you’ve ever been frustrated by poor 4G performance or even a “No Signal” indicator when attending a busy sporting event or concert you’ll be happy to know that mmWave solves this. By using these higher frequencies carriers can provide solid 5G performance to thousands of attendees in a stadium without breaking a sweat.

The 5G frequency mix

It’s probably apparent by now that there’s no one perfect frequency for 5G networks to run on. For carriers to deliver on what 5G promises they have to use a mix of 5G spectrum according to the circumstances.

While C-band and other mid-band frequencies will be the most commonly deployed in urban areas those are overkill for rural coverage where range is more important than performance.

This is why low-band 5G towers will continue to blanket the countryside and the good news is that as more people move to 5G smartphones and other devices the amount of 4G traffic on those frequencies will diminish paving the way for faster 5G speeds even on the lower frequencies.

Meanwhile carriers will continue to supplement their faster mid-band 5G networks with mmWave transceivers in places like stadiums and airports where extra capacity is needed to support large groups of people. Verizon also has no plans to shut down its original mmWave network already found in many urban downtown areas.

What’s next for 5G spectrum?

These three frequency ranges are just the beginning. Carriers are already vying for new blocks of 5G spectrum although it will take some time for all the pieces to be put in place.

For instance a fourth player on the field Dish could end up being a dark horse in this race. Rising from the ashes of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger Dish recently turned on its new Smart 5G network that uses revolutionary new cloud-based technology to make it faster and more affordable to roll out its 5G service across the country.

Dish has been lobbying the FCC to open up the 12GHz band although it’s currently in a fight over this spectrum with Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink service. It’s hard to say how 12GHz will fit into the 5G mix — we’re not even sure what to call it since it lives in the vast gap between Sub-6 which stops at 6GHz and mmWave which starts at 24GHz.

However this 12GHz spectrum could become a new sweet spot providing even faster speeds without sacrificing nearly as much range as the 28GHz mmWave.

T-Mobile and Dish also collectively own licenses for 99% of the 47GHz spectrum although it’s not yet clear what either carrier plans to do with that. The FCC also plans to license more mmWave spectrum in the 57-64GHz 71GHz 81GHz and 92GHz ranges.

Not every carrier is putting its hopes on this extremely high frequency (EHF) spectrum. T-Mobile has been working on achieving mmWave-like speeds on Sub-6 networks using a new feature known as Carrier Aggregation technology. As the name implies this ties multiple low-band and mid-band 5G channels together combining their bandwidth.

However the biggest obstacle to these new initiatives will be waiting for chip and phone manufacturers to catch up. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X60 offers baseline support for T-Mobile’s Carrier Aggregation strategy while the newer X65 and X70 improve on that. This means the iPhone 13 Galaxy S21 and more recent models are ready for it. However the earliest 5G phones like the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra won’t be able to take advantage of it.

New spectrum is another matter entirely. Carriers can open up whatever spectrum the FCC will allow them to but smartphones must also be ready to support those frequencies — and most don’t go beyond the standards that have already been widely deployed.

For example there aren’t any phones on the market yet that support the 12GHz band that Dish is trying to acquire and since this frequency isn’t used by anybody else Dish would have to convince a smartphone maker to get on board with it. The same is also true with the higher-frequency 47GHz spectrum.

Nevertheless there’s a close enough relationship between mobile network operators and hardware manufacturers that if the carriers build it the smartphone makers will come. The critical point is that these things take time so while the 5G spectrum will undoubtedly expand in the next few years it won’t happen overnight.

Get iPhone 13 Pro with $800 discount THIS way; buy it or wait for iPhone 14?,"iPhone 13 Pro price cut by as much as $800? That may sound unrealistic to believe but US Mobile telecommunication company T-Mobile is actually offering the Pro version of the iPhone 13 series with this massive discount. The price cut is alluring but when you know Apple is about to unveil its next flagship iPhone 14 series and that too with some major upgrades of the Pro models it becomes difficult to decide whether to buy the current iPhone 13 Pro now or just wait for the iPhone 14 Pro launch.

Let us help you! The iPhone 14 series launch is still a few months away and considering the leaks and reports this flagship will be much costlier than iPhone 13. Especially the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models. When it will be available for sale and will you get any discounts on the iPhone 14 series everything is uncertain right now. So if you are in a hurry to buy a new smartphone and an iPhone is on your mind then buying iPhone 13 Pro now will be a good choice unless you are ready to pay the expected hefty amount for the iPhone 14 Pro!

So if you are considering buying iPhone 13 Pro then check out this iPhone deal on T-Mobile which is offering a deal that slashes $800 off the final price. But there is a catch! To get the benefit of the entire $800 amount you will need to trade in an old smartphone and get a new line offered by T-Mobile. Let us simplify it!

Like most of you I’m pro-people-giving-me-cash but more generally I think handing out unrestricted currency whether in paper or digital form is an underrated and efficient way to help people.

As we’ve covered at Future Perfect evaluations of cash programs have found that they can function as economic stimulus in one of the poorest regions of Kenya help a therapy program reduce crime in Liberia reduce homelessness in Vancouver fight hunger in areas with food crises and slash child poverty in the US.

With great enthusiasm comes great responsibility though — specifically responsibility to highlight evidence and research that challenges my existing beliefs even ones that seem as obvious as “getting cash is good.” Recent days have seen the release of three big studies of cash transfers in the US and those studies found the transfers did … very little.

Getting an extra stimmy in 2020

The first two studies come from the same team composed of the University of Michigan’s Brian Jacob Natasha Pilkauskas Katherine Richard and Luke Shaefer and Elizabeth Rhodes of OpenResearch a lab running a separate long-term cash study. Their papers analyze two different rounds of $1000 cash grants from the charity GiveDirectly which distributed the money to American households in May 2020 and again in October that year. The money was targeted at low-income people with recipients recruited from a mobile app that helps users manage their SNAP/food stamps benefits.

After surveying recipients as well as a control group of non-recipients the researchers found no differences between the two groups on any of the five outcomes they were interested in: material hardship mental health challenges partner conflict child behavior problems and parenting problems.

In the study covering the May 2020 payments they did find some reduction in material hardship among very low-income households specifically and some weak evidence that mental health improved. But that was about it. And in October there weren’t even those silver linings — even in the subgroups no significant effects were found.

The third study comes from a different team (Harvard’s Ania Jaroszewicz and Jon Jachimowicz and the University of Exeter’s Oliver Hauser and Julian Jamison) and has a slightly different design: their paper analyzed a cash payment program where 1374 recipients got $500 699 recipients got $2000 and a control group got nothing. The median household receiving money earned $1028 a month or $12336 a year below the poverty line for a single person much less for a family. Like the Michigan researchers’ papers the funds were disbursed slightly after the pandemic started but in this case the transfers were made gradually: from July 2020 to May 2021.

(Side note: The paper states that the transfers were funded by “a national non-profit organization that specializes in providing low-income individuals unrestricted cash transfers.” In an email Jaroszewicz stated that the funder wished to remain anonymous.)

The Harvard/Exeter team came to the same conclusion as the Michigan team: the authors found “no evidence that [cash] had positive impacts on our pre-specified survey outcomes at any time point.” If anything they found negative outcomes for recipients’ reported financial medical and psychological well-being — though the authors argue that this is likely due to study attrition and are careful to limit their conclusion to “cash did nothing positive” rather than “cash caused harm.”

Why didn’t cash help?

So … what the hell happened? Why didn’t giving very low-income Americans as much as $2000 lead to them reporting greater financial security better mental health even just being happier?

The Harvard/Exeter team posits an interesting reason: getting the money reminded recipients that they were poor without doing much to change that long-term condition which in turn led to worse psychological health and lower happiness among recipients. Recipients reported thinking more about money reported more financial needs in their life and were likelier to say they were stressed about how to spend the money than people who didn’t get the money. This points to the checks raising the “salience” of people’s financial needs which in turn caused them distress.

Both teams of researchers bring up survey attrition as a possible explanation: it was common for both recipients and control group members to decline to complete the follow-up surveys and it was possible that those who didn’t complete the surveys differed systematically from those who did in ways that affected the results. This is the same kind of problem that led to US electoral polls in 2016 and 2020 being wildly off.

There’s also the fact that 2020 as you may dimly recall was a weird time. This isn’t just because there was an ongoing pandemic with no vaccine yet accompanied by severe isolation that significantly affected people’s mental and physical health. Thanks to unprecedented federal actions low-income Americans were also in an unusually good financial situation.

In all three studies recipients had gotten stimulus checks worth $1200 per adult and $500 per child just a few months before. Some of the recipients in the Harvard/Exeter study also received the December 2020 checks worth $600 each and the March 2021 checks worth $1400 each. Many recipients in all three studies likely benefited from greatly enhanced unemployment insurance payments. UI recipients had median incomes much lower than the general population especially recipients through the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program making the program highly progressive.

It seems plausible that another one-off payment didn’t register the same way amid much larger federal interventions — especially the UI benefit which offered regular infusions of cash.

And moreover the US is a rich country! It was ironically given the conditions an unusually prosperous place for low-income people in 2020. If you want to compare GiveDirectly’s cash transfers in the US to those in extremely poor villages in sub-Saharan Africa the enormous gap in economic outcomes in the two places is very relevant.

The Harvard/Exeter authors note that the $2000 checks they studied represented about 16 percent of the typical recipient’s annual household income. By contrast the landmark 2016 paper studying GiveDirectly’s program in Kenya involved a transfer equal to about two years’ worth of household consumption (a number not too different from income among low-income people without much savings or access to formal loans). A check worth 200 percent of your annual income is obviously very different from one worth 16 percent! Of course the former would have stronger effects.

The studies we need

We also might be getting to a point of diminishing returns on what we can learn from studies of one-time cash drops especially when the outcome variables of interest are the usual suspects of financial mental and physical well-being.

Cash programs have been studied a lot. In 2016 the UK-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI) think tank conducted an evidence review on cash programs that looked at an astonishing 165 different studies. That was six years ago and the evidence base has only grown since with the vast number of basic income pilots around the world as well as one-off cash programs like the ones studied above.

You can draw a few conclusions from the vastness of the evidence base on cash. One is that a handful of new studies shouldn’t massively change your views on the topic. If there were only one prior paper anywhere in the world studying a cash drop like those described above a single new study would double the evidence base. It would be a big deal and should adjust your views substantially. But going from 165 to 166 studies isn’t a radical change.

Secondly it’s worth asking if the research community is focusing resources toward the most important questions remaining about cash. The ODI report concluded that on average cash has a number of beneficial effects in terms of reducing poverty building assets and improving health. There may be diminishing returns in rich countries with extensive safety nets as detailed in the new studies above. But overall the evidence that giving people money reduces deprivation is strong.

Adding nuances to this story like the point at which diminishing returns set in is important and if a group is doing transfers anyway as seemed to be the case with GiveDirectly you might as well run a study of the effort alongside it.

But there are major unanswered questions about cash that don’t have nearly this much evidence behind them. Do people for instance fare better (on any number of metrics) if they get a large lump sum or if they get smaller monthly payments? Does the method of payment (check v. mobile app v. prepaid debit card) matter? Does knowledge of where the money comes from whether from the government or a charity or a subnational arm of government matter? What are the macroeconomic effects of a large cash program? I know of only one major randomized study on the latter question but it’s very important and something that ordinary random studies can’t elucidate.

Perhaps the biggest question outstanding about cash programs is about their political economy: if cash programs are on the merits often superior to programs giving aid in-kind (in the form of housing or food or what have you) why are they comparatively rare? Why don’t politicians like passing them? Why do programs like the expanded child tax credit in the US fail in legislatures while efforts like the UK Tories’ to slash cash benefits in 2012 succeeded?

The longtime DC safety-net policy analyst Robert Greenstein has a new paper looking at some of these questions. He tries to locate factors that explain whether a government safety-net program grew or shrank in the US over the last 40 years. Programs tied to work and that extend to the middle class as well as the poor do better; so do ones that are federally funded and administered.

But one key factor is that successful growing programs “provide benefits either in-kind or through the tax code rather than as straight cash” as Greenstein writes. Programs for the elderly or disabled are an exception to this rule but generally “straight cash” is bad for a program’s survival. Look at the demise of Aid to Families with Dependent Children a cash welfare program ended in 1997 and the relative flourishing of food stamps just as one example.

Greenstein’s paper is not the only one analyzing these questions (see Yale’s Zachary Liscow and Abigail Pershing’s recent study showing in-kind programs are more popular among Americans than cash ones). But this is a line of research that’s crucially important for the fate of cash and has much less in the way of resources behind it than studies looking at cash’s direct effects on recipients.

Again I’m appreciative of new research on cash’s immediate effects. The three studies above certainly complicated my views a bit. But for people interested in cash programs they’re the beginning not the end of the road. To make progress the research agenda has to move forward a bit from what cash does to how to make cash happen.

The study shows the potential aftermath of a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake along the Seattle Fault zone which crosses east and west through the Puget Sound and downtown Seattle.

Scientists say those along the Seattle-area waterfronts and islands across the Sound would have only about three minutes after the quake before the tsunami would arrive. Waves could reach as high as 42 feet along the downtown Seattle Waterfront near the Great Wheel with floodwaters several feet deep eventually inundating Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park home to the Seattle Seahawks and Mariners respectively.

The inundation would last as long as three hours and could keep waters as deep as 20 feet the study found. Floodwaters would spread up and down the inland sea flooding Tacoma – 30 miles to the south – under 6 feet of water as far as three miles inland.

Experts say the last known earthquake to happen in the Seattle Fault happened about 1100 years ago. Geological evidence shows that it was powerful enough to thrust the beach at Restoration Point on Bainbridge Island upward by 23 feet while dropping land at Seattle’s West Point by three feet according to the DNR. If another earthquake happens the study suggests that the land level changes could create an entirely new shoreline in many locations near the Seattle Fault zone.

Despite the major time gap since the last earthquake Scientists say another earthquake is still possible. Geological evidence shows there were five additional earthquakes averaging a magnitude of 6.5 in the Seattle Fault zone in the last 3500 years.

“Although the chances of this happening in our lifetime is low it’s important for families to get prepared now” Maximilian Dixon the hazards and outreach program supervisor for the Washington Emergency Management Division said in a press release announcing the study. “The ground shaking will be your warning that a tsunami may be on the way. Make sure you know where the closest high ground is and the quickest route to get there. Get signed up for tsunami and local alerts.”

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell says studies like this are a critical tool for the city to understand risks and prepare for future emergencies.

But emergency officials acknowledge the study’s results “can be scary” but stress that the study used a “maximum considered event” meaning it has a low probability of occurring.

“This sounds legitimately terrifying. We get it. This earthquake could happen before an alert hits your phone” said officials with the Washington Department of Emergency Management. “If you feel an earthquake drop cover and hold on then evacuate to high ground and get as far inland as you can as quickly as possible.”"

Pokemon Go is highlighting in-person meetups for the July Community Day which will happen on Sunday July 17 2022. For those unaware Niantic already published all the details about the next CD which features Starly.

With the meetups somewhat organised by the game itself the trainers should have an easier time finding people to trade and raid with while trying to find Starly and its Shiny version.

Meeting up will also make it easier to utilise some bonuses. For example having multiple trainers use a single Lure will net them four times the Catch XP near the lured PokeStop for 30 minutes.

You can check out the official map of locations that will feature in-person as well as virtual activations showing all the places in the world where you can join in on the fun. If there aren't any in your vicinity there is always the marker for popular parks which is the next best thing as you are likely to meet other trainers around.

The map has filters for each marker with the orange pins denominating in-person Community Day meetups the blue ones showing where to get extra loot from PokeStops and the green ones showing the popular parks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZGlnaXN0YXRlbWVudC5jb20vY2hpdmFscnktMi1ob3ctdG8tdXNlLW5vdmVsdHktaXRlbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chivalry 2: How to use Novelty Items?,"Chivalry 2 is a medieval-themed contact action hack and slash multiplayer video game developed and published by Torn Banner Studios and Tripwire Interactive respectively. It was fully released for Microsoft Windows PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on June 8 2021. The game can be played from a first-person or third-person perspective and has two major modes; team deathmatch mode and team objective mode and players have access to lots of combat skills and medieval melee weapons like maces battle axes bows and arrows swords and war hammers etc. In this article we will discuss how to use novelty items in Chivalry 2 explain what novelty items are in relation to the game and every other relevant detail you should know about novelty items in the game.

In the game players either get matched with the Agatha Knights recognized through their blue and white outfits or the Mason Order who wear black and red. The Tenosian Empire is the third force in the game that was introduced in a later update. One of the features of the game is the collectible novelty items. Let’s discuss How to use Novelty Items Chivalry 2.

How to use Novelty Items Chivalry 2

Let’s start by explaining what novelty items are in the game. Novelty items in the game usually serve no practical purposes unlike novelty weapons and armor but they can be used for showoff and status symbols and in some cases they perform non-combat functions. Also some novelty items can be used in the customization of other items to give them a better outlook. To redeem a novelty item go to the armory and then customization and ensure you pick a specific class for each of the items. When customizing your characters for instance you can scroll over to the weapons tab and right under it you will find your novelty items. For PC users press 7 while in-game to use equipped novelty items. Xbox users only have to hold the right D-Pad and select the Novelty option. You can equally bind the novelty item to another key to make things more convenient if you are not quick enough with the default keybind on your PC.

Keystone / Nadeem Khawer

A report by the McKinsey consulting firm estimates that the small Alpine country with its highly globalised economy and powerful financial centre has an estimated indirect influence on 2-3% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Domestic CO2 emissions in Switzerland account for almost 50 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalents annually or less than 0.1% of annual global emissions.

But Swiss emissions are much larger if you look beyond its borders according to a studyExternal link by the McKinsey consulting firm published on July 10.

It calculates that imported goods would add another 69Mt of CO2 equivalents per year to the Swiss carbon footprint.

On top of this many international companies based in Switzerland operate mainly abroad. Their annual CO2 emissions account for 300-400Mt of CO2 equivalents McKinsey estimates. And the Swiss financial centre which plays a large international role via investments loans shares and other transactions is responsible for 700-900 Mt of additional CO2 emissions per year it says.

Together the authors estimate that Switzerland has “at least an indirect influence on 2-3% of global CO2 emissions” which would put it on a par with countries like Indonesia Japan and Brazil.

“Contrary to popular belief Switzerland and its economy are not insignificant compared to other global greenhouse gas emitters” says the report which was produced in cooperation with the Swiss business lobby EconomiesuisseExternal link and the WWF environmental group. McKinsey contacted 180 companies and sector organisations for its survey.

Switzerland wants to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. But the country narrowly missed its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 despite coronavirus lockdowns and an unusually warm winter.

Under the terms of the Paris climate agreement Switzerland has pledged to halve emissions by 2030 and intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. But the government was forced to re-draw its plans when voters rejected a package of climate reforms last yearExternal link.

But what's the Model Y's long-term reliability like? It's only been on sale for two years after all so you'd think it would be hard to judge. However one owner YouTuber Gjeebs has clocked up over 40000 miles on his 2020 Model Y. He recently gave his overall thoughts on the vehicle after two years of ownership also going through some unexpected costs he has encountered.

Gjeebs first discussed tires. His stock tires lasted 36000 miles before they had to be replaced. He also had to replace a windshield after it got cracked. Although his car is a Long Range he wants it to look like a Performance so specced 20"" Induction Wheels and got an aftermarket Performance spoiler. He also wrapped his Y pink for a gender reveal.

The YouTuber is a big fan of Tesla Autopilot although he does experience phantom braking from time to time and he feels his Model Y could change lanes quicker. He doesn't think FSD is worth it with standard Autopilot being more than adequate. He thinks the Tesla Supercharger Network is superb. He feels it's a major advantage at the moment although Tesla is opening up the network to other manufacturers in Europe and will likely do so in North America soon.

In general after 40000 miles his car has been perfect. It's cheap to run and the only things he's had to replace are two tires and a windshield. He thinks the Y's comfort and autonomy make it ideal for road trips. It's also very practical as a daily driver with plenty of space. Although it could be built better (frequent rattles/creeks a good bit of road noise) overall he's more than happy with his Y and does not regret buying it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS10ZXNsYS1jcmFzaC10aGF0LWtpbGxlZC0yLXVuZGVyLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tYnktZmVkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida Tesla crash that killed 2 under investigation by federal auto safety watchdog,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government’s auto safety watchdog is sending investigators to another Tesla crash this time one that killed two people along Interstate 75 in Florida.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed Friday that it sent a Special Crash Investigations team to probe the Wednesday crash into the back of a semi-trailer at a rest area near Gainesville.

The agency would not say if the Tesla was operating on one of the company’s partially automated driving systems.

The 2015 model year Tesla was traveling on Interstate 75 about 2 p.m. Wednesday when for an unknown reason it exited into a rest area. It then went into the parking lot and hit the back of a parked Walmart Freightliner tractor-trailer the Florida Highway Patrol said in a release.

The driver and passenger both from Lompoc California were pronounced dead at the scene.

Highway Patrol Lt. P.V. Riordan said Friday night in an email that his agency will determine whether any partially automated features were in use. “That is a consideration that will be explored during our investigation” he said.

A message was left Friday seeking comment from Austin Texas-based Tesla.

NHTSA is investigating 37 crashes involving automated driving systems since 2016. Of those 30 involved Teslas including 11 fatal crashes that have killed a total of 15 people.

The agency also said in documents that it’s investigating a fatal pedestrian crash in California involving a Tesla Model 3 that happened this month. It also sent a team to probe a Cruise automated vehicle crash in California that caused a minor injury in June.

NHTSA also has been investigating Teslas on Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles. In a separate probe the agency is looking at Teslas on Autopilot braking for no apparent reason.

Last week newly confirmed NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff told The Associated Press that the agency is intensifying efforts to understand the risks posed by automated vehicle technology so it can decide what regulations may be necessary to protect drivers passengers and pedestrians. He also says automated systems such as automatic emergency braking have huge potential to save lives.

In June NHTSA released data from automakers and tech companies showing nearly 400 crashes over a 10-month period involving vehicles with partially automated driver-assist systems including 273 with Teslas.

The agency cautioned against using the numbers to compare automakers saying it didn’t weight them by the number of vehicles from each manufacturer that use the systems or how many miles those vehicles traveled.

Automakers reported crashes from July of last year through May 15 under an order from the agency which is examining such crashes broadly for the first time.

Tesla’s crashes happened while vehicles were using Autopilot “Full Self-Driving” Traffic Aware Cruise Control or other driver-assist systems that have some control over speed and steering. The company has about 830000 vehicles with the systems on the road.

The next closest of a dozen automakers that reported crashes was Honda with 90. Honda says it has about 6 million vehicles on U.S. roads with such systems.

Tesla’s crash number may appear elevated somewhat because it uses telematics to monitor its vehicles and get real-time crash reports. Other automakers don’t have such capability so their reports may come slower or crashes may not be reported at all NHTSA said.

Auto safety advocates said driver-assist and self-driving systems have potential to save lives but not until NHTSA sets minimum performance standards and requires safety improvements to protect all road users.

Chinese vs. German Tesla Model Y,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

Over the past few years Tesla has become a global company – if not a global phenomenon. The first significant “EV-only” entry into the market Elon Musk’s car brand redefined speed performance and what it meant to build a desirable car in the 21st century. That success has brought growth and that growth has brought expansion with the American company now opening factories (though not always building cars) in such far-off places as Shanghai and Berlin … but like are the cars made in Germany the same as the ones made in China?

Maybe a more interesting question would be to ask someone who might have preconceived notions about cars built in Germany being better than cars made in China – and there are plenty of Americans who will type out the words “cheap Chinese junk” on an iPhone or MacBook Pro that was very much built in China.

Just Answer the Question

OK OK – I get it. We don’t want to explore the Euro-centric and racial biases of middle class Americans in this one we just want to know what the differences are between the Shanghai and Berlin-built Model Ys.

Lucky for us a detail-oriented YouTuber in the UK called Richard Symon (host of the RSymon RSEV channel) has carefully examined the small differences between a Tesla Model Y Performance that was manufactured at the new Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in Germany and another Long Range Model Y – his own car in fact! – that was made in Tesla’s more established production site in Shanghai China.

Without spoiling too much one of them has a “noticeably” better ride quality and seems to have nicer materials used throughout the interior. Beyond that you’ll have to check out the video below to find out more. Once you’ve done all that though we’d love to hear your take so scroll on down to the comments and let us know!

The technology of batteries used to power electric vehicles has come a long way –- from lead-acid batteries that were used in GM's EV1 back in the '90s to lithium-ion batteries that are now used by most electric vehicle models. Tesla is one of those companies that are leading in the electric vehicle revolution and batteries are the new gold rush.

In its quest to take over the electric vehicle industry and compete with gas-powered SUVs Tesla introduced the Model X a car we've reviewed before. It's a top of the range electric SUV that is built on the Model S platform; that's why they're often compared. Even Jeremy Clarkson who was infamously sued by Tesla for reputational damage thinks the Model X is a fabulous car (via YouTube).

If you've driven a Tesla Model X you've probably experienced range anxiety at some point. Even if you don't have a range anxiety problem you probably can't help but wonder how long will the battery pack could last before you need to replace it."

Director Rob Schroeder and writer Conor Stechschulte bring a pile of ideas to the table arrange characters and settings within them and craft a “puzzle” movie that hopefully all comes together in the end without any pieces falling down the furnace vent or being eaten by the cat. This one has to do with gaps in the narrative optical illusions and odd laboratory settings that could add up to aliens pseudoscientific woo-woo or something on the spectrum in-between. Maybe it’ll hold together or maybe it’ll fall apart; let’s find out.

ULTRASOUND: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?

The Gist: It was (sigh) a dark and stormy night. An unnatural but beautiful royal blue sky loomed above blackness with two headlights slashing through it. A board with nails sticking out of it. Tires lacerated. The rain falling like buckets very full buckets. A man Glen (Vincent Kartheiser) sloughs from the auto to a nearby house. Drenched. Art (Bob Stephenson) lives there with his wife Cyndi (Chelsea Lopez). Can Glen use the phone? His iPhone is waterlogged but was it in such a state before he got out of the car and into the rain? Maybe there’s no cell service out here. That must be it. Here Glen here’s a towel put on this robe sit down have a drink have another drink then another. It’s late. Just stay here tonight the nearest garage and motel are many miles away and oh by the way please feel free to have sex with Cyndi. She’s like 20 years younger than Art who isn’t shy about discussing his struggles with depression which probably has something to do with his inability to satisfy Cyndi.

Nice people. Accommodating. Too nice! TOO ACCOMMODATING. But Glen is a little bit drunk and Cyndi is sweet and earnest. The next morning Glen awakens to an empty house and gets dressed and walks on down the road. Then the title graphic which looks like the product of a Texas Instruments home computer or maybe a Commodore. Remember those? Some time has passed. Glen still looks damp. Sloughy like he sloughs everywhere. Should we read into that? Maybe but we’ve known people with bad haircuts and posture like an understuffed stuffed animal so maybe he’s just always like that. Art knocks on his door and Glen isn’t happy to see him. Glen found the board with nails but does he really think Art sabotaged Glen’s evening so he could get Glen in the house and talk him into doing it with his wife? Seems farfetched doesn’t it? Oh by the way Art has a video camera and he makes a big to-do about plugging it into Glen’s TV so he can show Glen images of Cyndi specifically Cyndi being pregnant. But… Glen thought he didn’t… and it couldn’t have… the mechanics of it… but I guess the memory is hazy?

We meet two more characters Katie (Rainey Qualley) and Alex (Chris Gartin). She’s lonely in an apartment all the time he comes and goes. Thing is sometimes Katie is obviously pregnant and sometimes she isn’t and sometimes Alex looks like Art. It has something to do with mirrors I think. This is where the movie starts not adding up like a broken Texas Instruments calculator. And this is just the tip of the iceberg because it’s sort of our job to put the calculator back together and see if it works apologies for mixing metaphors. There are scenes in which Glen has apparently Done The Right Thing for Cyndi and they’re living together and preparing for the birth and scenes involving people in a lab/research setting primarily Dr. Conners (Tunde Adebimpe) and his assistant Shannon (Breeda Wool). No more will I say lest the spoiler helicopters flutter off to report me to the authorities.

What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Ultrasound is Chris Nolan on a fraction of a fraction of his usual budget. It definitely has more in common with Memento than The Prestige and Inception but is surely inspired by all of them. Also think Primer or The Vast of Night in terms of high concept/lo-fi dynamics.

Performance Worth Watching: For reasons that are complicated and have to do with spoilers Breeda Wool plays the only character who seems to have a conscious conscience; without her empathetic performance bridging the gap between two types of characters the movie likely wouldn’t be functional.

Memorable Dialogue: Shannon gives us hope for eventual clarity of this confounder of a plot when she says “It’ll all make sense as we go along. I promise.”

Sex and Skin: Nothing noteworthy.

Our Take: There tends to be a breaking point with “puzzle” movies where either we’re drawn into the intrigue or we deem it more trouble than it’s worth. Ultrasound is 49 the former and 51 the latter because it ultimately tests our patience a smidgen more than it rewards it. Schroeder slow-drips revelations about the nature of what’s happening and why too slowly slow-dripping it engaging our curiosity but setting its emotional hook too late. I was frustrated by its pacing and flattened tone and vaguely dissatisfied with the conclusion the movie reaches. It attempts to generate some tight-wound tension but the logic beneath it isn’t sound and the answers it gives us feels more muted than revelatory.

The point of all of this is well I’m not sure. The film addresses issues of ethics within science and politics but those strands are ill-defined and too broad and obvious to be effective. It stirs up implications about the nature of memory and identity but the characters are too loosely defined to stir up any serious concern and play second fiddle to the plot and its many intricacies. It’s unfocused and draggy and the plot holes are too obvious e.g. if the Glen character had a single friend relative or co-worker who could arouse concern the gig would be up in seconds. And I think all the puzzle pieces are present but maybe it’s not worth fishing out the one that got kicked into the gunk under the stove to finish it.

Our Call: SKIP IT. The best films of this ilk make us put in a little bit of work at the same time they entertain us. Ultrasound feels more like work than entertainment.

LIG Nex1 hopes that this will open up more export opportunities for the platform in the future.

According to LIG Nex1 the company is cooperating with both the Republic of Korea Navy and South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) to expand export opportunities for the country’s defense industry at RIMPAC 2022. The K-LOGIR in particular has been on display on ROKS Marado a South Korean amphibious assault ship since July 4th and is said to be drawing the attention of service members from participating navies including Admiral Samuel Paparo Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet who visited the vessel last week.

The Poniard / K-LOGIR has a range of 8 km and was jointly developed by South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development and LIG Nex1 with work being completed in 2016. The 2.75-inch rocket has an onboard guidance system allowing the operator to “fire-and-forget” once the missile has been launched. In addition to this the rocket’s search-and-track and fire control systems can be integrated onto vehicles such as trucks giving it great flexibility.

ROK Marine Corps K-LOGIR during test

The Republic of Korea Marines Corps replaced its M47 Patton tank-based coastal defense guns with truck-mounted K-LOGIRs in 2017. In 2019 the system became the first South Korean-made weapon to complete a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT). The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) conducts FCTs to evaluate weapons systems developed by allies. During the test held in 2019 which was presided over by officials from the DoD the K-LOGIR successfully hit the target during all 10 launches conducted.

LIG Nex1 is carrying out a joint marketing campaign for the system with Raytheon. Last August the two companies displayed the Poniard at the Sea-Air-Space Exposition 2021.

Some observers are speculating that air-to-ship and air-to-ground variants of K-LOGIR could also be in development. If the program does proceed it is likely that the developer for these variants will either be LIG Nex1 or Hanwha.

RIMPAC is a U.S.-led multinational exercise that has been held biannually since 1971. South Korea has been a fully-fledged participant since 1990 and is sending its largest force ever deployed to RIMPAC to the 28th iteration of the exercise this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 92E (Stat92E) is a direct downstream molecule of the niche signal Unpaired (Upd) and is known to be required for GSC establishment and maintenance1722232425. Stat92E protein is specifically expressed in the GSC population and decreases immediately in differentiating daughter cells called gonialblasts (GBs)26. To determine whether Stat92E expression is transcriptionally regulated we designed single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (smFISH)272829303132 probes targeting an exon or an intron of the Stat92E gene to monitor the levels of Stat92E transcription (Fig. 1b). The intron probe hybridizes to Stat92E nascent transcript which represents active transcription occurring on the template DNA region293334 (seen as puncta double positive for exon and intron probe signal whereas mature mRNA shows only exon probe signal Fig.1b). Specificity for both probes was validated by using Stat92E null clones (Supplementary Fig. 1a b).

Unexpectedly upon visualizing Stat92E nascent transcripts we noticed that the localization pattern of the Stat92E locus is different between GSCs and differentiating cells. In GSCs we tended to observe a single focus of nascent transcript with high fluorescence intensity. In GBs and SGs we tended to observe two separate puncta (Fig. 1c d). This suggested the possibility that the Stat92E locus on homologous chromosomes may be paired in stem cells but become unpaired upon differentiation. The observed changes in the pairing pattern of the Stat92E locus prompted us to investigate whether such pairing is under the control of early germline development and if it has any impact on the Stat92E transcript.

It should be noted that a pair of GSC and GB enters S-phase immediately after mitosis when cells are still interconnected (Fig. 1e) and cytokinesis occurs after cells enter G2 phase35. S-phase cells sometimes have multiple (3 or more) foci of Stat92E intron FISH signal (Fig. 1f) likely reflecting the separation of sister chromatids during DNA synthesis. Therefore we excluded cells with more than three foci from the following pairing assays.

Stat92E expression is transcriptionally regulated during differentiation

Because the mammalian STAT3 (a homolog of Stat92E) protein is known to bind to its own promoter to induce its own expression36 it has been believed that the GSC-specific Stat92E expression pattern in the Drosophila testis might be similarly regulated by a transcriptional feedback loop37. However this model has never been tested in the GSC niche.

To test whether Stat92E expression is regulated at the transcriptional level we quantified Stat92E mRNA levels using the Stat92E exon probe. smFISH visualizes single molecules of Stat92E mRNA as uniform sizes and intensities of dots in the cytoplasm of developing germ cells and surrounding other cell types including hub cells somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) and cyst cells (CCs) (Fig. 1g). To quantify mRNA levels in early stages of germ cells we manually counted the number of smFISH dots. Since germ cells and somatic CySCs or CCs which are both positive for Stat92E mRNA closely adhere to each other smFISH signals in germ cells and in somatic cells overlap at the cells’ surfaces (Fig. 1g inset). Therefore we counted the smFISH dots in a single confocal plane at approximately the middle section of germ cells (Fig. 1h Supplementary Fig. 1 for more details). We found that Stat92E mRNA downregulation occurs gradually as differentiation proceeds from the GSC stage to the SG stage (Fig. 1g–i). We defined the ratio of Stat92E mRNA levels between GSC and 2–4 SG stages (GSC/2-4SG) as the silencing index (SI). We found that in wild type testes the SI was close to 2 (1.927) meaning a nearly 2-fold decrease in mRNA level as differentiation proceeds.

Although the smFISH results provided precise quantification of Stat92E mRNA the mRNA can be diluted out upon cell division leaving open the possibility that the change of transcription occurs even earlier in differentiation. Quantification of intron signal intensity relative to that in CySCs which show consistently high signal in a single focus also indicated that the transcription of Stat92E decreases gradually as differentiation proceeds (Fig. 1j k). Both results indicate that Stat92E transcription is not completely shut off at the GB stage but is gradually downregulated during differentiation.

The change in Stat92E pairing states is locus- and cell type-specific

To confirm the pairing state of the Stat92E locus at the DNA level we performed OligoPaint DNA FISH38 on the Stat92E locus which is located on the right arm of chromosome 3. A previous study showed that homolog pairing occurs between button regions in homologous chromosomes often containing a full TAD7. Therefore we selected a 60Kb OligoPaint probe target region spanning the entire Stat92E gene region within a TAD (estimated based on a published Hi-C sequence data analysis Fig. 2a). Similar to the pattern observed in our intron FISH experiment (Fig. 1c d) the Stat92E locus tended to be paired in GSCs detected as a single focus in a nucleus and was often unpaired detected as two foci in a nucleus in differentiating GBs (Fig. 2b c) (see39404142 and Supplementary Fig. 2 for the method used to estimate 3D-distance and Supplementary Fig. 3a b for validation of the probe specificity using an antisense probe).

Unlike somatic cells homologous chromosomes are unpaired in Drosophila female GSCs and become paired as differentiation proceeds in order to prepare for meiosis43. In contrast it has been reported that the male germline shows paired patterns of satellite DNA regions throughout differentiation44 suggesting that the observed pairing/unpairing events could be unique to the Stat92E locus. To test whether Stat92E pairing is locus-specifically regulated we performed DNA FISH on flies carrying an array of lacO repeats inserted at an euchromatic region close to where Stat92E is located on chromosome 3 (Fig. 2d–f) or at a heterochromatic region near the telomere on chromosome 2 (Fig. 2g–i) using oligonucleotide probes targeting the lacO repeat sequence. We observed that the lacO locus on both regions remained paired throughout differentiation (Fig. 2d–i) suggesting that the observed pairing/unpairing event seen within the Stat92E region occurs in a locus-specific manner.

The distance between Stat92E puncta progressively decreased as SGs differentiated into SCs (Fig. 2c) presumably in preparation for meiotic pairing pattern which takes place in the SC stage45. Consistent with previous reports early SCs show a uniformly paired pattern in all genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 3c)45. Similar to early SCs the somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) constantly showed a paired pattern at the Stat92E locus (Supplementary Fig. 3d e). These results suggest that the observed paired/unpaired change is cell type- and stage-specific.

A previous study demonstrated that local pairing can occur independently of entire homolog pairing even when alleles are distantly positioned7. We tested if Stat92E pairing is dependent on its position within homologous chromosomes. In flies carrying the TM3 balancer chromosome (FlyBase ID: FBba0000047) in which the Stat92E locus is inverted and dislocated approximately 10 Mb away from its original location4647 we still observed a similar pattern of Stat92E pairing/unpairing (Fig. 2j–l) suggesting that the Stat92E pairing regulation still occurs between alleles even if they are dislocated.

The observed unpairing event occurs between two homologous chromosomes and not between sister chromatids as we observed only one dot of DNA FISH signal in files heterozygous for deletion of the Stat92E locus (Df(3 R)BSC516 Fig. 2m–o). This result also indicates that the Stat92E OligoPaint probe was specifically recognizing the Stat92E locus.

The change in Stat92E pairing states does not reflect the difference in cell-cycle stages

It is thought that somatic homolog pairing may be regulated cell cycle dependently548. Therefore we wondered if the observed Stat92E pairing change during differentiation is developmentally regulated or rather simply reflects the changing fractions of cells in different cell cycle stages. To distinguish these possibilities we examined the pairing states of Stat92E between GSCs and differentiating cells when both populations were in the same cell cycle stage. To this end we expressed Fly-Fucci a fluorescent cell cycle marker49 under the control of the germline driver nosGal4 and examined Stat92E pairing states by visualizing nascent transcript foci using intron RNA FISH (Fig. 3a). A previous study has demonstrated that early germ cells in the Drosophila testis lack G1 phase and most germ cells are in G2 or S-phase35. We noticed that Stat92E transcription became low often undetectable during S-phase (Fig. 3a). Therefore we determined the distance between homologous Stat92E loci in G2-phase cells. The distribution of distances between Stat92E puncta measured specifically in G2-phase cells did not have a significant difference from the measurement of entire cell populations (Fig. 3b c) indicating that the observed change of frequency of Stat92E pairing between the GSC and the GB stage was unlikely caused by the difference of cell cycle stages.

The change in Stat92E pairing states is required for subsequent silencing of transcription

The locus-specific pairing state change we observed from GSC to GB prior to the downregulation of Stat92E transcription led us hypothesize that the pairing change may be required for subsequent Stat92E downregulation. To test this hypothesis we determined the timing of Stat92E downregulation during the early stages of germline development in several genotypes. To compare Stat92E downregulation across different genotypes we used the silencing index (SI) as defined above.

Flies heterozygous for the deficiency of the Stat92E locus (Df(3 R)BSC516 which lacks 3 R: 20093311..20790571 and therefore lacks one copy of the entire TAD including Stat92E (3 R: 20470000..20570000) Fig. 2m) should lack the effect of trans-chromosomal interaction of the Stat92E locus. Indeed we found that Stat92E mRNA level failed to decrease in Df(3 R)BSC516+ testes as differentiation proceeds. While in control testes the SI was close to 2 (1.898) meaning a nearly 2-fold decrease in mRNA level as differentiation proceeds the SI in Df(3 R)BSC516+ testes was close to 1 (1.237) (Supplementary Fig. 1h) indicating that the mRNA level remained similar throughout GSC to 2-4 SG stages. Nascent transcript intensity of Df(3 R)BSC516+ was also unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 4) indicating that the change of mRNA level reflects a change of transcriptional activity rather than mRNA stability.

Since Df(3 R)BSC516/+ lacks one copy of the Stat92E gene in addition to the defective SI it also showed lower Stat92E mRNA expression throughout all stages (Supplementary Fig. 1f h) presumably due to having only one copy of the gene. This made it difficult to judge the downregulation timing. Therefore we attempted to identify conditions in which two copies of functional Stat92E locus are still present but they do not pair. Hence we examined if the endogenous Stat92E locus can pair with a Stat92E transgene located on another chromosome. To test this we introduced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BacTg) harboring the entire Stat92E locus within a 80Kb region (Bac VK00037) on chromosome 2 into the Stat92E deficiency background Df(3 R)BSC516 (BacTg/Df for short; Fig. 4a). In DNA FISH experiments examining the BacTg/Df testes we consistently observed two spots in all stages representing a failure of the endogenous Stat92E gene on chromosome 3 to pair with the BacTg on chromosome 2 (Fig. 4b c). A previous study demonstrated that transgenes can pair even when they are separately positioned when the transgenes contain the full TAD7. The Stat92E Bac construct (Bac VK00037) lacks ~65Kb of the proximal portion from the predicted TAD suggesting the requirement of this region for pairing.

Taking advantage of the BacTg/Df line in which there are two functional copies of the Stat92E gene but they never pair we next investigated if the regulation of Stat92E transcription is compromised in this genotype. We examined the change of mRNA levels during differentiation in BacTg/Df testes and found that germ cells failed to downregulate Stat92E during differentiation with a mRNA SI of nearly 1 (1.062 Fig. 4d e) and a nascent transcript SI of 0.810 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

It is possible that the Bac transgene placed in a different location may be subjected to different positional effects that impact the gene downregulation timing. To exclude this possibility we compared Stat92E nascent transcript levels between the endogenous locus and the BacTg locus. We did not detect noticeable differences of nascent transcript intensity between the two puncta (Fig. 4f) indicating that the BacTg and the endogenous Stat92E locus are expressed at similar levels. Therefore the observed defect of Stat92E downregulation in BacTg/Df is unlikely due to a position effect of the BacTg allele and is most likely due to the absence of pairing between BacTg and the endogenous Stat92E locus.

Next we tested the effect of global pairing and anti-pairing factors on Stat92E downregulation. Condensin II a DNA loop extrusion factor has been shown to antagonize homolog pairing485051 and its interacting factor the Drosophila homolog of human MORF4-related gene on chromosome 15 (Mrg15) is known to be an anti-pairing factor52. The Condensin II complex is inactivated when its subunit Cap-H2 is degraded by the SCF (Skp/Cullin/F-box) E3 ubiquitin-ligase-Slimb complex. Therefore the component Supernumerary limbs (Slmb) functions as a pairing promoting factor5053. We observed that knockdown of Slmb in the germline under the nosGal4 driver significantly decreased Stat92E pairing in GSCs consistent with Slmb’s role as a pairing factor (Fig. 4g h j). In contrast knockdown of the anti-pairing factor Mrg15 significantly increased Stat92E paring in GB-SGs (Fig. 4g i j). In both conditions the change in pairing state between GSC and GB-SG did not occur and Stat92E failed to be downregulated during stage progression (Fig. 4k) with each genotype having a SI close to 1 (1.012 for nos(ts) > Slmb RNAi and 1.284 for nos(ts) > Mrg15 RNAi). These results strongly suggest that the change in pairing state from the GSC to GB stage promotes prompt downregulation of Stat92E transcription.

Stat92E nascent transcript levels differ in paired and unpaired conditions

To assess the direct effect of pairing change on downregulation of transcription we next attempted to examine levels of nascent transcript between paired and unpaired fractions of cells within the same stage. We specifically focused on the GB stage when the unpaired populations are undergoing the switch from a paired state. The pair of interconnected GSC and GB has been known to synchronously enter S-phase when they remain continuous prior to cytokinesis (Fig. 5a)35. At this phase Stat92E nascent transcript was almost undetectable (Fig. 3a). After completion of cytokinesis GSCs and GBs are in G2 phase and contain already duplicated chromosomes (4n Fig. 5a). To avoid effects of the cell cycle on transcription we selected G2-phase GBs identified as cells located one cell layer away from the hub and no longer connected to GSCs and compared their levels of nascent transcript between paired and unpaired alleles.

Left and right panel show paired or unpaired Stat92E homologous alleles respectively.

Box plots show 25–75% (box) median (band inside) and minimum to maximum (whiskers) with all data points. The p values were calculated by two-tailed Student’s t-tests. All scale bars represent 2 μm. Number of scored cells which are randomly chosen from at least 10 testes for each experiments is shown for each data point. Full size image

If each Stat92E allele contains the same level of nascent transcript the ratio of intron RNA FISH intensity between a paired and unpaired pattern is expected to be 2:1. However we found that the average intensity of intron signal per allele was approximately 60% of the expected level (the ratio of paired vs. unpaired loci was approximately 2:0.6 Fig. 5b c). In contrast OligoPaint DNA FISH intensity between paired and unpaired fractions showed a ratio of 2:1 as expected (Fig. 5d e). These results support our hypothesis that physical interaction of homologous regions impacts the levels of nascent transcript either enhancing transcript between paired alleles and/or suppressing transcript upon unpairing (Fig. 5f).

Regulation of pairing requires the Stat92E enhancer but not transcription

To determine the requirement of cis regulatory elements of Stat92E for pairing we examined a Stat92E mutant allele Stat92E0634654 in which a p-element is inserted into a putative Stat92E intronic enhancer (Fig. 6a). In Stat92E06346/+ heterozygous animals nascent Stat92E was only detectable on a single locus while DNA FISH shows two discrete spots in GB and SG indicating that as expected the Stat92E06346 allele completely lacks transcription as reported previously54 (Fig. 6b–d). In Stat92E06346/+ flies we found that pairing at the Stat92E region was completely disrupted in GSCs as compared to wild type (Fig. 6e f) suggesting that the Stat92E enhancer element is necessary for proper pairing in GSCs. The reduced expression of Stat92E mRNA in all germ cells was maintained at a similar level throughout differentiation (Fig. 6g h) with a SI near 1 (1.172) consistent with our model that a change in pairing state is required for prompt downregulation of Stat92E.

Full size image

Next we asked whether or not the effect of Stat92E06346 on pairing is caused by the lack of transcriptional activity from the allele. We attempted to artificially activate transcription of endogenous Stat92E allele in cis using the flySAM technique55 which induces transcription by combining sgRNA targeting the Stat92E transcription start site (3 R:20552774..20552796 [+]) with dCas9 fused to VPR (VP64-p65-Rta) a tripartite transcriptional activator domain (Fig. 6i). Compared to the control germline driver nosGal4-induced flySAM caused increased Stat92E expression levels throughout differentiation (Fig. 6j o). However the Stat92E pairing was unchanged (Fig. 6k p) suggesting that pairing regulation is unlikely to be downstream of transcriptional activity.

To confirm the effect of Stat92E transcription on pairing we next blocked transcription in cis at the Stat92E locus using the dCas9-mediated transcriptional knockdown CRISPRi combining dCas9 overexpression with sgRNA targeting the transcription start site Fig. 6l)56. As with the flySAM results even though CRISPRi caused a decrease in mRNA expression (Fig. 6m o) it did not affect the pattern of pairing (Fig. 6n p). These data suggest that the observed change in pairing state at the Stat92E region is not a consequence of a change in transcriptional activity in cis.

Stat92E pairing is under the control of asymmetric histone inheritance

During the asymmetric division of the GSC a sister chromatid incorporated with parental histone H3 and H4 is preferentially retained in the GSC while the other sister chromatid that incorporates newly synthesized histone H3 and H4 is inherited by the GB20. This pattern has been proposed to influence distinct chromatin states between GSCs and GBs. Notably the change we observe in Stat92E pairing state was already apparent in GBs immediately after asymmetric division. Therefore we tested whether or not asymmetric histone inheritance contributes to the distinct pairing states of the Stat92E locus between GSC and GB. To this end we perturbed the histone H3 inheritance asymmetry by expressing a mutant form of histone H3 that cannot be phosphorylated at Thr3 (H3T3A) resulting in the random distribution of pre-existing and newly synthesized histone H3 between GSC and GB21. Expression of histone H3T3A-GFP in the germline using the nosGal4 driver resulted in the Stat92E locus remaining mostly paired throughout differentiation while the control testes expressing wild type histone H3-GFP showed the expected pairing/unpairing switch seen in wild type flies (Fig. 7a–c). nos > H3T3A-GFP did not affect the pairing states of a lacO insertion which remained paired throughout differentiation (Fig. 7d) suggesting that asymmetric histone inheritance may have an effect specifically on the Stat92E locus. The difference in distance of DNA FISH puncta between nos > H3-GFP and nos > H3T3A-GFP was not due to compromised distribution of cell cycle stages in either genotype as both showed a comparable frequency of 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporating S-phase cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c).

Full size image

The failure to switch to an unpaired state in cells expressing histone H3T3A-GFP resulted in defective downregulation of Stat92E during differentiation (Fig. 7e–g) with a SI close to 1 (1.237) while the control cells expressing histone H3-GFP had a SI close to 2 (1.938) further supporting the idea that the change in pairing state of Stat92E is required for the downregulation of its expression.

To establish that the effect of histone H3T3A-GFP on pairing is specifically due to its effect on asymmetric histone inheritance within the GSC we expressed histone H3T3A-GFP in differentiating cells using the bamGal4 driver which is expressed later in germline development and thus should not result in perturbation of asymmetric histone H3 inheritance in the GSC and GB57. We performed DNA FISH on bam > H3-GFP and bam > H3T3A-GFP and found no significant changes in the unpairing pattern in differentiating germ cells expressing histone H3T3A (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f) confirming that the perturbation in pairing states seen in nos > H3T3A-GFP is due to disruption of asymmetric histone H3 distribution in GSC and GBs.

To further confirm the effect of asymmetric histone inheritance on pairing of the Stat92E locus we knocked down two genes reported to be required for this process. Haspin is a Serine/Threonine kinase that phosphorylates Thr3 on histone H3 and its RNAi disrupts asymmetric histone inheritance21. Chromosome alignment defect 1 (Cal1) is required for asymmetric segregation of sister chromatids each incorporated with old vs. new histone H3 and H458. Therefore knockdown of either gene should result in the same consequence of randomized histone inheritance. Consistent with this we observed the Stat92E locus remaining paired throughout differentiation in temperature-sensitive nosGal4-driven haspin RNAi (Fig. 7h i k) and Cal1 RNAi testes (Fig. 7h j k). Cal1 has been shown to be required for centromere pairing in meiosis59. However the Stat92E locus in GB and SG stages were more paired in Cal1 RNAi testes indicating that the pairing defect in Cal1 knockdown is not due to a centromere pairing defect but likely due to a histone inheritance defect.

These data suggest that the change in pairing state observed in GSC differentiation is epigenetically programmed during asymmetric stem cell division via stereotypic inheritance of histone H3.

Stat92E is also regulated post-transcriptionally

Finally we asked whether the observed Stat92E pairing defect has any impact on Stat92E protein distribution. In wild type testes Stat92E protein level shows a clear reduction in the GB and is almost non-detectable in the SG stage (Supplementary Fig. 6a2560) even earlier than transcription shuts off (Supplementary Fig. 6b) indicating that the level of Stat92E is also regulated post-transcriptionally. We examined the pattern of Stat92E protein distribution in genotypes in which Stat92E pairing was perturbed. As expected in all genotypes Stat92E protein showed normal downregulation as seen in the wild type condition with high expression in GSCs and immediate reduction in differentiating germ cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c–j). It has been shown that the defect in asymmetric histone inheritance disturbs germline differentiation21. Therefore we speculate that other genes that contribute to the differentiation of GSCs may be similarly regulated through pairing change.

Taken together our data are consistent with a model whereby Stat92E downregulation occurs under the control of pairing regulation providing a paradigm for how trans-chromosomal interactions mediate prompt gene downregulation during cell differentiation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTc4NDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inorganic carbon stimulates the metabolic routes related to the polyhdroxybutyrate production in a Synechocystis sp ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722017843 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTc4NDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xNTczNi160gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparative estimation of nitrogen in urea and its derivative products using TKN CHNS and hand-held refractometer ...,"The utilization of handheld refractometer based detectors has gained significant attention because of their small size low-cost portable no need for any skilled person and real-time detection. In this device a few drops of liquid suspension containing urea can be placed on the prism and therefore the reading is displayed on the screen within 3 s. This handheld instrument works on the principal of refractive index. When a liquid sample is placed on the prism surface then the light is transmitted via the solution while some of the light is reflected and detected by photodiodes. As a consequence a shadow line is created whose position is closely related to the refractive index of the solution. Therefore the refractive index or another unit of measure as per refractive index is correlated by internal software after the determination of the position of the shadow lines by using the instrument. Thus the final concentration of liquid can be viewed on the display of the refractometer. This device is easy to calibrate by simply mounting a few drops of liquid standard or distilled water on the surface of the prism.

In order to determine whether refractometer as a substitute method to TKN and CHNS for N% estimation for conventional urea as well as nano urea fertilizers all three techniques were systemically compared in terms of linearity and on the basis of other performance such as cost sample throughput environmental acceptance and automation capabilities. The calculation of N% in different concentrations of urea and nano urea was analyzed by TKN CHNS and refractometer and then compared. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of data utilized to compare the N% analysis by using different methods (where duplicate was taken for each samples; n = 2).

Table 1 Descriptive statistics of data utilized to compare TKN CHNS and Refractometer based methods for nitrogen analysis (N%). Full size table

Moreover their comparison has been evaluated in terms of correlations of the results obtained by a different technique. Figure 1a–d shows the linear fitting between the estimated nitrogen (%) and various concentrations of urea ranging from 0.25 to 10% for TKN CHNS refractometer and theoretical value of expected N%.

Figure 1 Linear fitting between nitrogen (%) and different concentration of urea from 0.25 to 10% for (a) TKN (b) CHNS (c) refractometer and (d) theoretical N%. (Both CHNS and refractometer have shown the R2 value is close to the theoretical value for urea analysis). Full size image

Interestingly the refractometer was capable of detecting the lower limit of urea at 0.25% (0.11% N) and displayed 0.092% N. Moreover it was observed that the N% detected by TKN exhibited the straight line with the lowest R2 (0.98879) value as compared to other techniques. Whereas both CHNS and refractometer have detected the different concentrations of urea as their R2 value is close to the theoretical value of N%. Furthermore the estimation of N% in nano urea was performed by using all techniques to evaluate the instrument performance in terms of linearity. A linear fitting between the measured N (%) and different concentrations of nano urea ranging from 1 to 10% for TKN CHNS and refractometer can be seen in Fig. 2a–d.

Figure 2 Linear fitting between nitrogen (%) and different concentration of nano urea (1–10%) for (a) TKN (b) CHNS (c) refractometer and (d) theoretical N%. (Refractometer showed R2 value is close to the theoretical value for the analysis of nano urea). Full size image

These results indicated that the refractometer-based device showed R2 = 0.99935 with an intercept of − 0.04667 ± 0.02455 and a slope of 0.46667 ± 0.00396. It can be concluded that the linear fitting for the estimation of N% in nano urea by refractometer is more closed to the theoretical value of N% as compared to other methods. Furthermore in view of the importance of the DEF solution in diesel engines for air pollution prevention higher concentrations of urea up to 40% were utilized for the analysis. A linear fitting between nitrogen (%) and different concentration of urea ranging from 0.25 to 40% for TKN CHNS refractometer and the theoretical N% have been displayed in Fig. 3a–d. On these concentrations the refractometer-based device produced outstanding results in terms of R2 (0.99918) in comparison with other techniques which indicates that the refractometer can also be used for the analysis of DEF solution.

Table 2 displays the different techniques for the measurement of urea and nano urea sample containing concentration up to 10% and their respective values such as R2 intercept and slope extracted via linear fitting.

In order to further evaluate the measured N% of different concentrations of urea and nano urea (1 5 and 10%) were extracted by all methods and compared as shown in Fig. 4a b.

Figure 4 N% detection by using different techniques and their comparison with the theoretical value of different concentration of (a) urea and (b) nano urea (c) estimation of N% in DEF solution containing 32.5% urea by using different methods (refractometer CHNS and TKN) and compared with theoretical value of N%. (Refractometer based device showed less deviation ~ 1.53% with theoretical value as compared to other techniques in case of DEF solution). Full size image

It was observed that N% estimation by TKN is inconsistent with the theoretical value of N%. The reason is this technique only detects nitrogen from ammonium as well as organic constituents such as amino acids nucleic acids and proteins in the sample. However it is not possible for the measurement of other forms of nitrogen present in nitrite and nitrate using TKN technique8. Moreover refractometer-based results are more closed to that of the theoretical value of N% as compared to other techniques as shown in Fig. 4. Figure 4c displays the analysis of N% in DEF solution by utilizing different methods such as CHNS TKN and refractometer and then compared their results with the theoretical value of N%. In this analysis TKN CHNS and refractometer based device showed 15.27 14.01 and 14.72% N-content in DEF respectively. It was observed that the N% was deviated about + 6.29% in TKN − 214% in CHNS and − 1.53% in refractometer with the theoretical value of N% in DEF. Therefore the refractometer based device exhibited the more close value to theoretical N% in case of DEF.

Other performances

Measurement time and automation: When analyzing a large number of samples in laboratories then these characteristics have a significant concern. For example TKN can analyze only 8 samples (including two replicates of each sample and two blank) using one digestion block for 8 tubes and one distillation-titration unit within 4 h. In the case of CHNS around 13–17 analyses can be executed in the same period. In contrast a refractometer can analyze about 170–180 samples (including sampling testing and washing the prism surface) in 4 h. Thus this device enables the fast detection of N% for urea samples.

Dealing with the automation capabilities TKN has some manual steps (for example insertion of reagents in digestion tube dilution of chemicals after digestion and positioning the digestion tube in distillation system). Moreover samples analysis by CHNS has some advancement in terms of samples insertion via autosampler. On the other hand one can easily monitor the results by pressing the button on a refractometer after placing a few drops of liquid samples.

Environmental and safety perspective: The utilization of hazardous acids (sulfuric acid sodium hydroxide) and catalyst-based heavy metals are a great concern while using the TKN. Moreover there are a small number of uses of heavy metals during the sample analysis by CHNS. On the contrary refractometer does not require any hazardous chemicals and toxic elements during the sample analysis. Surprisingly DI water is only used for the washing of the prism surface after the measurement.

Cost: Both instruments (TKN and CHNS) are expensive. The price of sample analysis includes their fixed (instrument cost) variable (glassware standard chemicals other chemicals power water consumption and maintenance cost) and labor cost of a technician. On the other hand a hand-held refractometer is quite cheap as compared to both instruments. The device operation is simple and no other cost is involved. For all these reasons hand-held refractometer-based urea detection could be a possible technique in the field of fertilizer industries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTUyNDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Evaluation of a virus concentration method based on ultrafiltration and wet foam elution for studying viruses from large ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722015248 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwNDg5Njk3MjIwMTUyNDjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMTc2Mi140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Nodal enhanced micropeptide NEMEP regulates glucose uptake during mesendoderm differentiation of embryonic ...,"Gm11549 is a direct target gene of Nodal signaling

Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are widely used to experimentally recapitulate early embryonic development for example with in vitro assays examining embryoid body (EB) formation. The LIF/STAT3 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3) signaling pathway promotes self-renewal and blocks the differentiation of mouse ESCs. LIF removal from culture media is the first step in a common protocol for inducing the differentiation of mESCs383940. This system is developmentally informative because mESCs have the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers upon selective exposure to appropriate culture conditions41. mESCs express ALK4 ALK7 ActR-II and ActR-IIB and produce autocrine Nodal42. We set out to explore lncRNAs responsive to Nodal signaling during mesendoderm differentiation. Activin A was used as a substitute for Nodal in our study because it is easier-to-obtain and because these two protein ligands act through the same receptors; one notable distinction is that Nodal requires the co-receptors Cryptic and Cripto; Activin A does not43.

A previous RNA-seq study of day 2.5 EBs treated with either the Nodal signaling agonist Activin A (hereafter Activin) or ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 globally characterized the mesendoderm LDTFs genes induced by Nodal/Activin signaling4445: these include the homeobox protein gene Mixl1 the T-box transcription factor Brachyury gene (Bra; also known as T) the homeobox protein gene Goosecoid (Gsc) and the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-β gene Foxa2. Note that each of these LDTFs is gradually induced in EBs between day 2 and day 4. Here we re-analyzed the Wang et al. (2017) dataset44 with a particular focus on identifying Nodal/Activin signaling target lncRNAs and thus identified 62 lncRNAs whose expression in SB431542-treated cells was increased or decreased by at least 2-fold upon Activin addition (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a).

Among the Nodal/Activin responsive lncRNAs we subsequently filtered for candidates using two criteria: strong expression in EBs at day 3 and day 4 and the presence of a predicted SMAD2 or SMAD3 binding site in their promoter regions2544. This identified one candidate Gm11549 (Fig. 1b Supplementary Fig. 1b c) and we characterized the Gm11549 transcript using 3′end RACE from EBs at day 3 and the Gm11549 transcript we found in EBs differs from Genbank and Refseq (Fig. 1b). ChIP-seq analysis showed that the Gm11549 locus does have TRIM33 SMAD2 or SMAD3 SMAD4 and FOXH1 occupancy at its promoter region in Activin-treated EBs at day 2.5 and does not have SMAD2 or SMAD3 binding in SB431542-treated cells suggesting that Gm11549 expression is responsive to Nodal/Activin signaling (Fig. 1b). Pretreatment of cycloheximide the protein synthesis inhibitor to the EBs did not block Activin response of Gm11549 demonstrating that Gm11549 is a primary transcriptional target of Nodal/Activin signaling but is not regulated by the Nodal/Activin signaling downstream target genes (Fig. 1c).

We then examined the distribution of Gm11549 transcripts throughout an in vitro differentiation time course of EBs and found that Gm11549 is induced at a similar time as the known mesendodermal marker genes Mixl1 Gsc T and Foxa2 (Fig. 1d). Consistently we analyzed published in vivo data4647 for mouse embryos and found that Gm11549 transcripts accumulate in the posterior primitive streak of mid-gastrulation embryos (~E7.0) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig.1d). Notably in adult mouse tissues Gm11549 is highly abundant and enriched in the brain compared to other organs (Supplementary Fig. 1e).

To determine which factors in Nodal/Activin signaling induce Gm11549 transcription we examined Gm11549 levels and responsivity to Activin in series of gene knockout mESCs. Briefly both Gm11549 transcription and responsivity of Gm11549 to Nodal/Activin are dependent on SMAD2 SMAD3 and SMAD4 individually as both phenotypes were impaired in Smad2 or Smad3 or Smad4 depletion cells or Smad2 KO and Smad3 KD cells (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1f g). We also found that TRIM33— a Nodal signaling-specific chromatin reader that associates with H3K9me3 and H3K18ac dual marks to regulate the expression of mesendoderm LDTFs2125—is essential for Gm11549 induction during mesendoderm differentiation and Gm11549 transcription was not induced by Nodal/Activin stimulation in Trim33 null cells (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1h i). Finally we found that Gm11549 transcriptional induction during mesendoderm differentiation requires the known early development regulator FOXH1 (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1j k). In addition depletion of co-receptors of Nodal Cryptic and Cripto (Supplementary Fig. 1l) dramatically impairs Gm11549 expression during mesendoderm differentiation as well as Mixl1 (Fig. 1i Supplementary Fig. 1m) suggesting that Gm11549 is indeed a Nodal signaling target gene. Collectively these results establish that Nodal signaling components directly induce the transcription of Gm11549 during mesendoderm differentiation and demonstrate that Gm11549 is specifically expressed in the primitive streak.

Gm11549 encodes a transmembrane micropeptide: NEMEP

Portions of the Gm11549 genomic sequence are highly conserved between human and mouse (Fig. 2a); specifically exon1 (224–405) and exon3 (1121–1446) share 87% and 75% identity respectively at nucleic acid sequence level whereas there is no obvious conservation for introns. Moreover the neighboring genes on both sides of the Gm11549 locus are conserved in both species (Fig. 2a). RNA-FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) and fractionation-based analyses revealed that Gm11549 transcript is mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 2a b). Recent studies reported that some cytosol-localized lncRNAs can be translated into functional micropeptides in vivo37 which prompted us to further investigate whether Gm11549 may have the potential to be translated into a protein product.

First we identified 4 putative ORFs in a sense (+) orientation with initiating ATG codon (Fig. 2b). After cloning these ORFs we examined the translational potential of these ORFs by transiently expressing them as C-terminal tagged fusions bearing FLAG epitopes in HEK293T cells. Only the ORF1-FLAG was detected by western blotting (Fig. 2c); mutagenesis at the ATG codon abolished ORF1-FLAG expression (Supplementary Fig. 3a b); note that ORF1 encodes a 63 amino acid micropeptide that is conserved among mammals (Fig. 2d). Moreover polysome profiling analysis of EBs at day 3 showed that Gm11549 is strongly associated with the polysome-like coding gene Gsc whereas non-coding RNA H19 is associated with the monosomes (Fig. 2e). These data provided additional evidence that Gm11549 has translation potential.

Further peptides from ORF1 were detected in HEK293T cells transiently expressing the ORF1-FLAG product by pull-down with the FLAG antibody followed by mass-spectrometry analysis (Fig. 2f). Moreover we raised a polyclonal rabbit antibody against a 25-residue region of the ORF1 gene product (Fig. 2d) an analysis of adult mouse brain samples with pull-down using the polyclonal antibody again detected the Gm11549 ORF1 protein (Fig. 2g). We generated ORF1-FLAG knock-in mESCs using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and a FLAG-tagged protein with a molecular weight of about 7KD was detected in these cells by western blotting (Fig. 2h). These results together establish that the micropeptide from Gm11549 ORF1 is indeed translated in vivo. We refer to this Nodal signaling target gene product as Nodal Enhanced MEsendoderm microPeptide (NEMEP).

The human ortholog of Gm11549 is TMEM155 which was annotated as a coding gene for a 130 aa gene product; note that there are to date no reports of experimental confirmation of the existence of these 130 aa proteins. In experiments to examine the translation product of TMEM155 we performed similar assays as with Gm11549 and found that TMEM155 likewise encodes a 63 aa peptide (“hNEMEP” sharing 93.6% identity with mNEMEP) (Supplementary Fig. 3d).

The protein topology prediction analyses indicated that NEMEP is a single-pass transmembrane protein (TMHMM Server 2.0) (Supplementary Fig. 3e) and NEMEP has a predicted alpha-helix domain between residues 7 and 29 (Supplementary Fig. 3f). Immunostaining of ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged NEMEP in mouse ES cells revealed that NEMEP was localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2i) and further fractionation-based analysis and immunoblotting of mESCs expressing NEMEP-GFP indicated strong accumulation of an NEMEP-GFP fusion protein in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2j).

NEMEP is required for mesendoderm differentiation

We next used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a Gm11549-NEMEP frameshift mutants (hereafter Nemep KO): we picked two frameshift mutant colonies one with an 8nt deletion (KO-1) and another with a 77nt deletion (KO-2); neither of these mutant Gm11549 loci produced the NEMEP peptide in cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). However note that the in vitro differentiation induced elevation of Gm11549 RNA transcription was not altered by either of these mutations (Fig. 3a). The absence of NEMEP in EBs dramatically impaired the expression of well-known mesendoderm LDTFs including Gsc Mixl1 T Eomes Foxa2 and Sox17 (Fig. 3a). Consequently the expression of the late mesoderm marker Nkx2–5 was significantly decreased in the Nemep KO EBs (Fig. 3a). Strikingly although Gm11549 transcription is induced during ectoderm differentiation we found that this RNA molecule is not required for ectoderm differentiation (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4d). We also found that the phosphorylation level of SMAD2 and SMAD3 at C-terminal tail is not affected in Nemep KO cells compared to wild type cells (Fig. 3c) indicating that NEMEP deletion does not interfere with the activity of known Nodal/Activin signaling receptors. Moreover we found that neither depletion of exon2 or exon3 has impact on mesendoderm differentiation excluding any regulatory impacts from Gm11549 region other than the 5′ UTR and coding region for 63 aa NEMEP (Supplementary Fig. 4a and 5a b). This data also suggests that it is less likely Gm11549 RNA contributes to regulate mesendoderm differentiation.

Again consistent with the EB differentiation functional impact from the NEMEP peptide frameshift mutation (Nemep KO) we found that mESCs harboring a promoter KO variant of the Gm11549 locus (generated by CRISPR/Cas9) (Supplementary Fig. 4a and 5c) displayed defects during in vitro EB differentiation including a sharply reduced extent of Gm11549 induction and strong reductions in the expression of mesendoderm genes as shown by the transcriptome analysis (Fig. 3d). Interestingly some pluripotency genes such as Esrrb Dnmt3l and Utf1 were not declined in Gm11549 promoter KO EBs compared to the wild type EBs (Fig. 3d). Consistent with this notion of NEMEP-dependent progression towards a mesendoderm differentiation fate the FOXA2 and T protein levels were significantly decreased in cells harboring mutant EBs including the frameshift and the promoter KO mutant cells by immunostaining assay (Fig. 3e f). Offering further support similar results were obtained in RNAi and CRISPRi-dCas9-KRAB experiments for depletion of Gm11549 transcripts from EBs (Supplementary Fig. 5d e). Thus NEMEP is required for mesendoderm differentiation.

NEMEP deletion leads to early defects in mouse embryo chimeras

Embryonic chimeras of the mouse are well-established tools for studying cell lineage and cell potentials48. To further investigate the role of NEMEP in mesendoderm differentiation we microinjected GFP-labeled WT or Nemep KO (Nemep−/−) mESCs into WT blastocysts to generate chimeric embryos which were collected and examined at E7.5 (Fig. 4a). At E7.5 we observed no obvious differences between WT and Nemep−/− chimeras (Fig. 4b). Immunofluorescence analysis of the chimeras for expression of the mesendoderm marker FOXA2 and T showed that WT but not E7.5 Nemep−/− chimeras expressed FOXA2 and T (Fig. 4c d). These chimeric embryo experiments strongly support that NEMEP is necessary for mesendoderm specification.

NEMEP interacts with GLUT1/GLUT3 and promotes glucose uptake

To explore the molecular mechanism of NEMEP in mesendoderm differentiation we conducted pull-down experiments with EBs at day 3 using NEMEP-GFP as bait. Mass spectrometry analysis of co-purified proteins revealed two glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) among the top-ranking candidate NEMEP-interacting proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies validated that both GLUT1 and GLUT3 do physically interact with NEMEP (Fig. 5a Supplementary Data 1). Then we confirmed that the homologous human NEMEP protein also interacts with the human GLUT1 and GLUT3 proteins (Fig. 5b). GLUT1 to GLUT4 are class I facilitative glucose transporters49. Glut1 and Glut3 have much higher expression in mESCs compared to Glut2 or Glut4 (Supplementary table 1). We conducted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis and successfully validated the interaction between NEMEP and these four of class I facilitative glucose transporters (Supplementary Fig. 6a).

Lysates from HEK293T cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding GLUT1-FLAG or GLUT3-FLAG or control vector and NEMEP-HA (as indicated) were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity beads and immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody against HA.

Moreover both confocal microscope images from BiFC assay and transient transfection of both GLUT1-FLAG or GLUT3-FLAG and NEMEP-HA vectors into mESCs show the colocalization of GLUT1 and GLUT3 with NEMEP on the cell membrane (Supplementary Fig. 6b c). We also validated that NEMEP binds to endogenous GLUT1 and GLUT3 using NEMEP-3xFLAG knock-in mESCs (Fig. 5c). Further deletion of the transmembrane domain (TMD) and of a 7-residue region (lacking H51-F57) of the NEMEP C terminus disrupted the interactions between NEMEP and GLUT1/GLUT3 proteins (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 6d). Domain swapping of the NEMEP-TMD domain for the ACVR1-TMD or ITGB1-TMD also impaired the interactions (Fig. 5d). These results demonstrate that the TMD domain and NEMEP residues H51-F57 are essential for NEMEP-GLUT1 and -GLUT3 interactions.

We next examined whether NEMEP impacts glucose transport by using the CRISPR-dCas9-VP64 activator system (CRISPRa) to generate mESCs that overexpress the endogenous mRNA encoding NEMEP (Gm11549) (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Compared to WT mESCs we found that overexpression of NEMEP resulted in a ~30% increase in glucose consumption as well as a ~60% increases in lactate excretion (Fig. 5e f). Consistently a Seahorse-based analysis measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) showed that the glycolysis activity of the NEMEP-overexpressing mESCs was significantly higher than in WT mESCs (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 7b c). Moreover the overexpression of human NEMEP in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d) also significantly increased glucose consumption lactate excretion glycolysis activity (Supplementary Fig. 7e–g).

We then used Promega Glucose Uptake-GloTM Assays to measure mESC glucose uptake to examine whether NEMEP impacts glucose transporter activity. Note that the measurement readout of the assay specifically reflects the glucose transporter activity. No changes in transporter activity were detected in mESCs expressing diverse NEMEP mutant variants (including TMD deletion H51-F57 deletion and the domain-swapped ACVR1-TMD and ITGB1-TMD variants); note that we did detect the expected increase in glucose transporter activity in mESCs expressing the full-length wild type NEMEP (Fig. 5h).

Intriguingly we detected NEMEP-mediated enhancements on both glucose uptake and glycolysis activities in mESCs in experiments examining overexpression of GLUT1 or GLUT3. Specifically the expression of WT NEMEP but not TMD-deletion NEMEP or H51-F57-deletion NEMEP in mESCs overexpressing GLUT1 or GLUT3 resulted in significantly higher glucose uptake compared to the GLUT1 or GLUT3 overexpressing mESCs (Fig. 5i j). Since H51-F57-deletion NEMEP failed to form complex with GLUT1 or GLUT3 (Fig. 5d) it suggests that NEMEP may act to facilitate glucose uptake through interaction with GLUT1 or GLUT3. However it does not exclude the possibility that NEMEP might facilitate glucose uptake via other factors. In addition the expression of WT NEMEP but not TMD-deletion NEMEP in mESCs overexpressing GLUT1 or GLUT3 resulted in significantly higher glycolysis activities compared to the GLUT1 or GLUT3 overexpressing mESCs (Supplementary Fig. 8a–h). Therefore NEMEP’s boosting glucose uptake likely through interactions with the known glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3.

NEMEP facilitates glucose uptake during mesendoderm differentiation

We next explored the potential impacts of altered glucose uptake and differential glycolysis activity on mesendoderm differentiation. In vitro differentiation assays revealed that decreased glucose concentration in the culture medium reduces the expression levels of mesendoderm developmental marker genes in WT EBs (Fig. 6a). Further knockdown of GLUT1 and GLUT3 led to severe defects in mesendoderm differentiation and in glucose uptake in EBs at day 3 (Fig. 6b c). We also found that increasing the glucose concentration in the culture medium caused a significant reduction in the expression levels of multiple mesendoderm developmental marker genes in WT EBs (Fig. 6d). Thus GLUT1 and GLUT3 are essential for normal mesendoderm differentiation. Moreover it appears that normal mesendoderm differentiation requires a developmentally-appropriate supply of glucose.

We then measured glucose uptake ECAR and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in WT and Nemep KO EBs at day 3. Compared to WT EBs the Nemep KO EBs displayed significant reductions in glucose uptake glycolytic function and mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 6e–j and Supplementary Fig. 9a–e). Consistently a metabolomics analysis detected significant declines in the levels of glycolysis and TCA cycle (Tricaboxylic Cycle) metabolites in Nemep KO EBs at day 3 (Fig. 6k). However a companion RNA-seq analysis found no differences between day 3 WT and Nemep promoter KO EBs for the genes encoding glucose metabolism enzymes or glucose transporters (Supplementary Fig. 9f) and AKT activation which have been reported that regulates glucose uptake in other type of cells is not impacted by depletion of NEMEP (Supplementary Fig. 9g)505152. These results indicate that the aforementioned physical interaction of NEMEP and GLUT1/GLUT3 may support mesendoderm differentiation by facilitating glucose uptake.

Our analysis of data from a previously published transcriptome analysis of WT EBs from day 0 to day 4 revealed that a group of well-known glucose metabolism genes including Glut1/Glut3 (Slc2a1/ Slc2a3) are up-regulated at day 3 EBs44 the same time point that mesendoderm genes are induced (Supplementary Fig. 9h).

Despite previous reports that TGF-β signaling can impact glucose metabolism in mesangial cells and NIH 3T3 cells535455 we are unaware of any studies examining whether Nodal signaling regulates glucose metabolism during mesendoderm differentiation. Pursuing this we found that treatment of day 3 EBs with the known Nodal signaling activator Activin significantly increased glucose uptake (Fig. 7a). Further compared to WT EBs the extent of glucose uptake was significantly reduced in EBs deficient for the Cripto and Cryptic deficient for SMAD2 and SMAD3 and deficient for TRIM33 (Fig. 7b–d). Moreover Activin treatment does not induce glucose uptake in EBs deficient for SMAD2 and SMAD3 or deficient for TRIM33 compared to WT EBs (Fig. 7c d). Noteworthy Activin treatment induces glucose uptake in EBs deficient for the Cripto and Cryptic (Fig. 7b) since Cripto/Cryptic-depleted cells remained responsive to Activin43. Together these in vitro findings indicate that the Nodal signaling functions to positively regulate glucose uptake during mesendoderm differentiation. However given that the expression of well-known glucose metabolism genes (including Slc2a1 and Slc2a3) was not altered by activation (Activin A treatment) or inhibition (SB431542 treatment) of Nodal signaling activity (Supplementary Fig. 9i) we suspected that the Nodal-signaling-mediated promotion of glucose uptake is through unknown glucose metabolism genes and NEMEP may be one of them.

A highly conserved putative lncRNA Gm11549 is specifically induced by Nodal signaling during mesendoderm differentiation and it is essential for mesendoderm differentiation in mESCs. There is a “ORF” hidden in Gm11549 that codes a transmembrane micropeptide we named NEMEP. NEMEP functions by interacting with GLUT1 and GLUT3 and augment the glucose uptake capacity of glucose transporter proteins to meet the energy needs during mesendoderm differentiation. a–f: Data are the mean ± S.E.M.

To explore potential mechanisms that may reconcile our observation of Nodal signaling’s promotion of glucose uptake during mesendoderm differentiation with our findings that the NEMEP-GLUT1/GLUT3 physical interaction and NEMEP promoting glucose uptake we conducted experiments combining stimulation of Nodal signaling and genetic knockout of NEMEP. Consistently we found that the Activin-induced increase in glucose uptake was significantly stronger in WT EBs than in Nemep KO EBs (Fig. 7e). An expression of NEMEP in the Nemep KO EBs rescued the defect of glucose uptake (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 9j). Given that NEMEP KO does not affect Nodal signaling activity (Fig. 3c) and the fold induction in response to Activin remains the same as in control cells for glucose uptake (Fig. 7e) we suspect that: (i) Nodal signaling induces the transcriptional activation of other as-yet-unknown genes that somehow regulate glucose uptake; (ii) crosstalk of Nodal signaling with other signaling pathways to facilitate glucose uptake; (iii) Nodal signaling may modulate post-translational modifications (i.e. phosphorylation) of proteins involved in facilitating glucose uptake56. Hence even if NEMEP is missing the cells can respond to Nodal signaling to regulate glucose uptake but at relatively lower level.

That is our results support a model of mesendoderm differentiation from pluripotent mESCs wherein activated Nodal signaling induces the expression of a micropeptide NEMEP that may function by interacting with GLUT1 and GLUT3 or other facilitators involved in glucose uptake and augmenting the glucose uptake to meet the energy needs during mesendoderm differentiation (Fig. 7g)."

The company donated about $150000 of pet food.

According to Better Choice Company the efficiency of its supply chain allowed it to support the donation despite the supply chain challenges heavily impacting the industry at large. The company donated nearly 65000 lbs of dry and wet cat and dog food from its Halo Pets brand.

“We’ve partnered with Greater Good Charities for many years and are proud to support their efforts in times of need” said Scott Lerner chief executive officer of Better Choice Company. “When our industry experiences supply chain challenges shelters are often the first impacted so we felt that this was the right time to act.”

Greater Good Charities is a global nonprofit that strives to support people pets and the planet. The nonprofit has recently focused its efforts on Ukraine striving to support those impacted by Russia’s invasion of the country and supporting pet food manufacturer Kormotech’s Save the Pets of Ukraine initiative.

Better Choice Company’s donation follows significant sales growth in the second quarter and its subsequent relaunch of Halo Holistic.

Jiminez Farms is a small local family farm that has recently begun to flourish. Built and operated by Luis Gutierrez and Ashley Swinford Jiminez Farms is on a quest to bring healthy fresh produce to the citizens of Vicksburg.

“Basically we started as a hobby that we for some reason couldn’t keep” said Gutierrez. “I was working on the boat for the last three years.” Swinford added “It just started where we wanted to have chickens so we could have our own eggs.” Gutierrez took a big chance at the beginning of the year. “I finally was brave enough to take the jump and get off the boat in January.”

Gutierrez and Swinford say what began for them as a home-based quest to feed their family really took off and developed into a business. The couple has worked hard ever since to invest themselves in their animals and garden. They currently have goats rabbits quail and of course chickens.

Swinford spoke about how it all came to be. “We found a seller on a Facebook page that had the chicken breeds I’d been wanting. Then tractor supply had chickens there and I got suckered into getting more.” She laughed as she recalled the memory. “People were coming over and they were seeing how many eggs we were getting. We had 17 chickens at the time.”

Gutierrez realized early on that having fresh eggs from healthy happy chickens made a huge difference. “Free Range at the supermarket is a lie. Those chickens get maybe a square foot of space.” A little bit of research on the brands of eggs labeled “organic” or “free-range” at the grocery store will prove that eggs often come from chickens who are living in unsavory conditions regardless of advertising. At Jiminez Farms the animals are loved and treated as family pets. They also have plenty of space to graze and roam.

Eventually Gutierrez hopes to make this his main focus. “I want it to be my only focus but I’m not big enough for that yet. It’s really just starting to take off for us now. We hope that by next year we’ll be a lot further along.”

Gutierrez and Swinford take great care of their animals. There are three big areas for them to explore and exercise. “A lot of them have names” noted Swinford. “We know exactly who lays what eggs and what they all like or don’t like.” She went on to reminisce about the “alpha hen” of the group. “The head chicken is named Karen.”

Gutierrez let out a laugh as he chimed in “Karen runs the show! She leads the pack.” Karen is always the first to the food and she’s the first to lay her eggs. She provides more than just produce for this family. She seems to live up to her name and is the comic relief as well.

The farm recently acquired quails their newest venture. “We will have pickled quail eggs here in the near future” said Gutierrez. “We’re experimenting with it. We just got the quails.”

Swinford then elaborated on how rabbits came to find residence on the farm. “We got a rabbit from my friend and I was completely against it” she mentioned. Gutierrez laughed again as he remembered “The best thing about that friend was that they told us it was a male.” The rabbit was in fact a female. Soon enough they found themselves with a small warren of their own. Swinford continued “Then we bought another rabbit and went to the local tractor supply for a small animal sale.” Despite reservations at the beginning they love their rabbits. They both bantered back and forth lightheartedly about how they accumulated animals.

“We kind of just take in animals that people aren’t wanting anymore” Gutierrez said. They have acquired a few animals that needed new homes from friends and acquaintances. “In a way we’re kind of a rescue.”

Aside from raising animals and selling products such as eggs and goat’s milk they also work hard growing fresh fruits and vegetables in their garden. “We’re also gonna have some pumpkins at the beginning of October that we can sell” Swinford said. Gutierrez added “We’re slowly but surely always looking for a way to expand.”

Swinford went on “We started a little garden this year just to test out the waters. We have jalapeños green bell peppers and some watermelon we have probably like 20 right now that are coming in. We have a couple of tomato plants but not enough to produce a lot. When I planted the tomatoes I just wanted to make sure we could juggle it all. All the plants are pretty much flourishing. Hopefully next year we can expand and have a much bigger garden in the spring.”

The goats on the farm are a big hit. Gutierrez spoke passionately about the many benefits of consuming goat milk in lieu of dairy. A fun fact is that goat milk is very similar to human breast milk component-wise. It’s easier to digest than cow milk and is rich in vitamins and nutrients.

If you’re wondering the answer is yes the Jiminez Farms family milks their goats strictly by hand. Gutierrez and Swinford shared more laughter when they were asked about the goat milking. In addition to the pride they have in their hard work it’s obvious that they’re having fun too.

“The goats are super friendly they love treats and being loved on” said Swinford. The goats have big personalities and love the attention they get from human interaction.

To Gutierrez the most rewarding part of running a farm is that “people can know where their produce is coming from. They can know that what they’re getting is fresh and comes from well cared for animals.” The couple expressed that they open their farm to visitors and friends often. They consider themselves somewhat of a family-friendly petting zoo but don’t charge for admission yet. It makes them happy just to see children joyfully interacting with their animals.

“I never once thought it would get bigger than living for my family” Gutierrez stated “But once you start seeing the changes you just feel different. You feel better in every way and we knew we had to share that.”

Gutierrez and Swinford have three beautiful children together. Swinford discussed how good it’s been for her kids to be involved in this mission. “It’s turned into a family thing. The kids love it! They get so excited to go collect the eggs. Our youngest gets out there and wrangles the chickens. Our middle son loves to go to the garden and see how big the watermelons are.” She went on to speak about how modern life is generally out of touch with this way of living. “You forget that when you were growing up you played with chalk or jump roped or went out into nature. You forget because in today’s society we have technology and convenience and so many distractions. You have to get back in touch with simplicity.” Her focus is on keeping the kids involved in the farm which has given them all a sense of reward and responsibility.

She clarified “It was just started to support our family and hopefully instill in them that taking care of these animals takes care of you. Then we realized we could have something here on our hands where we can help other families.” That desire to share with others is what drives the farm towards expansion.

“In January our wheels were turning. New chicks arrived in February by March we were really moving forward.” Swinford shared. For now they are focused on fresh eggs goat milk homemade goat cheese and pumpkins. Lots of big additions are coming next spring.

Everything on the farm was built by the blood sweat and tears of Gutierrez and Swinford. “We do a lot of things by hand” Gutierrez started. “We don’t use a tiller or anything. We built everything by hand. Fences to keep out wildlife and shelter for the animals we didn’t take any shortcuts. We got little donations here and there but other than that everything is something we built on our own.”

“I did get to live like our ancestors and live off of the barter system for a while” Gutierrez joked. He mentioned that in the beginning they got to experience a taste of human history. They’ve acquired several things by trading with other locals and friends.

Swinford perked up as she recalled “We actually just got two incubators so we’re hoping we can hatch and grow our own chicks. We’ll have fertilized eggs and baby chicks for sale so if people want to raise their own chicks or purchase fertilized eggs that come from our chickens they can!”

For this hard-working family the most rewarding experience is one they are sharing with their children. They have built from the ground up a way of life that can provide for years and years to come. The children don’t mind doing the work on the farm they really enjoy it. Swinford said “I know it’s going to instill hard work in them and a love of taking care of something that takes care of you.”

Jiminez Farms is so passionate about teaching others in the community about healthy eating and living. They are genuinely excited to share this journey with their community. They’re currently working daily to grow their farm and bring something to Vicksburg that improves life for everyone. They are looking forward to bringing more goods to the table in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWsvaG9tZS1uZXdzL2dvYXRzLW1pbGstY2hlZXNlLWZhcm0tbS1zLW9jYWRvLWFzZGEtbW9ycmlzb25zLWIyMTEzODkyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goats 'shoved and neglected' at farm that supplies M&S Ocado Asda and Morrisons,"Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the world Sign up to our free Morning Headlines email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

Goats were subjected to violence and neglect at a showcase farm whose milk and cheese are sold in UK supermarkets and Marks & Spencer according to investigators who carried out secret recordings.

Hidden cameras at the award-winning Pasture House Farm near Skipton North Yorkshire – one of the UK’s largest intensive goat dairies – showed animals apparently so lame they could not walk.

The video also revealed the killing of baby goats deemed of no value to the industry – thought to be the first time this has been recorded in the UK.

Goats’ milk is often marketed as an allergen-free healthier or more ethical alternative to cows’ milk.

But activists for the Animal Justice Project (AJP) who for three months monitored the farm which supplies milk to Delamere Dairy said they saw a string of shocking scenes including:

lame goats struggling to get up to reach food and water

animals suffering painfully overgrown hooves

mother goats with udders so distended they touched the floor sometimes leaving animals unable to walk properly

workers roughly shoving animals

kids crying out as their ears were tagged

piles of dead goats dumped outdoors

female goats being killed on the farm instead of being reared for breeding

kids as young as 24 hours old also killed

M&S Asda Ocado and Morrisons sell milk cheese butter or yoghurt from Delamere Dairy.

Delamere says it operates a “strict independently monitored farm assurance and welfare code” which means its milk “is sourced to the highest welfare standards”.

It says all its supply farms are family-run and “Red Tractor-assured” and the animals live in light airy barns with deep bedding and plenty of space.

Red Tractor is a not-for-profit company that is the UK’s biggest farm and food assurance scheme. Its rules state that animals’ health and welfare “must be met at all times and that lame goats must be identified treated and managed”.

Phil Ormerod who runs the farm is a director of the Milking Goat Association and has been described by the Innovation for Agriculture consortium as “one of the most progressive farmers in the industry”.

But the animal rights organisation said it was disturbed to see workers hitting and slapping goats to various degrees on eight occasions. Some pulled the animals’ tails and grabbed their noses.

They said the footage showed “numerous severely lame” goats in the birthing pen that struggled to walk to reach food and water.

Some tried not to put weight on their legs in pain and one was unable to stand for 28 hours it’s claimed. One was seen in the footage trying to walk on its front knees.

Claire Palmer founder and director of AJP said: “Workers were not recorded assessing pregnant goats for lameness mastitis or any other health concern but saw severely lame goats in the parlour but did not act instead hurrying them along with others.”

Animals were unable to display natural behaviour because they were never let outdoors and one kid was “hit in the face when it tried to depart from a herd” she claimed.

Photographs of bodies left on the ground are too unpleasant to publish.

Delamere says goats have not evolved for the British climate with feet designed for dry rocky environments.

Delamere says disbudding was done with anaesthetic ( Animal Justice Project )

The farm which has around 2000 animals is one of the largest intensive goat farms in the UK and also sells animals for meat. It is featured on Delamere’s website.

Young animals were allegedly left with “bloody head wounds” after disbudding – destroying tissue around the horn bud which is done to stop horns from growing and potentially injuring other animals or people.

The footage showed workers failed to carry out twice-daily checks as advised by Red Tractor according to the activists and pens were not cleaned out during the filming using 10 cameras with “fresh straw put on top of sodden”.

Don’t tell the vet we did it Farm worker

The investigators also say piles of dead goats were seen dumped outside on a path and in sheds which “risked spreading disease”.

“Two piles were left outside for 11 days the first time and 14 days the second time and birds were feeding from the bodies” Ms Palmer said.

“We estimate from counting bodies on dead piles that at least 200 goats were killed and thrown on piles during our investigation. This goes against government guidance and Red Tractor goat standards.”

Bodies were thrown on top of one another without being checked for signs of life she claimed.

Delamere whose turnover is around £30m from UK sales and exports has won a string of industry awards.

It is as well known for goat milk products as St Helen’s where as The Independent revealed in 2020 workers were found subjecting goats to a string of brutal attacks including punching and tail-twisting.

At Pasture House Farm activists said they also saw kids being killed in front of their mothers which is not illegal but was condemned by AJP as cruel.

Ms Palmer said their cameras captured “pithing” of unwanted kids – rods being plunged into their heads to end their lives after a captive bolt has stunned them.

Although the practice is carried out legally on UK farms it is believed to be the first time it has been filmed in the UK and the cameras caught kids “still kicking afterwards”.

Kids were killed on farm ( Animal Justice Project )

In one clip a worker who has just killed a kid is heard saying: “Don’t tell the vet we did it.”

Molly Vasanthakumar a vet who watched the video clips from AJP said the video of kids being killed broke her heart adding: “I have multiple concerns here. Firstly the death of so many lovely kids who are clearly considered to be of no financial value.

“Secondly the fact that each kid is bolt-gunned next to the bodies of other kids. I feel it takes a certain level of cognitive dissonance to put any sentient being through that.

“And then finally the fact that not a single kid is checked after it has been killed.”

The clips also showed “an excessive number” of lame goats she said and that “the associated pain and discomfort are an obvious cause of concern”.

Ms Palmer said the findings revealed “a side to the goat milk industry that is hidden” from the public.

Pasture House Farm said in a statement: “We pride ourselves on the quality of our stock the high health status of our herd and in turn the welfare standards we have achieved and maintain.

“We continue to meet the requirements of all external inspections announced or unannounced and actively encourage site visits from all sectors including government trade academia veterinary or from a variety of groups and auditing bodies.

“We welcome the opportunity to have our farming practices challenged via direct or indirect means and though various claims and allegations have been made against our practices none of what we have seen appears to breach the animal welfare standards to which we adhere.”

A Delamere Dairy spokeswoman said the company frequently visits Pasture House Farm and in the past month it passed an independent audit.

Dead kids were carried away ( Animal Justice Project )

“The family that runs this farm has a wealth of knowledge and experience and uses this to maintain high herd health and protect their farm livestock and livelihood” she said.

“Undercover activity is not necessarily a bad thing and has sometimes helped to right some wrongs.”

But she said the footage apparently had been edited. “I appreciate some of this will be distressing to the general public. However we do not believe that animal welfare codes have been breached.”

She added that any lame goats are put in the sick bay for treatment; before Covid all male kids were reared for meat but the pandemic shrank the restaurant trade; euthanising conforms to Humane Slaughter Association regulations; tagging is a legal requirement that causes pain for just seconds; and disbudding is done under anaesthetic by a vet.

“The notion that the farm doesn’t comply with the law by checking animals at least twice a day is false. Workers are in the sheds on and off all day from 6am until the last checks around 9pm.

Piles of dead kids at the showcase farm ( Animal Justice Project )

“We don’t recognise a farm worker ‘hitting and slapping’ goats. She is tending to the health and welfare of kids” that immediately run back to her. Fresh clean straw is put down every day she said. “Bedded pens never look as clean in this light but seen in full daylight they would look and are perfectly clean.

“Delamere strives to work with the best in the industry and we remain very transparent as a business and our approach to sustainable farming.”

A spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and will investigate these claims. Swift action will be taken against any breaches to the high animal welfare standards our members uphold.”

This so-called ‘airmageddon’ has been building for months: in April nearly 220000 checked bags among U.S. airlines were lost damaged delayed or ripped a staggering 135% increase from the same period in 2021 according to the most recent U.S. Department of Transportation Air Travel Consumer Report released in June.

American Airlines led the pack with the highest likelihood of mishandling customer baggage with nearly 70000 cases in April 2022 compared with about 37000 in April 2021. Alaska Jet Blue Delta and United in that order had the next highest rates of mishandled bags.

American has topped the list for two years in a row while Delta United and Alaska all got worse pushing Spirit out of the top five in April 2022.

Baggage complaints made by consumers against U.S. and foreign airlines ballooned even more — by 619% over the past year.

Total consumer complaints about airlines leaped 147% the report said

Compounding the problems is what passengers describe as dreadful customer service from airlines about what is happening to all the lost and damaged bags.

“The biggest thing that’s so discouraging and sort of traumatizing is just the utter lack of regard and communication for consumers” Kartik Akileswaran whose bags have been missing for over a week told The Post.

US-born Akileswaran 37 and his wife Uthara Ganesh 33 flew more than 4000 miles from their current home in New Delhi India to Paris France to attend a friend’s wedding.

When they landed they waited so long for their bags that they missed the wedding leaving them “completely distraught.”

Chris Wood a retiree in her mid-70s living in Scotland lost her bags on a return flight from Montreal to Edinburgh late last week.

Wood said she and her husband spent seven days calling emailing and tweeting the airport and airline “without reply.” They only received their luggage after a stranger found their bag abandoned in the airport and contacted Wood’s husband via an email address on the bag’s ID tag.

Wood called the experience “a nightmare” which she attributed to “really poor communication” between airlines airports and travelers. “Customer relations were really poor customer care was non-existent” she said.

Last week Louis Quinones 50 flew from Tampa Florida to Berlin Germany with a suitcase filled with medications electronics and family heirlooms which has since been lost.

For over a week he’s been navigating what he described as a “desert of customer service” with “no human contact.”

“Not only they have not found it but [there’s] no communication whatsoever” he said. “No one has called me to ease my discomfort.”

Experts have attributed the travel chaos to staffing shortages and labor strikes. Delta Airlines pilots last week picketed outside airports across the U.S. for higher wages and more time off. Airline workers in France Spain Sweden and Denmark are currently striking for increased pay and British Airways on Thursday narrowly avoided an impending strike.

Ganesh and Akileswaran said they were sympathetic to the striking workers but were still disheartened by the complete lack of communication. The airline’s voicemail was full during one recent call Akileswaran said.

“It’s a black hole at this point” said Ganesh 33 a tech executive who flies frequently and said she’s never experienced anything like this. “Honestly it seems like it’s the worst time in history to travel in Europe.”

A spokesperson for Berlin Brandenburg airport said “At the major hubs there are currently delays in baggage handling due to staffing problems. … Due to the staffing situation at the airports there the baggage can‘t be unloaded sorted and reloaded in the next plane in time.”

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and airports in Tampa Edinburgh Brussels and Toronto directed The Post to airlines and contracted ground handling companies. SriLankan Airlines Lufthansa and AirFrance did not respond to requests for comment.

The New York Marine and General Insurance Company filed the suit against Heard on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. New York Marine insured Heard from July 18 2018 through July 18 2019 — a crucial time period for the defamation case. That time frame includes the date Heard wrote and retweeted a now-infamous Washington Post op-ed — a piece in which she claimed she was “a public figure representing domestic abuse.” The headline discussed Heard “speaking up against sexual violence” and “facing our culture’s wrath.”

Today I published this op-ed in the Washington Post about the women who are channeling their rage about violence and inequality into political strength despite the price of coming forward. From college campuses to Congress we’re balancing the scales.https://t.co/dBSwuJBtay — Amber Heard (@realamberheard) December 19 2018

The period of time New York Marine insured Heard also includes the March 1 2019 filing date of Depp’s defamation lawsuit. The suit was filed in Fairfax County Virginia because computer servers for The Washington Post are located there and because the paper’s printing plant is located Springfield Virginia.

The insurance company’s suit claims Heard was covered by a $1 million insurance policy from July 2018 through July 2019.

In the complaint New York Marine notes that California insurance law provides that although an insurance company may be liable for an insured party’s negligence “an insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the willful act of the insured[.]” New York Marine argues that since Heard was found by a Virginia jury to have acted with actual malice — in other words willfully — when defaming Depp the company should not have to indemnify Heard.

The suit also claims New York Marine accepted Heard’s defense on October 1 2019 through the law firm Cameron McEvoy and had agreed to continue its coverage through that firm. However New York Marine claims Cameron McEvoy withdrew from the case on November 2 2020 at the advice of Heard or attorneys representing her. It suggests New York Marine did not approve of a concomitant change in counsel and therefore shouldn’t have to pay for Heard’s legal fees.

On June 1 a jury found that Heard defamed Depp via her op-ed. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. However the judgement topped out at $10.35 million in sum total since punitive damages are capped at $350000 under Virginia law. The jurors deliberated for 13 hours across three days after having heard testimony for six weeks.

The jury found Depp liable on one counterclaim of defamation associated with a statement made by his attorney Adam Waldman to the Daily Mail in April 2020. Waldman told the publication that Heard and her friends set Depp up by calling 911 and summoning first responders to his penthouse on May 21 2016. That night Heard had asked Depp to come to the penthouse they shared. Depp said he had told Heard he planned to file for divorce. Depp testified he went to the apartment to gather some belongings as he prepared to go on a tour with his band The Hollywood Vampires.

That night Depp said he and Heard spoke and she became angry. Heard claims Depp threw her phone at her face. Depp claims he did no such thing and left after his security team heard yelling and ran into the penthouse to take him away.

Six days later Heard sought and obtained a domestic violence restraining order against Depp. The media awaited her exit from the Los Angeles County courthouse and the story quickly spread around the globe.

Depp has denied ever physically or sexually abusing Heard.

Notably Heard also had a homeowners insurance policy through Travelers Insurance at the time she wrote the Washington Post op-ed. In fact a representative from Travelers Insurance was in court during the defamation trial each day seated in the gallery behind Heard.

In a separate case filed last year Travelers Insurance sued New York Marine for what the former company called the latter’s “failure to meet its obligation to provide [Heard] with independent counsel and other counsel necessary to defend [Heard].” The result of that alleged failure according to Travelers was that Travelers was unfairly forced to pay for its share of the defense. The judge in that case which was also filed in the Central District of California was asked to stay the proceedings for 65 days in May.

The business software vendor Salesforce for instance generated 146000 metric tons of carbon emissions—roughly equal to the annual emissions of 18000 US homes—just by flying its employees around the world to client meetings and conferences in 2019. For comparison that’s about 60% as much carbon as all of Salesforce’s data centers generated that year hosting cloud computing services for over 150000 clients.

Salesforce has vowed to cut its carbon emissions to zero by 2040. To reach that goal the company will have to find a more climate-friendly form of business travel. That’s why Salesforce is one of dozens of companies experimenting with buying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates which are designed to give business travelers a way to book carbon-neutral flights. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has backed the concept and is designing an accounting framework that would allow airlines to sell SAF certificates to their biggest corporate clients.

If it works proponents say the scheme could help companies cut their carbon emissions jumpstart the market for lower-carbon jet fuels and create a pathway to decarbonize the airline industry by 2050.

The World Economic Forum’s SAF certificate framework

SAF is a category of jet fuels that releases between 50% and 80% less carbon than standard petroleum-based jet fuel. Right now SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of the fuel used in commercial flights because it’s more expensive than standard jet fuel and supply is very limited. But if there were an economic incentive for manufacturers to produce more SAF and for airlines to buy more of it the aviation industry could cut its carbon emissions considerably.

To create that economic incentive the WEF—along with airlines and some of their largest business travel customers—are designing a system they’ve dubbed “SAF certificates.” Under the proposed system companies like Salesforce could buy SAF certificates from airlines to offset the carbon emissions generated by their employees’ business travel. Airlines would use the money they make from selling these certificates to buy a certain amount of SAF instead of traditional jet fuel. By replacing a set amount of jet fuel with lower-carbon SAF the airline would reduce its carbon emissions by a clear measurable amount.

If the program is designed well—with transparency oversight and clear accounting—a company like Salesforce could buy SAF certificates and meaningfully reduce its business travel emissions to zero.

Airlines and their biggest corporate travel clients have been testing out the concept since 2021. Last year 11 companies including Boston Consulting Group Nike and HP bought enough SAF certificates from United Airlines to subsidize the purchase of about 3.4 million gallons of SAF (about 0.1% of United’s fuel consumption). In February JetBlue announced four companies including Salesforce will buy enough SAF certificates to subsidize 325000 gallons of SAF (0.05% of JetBlue’s 2021 fuel consumption).

The WEF has used data from some of these early transactions to design an accounting system for tracking how much each SAF certificate sale helps reduce carbon emissions. The organization plans to publish its accounting rules in September and test them out with a new round of experimental SAF certificate sales later this year. The WEF aims to establish a global SAF certificate market which meets the standards of environmental watchdogs like the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) by 2024.

What are sustainable aviation fuels?

Many types of fuel can count as SAF including biofuels made from corn algae used cooking oil municipal trash sewage and other forms of waste or synthetic fuels like liquid hydrogen created using renewable electricity. The key requirement is that all these fuels must emit at least 50% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel.

For now most SAF is biofuel made from used cooking oil which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions (pdf) by as much as 84% compared to conventional jet fuel. But there simply isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to meet the airline industry’s fuel consumption according to Mike McCurdy an engineer who heads the energy advisory department at consulting firm ICF. McCurdy estimates there’s enough readily available kitchen grease out there to produce 3 to 5 billion gallons of fuel a year split between SAF and biodiesel for trucks. Commercial airlines by comparison used 95 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2019.

Meeting the airline industry’s fuel needs through SAF will require fuel producers to refine the process for converting woodchips crops and household food waste into biofuels. But those fuel sources will require years of research and construction to scale up and become cost competitive. For instance one of the earliest alcohol-to-jet-fuel facilities operated by the alternative fuel startup LanzaJet aims to produce just 10 million gallons of SAF per year from corn ethanol when it opens at the end of 2022.

The SAF market’s chicken-and-egg problem

The SAF market needs billions of dollars in investment to scale up production to replace conventional jet fuel. But the market is stuck at an impasse. Airlines are reluctant to buy SAF because it typically costs about twice as much as conventional jet fuel. And manufacturers are reluctant to produce more SAF because airlines don’t want to buy it.

SAF certificates offer a way to break the impasse and start a virtuous cycle. If business travelers were to subsidize the extra cost of buying lower-carbon fuels airlines would be willing to use them. Greater demand from airlines should incentivize manufacturers to produce more SAF. As manufacturing scales up costs would fall and eventually SAF could become cost competitive with petroleum-based jet fuel according to Eliot Lees vice president for clean transportation at ICF.

“The challenge is priming the pump and getting this new renewable jet fuel into the fleet as quickly as possible” said Lees. “If you wait for the market to do it it’s going to be a challenge to meet the emissions target that both the federal government is pushing and the industry is trying to achieve.”

“If you wait for the market to do it it’s going to be a challenge to meet the emissions target that both the federal government is pushing and the industry is trying to achieve.”

“Priming the pump” starts with a handful of companies that collectively fly millions of employees around the world each year. Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Boeing Deloitte JPMorgan Chase McKinsey Microsoft Netflix and Salesforce are the founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) a group of corporate business travel giants committed to buying SAF certificates to push airlines and fuel manufacturers to ramp up SAF production and use. “Because there is significant concentration in demand for flying especially around corporate [travelers] we believe we can send a very strong signal to the market and help create the market for SAF” said Tarek Helmi who leads Deloitte’s work on sustainable energy.

Recent spikes in oil prices have brought SAF and conventional jet fuel closer to cost parity: The average US price of SAF is $8.33 per gallon compared to $7.33 per gallon for conventional jet fuel. But even small price premiums for SAF can be a big barrier for airlines according to Lees. “Aviation is a highly competitive industry with very small margins that there’s significant pressure to maintain and jet fuel makes up 30% of airlines’ costs” he said. Paying an extra dollar a gallon for fuel would eat into airlines’ margins at a moment when even the biggest firms are struggling to break even.

The SAF certificate accounting challenge

Before the WEF can help establish a trusted global market for SAF certificates it will need to create a transparent carbon accounting system. The certificates won’t have any value unless the businesses that buy them have can prove they are truly reducing carbon emissions as much as they say they are. Otherwise companies that buy SAF certificates will face the same accusations of greenwashing that plague the carbon offset market.

The best way to create that trust is through a clear consistent accounting system that wins the endorsement of recognized authorities on corporate carbon cutting schemes. Getting those organizations’ buy-in is crucial for convincing companies to spend money on SAF certificates according to Andrew Chen who heads the aviation decarbonization team at the Rocky Mountain Institute an environmental consulting group that helped found SABA and is working with the WEF to design the SAF certificate accounting system it plans to publish in September.

“The Science Based Targets Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are going to look at that suite of documents and say ‘Is this legit? Have they really thought through all of this? Do they have an accurate accounting approach?’” said Chen. If SBTI and GHGP aren’t satisfied companies will have a hard time justifying SAF certificate purchases.

So far the groups have been cautiously supportive of the WEF’s efforts. SBTI endorsed the sale of SAF certificates (pdf) to business travelers as a way to cut carbon emissions in August 2021. But the organization noted “the practicalities of corporate SAF procurement and accounting are currently poorly defined in the market” and stressed the need for more standard accounting practices before it could throw its full weight behind any SAF certificate scheme.

First airlines need to demonstrate that they used their certificate money to buy additional SAF on top of whatever quantity of SAF they were already legally required to buy. The EU for instance is considering a rule that would require airlines to buy jet fuel blended with at least 2% SAF by 2025. Airlines would have to buy that legally mandated amount of SAF first and then buy even more to fulfill their SAF certificate commitments.

Second airlines need to create clear consistent pricing for certificates across the industry. In early SAF transactions prices have ranged widely. Deloitte published a report detailing its experience buying SAF certificates from American Airlines Delta and United Airlines between February and April 2021. The consulting firm wrote that it paid an average of $130 per metric ton of carbon emissions avoided—but the prices ranged by more than $90 a ton between airlines and none of the airlines offered clear breakdowns explaining how they set their prices.

“We paid what we believe to be the price premium for sustainable aviation fuel over [conventional jet fuel] but it’s certainly not a transparent market yet” said Lisa Newman-Wise Deloitte’s climate chief of staff.

How can the airline industry reach zero emissions by 2050?

Ultimately SAF alone won’t get the airline industry to cut its carbon emissions to zero. Even if airlines replaced every drop of jet fuel they use with SAF they’d only reduce their emissions by 50% to 80%. To reach net zero airlines will have to replace their existing fleets of jet-fuel-burning planes with new models that can run on electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.

But those airplanes haven’t been invented yet. It will take decades for established planemakers like Boeing and Airbus or startups like ZeroAvia to develop a new generation of zero-emissions jets that can carry hundreds of passengers long distances. In the meantime airlines will keep buying conventional planes that burn jet fuel and those planes will stay in the sky for an operating life of up to 30 years.

SAF offers a way to bring down the airline industry’s emissions now as a bridge between the current generation of heavily carbon-emitting planes—which contribute more than 2% of all global greenhouse emissions—and that future generation of yet-to-be-invented zero-emission planes.

“This is what has to happen if we want to enjoy the benefits of an economy that is connected by aviation in the future and one that doesn’t create unacceptable climate impacts” said Chen."

With a 1.20 ERA a 2.44 FIP and a .232/.271/.321 line against in his last two starts and 15 IP Patrick Corbin has shown signs of life well into his third season of struggling on the hill in Washington’s rotation and the Nationals’ southpaw told reporters after he held Miami to one run on eight hits in seven runs last time out before today he has felt better for a while now even if there weren’t results to support his feelings.

“Like I’ve said I’ve felt good even before this even the couple before” Corbin explained as quoted by MASN’s Mark Zuckerman.

“I’m more looking at how the ball’s coming out how my pitches are moving a little bit more than results. Obviously you want results but sometimes it doesn’t happen.”

Corbin gave up a leadoff single by Ronald Acuña Jr. on a 2-1 sinker in the first at-bat of this afternoon’s game and two outs later he gave up a 422 foot two-run homer on an 0-1 slider he left over the middle of the plate to Austin Riley whose 22nd of 2022 put the Braves up 2-0 early.

Austin Riley and Travis d’Arnaud hit back-to-back singles off Corbin in the bottom of the fourth and one out later Riley scored on a Marcell Ozuna grounder when Luis García’s throw to first sailed wide and got by a lunging Josh Bell 3-1 Braves. Orlando Arcia drove another run in with an RBI single 4-1 and Atlanta loaded the bases with two out but left them loaded in a 32-pitch frame by Corbin who finished the fourth at 76 overall.

Corbin got an inning-ending double play after walking Riley with one out in the fifth and he was up to 88 pitches after the 12-pitch frame and a 14-pitch 1-2-3 sixth left him at 102 total.

Patrick Corbin’s Line: 6.0 IP 8 H 4 R 4 ER 2 BB 4 Ks 1 HR 102 P 61 S 5/2 GO/FO.

Wright Makes Right Or Something:

In his last seven starts before today’s outing Kyle Wright was (5-1) with a 3.19 ERA a 3.41 FIP and a .253/.318/.342 line against in 42 1⁄ 3 IP.

This afternoon threw his first 18 pitches for strikes in a true aggressive pounding the zone-type approach this afternoon in Truist Park.

He worked around a two-out single by Josh Bell in an 11-pitch first then a one-out double by Keibert Ruiz in an 11-pitch second inning after his teammates gave him an early 2-0 lead to work with in the home first.

Ehire Adrianza singled to start the Nationals’ third but was doubled up on a ground ball to third by César Hernández then Juan Soto stepped in and hit a 1-1 curve up in the zone and outside to left field for a 400-foot home opposite field homer which cut the Braves’ lead in half 2-1. Soto’s 17th of 2022 (and second in two games in Atlanta).

Will Smith took over for the Braves with Juan Soto on first after a leadoff walk in the top of the eighth and Soto took third base on a double to left by Josh Bell on a first-pitch curve from Smith. Nelson Cruz stepped in next and singled through the left side bringing Soto home 4-3 and getting Bell to third with no one out. Luis García flew out to left-center for out No. 1 but not deep enough for Bell to score.

Keibert Ruiz K’d swinging with the tying run still on third and then Yadiel Hernández did as well. Still 4-3 Braves after seven and a half.

Mason Thompson got the bottom of the eighth for the Nationals and retired the side on a total of 16 pitches.

A.J. Minter got the save opportunity in the ninth and the left-hander gave up a leadoff hit by Lane Thomas but Ehire Adrianza popped out trying to bunt for out No. 1. César Hernandez’s strikeout (looking) left it up to Juan Soto who fell behind 0-2 but singled to right field on a 1-2 changeup for a game-extending hit. Josh Bell? From the right side?

A man is facing multiple charges after being arrested for a bank robbery in Herndon Thursday afternoon police said.

Herndon Police responded to a Truist Bank located on Herndon Parkway around 12 p.m. after receiving a report about a bank robbery.

Employees informed police that a black man dressed in black clothing and wearing a face mask approached a teller pointed a hand gun and demanded money. The teller gave the suspect around $2500 and he then left on foot.

The suspect was located by a Herndon officer nearby North Walnut Branch Road in Reston and a brief foot pursuit initiated but the officer lost sight of him.

As the search continued the suspect was found hiding in some bushes near Sundance Court and North Walnut Branch Road by Fairfax County Police around 2:20 p.m. and was taken into custody.

Steven Eley the identified suspect was charged with robbery and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony Herndon Police said.

Jurors returned the verdict in federal court after more than a day of deliberations. Two earlier trials ended in hung juries and prosecutors had hoped for success after narrowing the case from 10 individuals to five. Instead the result was a win for former Pilgrim's Pride Corp. chief executive officers Jayson Penn and William Lovette; Roger Austin a former Pilgrim's vice president; Mikell Fries president of Claxton Poultry; and Scott Brady a Claxton vice president.

Criminal trials of industry executives are unusual and they came as soaring meat prices are adding fuel to rising inflation. Each man faced the possibility of prison sentences and million-dollar fines if convicted.

The Justice Department pushed ahead with a third trial after U.S. District Judge Philip Brimmer summoned Jonathan Kanter head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division to Denver in April to explain why after two hung juries he thought the government could still win convictions.

""We know that the evidence couldn't persuade 12 people"" a skeptical Brimmer told Kanter at the time. ""We've seen it happen twice.""

The result calls into question the government's ability to win convictions in other chicken price-fixing cases.

""Although we are disappointed in the verdict we will continue to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws especially when it comes to price-fixing schemes that affect core staples"" the Justice Department said in a statement. ""We will not be deterred from continuing to vigilantly pursue cases to protect the American people and our markets.""

A Justice Department spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a question about other prosecutions targeting alleged price-fixing in the chicken market.

""This case should never have been brought"" said Michael Tubach a lawyer for Penn. ""Jayson Penn and his family have shown incredible strength throughout this ordeal. We are gratified that the jury has vindicated Jayson and he can now move forward with his life.""

Michael Feldberg who represents Austin called the defendants ""extremely courageous human beings"" for standing up to the pressure of three trials. ""This was justice"" he said. Brady's lawyer Bryan Lavine said they are ""very thankful for the jury's verdict.""

""Mr. Fries and the other defendants have maintained their innocence from day one and after three trials they have been vindicated"" said his lawyer Rick Kornfeld.

After the second trial prosecutors dropped charges against Timothy Mulrenin a Perdue Farms Inc. executive who previously worked at Tyson Foods Inc.; William Kantola a Koch Foods Inc. executive; Jimmie Lee Little a former Pilgrim's sales director; Gary Brian Roberts a Case Farms employee who had worked at Tyson; and Ric Blake a former director and manager at George's Inc.

The series of criminal trials was the first after a years-long federal investigation that targeted the biggest producers in the $95 billion chicken market. Tyson the biggest U.S. chicken producer said in 2020 it was cooperating in the federal investigation taking advantage of a government policy to grant leniency to companies that are the first to disclose illegal price-fixing.

Each defendant was charged with a single count of conspiracy to restrain trade which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison.

Jurors in all three trials heard from the government's star witness Robert Bryant a longtime Pilgrim's Pride employee. Bryant testified about an industry-wide agreement to share price and bid information to inflate profits or limit losses depending on market conditions.

Bryant who testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution admitted on cross-examination that he had lied to the FBI ""multiple times"" on matters unrelated to the price-fixing investigation. The subject of Bryant's lies wasn't made public.

More than 40000 members of the Islamic community came to U.S. Bank Stadium on Saturday to celebrate Eid-al-Adha one of the religion’s holiest traditions.

The turnout was so extreme organizations tell 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS they had to add an additional prayer service and eventually turn members away.

“Super” Eid was created by Minnesota’s Muslim Coalition back in 2018 after leaders say mosques around the state began questioning the safety of celebrating Eid.

Abdulahi Farah with the Muslim Coalition explained that hate and attacks geared toward the community had sparked fear.

“There was a lot of political rhetoric a lot of fear-mongering and divisive narratives that were out there. A lot of our community was under this dark shadow of oh my god is it really safe to come together for Eid?” Farah said.

Instead of scaling back Muslim leaders looked to their values for guidance and created “Super” Eid a larger and more public celebration of their traditions.

Farah explained they chose U.S. Bank Stadium because it was by far the biggest and most Minnesotan venue to host their Eid services.

In past year the event has drawn anywhere between 30-35000 people but this year the holiday celebrating Ibrihim drew more than 40000 participants. Farah says it’s a great example for their youngest members who didn’t grow up surrounded by as many Muslim traditions as older generations did.

“It really gives you a sense of belonging and a sense of unity” Farah said.

About Eid al-Adha: According to the Muslim Coalition Eid-al-Adha commemorates the sincere faithfulness of Prophet Ibrahim or Abraham as he’s called in the Jewish and Christian faiths. The organization says that as a test the prophet was called by Allah the Arabic word for God to sacrifice his son. As Ibrahim was about to carry out what had been commanded up him Allah instructed him to let his son go and to instead sacrifice a ram. For this reason Islam calls this day Eid al-Adha which mean “feast of sacrifice.” On this day Muslims take the time to celebrate faith sacrifice commitment community and patience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdXBlci1laWQtY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tYXQtdS1zLWJhbmstc3RhZGl1bS82MDAxODg5ODIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Super Eid celebration draws a crowd at U.S. Bank Stadium,"Thousands of Muslims crowded onto the field of U.S. Bank Stadium and still more came down the steps Saturday morning as a religious leader sang Allahu Akbar in honor of the Islamic holiday Eid.

""Brothers and sisters inshallah — we are going to pray the Eid salah"" a voice boomed across the field. ""The facility is full. We can no longer allow any more people to enter so we want to … not delay.""

Everybody rose. They listened to the prayer knelt and touched their heads to the ground. Then the stadium roared in silence.

""Wow"" Imam Abdirahman Kariye told the organizers afterward. ""That was amazing … that was the biggest gathering of Eid I have seen in my life.""

Forty-five thousand Muslims filled the stadium for their biggest holiday in grand fashion starting just after sunrise. Families dressed in their finest came to honor Eid al-Adha — the second and holier of two Eids it commemorates Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allah who gave Ibrahim a ram to kill instead. It also recognizes completion of the annual hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca.

Organizers dubbed Saturday's event ""Super Eid.""

One of them Abdulahi Farah recalled that in 2018 some Muslim leaders planning Eid said it was better to ""kind of lay low and hide"" for fear that a large gathering could be targeted.

""It was like no"" Farah said ""what does that do to our identity and claiming our voice in Minnesota who we are?""

Instead they decided to plan their biggest Eid yet that year at the stadium drawing 36000 people. This Eid's sequel was even bigger reuniting many who hadn't seen each other during the lull of the pandemic and replicating how their Muslim brethren in Somalia and other countries honored the day — by gathering in the biggest spot they could find.

Eid is also a time to give to the less fortunate and speakers urged the mainly Somali American crowd to donate money for millions of people who face famine because of the drought in Somalia.

Vendors sold toys and books: Gift-giving is traditional on Eid and Farah's 9-year-old daughter removed her new doll's hijab and diligently brushed her hair as the adults talked. Political campaigns dropped off fliers. Boys and girls showed off elegant new outfits as they darted around the crowd.

""Yesterday we were at the Roseville mall and it was like the day before Christmas — everyone was running around trying to get their Eid outfit together"" Salma Hussein said .

Her 4-year-old daughter Suhayr Al-Said looked like a princess in her sparkly new blue dress and bejeweled white hijab. Mother and daughter had decorated their arms and hands with henna as is the custom for Eid and Suhayr was at an age when she could start understanding the holiday.

""This is her first Eid where she's old enough"" Hussein said happily.

The event — open to the public and non-Muslims — was so large that leaders held the prayer four times quickly ushering out each group to accommodate the next.

There was suspense too: Who would win the raffle and drive away in the donated BMW crowned with a red bow on display?

""We'll be announcing the winner in about two minutes!"" said Kariye imam of Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington.

Leaders spun a computerized wheel three times and called out the winning number. Nobody stepped forward to collect. It turned out that the man who won had been in the first round of prayers and had already departed. Somebody left him a voicemail.

Nadir Hussein walked up to the men standing near the car playfully lamenting that he hadn't won. ""My third round I lost"" the Blaine resident said holding his baby niece. This was his first Super Eid and celebrating with this many people he said ""was so beautiful.""

Stadium-goers left to share feasts with their families and enjoy the rest of the day at the Mall of America Valleyfair or an afternoon carnival outside the stadium at Commons Park with bounce houses ice cream and obstacle courses.

""We did it!"" volunteer Khalid Omar cheered as the stadium crowd thinned.

He'd been setting up there since 5 in the morning.

""We hope we can continue doing Super Eid every year going forward"" Kariye said. ""I think everyone likes coming out; it's a different experience and it creates great memories.

After repeated clashes on Oct. 20 2015 authorities partially suspended Uber’s most popular service. Needing a friend in government to smooth things over Uber’s chief European lobbyist sought help from a young French minister on the rise: Emmanuel Macron. The exchange was one of more than a dozen undisclosed communications including at least four meetings between Uber representatives and Macron as the company faced investigations and fought to keep its toehold in France according to newly leaked internal records. They overturned cars burned tires and blocked access to the airport and train station in protest of Uber the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company which they said was breaking laws and threatening their livelihoods. Hours later authorities said they would revise the suspension order.

As it grew from scrappy Silicon Valley startup to a world-conquering multi-billion dollar operation Uber promoted itself as a leader of the digital revolution.

But the tech company pushed its agenda the old-fashioned way. Uber’s scandals and missteps in the United States from its spying on government officials to its leaks of executive misconduct have been the subject of books TV series and newspaper investigations.

Now a new leak of records reveal the inside story of how the ride-hailing giant’s executives muscled into new markets then managed the fallout spending gobs of cash on a global influence machine deployed to win favors from politicians regulators and other leaders who were often eager to lend a hand.

The records the Uber Files were obtained by The Guardian newspaper and shared with ICIJ and 42 other media partners. The cache includes emails text messages company presentations and other documents from 2013 to 2017 when Uber was barging into cities in defiance of local laws and regulations dodging taxes and seeking to grind into submission the taxi industry most prominently but also labor activists.

“Right now you are seen as aggressive” the prime minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte told Uber’s founder Travis Kalanick in 2016 according to meeting notes. “Change the way people look at the company” by stressing the positives Rutte advised. “This will make you seem cuddly.”

That aggressiveness — plunging into markets without government approvals — made Uber’s drivers the target of traditional cabbies’ rage. Taxi drivers saw their business threatened by competitors who didn’t have to play by the same rules. In Europe Asia and South America cabbies staged protests harassed Uber customers beat Uber drivers and set fire to their cars.

Some Uber executives sought to spin violence to their advantage. They discussed leaking details of a near-fatal stabbing and other brutal attacks to the media hoping to draw negative attention to the taxi industry the communications show.

Uber executives also sought to deflect inquiries about the company’s aggressive tax avoidance strategies by volunteering to help host countries collect income taxes owed by drivers documents show.

The records include details of private exchanges and get-togethers: a U.S. ambassador chatting with an Uber investor in a Finnish sauna; a Russian oligarch entertaining company executives with a Cossack band; a company lawyer circulating a “dawn raid manual” that tells employees what to do if law enforcement officers swoop down on Uber offices to seize potential evidence of illegal conduct.

And they shed light on internal discussions among executives grappling with the fallout of Uber’s chaotic global strategy.

Mark MacGann Uber’s chief lobbyist in Europe at the time described Uber’s approach to entering new markets as a “sh*itstorm” according to the documents.

“We’re just fucking illegal” Nairi Hourdajian then head of Uber’s global communications wrote to a colleague amid government efforts to shut down the ride-hailing service in Thailand and India.

The Uber Files also show that the company’s use of stealth technology to thwart government investigations was far more expansive than previously reported. Company executives activated a so-called kill switch to cut access to company servers and prevent authorities from seizing evidence during raids on Uber offices in at least six countries according to the leaked documents.

Kalanick personally ordered use of the switch as police were descending on its Amsterdam headquarters records show. “Please hit the kill switch ASAP” Kalanick ordered. “Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam].”

David Plouffe who managed President Barack Obama’s successful 2008 presidential campaign and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty now in charge of Uber Eats were told that the company had deployed the kill switch to block investigators text exchanges show.

To spread its message Uber and an advisory firm compiled lists of more than 1850 “stakeholders” — sitting and former public officials think tanks and citizens groups — it hoped to influence in 29 countries and the European Union the documents show.

Plouffe was one of many former Obama aides recruited by Uber to join a battalion of former public officials to spread its influence. They appealed to public officials to drop probes change policies on workers’ rights draft new taxi laws and relax background checks on drivers.

Records show that Uber executives met with France’s Macron then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then-Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and then-Estonia President Toomas Hendrik Ilves among other world leaders.

In 2016 then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden sought a meeting with Kalanick at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland.

Kalanick messages show grew impatient when Biden ran late. “I’ve had my people let him know that every minute late he is is one less minute he will have with me” the then-39-year-old entrepreneur texted a colleague.

Once Biden arrived at the five-star hotel suite they’d agreed to meet at Kalanick made his well-practiced pitch: The ride-hailing company he said was transforming cities and the way people work all for the better.

Biden was so impressed records show that he tweaked his keynote speech delivered later that day to tout the company’s global impact.

In all the new records reveal more than 100 meetings between Uber executives and public officials from 2014 to 2016 including 12 with representatives of the European Commission that haven’t been publicly disclosed.

Uber executives also courted oligarchs tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin through former U.S. and U.K. officials and struck special deals with them. Those oligarchs have since been sanctioned by Western governments in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In every market claims that Uber was transforming the workforce were central to the company’s pitch. But some drivers say that they were misled that Uber lured them to its platform with financial incentives that didn’t last while sharply increasing its commission from each ride. That meant drivers like 44-year-old Abdurzak Hadi of London had to work longer hours to maintain their wages.

Hadi began driving for Uber in 2014 and found it “a joy” at first. But “the joy only lasted a very short time” he told The Guardian.

Uber soon cut drivers’ incentives and increased its commission meaning less money for Hadi. The Somalia-born father of three brought in about $23000 last year after spending between 40 to 50 hours a week logged onto the Uber app — the majority of which was spent completing trips.

Jill Hazelbaker a spokeswoman for Uber acknowledged “mistakes” and “missteps” that culminated five years ago in “one of the most infamous reckonings in the history of corporate America.”

She said Uber completely changed how it operates in 2017 after facing high-profile lawsuits and government investigations that led to the ouster of Kalanick and other senior executives.

“When we say Uber is a different company today we mean it literally: 90 percent of current Uber employees joined after Dara [Khosrowshahi] became CEO” in 2017 Hazelbaker said in a written statement. “We have not and will not make excuses for past behavior that is clearly not in line with our present values.”

Hazelbaker said that Uber has not used a kill switch to thwart regulatory actions since 2017 and that Uber complies with all tax laws. She added: “No one at Uber has ever been happy about violence against a driver.”

The company dismissed any suggestion that it received special treatment from Macron or his cabinet and emphasized that no one who works at Uber today was involved in building relationships with Russian oligarchs.

Kalanick resigned under pressure in 2017 as investors voiced concerns about Uber’s workplace culture including allegations of sexual harassment racial discrimination and bullying. He remained a director until the end of 2019.

About a week after his meeting with Biden Kalanick texted with colleagues about the possibility of organizing pro-Uber counter-demonstrations after violence by cabbies in Paris. “We will look at effective civil disobedience and at the same time keep folks safe” MacGann wrote.

“I think it’s worth it” Kalanick responded. “Violence guarantee[s] success. And these guys must be resisted no?”

Devon Spurgeon a spokeswoman for Kalanick said the former CEO never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety or authorize “any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country.”

Uber like other businesses operating outside the U.S. used technology protocols to protect intellectual property and the privacy of riders and drivers and to ensure due process of law is respected in the event of a raid she said adding: “These fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information and all decisions about their use involved were vetted by and were approved by Uber’s legal and regulatory departments.”

Spurgeon said Kalanick did not create direct or oversee these systems set up by legal and compliance departments.

“In pressing its false agenda that Mr. Kalanick directed illegal or improper conduct the ICIJ claims to have documents that Mr. Kalanick was on or even authored some of which are almost a decade old” she added. “Tellingly the ICIJ flatly rejected requests to review any of those documents which further exacerbates concerns about many of the source documents’ authenticity.”

‘The Pyramid of Shit’

By 2014 Uber was dominating the ride-hailing market in the United States and aiming to conquer the rest of the world.

Armed with buckets of cash from investors like Jeff Bezos and Goldman Sachs the 5-year-old company entered 31 countries in 2014 alone.

It also provoked regulatory crises wherever it went.

Rather than going through the traditional licensing process or working to change laws and regulations governing taxi and similar services Uber plowed ahead undercutting rivals by offering steep discounts.

The leaked communications show that some Uber executives embraced the renegade approach as simply the way the company operated.

“Our initial approach was at times too brash” Uber’s Hazelbaker said.

When Uber sought to enter Poland for example the team held “extensive discussions” about how to deal with Polish law ill-equipped to regulate a smartphone-enabled ride-hailing service Bartek Kwiatkowski then an Uber consultant told ICIJ.

The leaked documents show that in 2014 Kwiatkowski asked for guidance about the Polish launch. MacGann an Uber lobbyist answered: “Bartek there are no case studies per se – basically Uber launches and then there is a regulatory and legal sh*itstorm.”

The guerrilla strategy produced a mounting set of challenges that executives described in a presentation as a “pyramid of shit.” “Driver lawsuits” “regulatory investigations” “administrative procedures” and “direct litigation” made up the pyramid.

To surmount obstacles Uber built a massive influence juggernaut for lobbying and related activities with a proposed global budget of $90 million in 2016 alone according to the leaked documents.

The company borrowed strategies it had honed in the United States.

When Uber needed political muscle to move into a city it hired former government officials to lobby former colleagues. When accused of breaking rules the company solicited customers to serve as grassroots lobbyists and sign “save Uber” petitions. And when its agenda seemed in need of a scholarly push it paid friendly academics to produce favorable research.

Uber adopted the mantra as two Uber figures put it: It’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.

Just as it did in the U.S. Uber lured drivers in European cities to its platform by offering bonuses and other incentives. It then cut back on subsidies stripping workers of income they had come to rely on.

The company turned to “strategic investors” people with deep pockets and political connections to influence laws abroad. Company executives encouraged them to invest in the ride-hailing app and ensured that they had enough “skin in the game” to help the company overcome regulatory obstacles in their respective countries. The French telecom tycoon Xavier Niel invested $10 million and the German publishing company Axel Springer put up $5 million as did French fashion magnate Bernard Arnault.

“We don’t need their money per se but could be useful allies to win France” lobbyist MacGann wrote in an email referring to Arnault.

Uber also built up an impressive roster of lobbyists.

As its first in-house lobbyist Uber hired Brian Worth a former aide to U.S. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California in 2014. Among the leaked documents is his five-page memo outlining a global expansion strategy titled: “Leveraging the U.S. government to support Uber’s international business.”

Some Uber lobbyists and advisers were offered equity stakes in the company and success fees for delivering favorable results according to the documents. Those hired guns offered government officials discounts on Uber rides “super high level” lunches advice about jobs free political campaign work campaign contributions and other gifts and perks.

Uber also sought to leverage former public officials including Neelie Kroes a former Dutch transportation minister who served as vice president of the European Commission the European Union’s executive arm.

About a year after leaving the commission in October 2014 Kroes asked to be allowed to join a paid Uber advisory board despite an 18-month so-called cooling off period in the commission’s code of conduct that forbids former commissioners from lobbying ex-colleagues. The commission turned her down and denied an appeal.

During the cooling-off period Kroes pressed a Dutch minister and other members of the government “to force regulator and police to back off” an investigation of Uber’s Amsterdam office according to the leaked documents.

And in May 2016 around the time the cooling-off period was expiring she told an Uber executive she was working to arrange a meeting between Uber and a European commissioner.

Although the ethics code speaks only to lobbying the commission itself it also requires commissioners to “behave in a manner that is in keeping with the dignity and the duties of their office both during and after their term.” It also requires them to “behave with integrity and discretion … even beyond the 18 months after ceasing to hold office.”

After the cooling-off period ended Kroes joined Uber’s advisory board. Records show Uber offered her $200000 to chair the board.

“Our relationship with NK is highly confidential” MacGann reminded his colleagues in a March 2015 email four months after Kroes resigned from the commission. “Her name should never figure on a document.”

Company executives discussed the risk of Kroes’s becoming “the poster child for the discussions around ‘revolving door/tech’s crony capitalism.’ ”

In a written statement to ICIJ Kroes said: “Consistent with my ethical duties as a former European Commissioner I did not have any formal nor informal role at Uber” before the end of the cooling-off period. She added that during the period she took an unpaid role with a Dutch startup support organization that required her to “interact with a wide array of business government and non-governmental entities.” She said she did so at the request of the Dutch government and with the approval of the European Commission.

Other revolving-door recruits included the flock of former Obama aides who would seek audiences with U.S. Cabinet secretaries trade officials ambassadors and foreign leaders.

Jim Messina Obama’s former deputy chief of staff became a political consultant in 2013 taking on Uber as a client. Records show that he sometimes found himself in dual roles: Messina for instance asked an Uber lobbyist if he should discuss the company’s regulatory problems in Spain with then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy while handling Rajoy’s political campaign the documents show.

Messina also helped connect Uber executives to U.S. diplomats including John B. Emerson a U.S. ambassador to Germany during the Obama administration and one of Emerson’s predecessors Robert Kimmitt then a senior counsel at the WilmerHale law firm. The law firm was looking for work helping Uber overcome legal obstacles in Germany.

The leaked documents throw light on MacGann’s and Messina's ties to Jane Hartley the U.S. ambassador to France from 2014 until 2017. Hartley got her prestigious diplomatic post after raising large amounts of campaign money for Obama. With the company facing regulatory hurdles in France MacGann requested a meeting with the ambassador. He texted Messina a day before the appointment. The exchange includes an apparent joking reference to works of art at the lavish ambassador’s residence in Paris.

Adrian Durbin a spokesman for Messina said Messina never lobbied for Uber or spoke to any head of state on behalf of Uber. “Mr. Messina’s work for Uber involved helping them understand the political landscape in certain European countries where the company was seeking to grow its business” Durbin said.

Durbin did not comment on follow-up questions about Uber Files documents in which Messina tells Uber executives about private conversations he was having with heads of state.

Former Obama aide Plouffe joined Uber as the head of global branding communications and policy in 2014. He was the architect of Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign which had pledged among other reforms to curb revolving-door lobbying. The documents show him playing a larger role lobbying and leading Uber’s international regulatory fights than previously known.

Plouffe held unpublicized meetings with several U.S. officials including then-U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Ambassador Hartley.

A State Department spokesman said Hartley now U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom did not recall any discussions with Plouffe or Messina about Uber. Perez did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Plouffe also met with officials in countries where Uber was waging regulatory battles including India. In India Uber employees were told to expect disruptions from competitors and regulators as the company launched ride-hailing operations. “Embrace the chaos” the company’s top executive in Asia said in a message.

In the United Arab Emirates the company turned to Plouffe to “soften Uber’s image” an Uber public policy specialist Joanne Kubba said in an email in the leaked documents.

Kubba told The Washington Post an ICIJ partner in a statement: “David’s meetings didn’t prevent or delay anything — they simply served to show we had responsible and mature leaders in the company who would be professional counterparts with government.”

Plouffe worked for Uber from 2014 until January 2017. Just before he quit he paid $7.6 million for a 6000-square-foot house in San Francisco.

The following month the Chicago Board of Ethics fined Plouffe $90000 for illegally lobbying then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel had served as Obama’s chief of staff.

In a statement Plouffe acknowledged “a very public global and sometimes fierce debate” over ride-hailing regulations during his time at the company.

“Sometimes those debates and negotiations were straightforward sometimes they were more challenging and sometimes there were people within the company who wanted to go too far” Plouffe said in a three-paragraph statement. “I did my best to object when I thought lines would be crossed—sometimes with success sometimes not.”

“Let me tell you” Plouffe said “you get in the room with a transportation minister I don’t care where it is state capitol city council European capital African country they don’t care what I or anyone else did before.” The negotiations he added “tended to get very specific about a whole set of issues around ride-sharing.”

Uber did not comment on specific lobbying efforts but said that as the company “matured” it strengthened oversight of lobbying and instituted new lobbying guidelines in Europe.

“Uber fulfills its obligations to disclose its activities when required to do so” Hazelbaker said. “In turn it is the responsibility of elected officials to disclose meetings when they are required to do so.”

The kill switch

On a Monday afternoon in November 2014 Uber’s Paris office in a leafy business park received unexpected visitors: French inspectors.

“Please kill access now” Uber attorney Zac de Kievit emailed his colleagues.

De Kievit was referring to the so-called kill switch which when activated disconnected computers from company servers. This would prevent authorities from seizing sensitive company documents.

Over the span of nearly a year as Uber expanded worldwide the company used the kill switch to block police from accessing its systems during office raids in France as well as Romania Netherlands Belgium India and Hungary.

The Uber Files reveal that Uber policy chief Plouffe participated in discussions about at least two of the raids as they took place. In March 2015 he asked for information as police raided the Paris office for at least the second time.

“Police still there. Big force (around 25)” then-lobbyist MacGann said in an email forwarded to Plouffe. “Police trying to get into laptops.”

“Ok” Plouffe responded. “Real time updates please.”

“Access to IT tools was cut immediately so the police won’t be able to get much if anything” MacGann told Plouffe.

During yet another Paris raid in July 2015 MacGann sent France’s Uber manager Thibaud Simphal advice via text message.

The kill switch wasn’t the only technological weapon Uber deployed to dodge police and regulators. The company also identified police or government officials who it thought were ordering Uber cars to gather evidence. It could then show them a fake version of the app with phantom cars that never arrived. It did so in the Netherlands Belgium Russia Bulgaria Denmark Spain and other countries.

Staff discussed creating “blackout geofences” around police stations in Denmark. Anyone inside the geofence wouldn’t be able to use the app successfully unless cleared by an Uber employee.

In Brussels local authorities hired companies to recruit fake customers or “mystery shoppers” to take part in stings against Uber. They would order cars so that the authorities could take action against drivers when they arrived. Uber discussed telling staffers to sign up as shoppers under fake names in hopes they’d be alerted when the police were recruiting for any upcoming stings.

In 2014 Gore-Coty then-Uber’s regional manager for Western Europe wrote to the staff that the tactics “to fight enforcement” had been compiled in a “very good playbook.”

Gore-Coty one of the earliest members of the Uber team did not answer ICIJ’s questions about a playbook of tactics to fight law enforcement.

In an emailed statement Gore-Coty expressed remorse for some of Uber’s tactics. “I joined Uber nearly ten years ago at the start of my career” he said. “I was young and inexperienced and too often took direction from superiors with questionable ethics.”

Neither Gore-Coty nor Plouffe responded to questions about the kill switch.

Simphal then manager of Uber France and now global head of sustainability said all of his interactions with public authorities were conducted in good faith.

In a written statement MacGann said: “On every occasion where I was personally involved in ‘kill switch’ activities I was acting on the express orders from my management in San Francisco.”

De Kievit did not respond to requests for comment.

Today Uber said it routinely cooperates with law enforcement and no longer uses technology to thwart it.

“Uber does not have a ‘kill switch’ designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world and has not since Dara [Khosrowshahi] became CEO in 2017” spokeswoman Hazelbaker said. “While every company has software in place to remotely protect its corporate devices (for instance if an employee loses their laptop) such software should never have been used to thwart legitimate regulatory actions.”

After Uber launched its first international efforts in Paris in 2011 the company ran into rigorous enforcement by French authorities and fierce opposition from established taxi services. Taxi drivers’ anti-Uber demonstrations turned violent and in 2014 the National Assembly passed a pro-taxi law that regulated Uber.

French authorities began investigating Uber for possible offenses including violating tax laws and operating a taxi service without a permit. France’s powerful consumer protection agency the General Directorate for Competition Policy Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control focused on whether UberPOP the company’s unlicensed low-cost service was illegal.

Uber had been gearing up for just this kind of fight.

Uber and an advisory firm compiled lists of “stakeholders” mostly across Europe the leaked communications show. In France the company identified more than 250 allies adversaries and others including about 180 politicians and public officials.

After Emmanuel Macron the fast-rising political centrist became the economy minister in August 2014 Uber found that it had a high-ranking ally. Macron then 36 was known as a business-oriented technocrat who once served a stint at the investment bank Rothschild & Co. As economy minister he oversaw the consumer protection agency.

ICIJ partner Le Monde documented more than a dozen communications in the Uber Files — emails texts meetings calls — between Macron or his aides and Uber between September 2014 and February 2016.

Shortly after becoming a minister Macron had a meeting with Kalanick the documents show. MacGann described it as “spectacular.” Macron told regulators not to be “too conservative” essentially committing to interpreting taxi law in ways more favorable to Uber MacGann said in an email.

Macron “hosted Uber in a remarkably warm friendly and constructive atmosphere” MacGann wrote. “Clear desire on his part to work around the … legislation.”

In another exchange in July 2015 Kalanick asked Macron whether Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve could be trusted. Macron replied that he had met with Cazeneuve and then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls the previous day and that Cazeneuve had accepted a “deal.” Macron said he would amend the law and later that evening the company suspended UberPOP in France.

Cazeneuve told Le Monde that he had never heard of a deal between the French government and Uber. Macron he said didn’t tell him anything about that.

Hazelbaker said the company shut down UberPOP in response to high levels of violence against drivers and passengers. She denied a deal was struck with Macron or French authorities to ease rules. “The suspension of UberPOP was in no way followed by more favorable regulations” she said.

In response to ICIJ’s questions Macron’s office said the French services sector was in upheaval at the time because of the rise of platforms like Uber which faced administrative hurdles and regulatory challenges. The office did not respond to questions about Macron’s relationship with Uber.

After building for months the crisis in Marseille peaked after taxi drivers blocked an Uber executive from speaking at a business fair featuring entrepreneurs. Citing “clashes and excesses disturbing public order” the local arm of the national police suspended UberX — the most popular Uber service — in central city districts and around the airport and train station.

A “dismayed” MacGann texted Macron the next day and the minister replied 11 hours later: “I will look into this personally. Let me have all the facts and we will decide by this evening. Let’s stay calm at this point.”

That evening the head of local national police began to reverse course promising to clarify the order. Twelve days later authorities issued a new order saying that the ban applied to unlicensed and unregulated Uber drivers in the whole jurisdiction. Authorities denied receiving any pressure from Macron’s ministry.

Uber chalked up the outcome as a win: “Ban reversed” the company’s internal weekly update said “after intense pressure from Uber.”

A high-stakes game

Ten Uber executives descended on the ski-resort town of Davos Switzerland to schmooze party and strike deals with world leaders and oligarchs at the 2016 World Economic Forum.

At the four-day invitation-only gathering Uber also impressed then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden with the company’s commitment to workers.

A theme of Davos 2016 was the digital revolution and the future of work. A 98-page Uber briefing book reveals that then-Uber CEO Kalanick and his subordinates had appointments with four prime ministers two European Commission vice presidents French Minister Macron and a smattering of other leaders. They also were scheduled to attend a late-night party hosted by British financier Nat Rothschild and Oleg Deripaska a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“So one vice president and two prime ministers today” Rachel Whetstone Uber’s top communications executive at the time emailed the boss on Jan. 20 the first day of the Davos forum. She said his schedule also included cocktails and dinner with philanthropist Melinda Gates a fireside chat with Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington and a side huddle with Russian billionaire Herman Gref head of now-sanctioned Sberbank during a reception hosted by the Russian bank. And lastly an “entirely optional nightcap” at the Grand Hotel Belvedere a colonnaded fortress towering over the Davos Promenade.

Behind the scenes Kalanick spoke with world leaders and senior government officials in countries where Uber was trying to expand.

He met with Xavier Bettel Luxembourg’s prime minister and Saudi Arabia’s then-minister of commerce and industry Tawfig al-Rabiah documents show. “It was a pleasure” al-Rabiah wrote later. “We hope to support you to have your official license soon.”

Netanyahu Israel’s prime minister publicly voiced support for Uber shortly after his meeting with Kalanick.

“We will break resistance. Let’s work in parallel” Netanyahu said according to notes from the meeting.

Netanyahu declined to comment through a spokesman.

Tawfig al-Rabiah did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for Bettel said Kalanick and the prime minister discussed Uber’s possible expansion into the tiny European country.

Uber took special care to keep Kalanick’s meeting with Biden confidential “even with internal teams.” The chat was arranged through a chain of former Obama staffers.

Accompanied by an ex-Secret Service agent Kalanick met Biden in Biden’s suite at the InterContinental Hotel a hotel called the “Golden Egg” for its oval shape. Their discussion centered on Uber’s claims that it was creating lots of jobs and providing jobs that gave people a flexible way to make money. It had the desired effect. Biden changed his prepared remarks at the forum to allude to Uber according to a message to an Uber staffer from a Biden aide.

“I met with the CEO today of one of those companies” Biden said in his keynote speech alluding to Kalanick and Uber while citing Kalanick’s projection of the impact of ride-hailing businesses on the world’s economies. “[He says] he is going to add two million new jobs this year allowing them freedom to work as many hours as they wish manage their own lives as they wish.”

In response to ICIJ’s questions last month a White House spokeswoman said Biden was “committed to combating employee misclassification which deprives workers of critical protections and benefits including minimum wage overtime and family and medical leave.”

The jobs forecast at Davos was rosy. Many of Uber’s drivers were part-time freelance contractors ineligible for key benefits like health care. In many countries where Uber had rolled out rapidly its drivers were being threatened and attacked by riders thieves and traditional cabbies.

In South Africa Uber let drivers begin accepting cash in May 2016 as part of an effort to boost ridership and gang members ordered rides on the app simply to rob the drivers. In August 2019 two thugs attacked an Uber driver who was smashed in the head with a brick and died prosecutors said.

I just can’t see myself driving for the platform anymore. I’m too scared — former Uber driver Faiza Haupt from South Africa

Drivers in Cape Town South Africa told The Washington Post an ICIJ media partner that several drivers were burned alive in their cars.

“I just can’t see myself driving for the platform anymore. I’m too scared” Faiza Haupt 61 said in an interview with ICIJ. Haupt began driving for Uber in Cape Town in 2014 hoping to become an independent businesswoman. At first the work was empowering. Then Uber started taking a higher commission while fares stayed the same.

She quit in 2016 after an angry rider attacked her from the rear seat pulling her hair and beating her. “I lost control and thought I was going to crash” Haupt said. “For a woman driving it is scary.”

From 2014 to 2015 Uber dramatically reduced drivers’ pay in Cape Town by cutting a $4-per-trip bonus to nearly zero according to leaked documents. Cape Town became one of Uber’s most profitable markets.

Frans Hiemstra manager of Uber Sub Saharan Africa said such incentives are common for any growing business. Uber spokesman Gus Glover added that as markets mature the company adjusts those incentives.

In the last five years Uber said it has focused on “reorienting Uber’s entire culture — from the top down — around safety” investing heavily in new technologies and other security features to keep passengers and drivers safe.

“There is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today” Hazelbaker said. “But one thing we do know and feel strongly about is that no one at Uber has ever been happy about violence against a driver.”

Yet leaked documents show that Kalanick and some other Uber executives saw violence and attacks on drivers as strategic opportunities to build support for their cause. They took no responsibility for the violence even though Uber’s advance into new markets often in violation of local laws was triggering it.

Just a week after Kalanick’s meeting with Biden — after anti-Uber protests by taxi drivers had turned violent — CEO Kalanick sent this text to colleagues declaring the possible upside of disorder:

It wasn’t the only time Uber executives tried to spin violence against its drivers to its advantage. In 2015 taxi drivers in Brussels organized a campaign of harassment against Uber. They threw eggs at Uber cars smashed side-view mirrors and took keys from Uber drivers. Some even threatened to “lynch” them.

The company’s general manager in Belgium remarked: “Already one driver stepped forward to talk to press: He had a full sack of flour thrown over him and passengers by taxi. He pressed charges and one taxi driver would have spent a night in jail –> Good story!”

‘From confrontation to collaboration’

After replacing Kalanick in 2017 Dara Khosrowshahi led Uber through a shaky stock market debut a pandemic-induced ridership slump and an overhaul of business practices. “Dara rewrote the company’s values revamped the leadership team made safety a top company priority implemented best-in-class corporate governance hired an independent board chair and installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company” spokeswoman Hazelbaker said. “We’ve moved from an era of confrontation to one of collaboration demonstrating a willingness to come to the table and find common ground with former opponents including labor unions and taxi companies.”

Hazelbaker acknowledged the company hasn’t always treated drivers with enough care and respect but has made improvements since 2017. Drivers’ earnings globally are near or at an all-time high she said and Uber now advocates “globally for more benefits and protections.” She defended Uber’s independent driver-contractor model as an engine of job creation and economic growth.

Kalanick’s spokeswoman Spurgeon said: “When Mr. Kalanick co-founded Uber in 2009 he and the rest of the Uber team pioneered an industry that has now become a verb. To do this required a change of the status quo as Uber became a serious competitor in an industry where competition had been historically outlawed. As a natural and foreseeable result entrenched industry interests all over the world fought to prevent the much-needed development of the transportation industry. As the ICIJ and the world know Uber persevered.”

Uber is still dealing with the fallout from its tumultuous international rollout.

Some Uber drivers especially in developing countries like South Africa still complain about grueling hours and poor pay. Many entered high-cost leasing deals for their Uber cars. During the pandemic some couldn’t make ends meet as they struggled to make car payments.

In India drivers pay Uber 20% to 30% of their fares in commissions double the amount when Uber launched in the world’s largest democracy according to gig economy advocacy group Fairwork India.

In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands courts have ruled that Uber drivers are covered by labor laws.

Elsewhere rulings have gone against drivers seeking employee status. In the U.S. the National Labor Relations Board declared that Uber drivers are independent contractors who do not have the right to form unions or bargain collectively.

After racking up more than $20 billion in losses over more than 10 years Uber finally began drawing closer to profitability in 2022.

In May Uber shareholders voted against a proposal that would have required the company to fully disclose its lobbying activities and spending.

In response to ICIJ questions Uber didn’t disclose how much it spent in the last year on international lobbying and who got the money.

A guide to cab-hailing firm’s ruthless expansion tactics,"The Uber files is a global investigation into a trove of 124000 confidential documents from the tech company that were leaked to the Guardian. The data reveals how Uber flouted the law duped police exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments across the world.

The leak consists of emails iMessages and WhatsApp exchanges between the Silicon Valley giant’s most senior executives as well as memos presentations notebooks briefing papers and invoices.

The files cover 40 countries and span from 2013 to 2017 the period in which Uber went from a plucky startup to a global behemoth brute-forcing its way into cities around the world with little regard for taxi regulations.

To facilitate a global investigation the Guardian shared the data with 180 journalists at more than 40 media organisations via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

What do they reveal?

Who leaked the data?

Mark MacGann Uber’s former chief lobbyist in Europe the Middle East and Africa said he decided to speak out because he believed Uber’s senior executives knowingly flouted laws in dozens of countries and “sold people a lie” about the economic benefits to drivers of the company’s gig economy model.

The 52-year-old acknowledged he was part of Uber’s top team at the time – and is not without blame for the conduct he describes. He said he was partly motivated by remorse.

“I regret being part of a group of people which massaged the facts to earn the trust of drivers of consumers and of political elites” he said. “I should have shown more common sense and pushed harder to stop the craziness. It is my duty to speak up and help governments and parliamentarians right some fundamental wrongs. Morally I had no choice in the matter.”

Why does the period covered by the leak matter?

The five-year span covered by the data covered a crucial period of Uber’s expansion.

When the app first launched publicly in San Francisco in 2010 Uber customers could only hire luxury black vehicles. The introduction the following year of UberX which enabled drivers to pick up passengers in their own cars quickly gained traction and by early 2013 the service was operating in more than 30 locations – mostly in the US.

It was around this point that Uber sought to rapidly expand overseas. The period covered by the leaked data was marked by frenzied growth as Uber used its record venture capital investments to subsidise journeys in cities across the world. By June 2017 when its controversial co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as chief executive Uber was operating in more than 600 locations.

Kalanick’s replacement Dara Khosrowshahi set out to prove to shareholders that the company could deliver profitable growth. Five years later Uber – now valued at $45bn – provides on-demand transport in more than 10000 cities.

How have Uber and Travis Kalanick responded to the investigation?

In a statement Uber’s senior vice-president of public affairs Jill Hazelbaker said: “We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”

She continued: “Uber is now one of the largest platforms for work in the world and an integral part of everyday life for over 100 million people. We’ve moved from an era of confrontation to one of collaboration demonstrating a willingness to come to the table and find common ground with former opponents including labour unions and taxi companies.

“We are now regulated in more than 10000 cities around the world working at all levels of government to improve the lives of those using our platform and the cities we serve.”

In a separate statement Travis Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never authorised any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country” and he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety. Any accusation that Mr Kalanick directed engaged in or was involved in any of these activities is completely false.”

“The reality was that Uber’s expansion initiatives were led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal policy and compliance groups.”

The spokesperson added: “When Mr Kalanick co-founded Uber in 2009 he and the rest of the Uber team pioneered an industry that has now become a verb. To do this required a change of the status quo as Uber became a serious competitor in an industry where competition had been historically outlawed.

Not all beaches are built the same. At least that’s definitely the case in Culebra a small island off the coast of San Juan only accessible by plane or boat. With pristine turquoise waters and white sand it’s the optimal venue for snorkeling and immersing yourself in sea life—the island is a nesting site for giant sea turtles and the endangered brown pelicans. Pro tip: Book your tickets for a day trip on a catamaran.

El Yunque National Forest

Up for an outdoor excursion? Look no further than El Yunque—the only tropical rainforest in the United States. A favorite of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s this must-see sight includes miles of hiking zip-lining and waterfalls in one of the most diverse ecosystems on the island. Be prepared as it does (unsurprisingly) rain here quite often. (It isn’t called the rainforest for nothing.) El Yunque is located only 35 minutes by car from the airport and many hotels offer day trips and guided tours. Find the rope swing it’s a must.

Castillo San Felipe del Morro

As a New Yorker who loves to walk everywhere I quickly fell in love with every colorful cobblestone street in Old San Juan lined with pastel-painted buildings and bustling shops perfect for capturing that outfit of the day pic. Make sure to stop by Castillo San Felipe del Morro a six-level fortress overlooking the Atlantic ocean at the very tip of town. The views here are unmatched—the 500-year-old Spanish castle sits high on a hill surrounded by acres of meticulously manicured grounds. How do they mow all that grass? Sip on a piña colada and contemplate.

Makeup fans are increasing praising a new hue: orange.

An orange blush to be exact.

Blush continues to be one of the most popular beauty products of 2022. TikTokers have been raving about cream formulas since the start of the year and now powder blushes are having a comeback too.

Benefit Cosmetics' new range of boxed cheek colors has found a following among social media influencers with countless TikTok  YouTube and Instagram posts about the blushes. While some people stick to tried-and-true pinks others like myself are all about the more daring bold colors. So when one shade — the orange hue dubbed ""Butterfly"" — become especially beloved I had to try it.

After putting the product to the test myself I understand why. It's the blush I'll be returning to all summer.

The Benefit Cosmetics Butterfly blush retails for $29

The brand's boxed blushes have been around for decades but I'd never personally tried them. When Benefit Cosmetics reformulated them — and minimized the packaging to be more eco-friendly — it was time to give them a go.

According to the beauty brand the vibrant blush is said to feel ""silky-soft"" and have a light ""shimmer finish"" that leaves your skin looking airbrushed. It also claims to be buildable — meaning you can use the blush to get a light wash of color or pack it on to get a more striking look — and resistant to sweat.

It's packaged in a box that's lightweight and easy to travel with which I appreciate. There's also more product in the box compared to other powder blushes — .21 ounces versus the usual .16 ounches — which will last longer than your typical container.

You can find the blush in Butterfly and other shades available to purchase on the brand's website Sephora and Ulta Beauty.

I've worn the blush for a month now and I can't get enough of it

Admittedly I'm a big fan of bold blush. I like to pack the product on like I'm going out in the the 1980s when overly-colorful cheeks were all the rage. So I was all about the idea of orange blush.

When I first swiped the powder onto my cheeks I was thrilled to see how vibrant it looked.

There was definitely a luminous sheen atop the color and the formula felt silky on the skin just like the brand suggested.

Still I was curious to see if the blush would be as buildable as Benefit Cosmetics promises given how bright a color it is to start.

I typically increase blush pigments with an extra swipe or two of product so I tried that here. My cheeks went from looking sun-kissed to almost sunburned — but I mean that in a good way. Adding more blush enhanced the orange tones of the powder making it stand out from the common coral blush shades.

If you're looking for something more subtle start with a small swipe of powder and blend it into your cheeks for a full minute. That will help diffuse the pigment and give a soft glow instead of my intensely colored cheeks.

The rave beauty reviews on social media were entirely warranted with this product. I'm so glad I tried it. A vibrant orange blush might not be everyone's cup of tea. But after trying this one I can definitely say it's mine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHN1Z2FyLmNvbS9iZWF1dHkvZ2FiZS1hZGFtcy13aGVhdGxleS1tYWtldXAtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LTQ4NTcwMTY0LzEwMDDSAVFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3BzdWdhci5jb20vYmVhdXR5L2dhYmUtYWRhbXMtd2hlYXRsZXktbWFrZXVwLWludGVydmlldy00ODU3MDE2NC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Makeup Artist Gabe Adams-Wheatley on His TikTok Success,"Too often the best beauty stories go Untold solely based on a person's skin color religion gender expression disability or socioeconomic status. Here we're passing the mic to some of the most ambitious and talented voices in the industry so they can share in their own words the remarkable story of how they came to be — and how they're using beauty to change the world for the better. Up next: Gabe Adams-Wheatley a 23-year-old TikToker and self-taught makeup artist.

I was born in Brazil and put up for adoption at 9 months old. I was adopted by a Utah family here in the US and when they were adopting me my mom was pregnant with her 11th child; she now has 13 of her own biological children and I am her only adopted child. We grew up in a Latter-day Saints home so being gay was a huge no-no. It wasn't until I was 19 years old that I told my parents for the last time that I wasn't going to change and if they wanted me to be in their lives they would need to learn to accept me and allow me to be myself unconditionally. It has blessed our relationship beyond measures and they are now two of my best friends.

Ever since when I was younger I was always looked at as a kid in the wheelchair — nobody was asking me to hang out because they didn't see that I was physically independent and capable of doing things without my wheelchair. In the seventh grade there was a talent show and I didn't tell anybody that I was auditioning. I came home and my mom was like ""Where were you? What did you do?"" and I was like ""I danced."" And she's like ""No really? OK well I'm going to need to see this dance."" I showed it to her and she told me flat out that the dance was not good and that we needed to work on it. My mom has always been the type of person who never gives it to me easy because she wants me to be able to take things in life as they are.

She ended up helping me choreograph a whole new one. There's a video on YouTube from the actual performance and you can see my mom running to the front of the audience to be right up front. At the end of the dance I got a standing ovation but the first person I looked at was my mom and she started crying and mouthed to me ""You did it."" It was a huge eye-opening moment for my classmates — I was no longer just the boy in the wheelchair. It helped push me out of my bubble and make some friends.

I feel like my entire life I've always had to prove myself and go beyond what people think the boundary could or should be for a person without arms and legs or just with a disability in general.

I still struggled with bullying and it got so bad that I ended up switching schools. I had to find my confidence again before I went back into the public school system and when I did I decided I wanted to join a dance company. That's when my excuse to get into makeup came. I had always been interested in beauty — I have four sisters and they're all gorgeous and my mom is also stunning. I always loved just sitting there watching them do their makeup and how each one of them did it so differently — whether that was starting with their eyeshadow first or starting with their foundation first.

My junior and senior year I ended up making both dance teams at two different schools and my senior year I went to state and got second place with a dance that I choreographed which was all about people with disabilities being looked at as if they can't do things. That's when my coach was like ""You need a foundation a blush a contour and a highlighter to make your features pop out on stage otherwise you'll look like a ghost."" And I was like ""Oh this is perfect."" I went to Ulta Beauty with my sister and I spent about a hundred dollars that day on just random makeup that I found fascinating. That very next weekend I applied blush and I put it all over my entire face because I didn't know what I was doing at the time.

I started watching a lot of makeup YouTubers on their techniques and taking into consideration what works best for me because I have to use the makeup brushes and the beauty sponges in a very different and unique way. When I first started doing my makeup the best way I could think of was to lie down and have a towel on the ground so I wasn't getting any products on the carpet. I had one of those circular flat sponges that you can buy at Ulta and I did my makeup lying down but I was always having to lift my head up and would get kinks in my neck because it wasn't the best position to be in.

At the time I had been doing motivational speaker work for about five years. I actually never truly enjoyed it I just thought it was something that I should be doing because there's a lot of people that could benefit from it but when COVID-19 hit I was like ""Oh this is the perfect point for me to actually do something that I want to do.""

That's when I dove into making makeup videos. I was in my brother's house at the time and I had this TV stand that hit just above my chest area and I would do my makeup there every single day. The first video I ever posted it was just from the neck up and there were a bunch of comments saying ""Why is he doing it this way?"" and ""What's going on?"" and I was like ""Oh I need to show that I actually don't have arms and legs in the beginning of the video to people understand."" When I started to do that the videos skyrocketed. Everybody was like ""Whoa!""

Then when I moved in with my now-husband for a birthday present he bought me an Ikea vanity desk and mirror and he chopped the legs down to my height. It was really sweet of him to give me because it gave me a boost of confidence in doing makeup and it also helped with my future career in being able to express myself on TikTok.

Everybody goes through different things and comes from different walks of life. That's what makes us unique and special in our own ways and it needs to be celebrated.

I always like to say I know that I don't need makeup nor does anybody else but it's a creative outlet and a way for me to express myself. I feel like my entire life I've always had to prove myself and go beyond what people think the boundary could or should be for a person without arms and legs or just with a disability in general. For me there's always been a fire that ignites in me when somebody tells me that I can't do this or that I'm doing something wrong. I always want to be able to push those norms and show that anything is possible if you just try.

It's still mind-boggling that this has been a possibility for me. It's always been a dream of mine to be somebody that people look up to and want advice from and so now that I'm actually there it's amazing. But it's been very interesting to navigate because I always thought that I was a strong person until I started doing more on social media and getting a lot of backlash just for the way that I look. But the thing that makes me so happy and makes me want to continue doing makeup and posting it on social media is when I get the comments and the messages from parents saying that their 4-year-old wakes up in the morning and says that they want to watch my videos while they eat their breakfast or people who are going through a really hard time will scroll through my feed just to brighten their day and get a different outlook on life.

And so I hope that continues in many ways not just for those people but also for people who are with disabilities or in the gay community or in any kind of community. I just hope that my content brightens their day and makes them want to better themselves and know that everybody goes through different things and comes from different walks of life. That's what makes us unique and special in our own ways and it needs to be celebrated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcmV2aWV3LXBob3Rvcy1uZXctb3JhbmdlLWJsdXNoLTIwMjItN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review and Photos of the Orange Blush Beloved by Influencers,"By clicking “Sign Up” you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Welch

Community Columnist

I understand I am the sum total of all of my experiences. When I back up in my life walk analyzing significant or seemingly insignificant benchmarks along the way it becomes very apparent these events continue to contribute to the personality patchwork mosaic known as me.

One such important developing stage of my life was my employment time with UPS in Indianapolis. Much of the taught work habits I learned and acquired knowledge from those days still exhibit themselves in my daily life choices.

The G.I. bill funds for my college at I.U.P.U.I suddenly stopped in 1978 as the U.S. Congress were deliberating on the budget for the year. I had to do something to stay in school. I noticed on a college bulletin board that UPS was coming to the college to interview for jobs. I decided to apply not really knowing what to expect. They immediately hired me.

I started by unloading semi-trucks of packages then after a few weeks was moved to loading four package delivery cars for the next four years. Congress finally passed the budget and the G.I. bill was in place but I still stayed at the night work at UPS while attending college during the days. When driving was offered to me it became necessary to cut my hair and work days.

Now I could almost say: “Much of what I learned about life I learned at United Parcel Service. What are the lessons I learned?

Take the path of least resistance. I am a creature of habit. This tendency is often a good thing but it can also be an annoyance to my family. I understand taking a more difficult way builds character but when I have the opportunity of choice I take the path with the least amount of obstacles. Leave yourself an out. We were to park our vehicle as if we were a bank robber when we stopped to make a delivery. Since I never had previous experience in this kind profession I understood this meant we doubled park so as not to become stuck in between other cars. This worked well until I was delivering some packages to a home office containing iron bars on all of the windows and doors. As I was getting the necessary signature one of the employees shut the iron door entrance locking us all securely inside. I asked them to open it. They all immediately laughed and indicated their boss had the only key and would not return until after lunch.“Isn’t there any other way out?” I asked frantically as I realized my nicely ordered day interrupted. They answered almost with a hint of glee enjoying my predicament “There is the restroom window which does not have bars on it but it is kind of small.” I was able to squeeze through the small window aided by some uncomfortable pushing on their part. Order your day. I am still working on this one. I have noticed when I have a plan for my day more gets accomplished. Things go smoother when you know what direction you are going what needs to be finished and how you are going to accomplish it. Finish the day's work today. The completion of the important daily tasks must take precedence. At UPS we always wanted to finish the delivery of our route for each day. Handle other people's property as if it were your own. This lesson is still important today when permitted the use of something belonging to someone else. Details are important. UPS even instructed us how to hold our vehicle keys when we made a delivery so we could fasten our seat belts and start the engine at the same time in a habitual motion. The details of a project fill in the necessary steps and move work toward completion. Image and appearance sells. No matter what anyone says we know impressions are an important part of life.

UPS still has an impact on my life 38 years after I left their employ. I really believe all of our life experiences whether good or bad contribute to who we are and the way we do things.

“I saw how the Lord my God carried me as a father carries his son in all the way I have gone until I have reached this place.” (Deuteronomy 1:31b) For you see God is a God of order too. He directed my life during my time at UPS and God still directs my life today.

How about you? What makes you ... you?

United Parcel Service has issued new rules for shipping firearms and firearm parts but the announcement comes a week after UPS cancelled the accounts of gun retailers who may have violated the rules that weren’t yet made public or even in effect.

In a story published July 1 we revealed that UPS was terminating the accounts of gun dealers and that any packages currently in the UPS system could be “seized and destroyed.”

In a letter sent to one Florida gun dealer Ghost Firearms UPS said they were terminating the account because they “may be violating” laws concerning homemade firearm parts.

“We write to inform you that UPS has learned that your company may be violating applicable laws concerning the shipment of “ghost guns” to unauthorized locations” the letter states. “In light of our concern UPS has determined that it will cancel your account effective immediately.

In a follow-up story published July 5 we revealed that five Democratic Senators recently sent ominous letters to UPS and 27 other carriers blaming them for escalating violent crime rates.

“We are concerned that lax shipping security measures are contributing to the epidemic of gun violence in this country by allowing criminals to use stolen firearms to commit crimes” the letters each state.

They were signed by Senators Edward Markey (D-Mass.) Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.) Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).

In their letters the Senators peppered the shippers with 20 questions and document requests. They were sent May 19 to UPS FedEx the U.S. Postal Service and trucking and rail carriers located in the United States and Canada.

UPS media relations personnel did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment for either story.

Now UPS has quietly updated their rules for shipping firearms on their website.

Now they require a serial number on any frame or receiver as required by a federal rule that hasn’t yet taken effect.

Any item that meets the definition of a firearm (including firearm mufflers or silencers) or a “frame” or “receiver” under federal law (including any partially complete disassembled or nonfunctional frame or receiver as defined by 27 CFR § 478.12) must be identified and bear a serial number in satisfaction of the requirements for identifying such items under federal law including 27 CFR § 478.92 and/or 27 CFR § 479.102 regardless of whether any such items are otherwise exempt from or not subject to identification requirements under applicable law. This prohibition applies even before the effective date of 27 CFR § 478.12.

UPS’s previous rules contained no serial number requirements.

Takeaways

Over the past two weeks UPS’s messaging has been a hot mess.

They threatened dealers’ livelihoods. They threatened to seize and destroy property – all with no advance notice – and when they were caught and their actions became public they failed to address their mistakes.

In other words they punished gun dealers for violating new secret UPS rules that weren’t made public – all because they got a scary letter from five anti-gun politicians in Washington.

As a private business UPS is free to enact whatever shipping rules they want but we are free to choose a carrier that’s not so schizophrenic.

A year to the date from their first race together they are collaborating yet again.

This partnership is special to both parties as their unique pairing has deep meaning to both. Up-and-coming workwear brand BRUNT is redefining everyday work boots and apparel for blue-collar workers and everyday guys that have never had the convenience pricing or quality available to them from traditional brands a concept that’s deeply relatable to Massey. A Douglasville GA native Mason Massey grew up with workwear at the center of the conversation and culture of his small-town upbringing. He knows how important affordable reliable workwear is to the American worker. BRUNT is excited to have the opportunity to outfit the driver with the company’s logo and Massey’s No. 91 racecar will be fully wrapped in BRUNT branding for the race producing the No. 91 BRUNT Workwear car.

HARRISBURG Pa. — Rental units are becoming harder to find in Central PA and a recent study is backing that fact up.

According to a study by RentCafe Harrisburg is the second most competitive rental market in the entire country.

Miami-Dade County Fla. is the only area with a more competitive market.

The average apartment is vacant for only 36 days in Central PA with around 19 people competing for open units.

Danielle Hale with Realtor.com says Harrisburg’s numbers are reflective of what most of country is experiencing.

“Nationwide we’re seeing that the rental market remains really competitive"" said Hale.

Nearly 97% of apartments in larger complexes are occupied in the Harrisburg area. And 75% of those occupants are expecting to renew their leases.

Hale says the low vacancy rates are contributing to increasing rental prices.

“Because there aren’t a lot of empty units landlords don’t have to be in a hurry to fill units"" said Hale. ""That means that they can set prices the way they want to set them.”

Dennise Hill with the Harrisburg Housing Authority says the lack of units and increased prices are taking its toll on residents residing in the city.

“It has become increasingly difficult for people to find affordable housing not just in the city but in the region as a whole"" said Hill.

Hill says she’s in constant communication with local landlords about providing more units for residents at an affordable rate. She says its important to be able to provide enough housing for people who want to live in Central Pennsylvania.",,,,,,,,,

It was not an easy decision by any means and I did think that I would remain in-house for the rest of my career. Cargill has an extremely high-quality tax group that was assembled over a number of years. As a testament to that quality two of my Cargill colleagues also recently moved back to private practice including Joel Peters-Fransen who left in 2019 and is a tax partner at Kirkland & Ellis in their San Francisco office. Craig Zaim left in 2018 shortly before I started at Cargill to join Frank Rimmerman as a tax partner in San Francisco.

We were doing exciting transactional tax work at Cargill. It became very clear to me that there was a significant need for our type of experience in the private practice world especially as Cargill decided to reduce its work in the asset management space and sell businesses like CarVal. When I started talking to Shartsis I was very motivated to take what I’d learned at Cargill and help a wider variety of clients. I also have to admit that working at an excellent firm like Shartsis with its culture and high-quality work was a huge motivator.

Tell us about a few of those learnings and how you will bring them to your clients.

First and foremost tax planning is a value-add to every deal but not a driver of it. I have seen tax lawyers come up with overly complex structures that clients cannot successfully implement in the real business world. As a legal adviser to your clients – whether internally or externally – the juice has to be worth the squeeze so to speak when dealing with complexity.

Also as a tax professional we are working as much with the business professionals in the company as we are with the lawyers. That means you need to provide tax advice in a concise manner that is actionable by an educated professional who is not a lawyer. For most matters someone should be able to spend no more than five minutes hearing (or reading) your explanation of the issues and law after which they should be able to quickly make a decision.

Remember too that the telephone is usually your friend. If you think there is going to be a bunch of back and forth on an issue because there may be follow-up questions get on a call. It can often be more efficient.

Having the benefit of both company and law firm experience what advice would you now give to young lawyers?

Not all law jobs are alike. You need to find the place that provides the right fit where your skills are appreciated and valued. An in-house role can range from being someone who manages multiple outside legal service providers to one where you are doing everything yourself without any outside help. Know the job and know how you function best.

Also understand that if you’re not at least 15 years into your career as a lawyer any job you take should help you develop a skill. Perhaps you’re already there technically but maybe you haven’t had experience with direct reports (especially direct reports who have many of their own direct reports). Maybe you haven’t been sufficiently involved in client pitches. Think about where you could improve as an lawyer (Note: we all can improve) and chose a job that both plays to your strengths and helps you build your skills in areas where they aren’t at the level you want.

Anything else you want to add?

Don’t be a jerk. Being a decent human being will eventually reap you huge rewards personally professionally and financially. Being kind to someone and willing to help them is remembered years later. Part of why I’m good at my job is because I can pick up the phone and call someone to talk about unique tax issues that may be outside of what I do every day. I return that favor regularly.

Rafi Mottahedeh: 'Part of the joy for me is explaining byzantine tax laws in a way that makes sense to our business teams'

Cargill's tax counsel on the 'why' of tax law being diverse in the legal profession and adapting to a Minnesota lifestyle

By Anne Gallagher

Rafi MottahedehImage courtesy of Cargill

You speak several languages – and have a university degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilisations. How did your path lead you to the law?

Well I wouldn’t say I speak several languages now. They’re pretty rusty at this point! I’ve always had a love for languages and cultures and have travelled to more than 50 countries. Similarly I’ve always wanted to work in an international environment. When I was young I thought that might lead me to a career as a flight attendant or in hotel management. However when I went to the University of Chicago we were required to read everything from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman to Karl Marx. I became interested in finance and the economic underpinning of our global economy. That led me to law school a focus on tax and then a second law degree (an LLM) in tax law from New York University.

Many people might think tax law is something sort of dull. What is it about tax law that interests you?

When I was in law school I found law really interesting but what it didn’t answer for me was the ‘why’. That is we litigate about money we have transactions that involve money but what are the economic underpinnings of these things? I was an avid reader of the Becker-Posner blog on law and economics but I wanted to be involved with thinking about money in actual transactions like you read about in the New York Times DealBook. Taxes affect the bottom line in a business not unlike the cost of raw materials. So you could say the beauty of tax is that unlike most other areas of law you are closer to the business as taxes are a cost not unlike corn or wheat or paper pulp.

An aspect of my job that I absolutely love is how integrated I am with our business teams. Frankly they usually see the huge value-add that a good tax team provides because it all boils down to quantifiable amounts of money. At a US multinational like Cargill with operations in more than 70 countries you get the added bonus of all the national tax systems overlapping with each other and the US tax system. So you are in some ways dealing with a giant jigsaw puzzle of costs and consequences. Some of my friends like to equate it to conducting a symphony.

This is work that really pushes me technically and part of the joy for me in my work is how to best explain byzantine tax laws in a concise way that makes sense to our business teams. Cargill pays a lot of taxes around the world which always keeps us on our toes!

You told me how important diversity is to you particularly as a gay man. Is there still a stigma of being a gay man in the legal profession?

I have to say no. Probably only once in my entire career have I ever felt treated differently; that wasn’t at Cargill. One of the reasons I was attracted to Cargill is because of its exceptional commitment to diversity. It is not just lip service. I see their commitment every day and seeing it done right as we do it at Cargill is a sea change in creating an inclusive global environment. I feel comfortable bringing my whole self to work every day and we are very fortunate at Cargill that everyone can feel that way.

For most of your career you lived in Chicago a large urban area. What was it like to move to the Minneapolis area?

To be honest I was initially apprehensive about working at an agriculture company in suburban Minneapolis. My apprehension was totally unfounded. Not only is Minneapolis a very international city with companies like Target Medtronic 3M General Mills and UnitedHealth Group headquartered here but all these businesses bring people together from all over the world. As someone who likes to travel the world I’m actually living my childhood dream—but it’s not at all the way I imagined it would happen. I know dozens of people from Brazil in what are called the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) who came here as ex-pats for work and stayed! It’s also a place where I had my first Somali meal and we have an awesome community of Somali-Americans in Minneapolis.

You seem to have taken to the Minnesota lifestyle. Is that right?

Yes that’s right. Hunting is very big in Minnesota and I recently went on my first hunting trip. There are many wild turkeys here and we cooked one as part of a dish called Turkey Yucatan. It was a recipe in a cookbook Pheasant Quail Cottontail by Hank Shaw. I mentioned the Somali influence here which led me to buy another cookbook—In Bibi’s Kitchen: The Recipes and Stories of Grandmothers from Eight African Countries that Touch the Indian Ocean by Hawa Hassan. Maybe to offset all this cooking I’m doing five triathlons this summer and an Ironman in 2022. I’m also going to start working on one of my bucket list items and become certified as a group fitness instructor.

The winner will take on incumbent Republican Gov. Bill Lee who faces no primary opposition.

Early voting for the Aug. 4 primary runs July 15 to July 30.

Carnita Atwater doesn’t think of herself as a politician.

The Memphis resident says she’s been fighting for her community for years tackling “racial disparities healthcare disparities economic equality.” But her activism has taken a new tack as she competes for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Tennessee's Aug. 4 primary.

Atwater faces Memphis council member JB Smiley Jr. and Dr. Jason Martin in the race which opens for early voting on Friday. The winner will face Republican incumbent Gov. Bill Lee in the November general election. Lee faces no GOP primary opposition.

“I never viewed myself as a politician"" Atwater said. ""Even today I do not view myself as a politician. I look at myself as a community advocate for the people. That’s why my platform is 'Putting people back into politics.’”

Among Atwater’s top priorities if elected would be to work against “discriminatory laws” that have been passed out of the General Assembly in recent years including legislation targeting LGBTQ youth and new sentencing guidelines criminal justice advocates warn could exacerbate an already overburdened prison system.

Atwater also calls for a “livable wage plan” to implement a $15 minimum wage a universal health care system and a review of term limits and qualified immunity for judges and police officers.

Tennessee governor race: Jason Martin believes he has a chance to beat Gov. Bill Lee if picked by Democrats on Aug. 4

Tennessee Democratic primary: JB Smiley Jr. has always aimed higher. Now he's going for the Democratic gubernatorial bid

Born in Mississippi Atwater moved to Memphis in her adolescence. Atwater said she’s always had a heart for the community organizing neighborhood meals as soon as she could work and bring home a paycheck.

Atwater worked in health care where she said she moved her way up from paramedic to EMT to nurse. She later transitioned to higher education where she held administration positions at Draughons Junior College now Daymar College in Clarksville Tennessee.

But for years Atwater’s focus has been on advocacy in Memphis particularly in historically Black communities she believes have been underserved by the existing political establishment.

She frequently opened her doors to young people who needed a safe home. Her experiences as a foster mother would motivate her to address pitfalls in Tennessee's foster care system she said such as establishing better halfway services to bridge gaps in care for children aging out of the system.

Atwater has also run the New Chicago Community Development Corporation a hybrid museum and community center.

In 2020 Atwater filed a civil suit against local and state leadership alleging patterns of gentrification and tax incentives for large corporations stymied efforts of community revitalization in the New Chicago neighborhood.

The lawsuit was dismissed in 2021 but it spurred Atwater to consider seeking higher office.

“After that lawsuit I made my mind up that I would put myself in a position to take back the power and give it to the people” Atwater said.

Democrats face steep road to victory in governor's race

The 2022 path to the governor’s mansion will be an uphill climb for any Democratic candidate in Tennessee. No sitting governor has lost his reelection campaign since the 1970s. Lee has also enjoyed an increasing Republican majority in Tennessee nabbing 59% of the vote in 2018 a total closely mirrored two years later when around 60% of Tennessee’s electorate voted for Republican President Donald Trump.

Atwater may also be outmatched by her Democratic colleagues in the primary. Since entering the race Smiley and Martin have published slickly produced campaign websites and robust social media campaigns while pulling in thousands from contributors.

In contrast Atwater has received less than $2000 in donations according to campaign finance records. She publishes much of her campaign information from a Facebook account which often features stream-of-consciousness posts and frequent videos where Atwater outlines her professional history or plans for office.

Despite the differences in her campaign the candidate said she isn’t interested in measuring campaign war chests against each other.

“Good people are staying out of elections because they do not have the funding” Atwater said.

""I think [personal] connection more than money should be how you serve the people. I don't think any other opponents have an advantage because they have more. It seems like money is driving all our governmental decisions: Gentrification developers tax incentives. I am not letting money drive me.”

Legal controversy

Atwater also frequently cites addressing “political and judicial corruption” as a high priority and has tied a personal legal matter to the issue.

In 2018 a Shelby County probate court ordered Atwater to pay back more than $2 million in funds she allegedly spent from the estate of a woman she worked for as a caregiver. Atwater has long denied the allegations stating the money was hers. She told The Tennessean this week the issue was being appealed.

A U.S. Bankruptcy Court last fall issued an additional monetary sanction against Atwater for “willful and repeated noncompliance with court orders."" The Tennessee Supreme Court in April denied Atwater's application for appeal.

“I am a victim of miscarriage of justice and I will not go nowhere until justice is served” Atwater said in response to a Tennessean inquiry about the case.

Though the Democratic primary has remained relatively clean with each candidate sticking to their own lane rather than issuing negative ads Atwater this week appeared to poke at Martin’s Democratic bona fides after questions regarding the probate judgment arose.

Martin survived an attempt to boot him from the primary ballot earlier this year over concerns that he voted in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Martin has said his vote for Ohio Gov. John Kasich was a strategic move to keep Donald Trump “out of the White House.”

“I’m a bona fide Democratic candidate” Atwater said in a Facebook video denying the legal claims against her.

Still at the end of the day Atwater said change is needed in the Tennessee governor’s mansion and she will “hope and pray” for success for any of the three candidates vying for the Democratic nomination.

“We can no longer have four years of Gov. Bill Lee” Atwater said. “He’s disconnected. We need a politician a governor that is connected to the people. We have to have that in order for us to move forward.”

Betty McCollum isn't progressive enough,"During her 22 years in Congress Betty McCollum has compiled the record of a political progressive.

The St. Paul Democrat has championed women’s rights combated climate change and supported universal health care and environmental protection along with other actions that promote the interests of modest-income people who rely on government programs.

She received a 91 percent “progressive” rating from Progressive Punch a nonpartisan group that evaluates congressional voting records.

But McCollum isn’t progressive enough for Amane Badhasso. The 32-year-old community organizer and Ethiopian immigrant is running against the congresswoman in the Aug. 9 DFL primary election for the 4th Congressional District seat. She had raised more than $600000 for her campaign as of April 1 and hoped to top $800000 by the end of June.

McCollum had raised $1.3 million through March 31.

Badhasso’s prolific fundraising has made her McCollum’s best-funded challenger yet. A large chunk of her campaign cash has been contributed often in donations of $1000 or more by Oromo immigrants across the nation.

“I am running for Congress because I believe we deserve a representative who will fight for working people not special interests” Badhasso said in a recent interview. “I’m ready to bring progressive values and shake up the status quo in Washington.”

McCollum is an influential member of the House Democratic majority. A close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi she chairs the largest and most powerful appropriations subcommittee in Congress the defense panel that recently assembled a $762 billion funding package for the Pentagon.

“I didn’t get everything I wanted but at least I’m a voice at the table” McCollum said noting she successfully resisted the defense establishment’s calls for more spending while she fought to preserve President Joe Biden’s budget guidelines.

Badhasso doesn’t deny that McCollum is effective at what she does but the challenger said the incumbent spends too much time and energy on Washington insider dealings and too little improving the lives of her working-class constituents.

FOCUSED ON THE NEEDY

Born in a rural village in Ethiopia Badhasso and family members fled civil war for a refugee camp in Kenya when she was 4. At 13 she followed a brother to the United States and landed in Blaine living with an uncle and her grandmother who became her guardian.

Members of the Oromo ethnic group Ethiopia’s largest she and her family spent much of their time at the group’s community center in St. Paul. “When we first went there I had to stay in the car because I was freaking out” she recalled. “I expected the military to come people to be shot.

“But it’s not like that here. That opened my eyes to: I can think here I can march I can protest and I’m not going to be gunned down.”

While earning a bachelor’s degree in political science at Hamline University Badhasso also volunteered for local state and national Democratic candidates including the 2020 DFL-coordinated campaign for Biden Vice President Kamala Harris and the rest of the party’s state ticket.

Those political skills plus her personal experiences of living paycheck to paycheck and occasionally going hungry prepared her she said to represent the neediest residents of the 4th District which includes most of Ramsey and part of Washington counties.

PROGRESSIVE RECORD

By contrast McCollum 67 is one of the longest-serving political fixtures in the St. Paul area. She’s an 11-term incumbent who typically wins her elections by 2-1 margins in a district that hasn’t elected a Republican in 74 years.

She grew up in South St. Paul raised her two children in North St. Paul and now lives in St. Paul. A St. Catherine University graduate she was a high school teacher and retail sales manager before she ran for office. First elected to the North St. Paul City Council in 1987 she served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1993 to 2000 when she first was elected to Congress.

Just the second Minnesota woman elected to serve in Congress she now is the dean of the state’s congressional delegation. In addition to her work on behalf of progressive causes she has been a leading advocate for education supported a strong national defense and backed international engagement in development and human rights.

Badhasso and McCollum aren’t ideological opposites. They both wear the progressive badge proudly.

(Most progressives were liberal Democrats until the 1980s and 1990s when the tag “liberal” became widely viewed as a dirty word.)

NATION MOVING FROM CENTER

Hamline University political scientist David Schultz who personally knows both candidates said perhaps the two are separated by a generational divide rather than their views on the issues.

“McCollum is more of a classic DFL liberal connected to unions and economic social justice issues” he said. “Badhasso supports many of the same issues but in part is frustrated that the pace of change is slow on issues such as civil rights the environment health care and (other) issues.”

With perhaps fewer than 30 of the 435 congressional seats being competitive Schultz said conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are pushing their parties further right and left.

“We are also seeing a generational shift occurring in American politics” he continued. “The year 2020 was the first where Baby Boomers were no longer the largest generational voting bloc and it has shifted to the Millennials and Gen Z. The latter two are more progressive on a range of issues. … This is driving a divide in the Democratic Party. Over time we will see more successful challengers.”

CONTESTED CLAIMS

McCollum said what distinguishes this year’s race from her previous campaigns is “I’ve never had so many outlandish personal attacks made against me. … Most of them are baseless and senseless.”

For instance Badhasso in May posted a video on social media accusing McCollum of remaining “silent on racial justice” after George Floyd’s murder. The congresswoman’s staff responded with a list of 28 press releases social media pronouncements and a House floor statement that McCollum made decrying Floyd’s death.

“I have never been silent on racial justice or the murder of George Floyd!” she insisted.

After two other members of Congress announced a plan this spring to stop defense contractor price gouging Badhasso posted a tweet asking why McCollum hadn’t agreed to sponsor the legislation. In fact she did co-sponsor that bill.

When McCollum secured $2 million in federal funds this spring to upgrade the St. Paul Police Department’s radio system Badhasso said that money could have been better spent on schools climate-friendly infrastructure racial justice and tackling police brutality. McCollum’s staff responded that her opponent’s message was aligned with her efforts as a community organizer to defund the Minneapolis police.

The congresswoman said her challenger also has misrepresented her positions on two other key issues in the campaign.

Badhasso charged that McCollum would not sign a “Medicare for All” resolution that progressives are pushing in Congress. McCollum said she initially declined to sign on because the original proposal called for unacceptable changes in health programs for veterans and American Indians. Once the sponsors revised those two provisions McCollum said she enthusiastically endorsed the universal health care legislation and made it the top issue on a campaign leaflet.

The two candidates also disagree about how to promote a “Green New Deal.” McCollum said she supports “confronting the climate crisis by investing billions in clean energy … to create new high-tech green jobs.” Badhasso said she not only would support such changes but also would lead the fight to pass it which she contends McCollum has failed to do.

Badhasso’s campaign suffered a setback in May when the 4th District DFL convention endorsed McCollum for re-election by a 2-1 margin. The endorsement means the incumbent will benefit from the party’s phone banks digital messaging sample ballots and coordinated campaigning with the party’s other candidates said state DFL Chairman Ken Martin.

Badhasso said she hopes to offset the loss of the DFL’s operations with a grassroots campaign staffed by more than 200 volunteers.

In 2021 the number of people requesting assistance from Doctors of the World almost doubled compared to previous years. The organisation's most recent report conveys that last year volunteers helped provide 3067 consultations to 1391 people in Luxembourg.

The report further highlights difficulties that workers had to face in relation to the the pandemic. The logistical aspects of the vaccination campaign for instance have shown that there are many people in the Grand Duchy who live in precarious social situations that make access to medical care more difficult.

The 1391 patients treated by MdM doctors all share a similar social profile: they are below the poverty threshold live in temporary housing and don't have health insurance. Furthermore the lack of access to regular medical care has lead to long-lasting and at times irreversible health issues.

The MdM report also reveals that the amount of specialised care has returned to pre-pandemic levels with a total of 864 consultations given. Thanks to the organisation's efforts 750 people were given access to a Covid-19 vaccine at one of the centres in the country while about 600 were directly inoculated by an MdM doctor.

AN Ennis sports club which recently launched a fundraising campaign for the development of a multi-sport facility has received a boost which will support their goal for expansion.

Established in 2019 Ennis Hockey Club is the first and only hockey club in County Clare and players currently have to travel for matches as they have no home pitch. It is the club’s ambition to build a multi-sport 2G facility in Ennis where they can play compete and develop the next generation of people passionate about this Olympic sport.

The club has now been named county winners in the recent Texaco Support for Sport initiative and has been presented with a cheque for €5000 which will be used by the club to expand its membership and to cater for adults with mental and physical disabilities.

After only three years in existence it has already shown enterprise and creativity with programmes for children age 5 to 18 and for adults familiar with hockey or new members anxious to take up the sport. To cater for older members and those with disabilities the club has introduced a ‘Walking Hockey’ project and a ‘Hockey4All’ initiative.

Under the scheme similar to that which proved successful last year when the Clare county award was presented to Shannon Jets Basketball Club the presentation was made to the Club by Valero Energy (Ireland) Limited the company that markets fuel in Ireland under the Texaco brand.

Meanwhile Clare County Council have said they are available to engage with the hockey club to work towards the provision of a playing facility after their need for a suitable site was highlighted at a recent meeting of the Ennis Municipal District. Councillor Mark Nestor urged the council to show its support for the club pointing out the growing popularity of the sport and the service the club is providing for the county’s adults and children.

He called on Clare County Council to engage with Ennis Hockey Club with the intention of providing a 2G playing surface at a suitable site within the Ennis Municipal District. He said that the club does not have “sufficient” facilities saying “The fact is they have no home pitch and have to travel to Limerick Tipperary and Waterford. They are depending on clubs in other counties to have pitches available” he said.

Tim Forde Head of Sports & Recreation responded to the motion “Clare County Council is available to engage with and support Ennis Hockey Club in the provision of a playing facility for the club. It should be noted that the Council depend on grant funding being available from the Department of Transportation Tourism and Sport under the Sport Capital Grants for the continued development of the playing facilities. These grants are open to Ennis Hockey club should they wish to submit an application once the call is made later in 2022. Clare Sports Partnership are undertaking a study on the availability of sports facilities in the County with the objective of this report being to identify deficits in order to target grant funding to meet the needs.”

Councillor Ann Norton praised the work that the club is doing with people with disabilities saying “It’s hugely important that we showcase that all sports should be open to all abilities.” She also suggested that a meeting be held with Tim Forde to see what can be achieved.

Councillor Mary Howard commented that the club has been “very successful considering they don’t have a playing surface and a home ground.” She supported the idea of finding a site for the club saying “once a site is identified the finance will follow we need to identify a site and then chase the money”.

Councillor Paul Murphy voiced his support. He suggested that the planned 4g pitch in Clarecastle could provide a solution to the hockey club’s needs. However Councillor Howard pointed out that the surface of a 2g and 4g pitch are different and the Clarecastle facility would not be suitable for hockey. Councillor Pat Daly commented that the Ennis Hockey Club are a “great asset to the town”.

Councillor Clare Colleran Molloy commented that the Ennis Municipal District and Clare County Council are “very forward looking” stressing the importance of “making the town attractive for up and coming sports”.

Councillor Norton added “every sports club would like to be able to invite their opposition to their home grounds and it’s a shame they have to leave the county.” She said that the county is fortunate to have Tim Forde Active Ennis and Clare Sports Partnership and their staff with “expertise in such a variety of areas of sport working very well together” and expressed the hope that working together will find a resolution.",,,,,,,,,

Then again that might not be the worst play here considering that the goal of this ""giveaway"" is to keep folks set in their ways connected to a working network beyond the end of 2022 . The vast majority of these customers will presumably be happy to receive something ""basic"" with a familiar design and a short learning curve as far as overall functionality goes.





Depending on your luck you'll get an Orbic Journey V TCL Flip Pro  or Nokia 2720 V Flip at no charge whatsoever in the near future if you're still using a 3G device although with similar retail prices of between $79.99 and $99.99 we really couldn't tell you which one of these bad boys is objectively better than the others.





What's crystal clear is that all three are vastly inferior to the 4G LTE and 5G-enabled phones AT&T and T-Mobile offered in recent months to set the stage for their own 3G network shutdowns





Naturally you're always free to make the switch to a more advanced handset (at a cost) on Verizon if you want to and you can even ""decline the free phone for CDMA Sunset"" by calling (800) 922-0204. We don't see why you'd want to go through the trouble of refusing something gratis of course that won't change your plan or contract in any way merely bringing you one step closer to cellular modernity.

His creative talents and enthusiastic organization combined with a strong sense of community produces exceptional results for charities. On the eve of Independence Day he presented the 2022 Big Bang on the Bay which benefited Children Today. That charity helps families and their young children in need to achieve stability and success.

“We are grateful that John and the Boathouse selected our organization to support” Children Today Executive Director Pamela Austin said.

The Big Bang event has grown each year since its inception in 2011.

In addition to the boathouse and patio with sidewalk and pier side seating there was a block party. Naples Rib Company catered the block party and VIP premier tent — and the crowd estimated to be around 1000 had a great time. Many of the neighboring homes also enjoyed the view with parties. Homeowners also chip in to offset the costs.

Bruce DD McCrae led a prayer and thank you. Dennis Lord once again arranged air demonstrations that concluded with The Tiger Squadron’s “Freedom Break” formation. A cheer went up as the 100-foot firework barge entered the Bay. The evening concluded with a spectacular fireworks display.

Long Beach Symphony at the Boathouse

Nearly 800 people wiggled and jiggled as they enthusiastically danced with the Long Beach Symphony.

Morris owner of Boathouse on the Bay hosted “A Totally ‘80s Dance Party” at Alamitos Bay on June 12 to support the symphony. All the proceeds benefit the music education programming provided by the symphony to LBUSD classrooms.

Concert-goers arrived in throngs to a beautiful day on Alamitos Bay for festivities that launched with the funky ‘70s sounds of King Salmon and the Funk Yard Horns which had the audience up and dancing in preparation for the main event.

After a brief intermission the Long Beach Symphony took the stage with the six-piece ‘80s cover rock band REWIND. Vocalists Christine Shebeck and Brandon Nix perfectly captured the iconic sounds of the ‘80s while Maestro Eckart Preu led the orchestra.

Proceeds from the event will support the award-winning music education and outreach programming of the Long Beach Symphony which annually reaches more than 29000 students and educators within the Long Beach Unified School District. Programs include ensemble visits of symphony musicians into second- and third-grade classrooms and free concerts at the Terrace Theater for fourth- and fifth-graders.

All the different 5G ranges explained,"If you’ve been thinking 5G seems more complicated than the cellular technologies that came before you’re not entirely wrong. 5G promises faster performance better coverage and ubiquitous connectivity to power the next generation of autonomous cars and smart devices. To accomplish this it needs to push the boundaries of what was possible with older cellular technologies.

This also requires 5G to operate across a much wider range of frequencies. After all we’re talking about a technology that has the potential to replace wired broadband connections and even many traditional Wi-Fi networks. In the future a 5G network won’t be something you merely fall back on when a better connection isn’t available — it may very well be the best connection you can get.

So what frequency does a 5G network operate on? There’s no single straightforward answer to that but it’s also not as complicated as it appears at first glance. 5G networks use many different frequencies but these can all be grouped into three specific ranges each with its own pros and cons.

The speed and range trade-off

Before we discuss the frequency ranges used by 5G it’s essential to understand why so many different frequencies are needed. The answer to that question is something you may have already experienced in your own home.

Modern Wi-Fi routers operate on two frequencies: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. If you’ve ever tried to get the best Wi-Fi coverage in your home you’ve probably encountered a fundamental reality of how radio waves work. You’ll get slower speeds when connected to your 2.4GHz network but you can also stay connected even when you stray farther away from the router. On the other hand the 5GHz channel gives you much better performance but you may not make it to the other end of your house.

While these naturally have a much shorter range than cellular radio towers the same principles apply. Higher frequencies can carry more data but don’t travel as far and don’t penetrate solid objects nearly as well. Lower frequencies go much farther and are less prone to interference but they’re also much slower.

Mobile network operators need to consider these same tradeoffs when building their 5G networks. The highest-frequency 5G signals can provide insanely fast wireless speeds but can’t cover much more than a city block. At the other end of the spectrum low-frequency signals can go for miles but don’t offer performance that’s noticeably better than older 4G/LTE technologies.

Sub-6 versus mmWave

When 5G was rolling out the industry divided the frequencies into two generally broad ranges: Sub-6GHz (Sub-6) and millimeter wave (mmWave).

As the name implies the Sub-6 frequencies were intended to include all those below 6GHz while the 5G mmWave spectrum started at around 24GHz and went up from there.

In practical terms early Sub-6 5G rollouts stayed mainly below the 2GHz range. Since these frequencies were already used by 4G/LTE and even older 3G networks carriers already had the necessary licenses to use them. This made it easy to quickly roll out 5G on top of their existing networks and that’s precisely what T-Mobile and AT&T did.

Specifically AT&T and T-Mobile set up their 5G networks on the same 850MHz and 1.9GHz (1900MHz) frequencies used by the earliest “2G” GSM networks and the 700MHz and 1.7GHz (1700MHz) frequencies that came into use with the 3G and LTE rollouts. AT&T also ran some 5G services in the 2.3GHz range while T-Mobile went down to 600MHz to get even better coverage for its “nationwide” 5G network.

Meanwhile Verizon decided to go in the opposite direction with its initial 5G rollout using the much faster 28GHz mmWave frequency. This allowed Verizon to boast the fastest speeds; a 2020 OpenSignal report had Verizon well in the lead globally with average download speeds of 506Mbps since it had no Sub-6 5G networks to pull down its score. However the extremely limited range of mmWave frequencies meant fewer than 1% of Verizon customers even saw the company’s 5G network appear on their smartphones.

The challenges of low-band 5G

Low-band 5G let AT&T and T-Mobile get their networks up and running very quickly as they didn’t have to wait for new licenses plus they could also piggyback on existing 4G infrastructure. However it’s that latter point that made early 5G performance so underwhelming for many folks.

To make 5G and 4G peacefully coexist on the same frequencies carriers had to turn to a technology known as Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). This new 5G capability allowed it to yield the airwaves to older 4G traffic.

The problem with this is that 4G networks know nothing of DSS; 4G hadn’t been taught how to share so it was always up to 5G traffic to politely step aside whenever 4G traffic showed up. In other words older and slower 4G signals always got priority over newer and faster 5G.

This means that in addition to being hampered by the limited capacity of lower frequencies low-band 5G networks also had to contend with making way for all the 4G traffic on those airwaves. It’s little wonder that early 5G networks couldn’t deliver speeds that were noticeably faster than 4G.

Even when Verizon finally turned on its low-band Nationwide 5G network in late 2020 to bring 5G to the other 99% of its customers its 5G performance was so poor that some experts recommended folks switch off 5G on their smartphones to save battery life.

New mid-band spectrum changes the game

Following those initial rollouts two things happened that showed industry experts may have erred in lumping all sub-6GHz frequencies into a single “Sub-6” category.

Both of these involved the use of a higher frequency mid-band spectrum although the carriers approached it from two different angles.

Thanks to its 2020 merger with Sprint T-Mobile had an ace up its sleeve. Sprint had made the unusual choice of running its 4G/LTE network almost exclusively on a swath of 2.5GHz spectrum well above the range used by the other carriers and older GSM and 3G networks.

However instead of keeping this older 4G/LTE network around T-Mobile surgically decommissioned all Sprint’s towers freeing up that 2.5GHz spectrum to be used exclusively in new 5G rollouts. This gave T-Mobile faster frequencies to play with that wouldn’t be burdened by 4G signals. Hence 5G traffic had a clear path on those airwaves without the need to employ DSS to yield to older 4G traffic. This became the backbone of T-Mobile’s 5G Ultra Capacity network.

AT&T and Verizon weren’t quite so lucky. While AT&T had some 2.3GHz spectrum it didn’t have enough to make a difference. Instead both carriers had to wait until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) freed up some more spectrum in what’s now known as the C-band range.

An FCC auction in early 2021 saw Verizon drop $45.4 billion to secure as much of this spectrum as it could. AT&T also spent over $23 billion and even T-Mobile picked up a piece of the pie for $9.3 billion. This gave the carriers the right to run 5G networks on frequencies between 3.7GHz and 3.98GHz.

Both carriers began putting this new spectrum to good use earlier this year and the higher frequencies are already proving themselves more than capable of delivering the speeds that 5G promised in the first place. While T-Mobile has a head start thanks to its earlier 2.5GHz deployments Verizon is catching up fast and AT&T isn’t much further behind.

While these mid-band and C-band frequencies are still well below 6GHz they’re in an entirely different class from the low-band frequencies that initially defined the Sub-6 range.

Where does mmWave fit in?

Although the mid-range spectrum has distinguished itself as the sweet spot for 5G offering the best mix of range and performance there’s still a place for mmWave in 5G rollouts.

Verizon may have made a tactical error by putting all of its eggs in the mmWave basket but it had the core of a good idea. Only mmWave can provide the reliability and performance needed in densely populated areas.

AT&T and T-Mobile perhaps understood this better. Both rolled out mmWave more strategically covering places like stadiums concert halls airports and other places where thousands or tens of thousands of people are likely to congregate.

It’s in situations like this where mmWave shines. The higher capacity of the 28GHz and 39GHz frequencies used for 5G mmWave means more bandwidth for many more devices. If you’ve ever been frustrated by poor 4G performance or even a “No Signal” indicator when attending a busy sporting event or concert you’ll be happy to know that mmWave solves this. By using these higher frequencies carriers can provide solid 5G performance to thousands of attendees in a stadium without breaking a sweat.

The 5G frequency mix

It’s probably apparent by now that there’s no one perfect frequency for 5G networks to run on. For carriers to deliver on what 5G promises they have to use a mix of 5G spectrum according to the circumstances.

While C-band and other mid-band frequencies will be the most commonly deployed in urban areas those are overkill for rural coverage where range is more important than performance.

This is why low-band 5G towers will continue to blanket the countryside and the good news is that as more people move to 5G smartphones and other devices the amount of 4G traffic on those frequencies will diminish paving the way for faster 5G speeds even on the lower frequencies.

Meanwhile carriers will continue to supplement their faster mid-band 5G networks with mmWave transceivers in places like stadiums and airports where extra capacity is needed to support large groups of people. Verizon also has no plans to shut down its original mmWave network already found in many urban downtown areas.

What’s next for 5G spectrum?

These three frequency ranges are just the beginning. Carriers are already vying for new blocks of 5G spectrum although it will take some time for all the pieces to be put in place.

For instance a fourth player on the field Dish could end up being a dark horse in this race. Rising from the ashes of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger Dish recently turned on its new Smart 5G network that uses revolutionary new cloud-based technology to make it faster and more affordable to roll out its 5G service across the country.

Dish has been lobbying the FCC to open up the 12GHz band although it’s currently in a fight over this spectrum with Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink service. It’s hard to say how 12GHz will fit into the 5G mix — we’re not even sure what to call it since it lives in the vast gap between Sub-6 which stops at 6GHz and mmWave which starts at 24GHz.

However this 12GHz spectrum could become a new sweet spot providing even faster speeds without sacrificing nearly as much range as the 28GHz mmWave.

T-Mobile and Dish also collectively own licenses for 99% of the 47GHz spectrum although it’s not yet clear what either carrier plans to do with that. The FCC also plans to license more mmWave spectrum in the 57-64GHz 71GHz 81GHz and 92GHz ranges.

Not every carrier is putting its hopes on this extremely high frequency (EHF) spectrum. T-Mobile has been working on achieving mmWave-like speeds on Sub-6 networks using a new feature known as Carrier Aggregation technology. As the name implies this ties multiple low-band and mid-band 5G channels together combining their bandwidth.

However the biggest obstacle to these new initiatives will be waiting for chip and phone manufacturers to catch up. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X60 offers baseline support for T-Mobile’s Carrier Aggregation strategy while the newer X65 and X70 improve on that. This means the iPhone 13 Galaxy S21 and more recent models are ready for it. However the earliest 5G phones like the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra won’t be able to take advantage of it.

New spectrum is another matter entirely. Carriers can open up whatever spectrum the FCC will allow them to but smartphones must also be ready to support those frequencies — and most don’t go beyond the standards that have already been widely deployed.

For example there aren’t any phones on the market yet that support the 12GHz band that Dish is trying to acquire and since this frequency isn’t used by anybody else Dish would have to convince a smartphone maker to get on board with it. The same is also true with the higher-frequency 47GHz spectrum.

Nevertheless there’s a close enough relationship between mobile network operators and hardware manufacturers that if the carriers build it the smartphone makers will come. The critical point is that these things take time so while the 5G spectrum will undoubtedly expand in the next few years it won’t happen overnight.

An impasse between the health service and the pharma company has been dragging on for months leaving parents and children in limbo amid indications it could cost the State €7m every year to provide the drug to a cohort of children aged six and 11 who have a rare genotype.

Gráinne Uí Lúing from Maynooth Co Kildare whose daughters Caoimhe (8) and Fiadh (6) both have CF said: “Every day without this drug for the girls is time off their lives.”

Fiadh — who spends 90 minutes a day with a nebuliser alongside medication and antibiotics — was hospitalised recently.

“It is torture” the mother said. “We are just stonewalled when we ask who we talk to who's going to give it to us. We’re getting nowhere.”

She believes the drug Kaftrio would turn her daughters’ lives around. “You're talking two tablets a day to change their life completely” Ms Uí Lúing said.

Five years ago the HSE and Vertex struck a deal worth at least €400m to provide life-changing drugs including Orkambi and Kalydeco to CF patients following a concerted campaign by parents campaign groups and politicians.

The drugs are said to improve lung function and potentially extend lives with approximately 1000 patients reimbursed for access to Vertex medicines through the agreement

But the contract between Vertex and the HSE does not cover children under 12 with a rare genotype despite covering children over 12 with the same genotype and the same condition.

“Since the agreement was signed the knowledge and data regarding how our medicines provide clinical value to CF patients with different genotypes and younger age groups has evolved” Vertex said.

“The 35 patients in the six- to 11-year-old patient population with specific genotypes were not included in the original agreement.”

The company has offered to provide the drug to 35 children at the same cost per patient as the existing agreement but the HSE said this would involve a “significant additional budget impact to the State... to enable access to Kaftrio for this patient group”.

An analysis of publicly available HSE pharmacy reports shows this would cost in the region of €210000 per patient per year as treatment involves a course of Kaftrio costing €117000 and Kalydeco costing €93000. This would amount to an extra cost to the State of more than €7m per year.

Professor Michael Barry director of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) which advises the HSE on drug reimbursement policy said Vertex was being “unreasonable” in asking for more money.

“The portfolio deal is a very generous deal for Vertex and this looking for further funding for 35 patients is just not on” he said.

""I would say standing back from this that this isn't about patients — this is about money it's about profits and it's about shareholders that's what it is — and I think we should be very upfront about that. Patients get caught up in it unfortunately and nobody wants that.

""There is a finite budget for healthcare and if we go and spend even more than we're spending on these CF drugs then it's going to be taken from other areas so that's never thought of. Somebody loses out if you decide to spend even more.”

Prof Barry said over the past five years the portfolio deal had meant the State spending more than €250m on treating fewer than a thousand patients a year despite no published data showing a reduction in mortality.

However Ms Uí Lúing argued: “When you weigh that up against the cost of constant hospitalisations lung transplant liver transplant all the medication it's a no brainer. It will work out better for the HSE rather than deteriorating health with cystic fibrosis.”

In May the HSE commissioned the NCPE to do a full health technology assessment a process which could take up to six months. This would not preclude the HSE and Vertex from striking a deal in the interim but parents and campaigners have been given no indication of when this might happen.

“Vertex is in active discussions with the HSE about this matter and remains committed to seeking a resolution for the 35 children currently impacted and other populations of CF patients who may be eligible in the future as quickly as possible” the company said.

The HSE said: “The application for pricing and reimbursement of this subset of the licensed population for Kaftrio remains under consideration with the HSE.”

Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore who has been highlighting the issue in recent weeks said it would be nice to see Vertex waive any further payments to include the 35 children. She said the issue highlighted the need for a “broader conversation to be had about how the State negotiates with the drug companies”.

“Thirty-five children have been left out of a deal that would make life-changing differences for them and I would hate to see them caught up in some contractual negotiation” she said. “I’d hate to see them becoming the pawns.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It certainly was.

Around the Flamingo's 20th anniversary in 1967 Kirk Kerkorian acquired the property for $13 million at a time when a number of Strip hotel-casinos were changing hands during the Howard Hughes whirlwind. Kerkorian planned to use the Flamingo as a sort of hotel school to train the core staff of the huge International that he was then planning. He immediately invested $2.5 million into improving the casino expanding the theater and tearing down the iconic champagne tower.

Shortly thereafter in one of the very few missteps in Kerkorian's long storied and immensely profitable career he overextended his financing and in order to stave off foreclosure and/or bankruptcy he had to sell the Flamingo to Hilton Corporation in 1970; in so doing Hilton became the first major hotel chain to enter the Nevada market. Hilton quickly embarked on a massive expansion program that added 500-room hotel towers in 1977 1980 1982 and 1986 a 728-room tower in 1990 and a 908-room tower in 1993. The 400-unit Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare tower opened in 1993.

In 1998 Hilton's gaming properties including the Flamingo were spun off as Park Place Entertainment. That deal included a license good for two years only to use the Hilton name. When Park Place failed to renew the Hilton licensing agreement in 2000 the property was renamed Flamingo Las Vegas.

So the Flamingo was the Flamingo Hilton for a total of 30 years -- from 1970 to 2000.

As an addendum to this answer rumor has it that the Flamingo might not be a Caesars property for much longer. In its first-quarter earnings call in early May the Caesars Entertainment CEO told analysts and journalists that the company ""started the process of selling a Las Vegas-Strip asset early in 2022 ... putting us somewhere in the middle of summer for a confirmation of a transaction.” Two days later Bloomberg reported that the sale of the casino that's ""in motion"" was yes the Flamingo.

Apparently Caesars has been asking $1 billion for the 76-year-old property which is a bit rich for some ""private equity firms and other operators reluctant to buy an older property that needs a lot of maintenance."" Further complicating matters VICI Properties has a right of first refusal on the sale of the Flamingo. According to Bloomberg ""Caesars considered selling Planet Hollywood but decided to keep that property so it can continue using its theater for concerts.""

If the above timetable turns out to be true we should know if something is happening with the Flamingo within the next month or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MANILA Philippines — As the pandemic fast-tracked to the adoption of digital payments the Philippines already saw the highest number of new users of e-cash or mobile payment apps across Asia and the Pacific region in October 2021.

Unsurprisingly the digital shift has changed the game for the local banking scene.

EastWest’s Komo is sought as a likely contender in the Philippine digital banking scene touting itself as the first exclusively digital banking service offered by a local bank.

Launched in May 2020 Komo is a digital banking service product of East West Rural Bank Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of East West Banking Corp.

“Komo was launched to equip our customers with services that not only helps them meet their needs but also goes beyond and empowers customers to take control of their money” said Isabelle Yap business head of Komo.

At present Komo offers free fund transfers easy bills payment and a free Visa debit card. Komo account holders can also withdraw their money with no charge from ATM machines nationwide.

“In this new normal there’s an even greater emphasis on convenience and being able to perform financial transactions anytime and anywhere” Yap said.

Komo also said it does not require any minimum or maintaining balances. It also provides account holders with 2.5% interest per year – one of the highest interest rates from Philippine banks today.

“Since everything is done digitally with no need for branches we return the savings from lower overhead cost to customers in the form of high interest rates on their savings account” Komo wrote on its website.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) estimated around 40.7 million adult Filipinos were banked raising the country’s financial inclusion to 53% from 29% in 2019.

In its bid for digital transformation the BSP targets 70% of adult Filipinos to own bank accounts by 2023. — Intern Jan Cuyco",,,,,,,,,,,,

The local has 23000 members in Indiana Illinois and Iowa.

The companies produce aggregate materials including sand gravel and crushed stone that are essential to the production of asphalt concrete and other construction materials as well as mine rock for road construction.

“We are gaining support from other unions. The Teamsters refuse to cross our picket lines” Ed Maher communications director for the local told this Militant worker-correspondent. “Paving companies are laying off workers and shutting down due to lack of materials. Teamster members at the paving companies have said they support the strike.

“The companies have unilaterally changed rules and conditions including how to get time off for COVID” he said. “And they threatened to fire any worker who went on strike.”

The Chicago Area Aggregate Producers Association is negotiating on behalf of the companies. The last strike here was in 1967.

All told picket lines are up at approximately 35 quarries mines and other facilities.

Both are organized by the Confederation of National Trade Unions (CSN).

On June 21 Rolls-Royce bosses announced they had fired Frédéric Labelle president of the Montreal local.

That same day over 11000 Unite union members at Rolls-Royce in the United Kingdom rejected a revised 4% wage increase and 2000 pound ($2420) one-time bonus contract offer by the bosses. The employers claimed the bonus would offset inflation. “The revised offer still falls a long way short of the cost-of-living crisis claim submitted by our members and their expectations” said the union. Flags of Unite could be seen on workers’ handmade signs in Montreal.

“This attempt to fire me is a frame-up” Labelle told hundreds of unionists from Rolls-Royce Bridor and elsewhere at the barbecue and rally near the company gates. “They will not be able to break us. We can feel here that an injury to one is an injury to all.”

This new attack against the union comes after four months on the picket lines. “Rolls-Royce’s firing our union president is part of their attempts to demoralize us and break our strike” Tom Larin an inspector in the plant told the Militant. “It won’t work. It makes us more determined to fight than ever. The solidarity from other unions helps a lot.”

The workers were locked out March 15 as they were taking a strike vote which passed by 94%. The contract expired in March 2020.

The company is trying to get rid of the defined benefit pension plan that covers most workers in the plant. Workers hired after 2013 are under a defined contribution plan which is what the company wants to impose on all workers. The union demands the defined benefit plan.

“Our fight for pensions is a fight for all aerospace workers for all workers in Quebec and for all Rolls-Royce workers around the world” Labelle told the rally. “We are facing the same attacks as they do on the other side of the planet.”

A delegation came from CSN locals in the Quebec City region including construction workers bus drivers and health care workers. They brought financial contributions to both Rolls-Royce and Bridor fighters.

“In the plant before we went out we did not have this solidarity. After over three months I’m proud to see we are all here” said Eric Mailloux a fitter for 22 years.

A spirited delegation from the strikers at Bridor was hailed by all speakers. “It’s our 11th week on strike. We go from one union to another to make us stronger” Claude Carriere an operator-fitter there for 21 years told the Militant.

In both battles workers are demanding higher wages to offset skyrocketing prices. Canada’s official inflation rate for May was 7.7%. Bridor bosses offered 2.5% a year and Rolls-Royce 17% over seven years.

Berkley $16 352 pp.

Mr. Wrong Number is an entertaining romantic comedy that features a heroine prone to big mishaps. Olivia Marshall has moved back home to Omaha from Chicago after she was laid off dumped by her boyfriend and then she accidentally burned down her apartment building and all her belongings. So she temporarily moves in with her brother — and his roommate Colin Beck whom Olivia has loathed ever since she overheard him referring to her as a “little weirdo” when she was 15.

Colin is even hotter now she realizes when she sees him on her first morning there when she is hungover and disheveled. Her day does not get any better as she starts her job hunt online and then stops by her parents’ house to get some of her old clothes as well as a lecture.

So when she gets a random text during an ugly-crying session that asks what she is wearing she testily replies “Your mom’s wedding dress and her favorite thong.”

She and Mr. Wrong Number fall into a witty back-and-forth and develop an anonymous friendship over texts.

Naturally the mystery man turns out to be Colin who is torn between continuing the texting or ghosting Miss Misdial especially since the attraction between him and Olivia is heating up IRL. But despite his misgivings he continues his text conversations with Olivia who is vulnerable and in need of a friend even an anonymous one.

Of course we all know that a traumatic reveal is coming (including with Olivia’s less-than-honest bid to land her dream job). And despite the hilarious chaos that inevitably follows Olivia the two start to realize that their relationship may be the real thing.

The Love of My Life

By Rosie Walsh

Pamela Dorman Books $28 380 pp.

Two new books depart from the usual template for romances — one was bittersweet and emotional the other a mystery/thriller involving an already married couple.

The Next Thing You Know is about Nova Huston an end-of-life doula who helps terminal clients prepare for a “peaceful transition” on their own terms. Her new client is Mason Shaylor a singer-songwriter who has a deteriorating condition that now makes performing his music impossible.

At first prickly and resistant to Nova’s attempts to learn about his life and his disease Mason and Nova eventually connect. Soon their bond deepens but a shocking turn of events has Nova under scrutiny for her relationship with a client and Nova questioning herself. Strawser has written a poignant tale about love friendship and redemption.

I stayed up until dawn to finish The Love of My Life engrossed by the mystery surrounding Leo and his wife Emma. Leo is an obituary writer at a London newspaper. Emma is a well-known marine biologist battling cancer. While they await the results of her last round of chemo Leo is tasked with writing an advance obituary for his wife. He agonizes over such a morbid duty but he figures that he knows Emma best and is the most qualified to write it. He starts writing in secret not wanting to burden his already stressed wife. However he soon uncovers things he never knew about her leading him to realize that Emma has been keeping some huge secrets from him and he starts to delve into her past.

The story switches between their viewpoints between present and past slowly uncovering all the devastating secrets Emma has been keeping. Walsh keeps ratcheting the tension revealing more twists and turns in the story until a wonderfully satisfying denouement is reached.

AP

A woman is suing Walmart for injuries suffered when an employee hit her with shopping carts.

Beverly Robinson suffered severe permanent injuries and was unable to work her lawyer said.

The lawyer said damages being sought would exceed $75000.

A woman is suing Walmart after claiming that she was ""violently"" knocked to the ground by an employee pushing shopping carts according to court documents.

Beverly Robinson said she was knocked down by an employee pushing a row of carts on July 9 last year at the Walmart Super-center in Donaldsonville Louisiana and suffered extensive injuries and trauma as a result.

Robinson's attorney Ralph Brickman said his client had bought groceries in the store that became too heavy to carry and so she proceeded toward the row of carts to deposit her shopping.

""Beverly Robinson put the items in the grocery cart and placed her hands on the handle of the cart when suddenly and violently she was pushed to the floor by the force of several grocery carts being pushed into her from the opposite side by a Walmart employee"" Brickman said.

Robinson is said to have suffered multiple bruises internal injuries sprains headaches and emotional distress as a result of the incident.

Brickman alleged the incident was caused by the negligence of Walmart ""as the employee failed to keep a proper lookout for customers and failed to see what should have been seen.""

The damages sought are thought to exceed $75000 Brickman said. Robinson is also seeking the repayment of medical bills resulting from the incident as well as legal fees.

In a separate filing Robinson appealed for support with those legal fees as she receives nearly $1000 per month in social security and a further $150 in food stamps after being unable to work following the incident.

The initial case has been assigned to Judge Barry W Ashe and Magistrate Judge Dana Douglas.

Walmart didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

WALMART SAM'S CLUB HIKE WAGES FOR PHARMACY TECHNICIANS

The case comes weeks after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed another lawsuit against Walmart. The FTC alleges the retail giant allowed criminals to scam consumers for hundreds of millions of dollars using its money transfer services.

Walmart was ""well aware"" that fraudsters were using its transfer services but nevertheless sent or received $197 million in payments that were subject to fraud complaints in addition to $1.3 billion in other transactions deemed potentially fraudulent.

""Walmart has continued processing fraud-induced money transfers at its stores — funding telemarketing and other scams — without adopting policies and practices that effectively detect and prevent these transfers"" the FTC argued.

Walmart argued the lawsuit was ""factually flawed and legally baseless"" in a statement.

The Bentonville-based retailer said Friday that it won't hold a formal sale event this year because it's already offering discounts on thousands of products this summer in addition to its ""everyday low prices.""

And starting today Walmart said it will drop prices on hundreds more items. All discounts apply to merchandise in its stores and on Walmart.com.

Amazon's sale for Prime members will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday though it's already offering early discounts. Prime members pay $119 a year for benefits such as free two-day shipping and access to streaming and video content.

Big-box retailers such as Walmart and Target Corp. typically schedule competing sales the same week as Prime Days.

This year Target will hold its fourth annual online-only Deal Days from Monday through Wednesday with discounts on hundreds of thousands of items. Christina Hennington chief growth officer for the Minneapolis-based retailer noted in a news release that anyone can shop the event through Target's e-commerce site or app.

And other retailers such as Nordstrom Best Buy Macy's and Wayfair are holding their annual summer sales this month.

Walmart usually holds its Deals for Days sale also available to shoppers with no subscription or membership needed during Prime Days week as well.

Like most other retailers Walmart finds itself with excess inventory this year but the company has chosen a slower approach to shedding that merchandise.

Doug McMillon Walmart's chief executive officer said at a meeting with investors in May that inventory increased 32% in the first quarter ""which is higher than we want."" Walmart was trying to stay ahead of competitors stymied by holdups in the supply chain.

""We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters"" McMillon said.

Brett Biggs who was Walmart's chief financial officer until recently leaving the company said at the same meeting that most of the inventory increase stemmed from buying ahead to keep product in stock.

Unexpected markdowns on the extra inventory pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million Biggs said.

Target said in June that it plans to move its excess inventory as quickly as possible in the second quarter taking the financial hit upfront.

Target's action plan includes additional markdowns removing excess inventory and canceling orders among other adjustments to its business practices.

""While these decisions will result in additional costs ... we're confident this rapid response will pay off for our business and our shareholders over time"" said Brian Cornell Target's chairman and chief executive.

I follow a boba tea shop on Facebook called Oh! Boba and they posted a couple days ago that they’d be serving boba tea at a “Community Extravaganza” event hosted in the parking lot of a local Walmart. I had never heard of this event before but apparently it’s the second annual one! The event boasted 40+ vendors food trucks raffles and more. So I decided to check it out if for nothing else at least for the boba tea.

I definitely wouldn’t say there were over 40 vendors and there was only one food truck so it was perhaps a little underwhelming. But it was more than the town usually has so it was at least something.

After perusing the two sides of covered booths I decided the first thing I had to do was acquire some cotton candy.

This cotton candy is from Cloudy Days Cotton Candy. They had a few different flavors but I just wanted the most basic pink vanilla. It was four dollars for a cone and it was pretty good! Who doesn’t love this iconic sugary pink fluff on a summer day?

About half of the vendors were people just selling Scentsy or Tupperware or other multi-level marketing brands but a decent amount had handmade crafts like soaps and candles.

The first thing I ended up buying was two bracelets from a shop that exclusively sold crystals. I’m not big into crystals myself but I thought I’d get one or two and gift them to friends I know are more into them. One was ten dollars and the other was eight.

I do find crystals pretty and I like them aesthetically but I’m not into them in the way a lot of my friends are regarding their energy and whatnot. I hope the ones I picked out for them have good energy I just picked colors I thought they’d like. I forgot to grab a business card from this booth or maybe they just didn’t have any otherwise I would gladly link y’all to their page.

Moving on I also thought another one of my friends would like this shiny bookmark!

I actually think it’s pretty cute I just don’t read enough to require a bookmark so I’m giving it to my bookish friend. This booth sold only bookmarks and each one was ten dollars. If you’re interested you can just look up the name on the business card on Facebook but based on the other side of their business card it appears they don’t have a Twitter or Instagram I can link.

I came across another booth that sold crystals except this one put the crystals inside of their candles and wax melts! Apparently they are “hidden gem candles” though I’m not sure how you go about getting them out of the hot wax. Their business is called Lavender Amethyst Co. and their candles are made from soy wax and hand poured.

I smelled practically every candle they had out on display (there was no one else around so I wasn’t holding up a line or anything) and I was shocked at how spot on all of their candles smelled. They have one called “Cereal Killer” that legit smells exactly like a bowl of cereal. I quite liked everything but settled on a super floral candle called “Plumeria” (which I didn’t realize until Googling right now that that is a type of flower) and a package of wax melts that are “White Tea & Ginger”. They were having a special where if you bought one candle and one wax melt it was twenty dollars. And they threw in a little free sample of wax melts that are “Honey Oat Milk Bath”.

Everything smells super good and I’m excited to use them. Though I’m not sure what to do with the crystals that came on top of the wax melts.

The last thing I bought was some handmade soap from a booth with the name “Nitty Gritty Soap Suds LLC”. Again I got no business card but it says you can like them on Facebook on the paper bag they gave me the soap in. I settled on their bestselling bar Warm Cashmere. I also got two wooden bar soap holders because that shit be sliding everywhere in the shower.

All together it was eighteen dollars six for each item. The soap smells good but is very strong and has gold glitter in it. Who doesn’t love glitter?

Finally to end my little outing I got the boba I originally came for. Since they were just set up as a little booth they had limited options so I just got the Tiger Black Milk Tea. It was seven dollars and so flippin’ yummy.

The perfect end to my Walmart parking lot adventure.

All in all it was definitely interesting and I hope they have even more vendors and whatnot next year!

Here's why it's everywhere,"New York CNN Business —

“Unexpected item in the bagging area.”

“Please place item in the bag.”

“Please wait for assistance.”

If you’ve encountered these irritating alerts at the self-checkout machine you’re not alone.

According to a survey last year of 1000 shoppers 67% said they’d experienced a failure at the self-checkout lane. Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.

“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all” said Sylvain Charlebois director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.

Customers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it too.

The machines are expensive to install often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.

Despite the headaches self-checkout is growing.

In 2020 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout up from 23% the year prior according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.

This raises the question: why is this often problematic unloved technology taking over retail?

Making customers do the work

The introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.

Instead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work the model promised lower prices.

Self-checkout however was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66% according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.

The first modern self-checkout system which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.

Customers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.

The technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.

But self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.

It took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.

Walmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images

“The rationale was economics based and not focused on the customer” Charlebois said. “From the get go customers detested them.”

A 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”

The mixed response led some grocery chains including Costco (COST) Albertsons and others to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.

“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes coupons payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.

The move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.

Retailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision said Christopher Andrews a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”

Although self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs he said.

Self-checkout Andrews added “delivers none of what it promises.”

In the biggest headache for store owners self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.

“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout losses would be 77% higher” than average according to Adrian Beck an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.

Customers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.

Some products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce including fruit and meat typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.

“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”

Other customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak) scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.

Stores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors requiring store employees to intervene.

“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience” Beck said.

Self-checkout is here to stay

Despite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners the trend is only growing.

Walmart (WMT) Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.

It may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.

Stores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers even though there’s little evidence to support that. But because customers are doing the work rather than waiting in line the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.

Store owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.

“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it you look like an idiot if you don’t have it” said David D’Arezzo a former executive at Dollar General Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”

Covid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.

During the pandemic many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers. And challenges hiring and retaining workers have led stores to rely on the machines more heavily to get customers through the door."

On June 30 former Walt Disney World employees Barbara Andreas Stephen Cribb and Adam Pajer sued the park for violating their religious beliefs. They say they were unlawfully terminated based on faith-based concerns about pandemic-related safety protocols according to The Associated Press.

On June 30 former Walt Disney World employees Barbara Andreas Stephen Cribb and Adam Pajer sued the park for violating their religious beliefs. They say they were unlawfully terminated because of their faith-based concerns about pandemic-related safety protocols according to The Associated Press.

All three employees were fired earlier this year after refusing to wear masks and socially distance when unvaccinated the lawsuit claims. They had each worked at the park at least seven years.

In her request for a religious exemption from Disney’s policies Andreas referred to a belief that many Americans have cited to explain their resistance to COVID-19 vaccines. She said “participating in a medical experiment such as COVID testing or vaccines” involving aborted fetal cells would be an “affront” to her Christian beliefs according to the lawsuit.

Although cells descended from aborted fetuses were used in the development of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines the COVID-19 shots “do not contain fetal cells” as The Associated Press previously reported. Despite this fact many religious objectors have raised abortion-related concerns when explaining their resistance to vaccination.

Both Cribb and Pajer also cited Christian beliefs and biblical texts to try to circumvent Walt Disney World’s policies the AP reported.

The article pointed out that Florida passed what was referred to by the state as “the strongest pro-freedom anti-mandate action taken by any state in the nation” in November which disrupted Disney’s vaccine policies. The law prohibited private employers from implementing vaccine mandates and said that employees could seek faith-based and other exemptions and “choose to opt for periodic testing or PPE.”

In response to the new law Walt Disney World removed its vaccine mandate although Disney World’s website still encourages people to get vaccinated. The company continued to require unvaccinated individuals to wear face masks and socially distance.

After submitting a religious exemption request regarding the masking rules Andreas received a letter from Disney on Dec. 29 refusing her request according to the AP. “After careful review of the information you provided we are unable to conclude that you are prevented from wearing a face cover due to a sincerely held religious belief practice or observance” it said.

“The lawsuit claims that Disney’s ‘augmented protocols’ that were forced on nonvaccinated employees consisted of ‘harsh isolation and restrictions’ that caused ‘serious breathing’ and made it ‘nearly impossible to find a compliant manner and location in which to eat or drink while on shift’” The Associated Press reported.

Andreas Cribb and Pajer are seeking monetary compensation for “lost wages benefits and attorney’s fees” the article said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdWdoaW5ncGxhY2UuY29tL3cvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi8wNy8xMC9hdmVuZ2Vycy1jYW1wdXMtcGFyaXMtZmlyc3QtaW1wcmVzc2lvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Impressions of Avengers Campus at Walt Disney Studios Park - LaughingPlace.com,"As a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it’s downright abhorrent that I hadn’t been to an Avengers Campus until today. Incidentally that Campus was not the one in California but the brand-new one at Walt Disney Studios Park — which will officially open on July 20th. After having a chance to preview the land this afternoon I have a few thoughts about this much-needed addition to Disneyland Paris’s second gate.

Let me start with this: Avengers Campus is not only a major upgrade for Walt Disney Studios Park but the area is almost unrecognizable from its former self. It really wasn’t until I stood in front of Avengers Assemble: Flight Force building (formerly Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster avec Aerosmith) and looked across to what is now Stark Factory that I finally got my bearings and recalled exactly where I was. On that note it’s kind of amazing that this area went from having what I believe was the ugliest attraction facade in a Disney Park — more fit for a Sam Goody store than a theme park — to having one of the most visually pleasing displays. It is further enhanced with the presence of F.R.I.D.A.Y. who occasionally speaks but also communicates in moving lights and patterns upon the building. Alas I didn’t actually ride Flight Force as the coaster is a bit above my thrill threshold. However I’d be remiss if I didn’t note the impressive Iron Man Audio-Animatronic in the pre-show which now has the distinction of being one of the most advanced in the resort.

From one of the attractions to the other there’s also Spider-Man: W.E.B. Adventure. While as I noted I’ve never been to the Disney California Adventure Avengers Campus to ride this attraction’s counterpart I have to believe it’s mostly a clone — especially since it includes a scene that seems remarkably similar in aesthetic to Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! Nevertheless I found the ride to be fun despite it not exactly being the E-Ticket many would have hoped for from a Spider-Man attraction (you know like the one found at Universal Islands of Adventure). Meanwhile as a silly American I did find it funny that although Tom Holland does reprise his role for the ride you won’t hear his voice in this version as Spidey speaks fluent French instead.

Beyond the rides one of things I enjoyed most about my time in Avengers Campus was that there was nearly always something cool happening. When Black Window and Black Panther weren’t fighting off Task Master Star-Lord and Gamora were dancing to Queen. If that wasn’t happening the Dora Milaje were marching through the land — or Thor and Loki were testing guests with Mjolnir to see if they were worthy — or any number of characters were riding through on the Avengers Deployment Vehicle. Basically if you don’t see any superheroes around you give it a minute. Alternatively during our visit guests could meet Ant-Man or the Wasp near the land’s entrance while the Training Center had even more “Heroic Encounters.” In our case we had a chance to chat with Spider-Man and got to check out the new-multi camera “freeze frame” effect during our meeting with Captain Marvel.

As for downsides while the main thoroughfare at Avengers Campus looks great the intersecting street (beyond the Training Center) leaves something to be desired. While this stretch is home to two food trucks and a diner it’s a huge letdown in theming when compared to what’s literally around the corner. Perhaps this area will look better with time and when it connects to the rest of what will be a reimagined Walt Disney Studios Park. But for now it’s not a whole lot better than what was there before.

While we’re talking about food though I did have a chance to sample a couple of dishes from Stark Factory. Of them the arugula and prosciutto pizza would be my pick. While the pizza itself was far from the best I’ve ever had the prosciutto was delicious and made the dish for me. On top of that the dessert (which was a chocolatey carmely moose type thing) was tasty albeit with a strange-ish texture. Sadly Pym’s Kitchen was not available to us during this preview but we hope to check out the buffet in the future.

Overall the five hours I spent in Avengers Campus Paris made me finally see what I was missing having not been to California in some time. However what’s interesting about the Campus concept is that as we’ve seen at DCA there will be plenty to miss as the characters that appear have regularly been updated as new MCU entries arrive. As a result while I already find this area of the park to be an awesome place to hang out I can only imagine it getting better. On that note the addition of Avengers Campus also makes me want to spend a lot more time in Walt Disney Studios Park — which let me tell you hasn’t always been the case. Aside from special events and today I think my record for consecutive time spent in that park would be 90 minutes. In other words while it may not be perfect yet I think Avengers Campus is a big win for Disneyland Paris and its fans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGhpbmdzLXlvdS1zaG91bGQtbmV2ZXItZG8tZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWZyb20tZm9ybWVyLWZ1ci1jaGFyYWN0ZXItMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Worked As a Disney Fur Character — Things People Should Never Do,"I worked as a fur character at Disney World for 4 months during my Disney College Program.

While performing as a fur character at Disney World I often got asked about mistakes people make during meet and greets.

There are many ways to ensure a great guest interaction but you might want to consider avoiding these things next time you're at the parks.

It's stressful to be scrambling for autograph books and pens when you're meeting characters

The character attendant the non-costumed employee who's stationed with each character will probably announce at least five times that you should have all pens and autograph books ready throughout your wait.

But for some reason people just don't seem to get it.

Having everything ready allows more time for you or your family to interact with the character which can create a more genuine interaction that isn't rushed or transactional feeling.

Touching or treating characters like toys is a big no

It can be dangerous to mess with performers while they're in costume. Jenna Parkany

Inappropriately interacting with a character could mean a one-way ticket off Disney property if you're really acting out.

I've seen so many interactions with kids and adults alike that consist of pulling on Pluto's tail or Mickey's ears. There was even one time when a guest pulled a piece of fur off my costume and a part of my neck was exposed.

After that interaction the guest was told they wouldn't be meeting any more characters for the day.

Disney does a lot to uphold character integrity and keep its performers safe so think twice before trying to mess with a performer at the parks.

Don't ask characters for a photo or autograph when they're clearly walking somewhere else

It's very rare at Disney World to see a character ""roaming"" or not placed in one specific spot to meet guests. So if you see a performer walking around they're probably trying to get somewhere.

Stepping in front of them or grabbing onto them can become a safety issue for you and the performer — who is either trying to get to their meet-and-greet location or head backstage for a break from the heat.

It's important to listen to the attendants and other park employees when they tell you when and where you can interact with a character.

Purposefully asking questions that the character can't answer isn't fun for anyone

The characters in the fur costumes can't speak. Jenna Parkany

Fur-character performers aren't allowed to speak when in the big costumes so asking them an uncomfortable question — such as ""Is it hot in there?"" — can really make the interaction awkward and weird.

Disney performers are trained to keep the interaction moving so they'll dodge questions they aren't able to answer through movement or with the help of their character attendant and photographer.

If you don't know what to say to a character try asking them what they've been doing recently or what their favorite ride is.

Don't force your child to meet characters if they're uncomfortable

Just like any other attraction performers and park employees know you've waited a long time for a meet and greet.

If your child is clearly upset scared or uncomfortable meeting the character when they get closer to them please don't force your child to give them a high-five or a hug. The photo you're seeking isn't worth traumatizing your child.

Plus it makes the performer just as uncomfortable when they can see that they're scaring a kid. I always tried my best to just not make things worse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2wFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FscGhhLWthcHBhLWFscGhhLXNvcm9yaXR5LW1lbWJlcnMtYWdsb3ctaW4tcGluay1hbmQtZ3JlZW4tYXQtZGlzbmV5cy1hbmltYWwta2luZ2RvbS10aGVtZS1wYXJrLWF0LXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLXJlc29ydC1haGVhZC1vZi1uYXRpb25hbC1jb252ZW50aW9uLWluLW9ybGFuZG8tMzAxNTgzNDI4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Members Aglow in Pink and Green at Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park at Walt ...,"LAKE BUENA VISTA Fla.

Competition in the streaming industry is fierce leading companies to prioritize subscriber retention and satisfaction. A recent survey found that Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD -2.39%) streamer HBO Max has the highest customer satisfaction among all streaming services. Here's why.

Competitive value

HBO Max launched in the U.S. in May 2020. Although the platform was initially run by its former parent company AT&T WarnerMedia's merger with Discovery transferred ownership to the newly formed company. The platform has grown into a strong rival to Netflix (NFLX 1.51%) and Walt Disney's (DIS -9.51%) Disney+ in just two years. HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 76.8 million global subscribers in Q1 2022.

A report released in June compared the overall user satisfaction of the nine biggest streaming platforms. HBO Max Disney+ Hulu and Netflix ranked at the top suggesting these services had the best-perceived value and content. HBO Max led the way in subscriber satisfaction with 92% of participants very satisfied with the platform an increase of 2% from 2021.

Among the top-four streaming services on the list HBO Max was the only platform to increase user satisfaction in 2022 while Disney+ stayed the same and Netflix went from 90% in 2021 to 80% in 2022. Netflix also fell from second in best user satisfaction in 2021 to fourth in 2022.

When looking at HBO Max's offerings against competitors the service provides more value than its biggest rival Netflix. It offers members the choice between two monthly tiers: with ads for $9.99 or ad-free for $14.99. Both tiers have 4K streaming as standard and allow up to three simultaneous streams.

By comparison Netflix's current ad-free tiers are $9.99 for one stream at 480p resolution $15.49 for two streams at 1080p resolution or $19.99 for four streams and 4K video quality.

Premium content

In addition to fair pricing HBO Max offers members a wealth of legacy titles from HBO's premium library and blockbuster releases such as the latest DC movies. Both of its subscription tiers allow access to all 10 of Warner Bros. Discovery's entertainment hubs including DC Classics Curated by TCM Studio Ghibli Cartoon Network Sesame Workshop Crunchyroll Adult Swim Cartoonito and Looney Tunes.

When surveyed for HBO Max's quality and variety of content satisfaction the platform won out against all its competitors. The figures showed about 90% of consumers are pleased with the streamer's original series about 85% with its library series and more than 86% with its movies. Disney+ came in at a close second behind HBO Max but Netflix was just over 75% with its original series while its library series and movies hovered around 70%.

Additionally HBO Max has taken a page out of Disney's book by attracting viewers with originals based on popular franchises. The original series Peacemaker a spinoff of DC's The Suicide Squad set the HBO Max record for best single-day performance with its finale on February 17 -- achieving a 44% increase in viewing over the premiere.

Meanwhile HBO Max's library seems set to only improve with the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Rumors have swirled that HBO Max might be getting ready to absorb Discovery+ after European content changes. The move would add a large number of popular reality titles such as Property Brothers Chopped Pawn Stars and more. Discovery+ also doesn't offer annual subscriptions making it easier for the platform to merge with HBO Max.

Looking to the future

HBO Max's biggest hurdle in the near future is the launch of ad-supported tiers by Netflix and Disney+. The service will need to be willing to adjust its service accordingly based on what the new subscriptions look like.

Recent data revealed that subscribers are currently more likely to quit Netflix in the first month than any other platform. Compared with the above data Netflix has an uphill battle to climb before consumers view it as a good buy and subscriber growth turns around.

HBO Max and Disney+ offer such contrasting content it stands to reason the two could be friendlier about co-existing in the market than with other services. HBO Max can take the reins on quality dramas such as Game of Thrones and its immensely popular Euphoria while Disney+ entertains families with a library of nostalgic PG titles and action brands such as Marvel and Star Wars.

HBO Max has carved out its place near the top in an incredibly competitive industry in just two years. It will remain a strong competitor if it can continue offering quality content and value.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcGxheW5ld3MuY29tL2hiby1tYXgtYW5kLWNhcnRvb24tbmV0d29yay11bnZlaWwta2lkcy1mYW1pbHktc2NoZWR1bGUtYXQtMjAyMi1jb21pYy1jb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HBO Max and Cartoon Network Unveil ‘Kids & Family’ Schedule at 2022 Comic-Con,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcGxheW5ld3MuY29tL2hiby1tYXgtYW5kLWNhcnRvb24tbmV0d29yay11bnZlaWwta2lkcy1mYW1pbHktc2NoZWR1bGUtYXQtMjAyMi1jb21pYy1jb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001D2869EE1D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcGxheW5ld3MuY29tL2hiby1tYXgtYW5kLWNhcnRvb24tbmV0d29yay11bnZlaWwta2lkcy1mYW1pbHktc2NoZWR1bGUtYXQtMjAyMi1jb21pYy1jb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcncuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvc2hvd3MvZ29vZC1mb29kL2VjaG8tcGFyay1uYXlhcml0LXRoZS1iZWFyLWRpcHMtdGxheXVkYXMvamVyZW15LWFsbGVuLXdoaXRlLXRoZS1iZWFyLXNlcmllcy1odWx10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Actor Jeremy Allen White depicts the highs and lows of chef life in 'The Bear',"In the new FX series “The Bear” actor Jeremy Allen White plays Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto a chef with struggles both in and out of the kitchen. Carmy leaves the fast and traumatic world of fine dining and returns to Chicago to run his family’s sandwich shop.

Good Food host Evan Kleiman has seen plenty of shows and movies set in restaurants but most of them make her cringe. She says she doesn’t think she’s ever seen a better or more nuanced depiction of the intense highs and crushing lows of working in a professional kitchen than what she’s seen in “The Bear.” She talks to White about his new leading role.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KCRW: I need to know how many beef sandwiches you ate to prepare for the role. Please tell me you're not a vegan.

Jeremy Allen White: No. I'd spent a fair amount of time in Chicago shooting the show “Shameless.” Portillo's was kind of my go-to for a time because I’d have one or several every time I was there to shoot that show. I probably had about a dozen while I was there shooting “The Bear.”

Do you have a particular order?

I like spicy and dipped wet.

So when we meet Carmy he's hurting. He's mourning his brother. He's having horrific PTSD flashbacks for not only the relationship with his brother but all the abuse he endured working in restaurants. What drew you to the script and to this particular character?

We're meeting Carmy at his worst his most confused his most lost. It was really interesting to meet a character going through this most-traumatic moment in his life. I was really interested in the culinary world and fine dining. Not that I was incredibly knowledgeable but a lot of people have a fascination. I think the amount of people who are interested in that world has grown tremendously in the last decade or two with the birth of these celebrity chefs. I was interested and I wanted to learn more. And as I did the world became just more and more interesting.

I think for Carmy my heart just kind of broke for him. His identity was so wrapped up in everything he built for himself and in his identity of being a chef and being incredibly good at it and successful at it. And his life outside of that seemed pretty empty.

I know that the struggling actor who's waiting tables is a trope. Did you have much experience working in restaurants either front of the house or back before you started shooting “The Bear?”

I never had any. I started acting pretty young and didn't really have any success until I was older. I got a commercial here and there so no I never worked in restaurants.







I understand that you did a fair bit of hands-on prep for the role. You worked at several restaurants including Pasjoli here in Santa Monica. Can you tell us about that experience how long you were there and what they had you doing?

It started even before I got to Pasjoli. I went to culinary school for two weeks at the Institute of Culinary Education in Pasadena. That was a crash course for myself and Ayo who plays Sydney on the show. I learned a great deal in that time. I was pretty much clueless in the kitchen. [I learned] how to hold a knife how to move around the kitchen when to put oil on the pan when to heat it – the basics and simple stuff.

Then I started going into restaurants. I spent about six weeks at Pasjoli. It started out where I was really just a fly on the wall. I really just wanted to watch how these cooks moved in the kitchen. Then I began to come during the day for prep where the margin for error is a little bit smaller. If I screwed up it could be repaired.

I got better with a knife. I was learning a lot really quickly. Everybody there was really supportive. As long as I showed up and I was serious they seemed game to teach. After a couple of weeks of that I was kind of shoved onto the line with chef Dave Beran who's a really wonderful chef. He came from Chicago – he was a chef at Alinea for a long time. So he was really wonderful and kind of gave me the nudge. Eventually I was cooking on the line and actually cooking food that was served there. That was a real rush.

Did you connect with that experience? Did you enjoy it at all?

I gained a lot of respect for cooks and chefs during the process. I don't think I quite understood the sacrifice and the commitment that goes into being a chef – the repetition it's a craft that you have to hone so consistently. I think at that level too. Or at any level serving food is kind of a performance.

The more I spent time in the kitchen the more I started to draw parallels between putting together a show or a movie or a play and putting together a meal at a restaurant for your guests. There's performance involved in both. So I think I started to enjoy some parts of existing in the kitchen for the same reasons that I enjoy what I do.

I'm curious about how surprised you were about the internal life of the character the more you got into Carmy. He's such a real depiction of not just a chef-owner who's being pushed to the max but one who's also juggling life problems. I think that is true of everybody in every job but particularly those in the kitchen.

Carmy has thrown himself so much into his work. And obviously he's been running away from things – his feelings his family the place he grew up long before his brother committed suicide. He's not a stranger to burying himself in his work. He's so wrapped up in this identity that everything is automatically so high stakes. If he fails I really think that Carmi thinks he's going to die. And if he can succeed he'll have glory.

It was really obvious watching “The Bear” that whoever's writing the show has worked in restaurants. I love this scene where Carmy explains to aspiring pastry chef Marcus how to properly cut a tape label which is something that Chef Thomas Keller is famously rigorous about. It's such an insider thing. Were there other little details like that that you had to pay attention to?

Christopher Storer who's the creator of our show is a really wonderful cook but I don't know how much actual restaurant experience he's had. But his sister is the really wonderful chef Courtney Storer who was chef at Jon and Vinny’s in Los Angeles for a long time and she was around a lot. We also had chef Matty Matheson who's incredibly knowledgeable and now is a bit more of a restaurateur but also was a consultant on this for us. But I know that a lot of Chris Storer’s heroes are our chefs. He has a real passion. That was like a nod to Keller for sure.

Because working in a professional kitchen is so hard the staff often bonds in a way that people at most jobs don't. A psychologist would probably call it trauma bonding. I think there's a reason they call the staff dinner “family meal.” How would you describe Carmy’s relationship with his number two Sydney played by Ayo Edebiri. She's amazing.

She's incredible. There's something really wonderful that they have almost an instant mutual respect for one another because Carmy thinks Sydney is talented and Sydney thinks the same of him. They come from the same world.

Carmy has found himself at this restaurant where no one else knows [about his life] and he feels really unseen. When Sydney shows up I think he feels seen and understood again. I can't speak for Ayo but I think Sydney feels a similar way – at times also very unseen. And I think that's where the conflict can come from. But they've been through a similar wringer. I think there's a mutual respect and a vulnerability they allow one another.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm56aGVyYWxkLmNvLm56L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc3B5LW1lZXQtdGhlLWZvcmVpZ24taW52YWRlcnMtb2YtaGVhcnRicmVhay1pc2xhbmQvQ0o1VlRLQUdaQVhVSDNPVE9WNkNUVzNEWEEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spy: Meet the foreign invaders of Heartbreak Island,"The reboot of TVNZ's Heartbreak Island has introduced an overseas cast to star alongside the Kiwis.

The reboot of TVNZ's Heartbreak Island has introduced an overseas cast to star alongside the Kiwis.

Both Warner Bros Discovery and TVNZ are putting a lot of budget and strategy into Love Island-esque productions — but only for the streaming audience.

TVNZ will screen new show FBOY Island NZ hosted by Shavaughn Ruakere on TVNZ+ only and Discovery is screening its Clinton Randell-hosted Heartbreak on ThreeNow only.

It's the first production Discovery has made only for streaming. The international cast Spy is told is there to make it more fun for Kiwi audiences and to help the on-sell into foreign markets.

Spy sources say the show is steamy — but some of the action has been too hot to handle and has ended up on the cutting room floor.

After the first season Heartbreak Island star Harry Jowsey went on to star in more reality shows in Hollywood and became an influencer. In the hope of doing the same it is a sure bet the new Heartbreak cast gave it their best (or possibly their worst) for on-camera memorable moments during filming in Fiji earlier this year.

The starting cast of 16 are in for plenty of surprises. Spy understands even more foreign intruders invade their relationships just as they settle into the tropical love-fest.

Spy's four foreigners to watch are 24-year-old London postman Kieran Hickey 21-year-old Texan Shamar Sinegal 23-year-old Kacey Watson and for the most fun we have 25-year-old Sydney bartender Amber Yee.

Yee describes herself as a pocket rocket — a fiery night owl who is looking for a bad boy with wit and charm.

Watson loves to take the mickey out of others and has moved to a new country every two or three years. She loves fashion clubbing and dating.

Hickey is not the slightest bit shy and describes himself as the cheeky chappy who is always the leader of his 10-strong lad pack — and boasts he scores dates far more than his friends.

Hopefully Sinegal left his phone at home — his last relationship ended because he was putting more energy into TikTok than his girlfriend. He has more than 50k followers on Instagram and claims his work in security gives him plenty of opportunities with women.

Tonnes of dangerous untreated medical waste just outside Yemen's largest city poses a threat to the environment and water supplies.

At a landfill site near the city of Sanaa a truck unloads bags of colourful trash into a seemingly endless sea of waste covering the area.

The al-Azraqain landfill receives 2000 tonnes of waste a day including dangerous untreated medical waste generated by hospitals in Sanaa. As the waste builds up it leaks toxic chemicals down into the ground.

""We have no solution but to bury the medical waste with the garbage. It is mixed with garbage and buried"" says Bahauddin al-Haj data manager at al-Azraqai landfill site.

Though not a paragon of waste management before the war Sanaa was at least able to separate the most dangerous materials from general waste.

Nearby there used to be a medical waste processing facility which housed an incinerator. Unfortunately it was destroyed in a bombing in 2015.

How does contaminated land affect people’s health?

Medical waste is hazardous material that may be infectious toxic or radioactive.

The pools of contaminated waste on the landfill release pathogens and toxic pollutants into the environment and those leak into the groundwater.

Groundwater is a common source of drinking water and water for cleaning agriculture and animals.

If groundwater is contaminated it can cause a variety of diseases and illnesses including cancers birth defects immunological disorders and many other diseases.

So even when the war is over in Yemen its effects could last for decades.

Local administrators say they are looking for support from NGOs to rebuild the incineration facility.

""Due to the high cost of establishing such a project we have coordinated with the Supreme Council (for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) as well as with various organisations” says Head of the General Directorate of the Cleaning Department Ibrahim Al-Surabi.

“And God willing at the beginning of next year we will discuss the rebuilding of this strategic project. “

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently tested a newly-devised waste disposal technology on Internal Space Station or ISS. This waste disposal technology has been developed by Nanoracks a waste disposal company based in Texas. The test made it clear that this particular technology eliminates waste from the ISS very efficiently and in a sustainable manner. NASA is quite impressed with this technology and there is a good chance of it being implemented in several space stations in the near future.ISS astronauts gather waste material and then keep it on the space station for several months till the Cygnus cargo vehicle comes and collects it. Cygnus has often been described as a disposable spacecraft that is put together to carry essential supplies to the space station. Once the spacecraft completes this task astronauts put multiple bags containing trash into it and release it. Soon enough the spacecraft de-orbits and gets burned down while trying to enter the Earth’s atmosphere again.This brand new technology which has been discovered by Nanocracks involves the use of a specialized waste container mounted over the Bishop Airlock. Around 270 kg trash can be filled inside it by the crew members. Once the container is released it burns up while attempting to enter Earth. While this technology is very similar to the Cygnus method it has been found to be far more sustainable and efficient. Here astronauts will not be required to wait for the arrival of the cargo spacecraft to get rid of the waste material.During the test conducted by NASA the container had 78 kg waste material including cargo transfer bags foam used clothing material office supplies packing materials and hygiene products.According to Amela Wilson CEO at Nanoracks this successful test has paved the way for this innovative technology to be adopted by space stations. She also thanked NASA and the ISS Program for extending their support to this technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NieXRlc2FwcC5jb20vbmV3cy9zY2llbmNlL2hvdy1uYXNhLXRocm93cy1vdXQtdHJhc2gtZnJvbS1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9uL3N0b3J50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Space Station ejects 78kg trash using unique waste-disposal technology,"Next Article

International Space Station ejects 78kg trash using unique waste-disposal technology

By Athik Saleh 04:56 pm Jul 09 202204:56 pm

What's the story Have you ever wondered how astronauts in the International Space Station (ISS) dump their trash? As you can imagine it is tough but not anymore. The ISS ejected around 78kg (172 pounds) of garbage in a specialized trash bag from its commercial Bishop Airlock on July 2. The airlock system was created and operated by Nanoracks a private in-space services company.

Context

Why does this story matter?

Disposing of trash has always been the International Space Station's Achilles heel. It seems that a viable solution is finally available. Jettisoning trash is a huge step in the space station's waste management history as it puts an end to storing garbage until the cargo ship arrives to pick it up. It needs to be seen whether this will be permanent or not.

Old method

How did astronauts in ISS disposed their trash till now?

ISS astronauts collect and place their trash in their orbiting homes. The trash is then piled into a cargo ship that arrives to collect them. It is then released from the space station. After entering Earth's orbit the cargo vehicle burns up in the atmosphere. On rare occasions astronauts also hand-dispose small items during spacewalks.

New method

Bishop Airlock world's first commercial airlock was used for disposal

The ISS used the airlock trash bag system for the first time. The space station used Bishop Airlock the world's first commercial airlock for jettisoning the trash. The bag contained used foam cargo transfer bags officer supplies crew hygiene products and crew clothing. With the specially designed waste container the crew can easily dispose of up to 272kg of trash.

Information

Soviet Salyut space stations used to jettison trash bags regularly

Although ISS used an airlock trash system for the first time this method is not new to spaceflight. Soviet Salyut space stations in the 1970s and 1980s used to jettison trash bags regularly. The last time it happened was in 1996.

Official words

Airlock trash system is a more sustainable strategy: Nanoracks

About the successful use of Bishop Airlock Program Manager Cooper Read said ""As we move into a time with more people living and working in space this is a critical function just like it is for everyone at home."" Nanoracks said that the technology ""demonstrates a more effective and sustainable strategy for reducing garbage aboard the ISS.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvY2hlbm5haS8yMDIyL0p1bC8xMC9jaGVubmFpLWFkLWZpcm0tdGhhdC13b24td2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1iaWQtc3RhcnRzLXdvcmstYWZ0ZXItdHdvLXllYXJzLTI0NzQ4MzguaHRtbNIBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvY2l0aWVzL2NoZW5uYWkvMjAyMi9KdWwvMTAvY2hlbm5haS1hZC1maXJtLXRoYXQtd29uLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtYmlkLXN0YXJ0cy13b3JrLWFmdGVyLXR3by15ZWFycy0yNDc0ODM4Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chennai ad firm that won waste management bid starts work after two years,“To advise individuals firms companies corporations and others anywhere in the world on best methods of advertising products processes and services and to act as consultants and agents and to deal with newspapers magazines TV radio and other media on behalf of the clients” says a company document explaining its nature of business.

The 85-foot trawler deep green and speckled with rust was returning from a grueling fishing trip deep into the Atlantic swells. Leeman and his crew of four had worked 10 consecutive days 20 hours a day to haul in more than 50000 pounds of fish: pollock haddock and ocean perch a trio known as groundfish in the industry and as whitefish in the freezer aisle.

As sunrise broke over New Bedford harbor the fish were offloaded in plastic crates onto the asphalt dock of Blue Harvest Fisheries one of the largest fishing companies on the East Coast. About 390 million pounds of seafood move each year through New Bedford’s waterfront the top-earning commercial fishing port in the nation.

Leeman and his crew are barely sharing in the bounty. On deck Leeman held a one-page “settlement sheet” the fishing industry’s version of a pay stub. Blue Harvest charges Leeman and his crew for fuel gear leasing of fishing rights and maintenance on the company-owned vessel. Across six trips in the past 14 months Leeman netted about 14 cents a pound and the crew about 7 cents each — a small fraction of the $2.28 per pound that a species like haddock typically fetches at auction.

“It’s a nickel-and-dime game” said the 40-year-old Leeman who wore a flannel shirt beneath foul weather gear and a necklace strung with a compass a cross and three pieces of jade — one piece for each of his three children. “Tell me how I can catch 50000 pounds of fish yet I don’t know what my kids are going to have for dinner.”

Leeman’s lament is a familiar one in New Bedford an industrial city tucked below Cape Cod on the south coast of Massachusetts. In recent years the port of New Bedford has thrived generating $11.1 billion in business revenue jobs taxes and personal income in 2018 according to one study. But a quiet shift is remaking the city and the industry that sustains it realizing local fishermen’s deepest fears of losing control over their livelihood.

Blue Harvest and other companies linked to private equity firms and foreign investors have taken over much of New England’s fishing industry. As already harsh working conditions have deteriorated the new group of owners has depressed income by pushing expenses onto fishermen an investigation by ProPublica and The New Bedford Light has found. Blue Harvest has also benefited from lax antitrust rules governing how much fish it can catch.

Since it was founded in 2015 Blue Harvest has been acquiring vessels fishing permits and processing facilities up and down the East Coast. It started with the self-proclaimed goal of “dominance” over the scallop industry. It has expanded into groundfish tuna and swordfish as well as becoming a government contractor winning a $16.6 million contract from the U.S. Department of Agriculture this past February to supply food assistance programs.

The acquisitions are backed by $600 million in capital from Bregal Partners a Manhattan-based private equity firm. Bregal is an arm of a firm owned by a Dutch billionaire family who are best known for their multinational clothing company which maintains a steady track record of environmental philanthropy and low-wage labor around the globe.

Bregal its parent company and Blue Harvest President Chip Wilson did not respond to questions. Wilson said in an email that he has been “fighting a handful of fires” and that “speaking with the press has been low on my priority list of late.” He is more concerned “about moving our strategy forward so that the 200+ folks who work for Blue Harvest can be confident about their future” he said.

“New Bedford is an interesting community particularly in this ‘colorful’ sector and the rumor mill is particularly vicious” he added. “I cannot tell you how many times I have listened to employees scared to the core for themselves and their families due to unsubstantiated rumors about our company.”

In the first half of 2021 private equity firms which often invest in privately held companies with the goal of ultimately selling them for a profit accounted for 34% of mergers and acquisitions in the fishing industry nearly double the 2017 percentage according to trade publication Undercurrent News. Last fall one such firm ACON Investments purchased three seafood processing companies including one with a 38000-square-foot plant in New Bedford. Another private equity company — Solamere Capital which boasts as partners former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Taggart Romney son of former Massachusetts Gov. and current Utah Sen. Mitt Romney — also acquired processing plants.

“What we’re seeing is a fundamental transformation of the fishing industry” said Seth Macinko a former fisherman who’s now an associate professor of marine affairs at the University of Rhode Island. “Labor is getting squeezed and coastal communities are paying the price.”

To be sure private equity can inject capital to buy new equipment or renovate a processing facility. Boosters say that consolidation can improve efficiency and make U.S. seafood more competitive against cheaper fish imported from foreign countries that subsidize their fleets.

Still private equity’s gain has largely been small fishermen’s loss. Known for seeking profits by slashing costs in retail sectors such as toys and shoes private equity investors have taken a similar approach to the fishing industry which offered an opportunity to make a significant return on investment through economies of scale.

The number of employers in New Bedford’s fishing industry has dropped by more than 30% in the past decade according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Fishermen are working much longer hours — 45% of fishermen reported working 18 hours or more per day in a federal survey published last year up from 32% in 2012.

Almost all fishermen in New Bedford are paid a share of the earnings from their catch. It’s an arrangement with origins in the 19th century when whale oil made New Bedford the Dubai of its day. Whaling captains built the city’s historic mansions; the whale ships’ investors built churches and hospitals.

But today companies like Blue Harvest take advantage of this pay structure to shift costs onto fishermen reducing their income. Under the private equity takeover regional economies like New Bedford’s are keeping less of the industry’s profits while a cut of the owners’ share is shuttled to skyscrapers in Manhattan and in some cases overseas. Despite rising consumer prices for New Bedford’s fish the poverty rate in the city has been double the state average for the past decade.

“Without question there is an increase in costs that are being passed down to crew” said Matthew Cutler who studies socioeconomic trends among fishermen for the regional arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA which is part of the Department of Commerce governs the fishing industry.

So far private equity mainly dominates New England’s groundfish which constitutes roughly 11% of all seafood caught off the region’s coast by weight. But a proposal being considered by federal regulators could expand private equity’s control over scallops — the most lucrative seafood for New Bedford fishermen. The proposal has roiled New Bedford where more than 100 fishermen signed a petition against it. It also worries New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.

“Private equity owns a piece of the waterfront now” he said. “Remote ownership is always going to be driven by dollars and cents. Without any loyalty to the place business decisions can become cold and harsh.”

Owning his own vessel was Jerry Leeman’s goal when he first started fishing with his grandfather at the age of 12. He climbed the ranks from deckhand to mate and finally to captain. He hoped to go into business for himself.

But an overhaul of federal rules adopted in 2010 halted Leeman’s ascent and that of thousands of other fishermen in the northeast. Promoted by an alliance of conservation groups and some of the largest seafood distributors the new framework sought to end decades of overfishing that had devastated species like the Atlantic cod while also helping American businesses compete with cheaper imported fish by making the domestic supply more predictable.

Under “catch shares” as the system is called regulators cap how much of each species can be fished and require permits to catch them. Federal scientists set a “total allowable catch” determining the amount of each kind of fish that can be sustainably hauled from regional waters each year. Based on a decade of their catch history individual fishermen and companies were granted rights to a percentage of the annual total allowable catch — in perpetuity — free to fish it sell it or lease it to others.

The catch shares system has proven to be an effective tool to reduce overfishing. Overall New England waters have “shown slow recovery since the major declines” a 2021 study noted. But the change hurt small fishermen. Their shares were based on their historical percentages of the catch for a given species. As the total allowable catch for some species was reduced to avoid overfishing the same percentages translated into fewer pounds of those fish. Many fishermen sold their permits to bigger companies that had been granted larger shares and rushed to expand. New England’s fleet of vessels actively catching groundfish was reduced from 596 in 2007 to 269 in 2015 according to a NOAA study.

“This is the door closing on an entire generation of fishermen” said Brett Tolley who comes from a family of Cape Cod fishermen. After a series of reductions he said the catch allocated to his family — about one-third of 1% of pollock and haddock — was too small to make a living. They sold their permit a year ago to a midsize local company.

While consolidation started before catch shares the new system accelerated the process. It “turned the privilege to catch a pound of fish into a commodity that could be bought or sold without owning a boat” Macinko said. “It opened the door to private equity.”

Recognizing the potential for consolidation the Pacific Coast branch of NOAA built in controls prohibiting any individual from owning more than 2.7% of groundfish permits limiting the inroads that private equity could make. Accommodating business interests the New England office initially set a much higher cap of 20% before reducing it to 15.5% in 2017.

“You have to limit entry in order to have a profitable fishery” said Chad Demarest an economist with the Northeast Fisheries Science Center under NOAA. “The goal is to create some profit in the industry that is shared by the owners.”

Because Leeman was a hired hand when catch shares were adopted he wasn’t allocated any permits. And as the price of a single permit climbed to as much as $500000 for groundfish he couldn’t afford to buy in. His dream of captaining a fishing boat that he owned was dashed.

Rights to fish “were free 30 years ago” he said. “But then came the conservation groups. Then there was consolidation. Then there was big money.”

In the early years of catch shares many smaller fishermen sold out to the same New Bedford fishing magnate: Carlos Rafael often referred to as “the Codfather.” A first-generation immigrant from the Azores a chain of Portuguese islands Rafael arrived in New Bedford as a teenager. He started as a fish cutter and over four decades he built one of the largest groundfish operations in the country running more than 40 vessels.

A charismatic rogue who liked to describe himself as a modern-day pirate Rafael was openly opposed to the catch shares system at first believing it would eventually mean only one company would be left fishing on the East Coast. Yet as New England transitioned to the system he was granted about 9% of the region’s total groundfish permits one of the largest initial allocations. He decided that if only one company would be left standing it would be his.

“So he [a smaller fisherman] doesn’t have the money to buy a fucking quota” he said. “So he’s fucked either way. He’s hanging by his shoestrings. So this is a matter of fucking time for me to pick the rest of these fuckers and just get them all out of the picture….I always had the ambition to get fucking control of the whole fucking thing.”

According to court documents Rafael made that statement to undercover IRS agents posing as Russian mobsters. He also divulged to them an illegal scheme he called “the dance.” On a February morning in 2016 the green-and-white panels of the Carlos Seafood building were reflecting red and blue as a team of federal agents raided the waterfront facility. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to 27 counts of fraud and tax evasion related to mislabeling almost 800000 pounds of fish; he was sentenced to 46 months in prison.

At the time of Rafael’s downfall Bregal Partners was rapidly tightening its grip on the fishing industry. It took its first plunges in 2015. It invested in Seattle-based American Seafoods which Bregal has described as “the largest harvester of fish for human consumption in the US.” It also founded Blue Harvest which quickly acquired four fishing operations on the East Coast.

It first bought a large scallop fleet in Virginia then a midsize company in New Bedford. In 2018 it added Maine-based Atlantic Trawlers. (Leeman who had been working for Atlantic Trawlers stayed on the same boat now owned by Blue Harvest.) It capped off its buying spree with its biggest prize.

As part of a settlement with NOAA Rafael had agreed to sell his empire estimated to encompass a quarter of New England’s groundfish industry to the highest bidder. Rafael had tried to sell his company to the undercover agents for $175 million. In 2020 Blue Harvest acquired a portion of Rafael’s holdings — 12 groundfishing vessels and 27 permits — for $25 million.

Along the way Blue Harvest bought and expanded processing facilities off Herman Melville Boulevard named after the “Moby-Dick” author who sailed out of New Bedford on a whaling voyage in 1841. The goal the then-chief executive said in 2020 was to establish the “first vertically integrated groundfish company on the East Coast” — folding a large slice of the waterfront into one streamlined operation: vessels permits processing and distribution.

Controlling the supply chain enables Blue Harvest to reduce costs and compete with imports shipped frozen into the U.S. from Icelandic or Norwegian companies fishing in the North Atlantic. It also means that the company doesn’t have to pay its fishermen the market price for their catch.

Independent fishermen sell their catch at public auctions or to whichever wholesaler offers the best price. But Blue Harvest fishermen generally don’t have that opportunity. They must sell their fish to the company — sometimes at prices lower than they could get otherwise. Blue Harvest did not respond to questions about its payments to fishermen.

As it cast an ever-larger shadow over the port Blue Harvest set a lofty goal: “transforming commercial fishing into an industry that is defined by sustainability governed by transparency and bound to the promise of delivering excellence to every plate.”

Leeman has never heard of the billionaire Brenninkmeijer family but he’s working for them. Blue Harvest’s trail of global ownership winds from New Bedford’s industrial waterfront to Bregal Partners’ office in a sleek 50-story skyscraper on Manhattan’s Park Avenue and then on to a Swiss company Cofra Holding AG. Cofra in turn is wholly owned by the Brenninkmeijers a Dutch family described by a former retail analyst at Morgan Stanley as both “highly secretive” and a “global powerhouse” in the retail industry. One member married into the Dutch royal family. Several have lived in a moated five-story medieval castle on the River Rhine.

The family’s holding company has a wide-ranging portfolio. It has focused on renewable energies like solar and offshore wind as well as on fossil fuel projects such as natural gas drilling and exploration in Appalachia’s Marcellus Shale. Its investments include shopping plazas in Spain Belgium and the U.K. and commodities such as dairy coffee timber and now fish. Its sprawling supply chains encompass more than one million workers from New Bedford to Bangladesh.

The family’s vast wealth originated in clothing. In 1841 brothers Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer began peddling textiles in a small region that now spans Germany and the Netherlands. In an era when most European clothing manufacturers catered mainly to affluent families the brothers’ company now called C&A specialized in ready-to-wear clothing for the middle and working classes.

Under the Nazi regime the company took advantage of opportunities afforded by “Aryanization” to take over stores owned by Jews fleeing persecution according to a 2016 book by Mark Spoerer an economic historian at the University of Regensburg who was commissioned by the family to examine the company’s past. The German branch of C&A used forced labor in the Lodz Ghetto to manufacture clothing Spoerer found. Soon after the war C&A retail locations expanded around the world.

“It was opportunism” acknowledged Maurice Brenninkmeijer then chairman of Cofra Holding in a 2016 interview with German newspaper Die Zeit. “I suspect that my relatives were solely focused on business and in doing so they lost sight of our values.” He added “I wish it had been different.”

In rare interviews family members portray themselves as major donors to environmental initiatives. Their philanthropic arm the Laudes Foundation promotes sustainable usage of raw materials used in C&A clothing to address what it calls “the dual crisis of inequality and climate change.”

Yet C&A has come under fire for contracting with companies that have allegedly exploited workers. While it produces its own line of clothes it also acts as an intermediary between Western companies and hundreds of garment factories in East Asia and South America. It’s most active in Bangladesh where labor costs are among the lowest in the world.

In 2012 a fire swept through a Bangladesh factory producing clothes for C&A killing at least 112 workers. The company agreed to pay compensation to victims and to assess safety conditions. Last year a German human-rights organization filed a criminal complaint against C&A among others for sourcing cotton made with the forced labor of Uyghur Muslims in China. Cofra and C&A did not respond to requests for comment.

“Given the scale at which C&A operates they could literally lift millions of garment workers out of abject poverty” said Ben Vanpeperstraete senior legal adviser with the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights who helped negotiate compensation for victims of the 2012 Bangladesh factory fire.

“In the end they put profits first.”

One July day in 2017 Joseph Drago woke up in a loud dark cabin below deck of a scallop vessel owned by Blue Harvest. He had a splitting headache and couldn’t catch his breath. He stumbled onto the deck and asked the crew what was happening.

It was fumes one replied in Spanish. An exhaust leak from the engine had been pouring into the sleeping quarters. Soon after the engine blew out leaving the vessel bobbing in swells 80 miles off the coast. It had to be towed into port.

Blue Harvest boats have had a number of mishaps. Last year one Blue Harvest vessel burned at sea; another ran aground which can be attributable to human error or weather conditions. Leeman had to cut a fishing trip short in January when the boat’s engine malfunctioned.

Current and former workers said that several vessels that Blue Harvest regularly operates were already past their prime when the company bought them. “Their next stop should have been the scrapyard” said the former Blue Harvest mechanic who requested anonymity out of concern for his career. “The boats had been worked like dogs.” Blue Harvest did not respond to questions about the condition of its fleet.

Captains and crew on Blue Harvest boats pay for maintenance according to settlement sheets and fishermen. The company has also imposed other charges that fishermen say they haven’t encountered elsewhere in the industry including a 3% “electronics fee” and a $400 “wharfage fee” for pulling up at the company dock to unload fish.

“The price stays the same but all our expenses just keep going up” said Drago. “Every trip they’re taking more and more out of the crew’s share.”

Drago like Leeman aspired to buy his own boat. But with nerve damage in his hand from years working at sea the 35-year-old plans to leave the industry as soon as he can find another job.

“You can no longer work your way up from the deck become a captain and buy your own boat and permit. That was always the arrangement” he said. “You’ll never make enough. They made it unattainable to do anything but work for them.”

As Blue Harvest snapped up fleets it also acquired their permits. Today it is approaching the antitrust limit of 15.5% ownership of permits for groundfish caught off New England.

Blue Harvest owns 12% of the permitted catch overall including 21% of haddock 19% of winter flounder 16% of ocean perch and 15% of cod. It stays below the aggregate cap by owning smaller shares of other species like 2% of a certain northern flounder. The company’s groundfish permit holdings total about 46 million pounds.

But those figures underestimate Blue Harvest’s market share. In addition to owning permits it also leases fishing rights from other permit owners. At the beginning of the year the company will lease a “bucket of fish” one Blue Harvest manager said. “If we’re short on something we’ll buy it” for the year. The manager said that this practice addresses a weakness in the catch shares system which allows individuals and organizations to hold permits and passively earn a profit through leasing rather than fishing themselves. About 40% of all groundfish permits are not used by their owners and are available only on the leasing market records show.

Leasing provides a small but steady revenue stream for those owners and it helps to ensure that enough seafood reaches the market to satisfy demand. The practice also enables the expansion of larger companies. That’s because NOAA’s antitrust rules apply only to ownership. “There is no restriction on leasing” said NOAA’s Demarest. “It would be a very illiberal idea to try to cap the amount that each corporation can land.”Theoretically Blue Harvest or any other major player can legally circumvent the 15.5% cap by leasing the rights to catch more fish. Because of leasing the cap “does not really prevent consolidation at all” said Mary Hudson a manager at a Maine cooperative that makes permits available to independent fishermen at discount prices. “Private equity backing can come in set [leasing] prices and still buy it all.” Instead of fishing some small fishermen have taken to leasing out their rights she added: “They just don’t have the capital to compete.”

The news organizations’ analysis could not determine how much quota — the industry term for the number of pounds of fish someone is allowed to catch — Blue Harvest is leasing or from whom. That’s because groundfish permits belonging to individual fishermen organizations and large corporations are generally pooled and managed in groups known as sectors. The sectors act as a black box — fish quotas can be seen flowing in and out but who exactly is leasing them is hidden. NOAA tracks and publishes the weight of fish leased between sectors but those transactions do not identify the specific lessor or lessee. Even the U.S. government doesn’t track that information.

“It’s not legally traceable” Demarest said. “The government can’t get involved in what happens within sectors.”

In Blue Harvest’s case most of the company’s permits are held in two sectors that have leased the rights to catch more than 14 million pounds of groundfish since 2018. But there are other permit owners in those sectors as well. “This sector acquires quota from just about every sector out there” said Hank Soule who manages both sectors where Blue Harvest operates. He declined to say which owners within the sector were leasing the most quota.

Blue Harvest boats “are the ones that are fishing day and night” said John Pappalardo a member of NOAA’s regional council. “Nobody else is fishing at the level they are. Obviously they are going to be the ones setting the price and moving the market.” The Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen’s Alliance a cooperative headed by Pappalardo originally opposed catch shares fearing the system would gut the local industry. But when he realized that the new system was inevitable he voted to adopt it. Today he’s stoic about the entry of private equity into the fishing industry. “If not them then who?” he said. “I don’t think you’re going to see a lot of independent vessels or communities get into the fishery again.”

Since Leeman doesn’t own permits he isn’t eligible to lease them himself — that’s a perk afforded only to permit holders. But he ends up paying for it anyway. Blue Harvest passes the cost of leasing permits on to its fishermen the same way it does for fuel fishing gear or vessel maintenance the manager and workers said. In November 2021 a settlement sheet shows Blue Harvest deducted a $3329.90 leasing charge from the pay for Leeman and his crew.

There’s a long history of foreign fishing in U.S. waters. In the 1970s trawlers from Russia and elsewhere depleted East Coast fish populations spurring a 1976 federal law pushing foreign fleets at least 200 miles offshore. In 1998 a cap was added limiting a foreign entity to owning 25% of a U.S. fishing vessel.

In recent years foreign companies have reentered U.S. fishing grounds through a different route: investing in local operations. They include Canada-based Cooke Seafood which recently acquired a one-fourth interest in scallop fleets in New Bedford and North Carolina and Profand a Spanish company that did the same with Seafreeze Ltd. the largest squid and mackerel operation on the East Coast. According to Undercurrent News Profand’s majority shareholder is Enrique García Chillón who is known in his home country as “el emperador del pulpo” or the emperor of octopus.

Federal enforcement of the 25% cap largely relies on companies’ own assurances that they are in compliance. The Coast Guard lacks the resources to vet businesses’ paperwork a former official said and is required by law to “minimize the administrative burden” on owners and operators of vessels.

“There should be more transparency in ownership. But there isn’t. It’s basically an honor system” said Charlie Papavizas a Washington D.C. attorney specializing in maritime law. “As a result there is a big gray area in what is permissible.”

In a 2015 press release Bregal Partners acknowledged that “as an arm of German-Dutch Brenninkmeijer Group” it was limited by law to “a 25 percent ownership in any quota-holding fishing company.” Ownership forms for four of Blue Harvest’s vessels from 2018 and 2019 — submitted to NOAA and obtained through a public records request — listed four owners for each of the boats. One was Jeff Davis who served as Blue Harvest’s CEO before retiring from the company in 2018. Another was Chris Lischewski who was then chief executive of Bumble Bee Seafoods known for its canned tuna. The others were Mark Thierfelder a lawyer who has represented Bregal Partners and Michael Arougheti chief executive of a finance company that has advised Bregal on acquisitions in the fishing industry.

Davis and Thierfelder could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Arougheti declined to comment. Lischewski stepped down as CEO of Bumble Bee after he was indicted for conspiring to fix canned tuna prices. He was found guilty in 2019 and sentenced to 40 months in prison. NOAA lacks the regulatory authority to require investors to disclose the percentage of their stake in a vessel or permit said Ted Hawes chief of NOAA’s regional permitting office.

Blue Harvest said in a statement that the Coast Guard had approved its “capital and ownership structure” in advance and that the company has “continued to submit all required notices and reporting materials” to regulatory authorities. “At no time has Blue Harvest been owned 100% by Bregal” it added.

On May 11 more than 160 scallop fishermen business owners marine scientists attorneys and vessel owners crowded into the New Bedford Whaling Museum for a rowdy meeting. Attendance was especially high because the seas were stormy and many fishermen stayed in port. To loud applause more than a dozen people denounced a proposal backed by Blue Harvest and other large companies that independent local fishermen fear would enable private equity to storm their last stronghold — scallops.

Leasing scallop permits is currently prohibited but the proposal would allow it. The biggest companies in the market which are running up against a cap on permit ownership are advocating for the change.

Current scallop regulations allow one permit per boat up to a total of 17 vessels. One local company Eastern Fisheries has reached the limit according to a letter it sent to NOAA in 2021. In its own letter Blue Harvest listed 15 scallop vessels.

“This is going to hurt the fishermen and the local economy” said Tyler Miranda a third-generation fisherman from New Bedford and captain of two scallop vessels who is leading the opposition. “The only people to benefit are the owners of the largest companies. How much do the biggest owners need to take out of our wages and bring into theirs? How much is enough?”

One of the few speakers in favor of the proposal was George LaPointe a policy consultant to Blue Harvest and a former commissioner of Maine’s Department of Marine Resources. “We believe that we can improve flexibility” said LaPointe who was there to represent large scallopers including Blue Harvest. As he returned to his seat many fishermen booed.

New Bedford fishermen had a strong union until the mid-1980s when the union was broken in the heat of a strike. Now with private equity setting its sights on scallops as well as groundfish talk of a union is beginning to stir again.

Leeman said he would welcome a union to fight for fair pay. On his own he spends his days on land making calls to check how the rate that Blue Harvest paid compares to the market price.

Last year after a 10-day fishing trip he took a look at his settlement sheet and burst into the management office demanding fair pay for him and his crew. “I said ‘Until we get this straight I’m not leaving the dock’” he recalled.

And with the weight of a multibillion-dollar industry resting on the labor of a few hundred New Bedford fishermen the company relented and paid him what he said was the market rate. “If I didn’t say anything they’d still be paying us half of what that fish was worth.”

About the data: How we tracked Blue Harvest’s fishing permits

After hearing from local fishermen that Blue Harvest Fisheries is dominating New Bedford’s fishing industry we set out to document how much of the total allowable catch the company is pulling in.

A first step was to find out how many permits the company owns. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provided a database breaking down the permit holdings in the groundfish industry for the 2022 fishing year. Each permit has a unique identification number and represents a certain percentage of the total allowable catch of a species of groundfish. Blue Harvest holds permits in the names of limited liability companies. Most of these companies have “BHF” as part of their corporate name and we confirmed that they were linked to Blue Harvest through their corporate filings which list Blue Harvest’s executives. Our analysis was limited to permits that could be clearly linked to Blue Harvest through these records. It is possible that Blue Harvest holds additional permits.

We measured Blue Harvest’s share of permits as a percentage of the total quota by weight. When aggregating across different kinds of groundfish these percentages were averaged consistent with how NOAA calculates its 15.5% cap. We found that Blue Harvest owns permits for 12% of groundfish quota — the industry’s term for the total pounds a permit-holder is allowed to catch — in the current fishing year.

In addition to owning permits outright companies can also lease permits. However company-level lease agreements are not made public. Instead NOAA posts leasing transactions at a more summary level.

Permits are managed in groups of permit holders known as “sectors.” If one permit holder leases to another in its own sector NOAA does not publish the transaction. If a holder leases to a party in another sector that transaction is recorded publicly but only the sectors are identified not the specific lessor or lessee.

Most of Blue Harvest’s permits are kept in two of the 18 sectors. NOAA’s leasing records through May of this year show that more than 14 million pounds’ worth of fishing quota have flowed from other sectors into those two sectors since 2018.Interviews with individual fishermen and others in the industry indicate that Blue Harvest has a significant leasing operation; however lack of precise data from NOAA makes it impossible to determine the exact extent of the company’s leasing.

Local artisanal fishers in Thailand's Chana district ride a boat amid a storm to conduct fishing activities. A portion of Chana is being developed as an energy industry complex and a deep-water seaport.

MANILA Philippines — For 57-year-old Tom Buitizon the Verde Island Passage is the lifeblood of small fisherfolk like him and of millions living in southern Luzon.

The rich waters support their livelihoods and provide food for their families.

A fisherman for over 25 years Buitizon experienced the joy of catching as many as 20 kilos of fish many years ago and the struggle of people living on VIP’s shores who hardly find food there these days.

He said a lot has changed—for the worse—since Batangas City became the site of various industries including fossil gas.

“At present I can catch only two to three kilos. Sometimes I’m not keen to venture out to fish because the exhaustion and high cost of gasoline are not worth it” said Buitizon who is from San Juan town. He engages in fishing to supplement his income as a local government employee.

Buitizon is worried that the rapid expansion of fossil gas will make pressures in the marine corridor—which is dubbed as the “Amazon of the Ocean”—worse.

Verde Island Passage is home to 60% of all known shore fish species in the world. It is also the site of eight planned gas power plants and seven LNG terminals.

VIP is only one of the marine frontiers in Southeast Asia threatened by gas plans in the region. According to Quezon City-based think tank Center for Energy Ecology and Development (CEED) Southeast Asia is swiftly turning from coal’s last bastion to Asia’s fossil gas hub.

In a report released last month CEED said a massive 138 GW of new gas-fired power plants and 118 liquefied natural gas terminals are being proposed or already being built in the region. Leading the gas expansion in Southeast Asia are Indonesia the Philippines Thailand and Vietnam—countries that have vast renewable energy potential.

Rich marine biodiversity at risk

Center for Energy Ecology and Development A researcher assesses coral reefs in the waters of Batangas City Philippines.

The Verde Island Passage lies at the heart of the Coral Triangle a reef network that includes the waters of Indonesia the Philippines Malaysia Papua New Guinea the Solomon Islands and East Timor.

While the Coral Triangle occupies just 1.5% of the world’s total ocean area it represents 30% of the coral reefs on the planet.

But years of industrial development caused serious damage to VIP’s marine ecology. Climate change illegal fishing and unsustainable tourism also pose threats to the marine corridor.

A water quality analysis conducted by CEED found “very high” concentrations of key pollutants and heavy metals such as phosphates chromium copper and lead along the coasts of Barangays Ilijan and Dela Paz in Batangas City. A separate CEED study showed the coral cover along the reef fronting the heavily-industrialized areas in Ilijan and Dela Paz was “very low”.

It also found that while fish biodiversity and fish abundance were low in the waters next to the project sites compared to the rest of the Verde Island Passage fish biomass remained high.

CEED pointed out that sea water intake and discharge from gas plants and terminals may affect water temperature forcing fish to seek cooler water elsewhere. It added that the increase in shipping activities due to the transportation of LNG will lead to water pollution sedimentation that can destroy coral reefs and damage to smaller seacrafts.

If the Verde Island Passage is further damaged by the planned increase in LNG infrastructures the effects of the destruction may be far-reaching.

“The concept is that biodiversity regions are interconnected with one another and all organisms in the other regions came from [the Verde Island Passage]” said Jayvee Saco assistant professor from Batangas State University and head of the VIP Center for Oceanographic Research and Aquatic Life Sciences.

“So it could be an escalating effect” he warned although acknowledging that a study to identify how the population in VIP is connected to population in other regions still needs to be done.

Buitizon the fisherman fears that the various kinds of fish in VIP will vanish if the massive development of fossil gas in the area pushes through and that the next generation will only know about them through books.

“We are not fighting the government. We just want them to understand our concerns and study the effects of this LNG expansion because VIP is home to different kinds of marine species. If this is destroyed not only the lives of Batangas residents will be miserable but also those living in other provinces” he said.

Last month groups led by Bukluran ng Mangingisda ng Batangas urged the environment department to declare the waters of VIP surrounding the project sites of San Miguel Corp. Linseed-AF&P and existing gas plants as “non-attainment areas” where no new sources of exceeded pollutants should be allowed to be established.

The Philippine energy department told Philstar.com that the issuance of environmental compliance certificate signifies that a project will not cause significant negative impact and that it conducts inspections and investigations of proposed gas facilities.

Damage to mangroves in Island of God

Bali Provincial Forestry and Environment President Joko Widodo visited Ngurah Rai Grand Forest Park in Bali in late 2021. This mangrove forest is the venue for the G20 Presidency and is designated as the location for the construction of a 3-hectare LNG Terminal in Sidakarya Village Denpasar.

On the Indonesian island of Bali local communities are also resisting the construction of a planned LNG terminal. The project which will be built in a mangrove forest in Denpasar City aims to help the government reach its target of accelerating the use of gas.

According to CEED aggressive LNG terminal buildout can be observed in LNG exporting nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

Ida Bagus Setiawan who heads the energy and mineral resources division of the Bali Province Manpower and Energy and Mineral Resources Office said the LNG project will provide the top tourist destination with reliable electricity so it will no longer depend on energy sources outside the island.

But locals fear that the planned LNG terminal in Ngurah Rai Forest Park in Sidakarya Village will clear mangroves in the area. Ngurah Rai Forest Park is Bali’s widest mangrove ecosystem that is close to the business and tourism areas.

The dredging of sand for the sea lane is also seen to damage mangroves and other coastal ecosystems. Mangroves provide a number of critical ecosystem services such as serving as a breeding ground for marine species sequestering carbon dioxide and reducing the risks of tsunamis.

A pipe for gas distribution will pass through the mangrove area but the proponent PT Dewata Energi Bersih said it will not disturb the mangrove roots. Communities are also concerned that the proposed jetty port for LNG carriers will damage the coral reefs in the area. Bali is part of the Coral Triangle.

“[The LNG terminal] in Bali must be considered again whether there is the potential for major damage if it continues to be cultivated” said natural resources law observer Ahmad Redi.

IGW Samsi Gunarta head of Bali Provincial Transportation Service said dredging can only be carried out if there is a permit as well as a risk-based analysis process which refers to the results of the environmental impact analysis.

“The permit will not be issued if the requirements in the environmental document cannot be confirmed and the project can be terminated if this is not fulfilled” he said.

Lack of public hearing study

Napat Wesshasartar Residents of Chana district collect clams for their subsistence.

Chana a coastal town in Songkhla province in southern Thailand is known for its marine ecosystem with a majority of its residents relying on fisheries as their main livelihood. A portion of Chana is being developed as an energy industry complex and a deep-water seaport.

At present southern Thailand is the only region in the country excluding the Bangkok Metropolitan area where the demand for electricity surpasses production capacity. To power the gigantic industrial zone the government is planning to build an energy hub. One of the main infrastructures there is the LNG power plant.

Locals and activists are protesting the project due to the lack of public hearing with residents whose lives and livelihoods will be affected by the industrial development. Constructing the LNG terminal will require the dredging of the seafloor to accommodate massive LNG carriers.

“It’s not about the energy; it’s about conducting a proper public hearing. They have never asked the local people at all or if they did they will find a way to obstruct them” said Supat Hasiwannakit a medical doctor and one of the activist leaders.

Protests in Chana and Bangkok have led to the arrests of some activists.

The environmental impact assessment conducted by the government showed scant details on how the project could affect Chana’s rich waters. Kua Rittibon a lecturer with Prince Songkla University who will conduct a “people's version” of EIA said that sediments excavated by dredging could be carried by the current and affect coral reefs.

In Vietnam which leads the region’s planned gas expansion there are also limited studies on the impacts of gas projects on marine biodiversity and coastal communities. Vietnam has 56.3 GW of fossil gas projects in pre-construction and construction stages.

The lack of understanding about the effects of energy projects could be attributed to the country’s focus on the conservation of ecosystems on land and on lack of public attention to studies about marine issues.

“There is limited research on gas power projects: how will the coastal area be affected whether the gas power plant will increase the temperature in that area or not. If the temperature increases how will aquatic species be affected how does the system use cooling water to discharge waste etc.” said Nguyen Manh Ha director of the Center for Nature Conservation and Development.

While companies in Vietnam have an obligation to disclose their environmental impact assessments not all firms fully comply with this rule.

“At present the environmental impact assessment and management of new electric energy projects in Vietnam are completely absent” Nguyen said.

Fossil future?

Philstar.com/Gaea Katreena Cabico Fishers and community groups hold a boat parade in protest of plans to expand the use of fossil gas and liquefied natural gas in Batangas province on April 22 2022.

Many of the LNG projects in emerging Asia are “highly unrealistic” due to country-level and financial market constraints said Sam Reynolds energy finance analyst of US-based think tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

“This is overpromising and under-delivering on a regional scale” he said.

But as Southeast Asian countries scale up investment in fossil gas infrastructure measures must be put in place to mitigate the impacts of the projects’ life cycle on the marine environment and the communities.

For Miguel Azcuna a scientist studying the Verde Island Passage recognition from international institutions such as the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) can help slow down the “very fast” industrial development in the area.

Increasing the number of marine protected areas in the marine life-rich body of water is also another strategy to mitigate the adverse impacts of industrialization added Azcuna an assistant professor from Batangas State University. VIP has 36 MPAs 24 of which are in Batangas.

In 2017 the Verde Island Passage Marine Protected Area Network and Law Enforcement Network was created. The five provinces that surround VIP—Batangas Occidental Mindoro Oriental Mindoro Marinduque and Romblon—and national government agencies signed an agreement to protect and conserve the marine corridor.

Present during the signing of the agreement was a representative from Lopez-led power firm First Gen Corp. which built four gas-fired power plants in the area and is currently constructing a floating LNG terminal there.

Muhammad Zainuri a marine biology expert at Indonesia’s Diponegro University suggested that companies invest in remediation systems to treat wastewater.

“We need the sea to stay blue to produce oxygen. Waste is accumulative in nature so it keeps increasing every year. If it's not handled it's a problem” he said.

Experts across the region also emphasized the need for proper assessment of the impacts of projects. Ngo Thi To Nhien executive director of Vietnam Initiative for Energy Transition also said that in Vietnam’s cases where the development of LNG is new it is necessary that the country learns from the experience of developed nations.

She also stressed that regulations must be reviewed and synchronized to ensure the compliance with actual socio-environmental action plans.

“For project investors regulations need to include adequate and timely preparation of social and environmental resources time to implement impact mitigation measures and measures to prevent or respond to adverse events” Ngo said.

“Government needs to specify inspection or monitoring regulations including a separate and specific report form for LNG to monitor or handle environmental and social issues on land and sea.”

A release from Dalton Police reveals that the suspect Wendell Patton isn't just accused of trying to set a Wells Fargo office on fire.

The release says he approached a parked 2019 Toyota Tundra pickup on Elk Street and started throwing lit matches into its grill. The truck eventually burned and was a total loss.

The release says Patten then went to the Old Freight Depot on South Depot Street and tamper with the power box outside which knocked the power out.

After that the release says he went to Wells Fargo and tampered with another breaker box. There police say Patton then ""walked around the front of the building and threw a heavy ashtray through the glass door and entered the lobby where he attempted to start another fire.""

There was only minor damage.

Dalton Police say from there Patten went to the area of Cherokee Alley and opened two valves on a gas line. That's where police stopped him and arrested him.

Patton was charged with three counts of arson one count of burglary in the 2nd degree two counts of criminal damage to property and three counts of interference with public utilities.



EARLIER:

The Dalton Police Department is investigating after they say a man tried to set a Wells Fargo on fire on Sunday.

Officials say 34-year-old Wendell Patton Jr. suffered from a mental health crisis outside the Wells Fargo in downtown Dalton.

According to police Patton Jr. broke the glass doors at the front of the building and then tried to ignite a fire in the lobby of the bank but was unsuccessful.



Officials say there did not appear to be any motive or attempt to steal anything from the bank.

After leaving the Wells Fargo police say the suspect then attempted to set a truck on fire. Officials also say he went on to tamper with a power meter at another business.

Patton Jr. has been charged with three counts of arson three counts of interference with utilities one count of 2nd degree burglary and two counts of criminal damage to property.

He is being held at the Whitfield County Jail. The investigation is ongoing.

Jones,"The prolific character actor passed away Saturday at age 94.

Time to say goodbye to L.Q. Jones a cult-favorite mainstay of TV and movie westerns and frequent collaborator with Sam Peckinpah. The Beaumont Texas native passed away Saturday at his home in the Hollywood Hills. He was 94.

Born Justus Ellis McQueen Jr. he professionally rechristened himself after playing a character named L.Q. Jones in his first feature film Raoul Walsh’s Battle Cry (1955). Under that name he appeared in dozens of movies television series and made-for-TV films during a career that spanned six decades.

During the Golden Age of TV Westerns Jones guested on Cheyenne Annie Oakley Black Saddle Wagon Train Tales of Wells Fargo Laramie Rawhide and several others usually in villainous roles. “I've done 25 30 50 different types of heavies” he once told an interviewer adding “It’s really hard to say what they're looking for when they pick me. A lot of times your heavy is not that well presented in the script. Most times he's too one-sided. So we look for things to bring to being a heavy: a certain softness; a vulnerability that makes him human; a quiet moment when he's a screamer most of the time; a look; the way he dresses; the way he walks into a room. There are many things that contribute to why a casting director will choose me over someone else… or someone else over me.”

Jones frequently co-starred in movies directed by Sam Peckinpah including Ride the High Country Major Dundee The Battle of Cable Hogue and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. He made an especially vivid impression in Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch as a grubby bounty hunter partnered with an equally dodgy Strother Martin.

Among the other films on Jones’ resume: Flaming Star (1960) Cimarron (1960) Apache Rifles (1964) Nevada Smith (1966) Hang ‘Em High (1968) The Hunting Party (1971) Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) The Patriot (1998) and The Mask of Zorro (1998).

Jones played continuing roles on two television series — Andy Belden in The Virginian and Sheriff Lew Wallace in The Yellow Rose — and in 1975 wrote and directed A Boy and His Dog a darkly comical sci-fi thriller about a teen-ager (Don Johnson) and his telepathic canine companion (voiced by Jason Robards) struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic Southwest.

Martin Scorsese cast Jones for a key scene opposite Robert De Niro in Casino (1995) — and reportedly asked him to adjust his dialogue so his character would sound more authentically Western.

The wider Western region has welcomed a smooth transition to Digital transmission from analogue television services last Sunday.

Through a mix of terrestrial and satellite technologies Walesi is expanding broadcast coverage across the nation for Fijians who otherwise could not access free-to-air television before.

Residents living along Deuba to Natadola Matawalu Lautoka to Natovi and Tailevu can now expect better television sound and picture quality fewer signal interferences and a more comprehensive selection of free-to-air channels.

Viewers can even record their favourite programs or shows on a compatible USB drive for later enjoyment.

All of these have been made possible after the successful switch to digital television.

Another advantage of the digital platform apart from the great picture and sound quality is that it remains connected even during inclement weather allowing Fijians to continue to get updates.

Chief Executive Sanjay Maharaj says villages and communities in primarily rural and remote areas deserve the same reliable and uninterrupted information as those in urban areas.

Maharaj says Walesi will continue to provide free Set-Top Boxes to every household that has a combined annual income of up to $30000 and UHF Antennas at a subsidised cost.

To date Walesi has distributed 217358 set-top boxes

Walesi is a 100% Fijian-owned Company and its shares are 100% held by the Fijian Government.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9iYW5raW5nLzIwMjIvMDcvMDkvMjE5NDIwMi9lYXN0d2VzdHMta29tby1leWVkLWNvbnRlbmRlci1kaWdpdGFsLWJhbmtpbmfSAW9odHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFua2luZy8yMDIyLzA3LzA5LzIxOTQyMDIvZWFzdHdlc3RzLWtvbW8tZXllZC1jb250ZW5kZXItZGlnaXRhbC1iYW5raW5nL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EastWest’s Komo eyed a ‘contender’ in digital banking,"EastWest’s Komo eyed a ‘contender’ in digital banking

MANILA Philippines — As the pandemic fast-tracked to the adoption of digital payments the Philippines already saw the highest number of new users of e-cash or mobile payment apps across Asia and the Pacific region in October 2021.

Unsurprisingly the digital shift has changed the game for the local banking scene.

EastWest’s Komo is sought as a likely contender in the Philippine digital banking scene touting itself as the first exclusively digital banking service offered by a local bank.

Launched in May 2020 Komo is a digital banking service product of East West Rural Bank Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of East West Banking Corp.

“Komo was launched to equip our customers with services that not only helps them meet their needs but also goes beyond and empowers customers to take control of their money” said Isabelle Yap business head of Komo.

At present Komo offers free fund transfers easy bills payment and a free Visa debit card. Komo account holders can also withdraw their money with no charge from ATM machines nationwide.

“In this new normal there’s an even greater emphasis on convenience and being able to perform financial transactions anytime and anywhere” Yap said.

Komo also said it does not require any minimum or maintaining balances. It also provides account holders with 2.5% interest per year – one of the highest interest rates from Philippine banks today.

“Since everything is done digitally with no need for branches we return the savings from lower overhead cost to customers in the form of high interest rates on their savings account” Komo wrote on its website.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) estimated around 40.7 million adult Filipinos were banked raising the country’s financial inclusion to 53% from 29% in 2019.

In its bid for digital transformation the BSP targets 70% of adult Filipinos to own bank accounts by 2023. — Intern Jan Cuyco",,,,,,

Families of five people shot dead in Belfast 50 years ago have vowed never to give up their quest for truth.

Relatives bereaved by shootings involving the Army in Springhill in July 1972 marched through the area on Saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of their loved ones' deaths.

The victims included a Catholic priest and three teenagers.

At a wreath laying ceremony following the march the brother of a 13-year-old girl killed in the shootings criticised the UK Government's contentious draft legislation that would introduce a form of amnesty for perpetrators of Troubles crimes.

The Bill tabled by the Government would also end inquests and civil proceedings related to the conflict.

A fresh inquest into the Springhill killings is currently anticipated to be heard next year.

Harry Gargan's sister Margaret 13 was one of the five Springhill victims.

The other four were cleric Father Noel Fitzpatrick 40 John Dougal 17 Patrick Butler 39 and David McCafferty 15.

Mr Gargan told the 50th anniversary commemoration the planned legislation was ""unlawful and disgraceful"".

""It is really being implemented to cover the past played by previous British establishments both Tory and Labour in our horrific conflict"" he said.

""This Bill will inflict unending trauma and grief on victims' families.

""50 years or 100 years - our families are never giving up.""

Also addressing Saturday's event was Sinn Fein north Belfast MP John Finucane.

""Make no mistake about what this legislation is at its heart - it is a continuation of their (the British) policy to thwart frustrate and deny families the ability to hold them to account"" he said.

""It is a fundamental attack on the rule of law and an unprecedented and blatant attempt to retain total control of the legacy process.

""These actions are unilateral deliberately cruel and show that the British government care not for the lives of our loved ones nor do they care about the rule of law truth or justice.

""And that they couch this legislation in the language of reconciliation is truly shameful.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

After 46 years in the advertising and public relations business Williams officially retired July 1 from Williams/Crawford & Associates. Kevin Crawford Williams’ business partner for many years now owns and operates the agency.

Williams’ humility is admirable but folks who know him are likely to say Williams’ success is more tied to hard work building relationships and earning trust. And maybe being just a little “crazy.”

Folks like Kenny King.

“Well first of all Fred is a very smart guy. Don’t let him tell you he isn’t. And second of all he just had a way of knowing how my customers thought and what they would want. He interacted with the customers and he just had a knack. He had this sense of knowing people and how they were thinking and what they were wanting” King said.

And folks like Sam Fiori.

“I think you make your luck first of all. And Fred made that. His biggest skill is the ability to truly earn the trust of people in what he says and what he does. He has this way to draw people into his way of thinking” Fiori said.

King worked his way up from assistant KFC store manager to being an owner of Fort Smith-based KMAC Enterprises with the support of the late Ken McGruder one of the nation’s largest KFC and Taco Bell franchises. In the franchise’s early days the Taco Bell corporate folks encouraged franchise owners to hire ad agencies to develop local marketing. McGruder and King were to hear from big ad agencies in Little Rock and Memphis for the work. They also decided to invite Williams then a small ad agency with just a few clients and none of them in the fast-food business to also make a presentation.

‘OFF THE WALL’

King had briefly met Williams while they were volunteers at the Fort Smith United Way raft race – a fundraising event held on the Arkansas River near downtown Fort Smith before insurance companies decided cardboard boats on a navigable waterway probably wasn’t something they wanted to cover.

“The Little Rock guys and those from Memphis they did the usual thing the presentation we expected. But Fred was kind of off the wall to put it mildly. He was very very different from those other agencies” King said.

What was William’s pitch?

“I told them I didn’t know the first damn thing about the fast-food business but that I knew the people. … These stores are in a lot of these small towns and they are my people. I know how they think. And I can sell them just about anything” Williams said when asked about his “off the wall” pitch.

It worked.

“Ken and I decided you know we thought he may just be crazy enough to pull this off. So after some deliberation we decided to go with Fred. Fred continued to be off the wall which was behind his success. He didn’t just do the same old same old” King said.

Williams would work in a KFC learning to fry chicken. He worked in a Taco Bell.

“He made a real mess with some of those first tacos” King joked. “But he would get to know the business and he was a quick learner. He got to know the business from the ground up.”

Fiori who along with other partners would buy the franchise from McGruder and King began working more with Williams on marketing as the franchise grew from about two dozen stores to hundreds. He said Williams toured the stores talked to managers and customers “and really became an extension of the company.” Fiori also said Williams would become a sounding board for decisions not just related to marketing.

“We could sometimes talk about other business and he was not a ‘yes’ man. He’d think about it and come back and tell you what he really thought” Fiori said.

It worked. Williams’ ad agency grew with KMAC. His one-man marketing firm would grow into an agency with more than 20 employees and $22 million in annual billings.

“A lot of people have learned a lot of things from Fred Williams. He has definitely left his mark on the Van Buren and Fort Smith area” King said.

‘OASIS OF CREATIVITY’

KMAC wasn’t Williams’ only customer. His first client in 1982 was First National Bank of Green Forest – now Anstaff Bank. It’s a client he maintained through his retirement. Other clients included First National Bank of Fort Smith the Van Buren Advertising & Promotion Commission Citizens Bank and Trust in Van Buren and the North American division of Mercedes Benz.

“The Germans loved me. They said I was an ‘oasis of creativity in a desert of mediocrity.’ Their words” Williams said.

“But the biggest reward for me was seeing that what we did helped out clients grow” he said.

“And another reward what I’m also proud of was all the community work we did through all those years. Sometimes I’d get criticized for doing too much free work for a lot of them (community groups/nonprofits) but it’s what I wanted to do. … Remember working with the United Way is how I met Kenny and that’s how I got in the Taco Bell business.”

The Van Buren Advertising and Promotion Commission is one of Williams’ clients he worked with beyond contractual terms. He began working with the commission in 1989.

“Fred’s vast knowledge of all things Van Buren and Crawford County made him a natural for the job. Fred helped develop our first tourism brochures print ads and logo. Over the years Fred has been an excellent value for the A&P’s promotional efforts by going above and beyond the normal ad agency duties” said A&P Executive Director Maryl Purvis. “Fred has been instrumental in developing history-related marketing pieces because of his passion for Van Buren and Crawford County history. I know I speak for the members of the A&P Commission that even though he is retired and enjoying life on the farm we will still value his marketing advice.”

BANK MOVE

In the early 2000s a young Sam T. Sicard was dissatisfied with the public image and marketing of the First National Bank of Fort Smith and its parent company First Bank Corp. which now has around $3 billion in assets. Sicard’s father Sam M. Sicard was then head of the bank. The younger Sicard knew he needed someone experienced and respected in the advertising and marketing business to help convince others in the bank to make a change.

“So I just cold-called him. … I heard just really good things about him and his company. We talked for probably two hours you know just hit it off” said Sicard who became president and CEO of the bank after his father’s untimely death in 2011.

Working with Williams to meet other company leaders within the First Bank Corp. umbrella Sicard and Williams worked to change the corporate marketing direction. Sicard said Williams was “masterful” in his ability “to facilitate conversation and to open dialogue” and bring everyone together with a new marketing plan.

“He provided us a lot of guidance and got us out of our (marketing) comfort zone to do things which I loved. He was able to command the respect of the room which I couldn’t do at a young age. He helped do what I had hoped to be done” Sicard explained.

FAMILY AND FARM

Williams who will be 70 in October graduated with a bachelor’s degree in communications from the University of Central Arkansas. He worked for a Fort Smith-based public relations agency in Fort Smith before deciding in 1982 – amid a U.S. recession – to open an advertising and marketing firm.

He is also anchored to the area with a large farm operation in Van Buren he operates with his wife Shirley Campbell Williams. His family has been in the farm business since the 1880s. In addition to raising certified Angus cattle they also have horses. He’s proud of his business success but lights up when talking about his family and the farm.

Fred and Shirley have three daughters. Katie is married to Pete Rusin and they live in Fort Smith with daughters Adriana Karlee and Presley. Olivia is married to A.J. Underdorfer and they live in Miami with children Ava Adam and Audrey. Elizabeth is married to Josh Thurow and they live in McKinney Texas with their daughter Sloane. Fred and Shirley’s son Jackson is deceased.

“She (Shirley) will put me to work on the farm but I’m not sure how much quality work she’ll get out of me” Williams said with his usual self-deprecating humor.

Williams said a key part of his “luck” and career success was Shirley who he met on a blind date. He said she managed the home and Van Buren farm the many days and weeks he traveled to Taco Bell and KFC stores and met with other clients around the country.

“All those years I was with the agency she worked the farm. She kept the farm going. And she was always there with the kids” Williams said.

Williams said the farm and family helped keep him grounded and was often a good place to ponder client issues.

“And I was able to do it all as a country boy a farm boy from Crawford County. … I’d have clients call me while I was brush hogging saying ‘I’ve got something I want you to think about.’ And I could give it some good thinking time out there on a tractor.”

He won’t fully retire from the community however. Williams is a member of the U.S. Marshals Museum Board of Directors the advisory board for the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education the Regional Council of the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce and is involved with the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith Family Enterprise Center.

“I’ve had one heck of a time. I’ve eaten at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got to travel and I’ve seen some amazing places … and I’ve been really lucky to work with a lot of really fine people. It’s just time for something different.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rZW5lcmd5dG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvY3J1ZGUtb2lsLXJlYm91bmRlZC1vbi1mcmlkYXktd2lsbC10aGUtZ2FpbnMtY29udGludWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crude oil rebounded on Friday—will the gains continue?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vY2RhcHJlc3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9qdWwvMDkvcm9ib3RzLXdvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robots at work,"Dozens of people filtered through North Idaho College’s CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machine Technology Lab at Parker Technical Education Center on Thursday as regional machining and automation representatives demonstrated how robots can relieve humans of the most mundane tasks.

Graham Williams of Vectis Automation from Loveland Colo. operated an automated welding machine on an iPad. He explained the machine is capable of completing simple welds allowing skilled workers to focus on finer and more complex welding.

“We want the skilled welders to do the real skilled work and we want the robot to do the boring stuff” Williams said. “All the things that make people want to quit the robots can do. Skilled employees can do the fun stuff.”

The event also featured a machine that enables shops to combine up to three separate production processes in a single machine and another that can increase production by the hundred-fold using automation.

Troy Ojalehto of Rapid Design Solutions LLC showed a robot system with a moveable gripper and arm that took raw material from a loading zone into a Mini Mill CNC machine to be formed then delivered to a storage area before its next step in a manufacturing process. The robot system can be programmed to run continuously for up to 16 hours eliminating the need for a person to manually load the mill.

“Traditionally you’d have an operator doing this like every three minutes which is not a real good use of their time so having a robot do that instead is really a key element to efficiency” Ojalehto said.

Rapid Design Solutions recently relocated from Seattle to Spirit Lake. Ojalehto said the NIC event not only introduced the new-to-town company to local industry folks but also helped them get the lay of the land in machining and manufacturing in the Inland Northwest.

“It’s really nice to be able to meet up with local potential customers in the area and to get a feel for the work people are doing around here see how our product fits into a niche market and how to better serve the area” Ojalehto said. “Honestly it’s also really nice to see the school and the relationship between the school and local industry and to know that we can look at the people coming out of these programs as potential employees.”

George Cobb with King Machine Inc. in Bozeman Mont. helped NIC machine technology associate professor Kurt Kimberling organize the event. Cobb said North Idaho western Montana and eastern Washington are becoming hot spots for manufacturing and events like NIC’s demo day are an important resource for local machine shops to keep up with technology.

“Most shops that work in this area aren’t really aware of this newer technology because they can’t leave the shop to go see it” Cobb said. “They’re too busy because they can’t find people to work for them with the skilled labor shortage. It’s kind of a circle.”

Cobb said the importance of machining and manufacturing is more integrated with daily life than most people realize. Almost every product is made using some type of machine whether it’s manufacturing a mold that makes a plastic cellphone case or producing the nuts and bolts that hold a car together.

And it’s events like the demo expo at NIC that open that world to the public said Boise-based Nicola Filicetti from VersaBuilt Robotics Inc.

“There’s the message out there that manufacturing in the U.S. is dead that you can’t afford to manufacture” Filicetti said. “But we’re still here. There is so much technology that affects everyone’s day-to-day and so much opportunity to be had. Places like NIC will allow us to explore that and to really keep that dream alive.”

It’s not unusual for a child to run up to a teacher in public excited. It is a little more unusual for the child to then show off a stock portfolio.

But it’s happened to Corey Camp and Jimmy Williams 45-year-old friends from their days at Central High School in Philadelphia. They run a free financial literacy summer camp for children as young as 5.

Their business Buy the Hood LLC began around 2015 as a way to teach adults about finances investing and the power of ownership. Many adults didn’t know the basics of such concepts as credit and property ownership topics rarely taught in school. Camp a special-education teacher at Mastery Charter School’s Pickett Campus in Germantown and Williams a Philadelphia real estate agent and investor realized children stood to benefit the most from learning and applying these lessons early.

“Imagine if the concepts were put in front of us at 5 years old and you could grow with them” Williams said.

So Williams and Camp started the Buy the Hood Ownership Camp seven years ago. Through games and relatable examples children learn about budgeting investing taxes and cryptocurrency and how banks work. They learn how to grow their money over time and about the Rule of 72 calculating how many years their money would take to double at a certain interest rate.

“What we wanted to do is create an army of financially stable financially literate young people” Camp said.

The camp used to be held at a Germantown day care center but it went virtual during the pandemic allowing children from across the country to attend. About 60 children including repeat campers are attending this year’s camp which began June 25 and runs for six consecutive Saturday mornings. Williams and Camp also plan to help start financial literacy camps in other cities.

tips from Buy the Hood's Mr. Corey and Mr. Jimmy: You should be an investor : “You can’t just put your money in a bank and expect it to work for you” Mr. Jimmy said.

: “You can’t just put your money in a bank and expect it to work for you” Mr. Jimmy said. Think like a bank . Make money off money you borrow.

. Make money off money you borrow. Build good money habits now. “Everything you do is a deposit for tomorrow” Mr. Corey said.

They have been recruiting campers through their networks and the vast majority of the children who attend are Black. Nationwide the typical white family has eight times the wealth of the typical Black family. Most families build wealth by owning property. But the home ownership rate among Black households (43%) has dropped in the last decade and is well behind the home ownership rate among white households (72%).

“Right now everyone is talking about wealth-building and generational wealth” said Nicole Purvy an entrepreneur and founder of the nonprofit Philly Real Estate Week Inc. which teaches adults about real estate investing and home ownership. “But what good is it if we don’t teach the next generation how to receive it?”

This year she partnered with Williams and Camp to create the new website and organize a fall gala to raise awareness and funds for the camp. Thanks to the partnership campers will get a modest stipend to invest.

Rochelle Wilson-Ellis’ 16-year-old son Kamren Ellis and 10-year-old daughter Keziah Ellis have attended the camp from Detroit since it went virtual. Wilson-Ellis is an account analyst for a hospital group who owns several businesses and is enrolled in Buy the Hood University for adults.

“The camp is so amazing because they’re teaching them on their level” she said. “When they would get out of class they’d be like ‘Ma I learned this.’”

Pop quiz: what is the rule of 72? The Rule of 72 tells you how many years it takes for your money to double. Divide 72 by the interest rate.

Strengthening financial foundations at camp

Although Camp and Williams try to make financial concepts digestible for children they tell campers they shouldn’t worry about understanding everything they hear. Some concepts will make sense when they’re older.

The camp founders talk about brands the children like. Disney World is real estate students learn. Someone owns their favorite sneaker brands video games movies and restaurants. A lot of children don’t realize they can own things Williams said.

“They know they’ve always had a landlord. Well you can also be the landlord” Williams said. “They may put themselves in the position to be the first owners in their families.”

The friends teach financial concepts through understandable examples. Imagine Camp told students he borrowed $10 from Williams to buy and eat a cheesesteak. “I don’t have any more money and I don’t have a cheesesteak” he said — and he still has to pay back Williams.

But he said imagine he used that same borrowed money to buy cases of water and sold each bottle for $1. “I used leverage I invested and I made more money” Camp said.

Pop quiz: what is Arbitrage? Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of price differences in two or more markets to make a profit. “Arbitrage is just a fancy French word that means buy low and sell high” Camp told students in a recent lesson.

In the first two weeks of the camp students asked lots of sharp questions. From a 6-year-old: Does money expire? Is dug-up pirate treasure worth more many years after it was buried?

From a 13-year-old: What would happen if I bought the entire stock market?

From a 7-year-old: How do I create a business?

From a 13-year-old: How do I manage my money so I’ll be ready for my first job?

From a 16-year-old: What are some ways to make money other than a job?

An actor learning money management and investing

Kalaiyah Vicks of North Philadelphia is a 10-year-old actor who has been in short films commercials and print advertisements and played background characters on the HBO show Mare of Easttown and the AMC show Dispatches from Elsewhere. At camp she’s learned to pay herself first by investing and saving some of the money she earns.

Kalaiyah also attended the camp when it was held in person a few years ago and her stock portfolio includes shares in companies she chose. She’s up 12%.

Her “big goal” she said is to be a singer and fashion designer. “I want to own a brand something like Louis Vuitton something that will sell very high like designer” she said.

Pop quiz: what is leverage? Leverage is the practice of taking out a loan and making money from it.

Her father Kahaun Vicks went to high school with the camp’s cofounders and is a member of a Black investing group with them. Vicks who works for the U.S. Department of Defense and his wife Kaleandra a real estate agent and owner of 3K Cleaning Service were eager to enroll Kalaiyah in the camp.

“Just trying to teach her early about stock investing and the power of ownership understanding money at a young age” her father said. “I really just wanted her to have [that education] because I didn’t really get it. ... I learned a lot of these concepts when I become an adult.”

Parents also can learn a lot from the camp he said.

‘Money’s my favorite thing’

Ten-year-old Keziah Ellis sews bonnets and has made at least $1000 in a year selling them online. From the camp she learned to track how much she spends on fabric and her profits.

“I like money. Money’s my favorite thing” she said. She’s always had trouble with math and thinking in terms of money helps her focus.

She recommends that children learn how to capitalize on their interests. For example say someone likes hamsters she said. They can try investing in hamsters.

Her brother Kamren has a tutoring business in which he teaches classic subjects and the basics of what he’s learned at the Buy the Hood camp. “So we can all get this money together” he said.

Pop quiz: What are the categories of making money in Robert Kiyosaki's ""cashflow quadrant"" model? Employees and people who are self-employed trade time for money. Business owners don’t have to be present to make money. Investors use money to make money.

‘Just an awesome experience’

Sixteen-year-old Milan Smalls and 9-year-old Nile Smalls of Mount Airy have attended the camp for a few years.

Nile has learned about stocks — “when to buy and when to not” — entrepreneurship and bitcoin. He plans to one day write and market a book.

When his big sister was in eighth grade she self-published a book on Amazon called It’s OK to Hear. “I have a hearing disability so I wrote about that and try to lift kids’ spirits” said Milan who plans to be an oral surgeon.

The camp taught her how to manage money and use a credit card now to build up credit she said. It’s “just an awesome experience” and more interactive than school she said.

Their father’s experience as a real estate investor and agent has helped guide Milan’s interests at this year’s camp. “I want to learn more about what my dad has been telling me over the years” she said.

Financial literacy “is definitely needed in the Black community” Mark Smalls said. “And this is one part of being financially literate and independent.”

“I wish there was something like this when I was growing up” he said. “When I was 20 21 I knew nothing about a stock.”

He said he tries to spread the word about the camp as much as possible “so the inner city can know it’s free and it’s something that you can learn and it’s something that we can get in now early.”

WYNN,Wynn Resorts,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYXZlbC1oZWFsdGgtY2hpbmEtYXNpYS0yM2FhOWJkODUwNTJiNTZkNDk3MmZmNjQzNTE1ZTEzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Las Vegas of Asia' tells casinos to grow beyond gambling,"BEIJING (AP) — Losing money due to COVID the American casino giants that helped make Macao the “Las Vegas of Asia” face a fresh challenge: The tiny Chinese territory wants them to help reduce its reliance on gambling by paying to build theme parks and other attractions.

The former Portuguese colony stayed out of business decisions for decades and now is aligning with official strategy on China’s mainland where foreign companies are required to help pay for the ruling Communist Party’s development ambitions profitable or not.

The licenses of MGM Resorts Las Vegas Sands Wynn Resorts and three Chinese rivals that invested billions of dollars in Macao expire in December. Rules released in early July say any that want to operate over the next 10-year period face an added requirement to invest in “non-gaming projects.”

Casinos face still more financial pressure after they were ordered to close this week along with most other businesses while Macao tries to control a renewed coronavirus outbreak. They already were operating under rules imposed in late June that limited the number of their employees to 10% of normal.

Financial analysts expect the Americans to get licenses but the government says bidding is open to anyone.

The territory of 700000 people crowded onto a 30-square-kilometer (12-square-mile) peninsula jutting into the South China Sea near Hong Kong is the biggest global center for gambling but is under pressure from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government to rely less on its dominant industry.

Beijing wants theme parks entertainment and conventions to attract more non-Chinese visitors. Even before tourist travel was shut down to fight COVID in 2020 the mainland was trying to limit the flow of gamblers across the fenced boundary that separates Macao from Guangdong province.

Macao is “dedicated to steering the composition of industries towards adequate diversification” said its economy secretary Lei Wai Nong at a May 31 government meeting.

An added complication for the Americans: Relations between Xi’s government and Washington are strained by disputes over trade technology human rights and other irritants. Other companies have been hit by retaliation for U.S. tariff hikes but Macao casinos haven’t been targeted.

“There is a high risk that at least one if not two may not get a new concession” said Ben Lee managing partner of IGamiX a gambling industry consulting firm in Macao. “Why would 50% of such a dominant industry in Macao be ceded to foreigners particularly Americans?”

Pressure for change comes as Macao faces growing competition for potential non-Chinese gamblers from casinos in Singapore Malaysia and Cambodia.

Financial analysts expect MGM Sands and Wynn to be approved for licenses due to the jobs and tax revenue they generate. Their casino hotels with thousands of employees soar above the narrow lanes of Macao’s centuries-old city center and Cotai a strip of land reclaimed from the sea.

Still the risk an established operator might fail to receive a license “should not be ignored” Fitch Ratings said in a June 16 report.

The Chinese competitors include SJM Holding part of the empire of the late Stanley Ho a competitive ballroom dancer and Macao’s “King of Gambling” who had a four-decade government-granted monopoly on casinos until 2001. SJM is run by Ho’s daughter Pansy.

The others are Melco International run by Ho’s son Lawrence and Galaxy Entertainment Group.

The decision to allow in foreign-owned casinos in 2002 brought a flood of money to Macao once best known in China for its Portuguese-style egg tarts and billions of dollars in profit to their operators. In total the six license holders operate 41 casinos.

Annual revenue from slot machines dice tables and other games peaked at $45 billion in 2013. That was equal to $65000 for each man woman and child in Macao and more than triple Nevada’s 2021 revenue of $13.5 billion.

But revenue was sliding even before COVID hit in 2020. Beijing was tightening controls on how often mainland gamblers could visit. Curbs were imposed on financial transfers to Macao in a crackdown on money laundering and tax evasion.

By 2019 before the pandemic gambling revenue had sunk 19% from 2013′s level to $36.4 billion. In 2020 it collapsed a further 80% to just $7.6 billion. Last year revenue climbed back to $10.8 billion but that is down 75% from 2013.

Macao’s economy possibly the world’s most tourism-dependent has shrunk by half since 2019 according to government data.

The government has appealed to casino operators to avoid laying off employees.

Macao’s appeal is so powerful that Las Vegas Sands Corp. traditionally the biggest global casino operator by revenue sold its namesake Las Vegas hotel in 2021 to wager everything on its six Macao properties and one in Singapore.

The company has invested an estimated $13 billion in Macao. It is in the midst of a $2.2 billion overhaul of one of its hotels.

Betting so heavily on Asia however meant Sands suffered the biggest COVID hit. The company reported a first-quarter loss of $478 million. Revenue fell 21% from a year earlier to $943 million.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. said revenue at its two Macao casinos fell but its Las Vegas properties helped to limit its overall loss to $183.3 million on revenue of $953.3 million temporarily putting it ahead of Sands.

MGM Resorts said its first-quarter revenue of $268 million in Macao was down 76% compared with the pre-outbreak level of $734 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Adding non-gambling assets would make Macao more like Las Vegas where casinos try to attract families and non-gamblers with roller coasters music shopping centers art exhibits and water parks.

SJM operates a zip line and indoor skydiving attractions. It has dropped an earlier proposal for a Hello Kitty theme park. The tycoon behind Galaxy talked about a possible theme park resembling the movie “Avatar” but it never went ahead.

“Entertainment and theme parks are costly to run with questionable returns” said Lee.

Regulators need to craft investment requirements “very carefully” Lee said. “You can’t force concessionaires to invest in theme parks and entertainment without a return unless it is in black and white.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9VU0EtQ2FuYWRhL3ZlZ2FzLXBvb2wtcGFydGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Dayclubs and Pool Parties in Las Vegas for Summer 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelagewest.com/Travel/USA-Canada/vegas-pool-parties on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFnZXdlc3QuY29tL1RyYXZlbC9VU0EtQ2FuYWRhL3ZlZ2FzLXBvb2wtcGFydGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyaXAtaWRlYXMvbmF0dXJlLXRyYXZlbC9uYXRpb25hbC1wYXJrLXNpdGVzLW5lYXItbGFzLXZlZ2Fz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Best Natural Sites Near Las Vegas — From Otherworldly Landscapes to a Century-old Ghost Town,"Las Vegas is located in the middle of the desert but those who skip this part are only getting half the story. Consider: a 30-minute drive from the Strip could land you in the middle of a red rock jungle at 2000-year-old petroglyphs or under a waterfall in a remote canyon.

""Las Vegas is a great starting point for outdoor adventures"" says Rachel Bergren executive director of Get Outdoors Nevada. ""We're easy to get to and we have access to a lot of national public lands."" Bergren is referring to five natural sites that surround the city comprising millions of acres of unparalleled recreation area.

For the last 20 years Get Outdoors Nevada has invited thousands of locals and visitors to utilize the stunning array of wilderness near Vegas but there's still work to be done. ""Most people don't think of Las Vegas as an outdoor recreation destination. But it's important to remember that most of this state is federal land which means it's publicly accessible.""

From hiking through otherworldly landscapes to driving through a century-old ghost town read on for the best national monuments and parks near Vegas.

Valley of Fire State Park

Nevada's oldest and largest state park is also its most striking. Established in 1935 Valley of Fire is an otherworldly landscape of petrified trees 2000-year-old petroglyphs and trails that cut through some of the strangest most colorful outcrops you've ever seen. There are quite a few paths to choose from and nearly all lead to jaw-dropping natural rock formations like Elephant Rock (aptly named for its lengthy trunk-like protrusion) or the warped and wrinkled Beehives.

Located an hour northeast of Vegas Valley of Fire is a convenient stopping point on the way to Zion National Park. (It's also popular with movie buffs as classics like ""Total Recall"" ""Casino"" and ""Austin Powers"" were all filmed here.) If you're not in the mood to hike stick to the scenic driving loop which provides an excellent overview of the park's many natural attractions.

Gold Butte National Monument

This 300000-acre site is sacred to the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians as well as the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe and when you witness the incredible array of petroglyphs here you'll understand why. Evidence of human dwellings date back more than 12000 years and the vivid rock paintings — in particular a site called Newspaper Rock — offer a unique glimpse into what life might have been like for Nevada's earliest inhabitants.

Beware: The road that passes through Gold Butte is unpaved and as a result you'll need a high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicle to tackle the rough terrain. (Make sure to bring two spare tires as flats are a common occurrence.)

Once you've sorted your transportation buckle up for a wild ride. The 62-mile five-hour loop winds through one of the most remote stretches of southern Nevada. Highlights include a 110-foot-deep sinkhole nicknamed Devil's Throat an abandoned mining town from the early 1900s and Whitney Pockets a series of multicolored caves formed from fossilized sand dunes dating back to the Jurassic era.

Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area

Standing inside Sloan Canyon you'll wonder how it's possible that such a rugged remote landscape can exist so close to the Strip. Surrounded by tall jagged peaks this 48438-acre preserve is easy to reach from Vegas (a 30-minute drive) and offers a wonderful reprieve from the city's hustle and bustle.

There are no actual roads inside Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area so plan on parking at the visitor center at Nawghaw Poa Road and hiking out from there. The route can be challenging in some parts though the reward — a petroglyph gallery filled with more than 300 rock art panels not to mention wildlife like jackrabbits desert tortoise lizards and roadrunners — is worth the trek.

Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area

It's no surprise that this sprawling 200000-acre backcountry is one of the most popular national park sites in Nevada. An easy 13-mile driving loop connects visitors to more than two dozen marked trails with epic views waiting at every turn. In certain places like Ice Box Canyon or the Children's Discovery Trail you might even stumble upon a hidden waterfall or two.

Red Rock is also a popular climbing destination and at Calico Basin (located just outside the park's entrance) you can witness skilled climbers scrambling up the brightly colored cliffs. The 1.5-mile beginner-friendly Calico Basin Trail passes by a trio of natural springs that feed a grove of picturesque cottonwood ash oak and honey mesquite trees; there's even a lush grassland that makes it quite the romantic picnic spot.

Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument

In the 1960s a major archaeological dig at Tule Springs unearthed a treasure trove of Ice Age fossils earning a full-length spread in National Geographic and prompting locals to start petitioning for the area to be federally protected. Their efforts paid off in 2014 when Tule Springs Fossil Beds was officially declared a national monument under President Obama's administration.

Being relatively new this national monument lacks a proper visitor center and defined trails. But don't let that deter you from visiting. Head to one of three interpretive kiosks (located at the intersections of North Durango Drive and Moccasin Road; Aliante Parkway and Moonlight Falls Avenue; and off the exit from U.S. 95 at Corn Creek Road) to learn about the magnificent animals that once roamed these plains including the Columbian mammoth saber-tooth cat and camelops.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZHVqb3VyLmNvbS9saWZlL2RyLXN0ZXZlbi12aWN0b3ItcmVnZW4tbWVkaWNhbC1ncm91cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Fountain of Youth in NYC - DuJour,"The Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street just got a groundbreaking new tenant. Dr. Steven Victor and his ReGen Medical group are a testament to the way regenerative technology can help you heal and get stronger. The office offers the latest breakthroughs and therapies in health technology to help maximize energy and strength prevent disease and extend your health span. “Regenerative medicine seeks to replace tissue or organs that have been damaged by disease trauma or congenital issues versus the current clinical strategy that focuses primarily on treating the symptoms” explains Dr. Victor.

Originally trained as a cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Victor performed thousands of liposuction procedures over the years. “I learned that the fat I was throwing away contained numerous capillaries and in the walls of these capillaries were stem cells.” Twenty years ago he traveled to Athens Greece to learn more about the possibilities of stem cell therapy. “I came back to New York City excited and began integrating stem cell therapy into my practice using the technology I learned using enzymes to break up the fat to harvest the stem cells.” Dr. Victor then invested in a mechanical method to separate stem cells from the capillaries in the fat (or adipose tissue) and built a cellular lab in which to process the matter. “Stem cell therapy is useful where modern medicine fails” says Dr. Victor. “So we can help with ailments that traditional medicine fails to fix. Aging is inflammation and a decrease in circulation. Stem cell therapy helps to vastly reduce inflammation and increase circulation so you feel younger and better.”

When the Solow Building’s owner Stefan Soloviev decided to add amenities to the iconic Midtown space he believed tenants would love a medical wellness center and so he reached out to Dr. Victor who was looking for a new office space. At 9 West ReGen Medical has a full staff of emergency room physicians and cosmetic dermatologists all supported by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. When it’s completed in a few months the new space will offer regenerative medicine fitness wellness and aesthetics services as well as a membership concierge-medicine service for 24/7 access to care for building residents and private patients alike. Dr. Victor is also excited to be able to offer patients a full lab to process their bloodwork and other samples and special medical imaging equipment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9wb2tlci9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1nYW1ibGUtcGF5cy1vZmYtYWdhaW4tZm9yLXdzb3AtbWFpbi1ldmVudC1wbGF5ZXItMjYwNTU3OS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcG9rZXIvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtZ2FtYmxlLXBheXMtb2ZmLWFnYWluLWZvci13c29wLW1haW4tZXZlbnQtcGxheWVyLTI2MDU1NzkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit card gamble pays off again for WSOP Main Event player,"Joe Marincola of Philadelphia bought into the WSOP’s $10000 No-limit Hold’em World Championship for the second straight year using an interest-free credit card.

World Series of Poker announces dates for 2024 event on the Strip

Joe Marincola wasn’t sure he was good enough to play in the World Series of Poker’s Main Event when he entered the tournament in November.

But after a deep run that ended with a bad beat on Day 5 of that tournament the resident of Philadelphia knew he would return.

“Honestly I wasn’t sure if I was just a one-time lucky bum” said Marincola borrowing a line from the movie “Rocky.”

“But I’m here doing it again. I belong here.”

Marincola bought into last year’s WSOP’s $10000 No-limit Hold’em World Championship using an 18-month interest-free credit card and did the same for his entry fee this year.

The gamble worked again as he made Day 4 of the tournament before being knocked out in 777th place for $19000.

There were unofficially 594 players remaining at the dinner break Sunday as the starting field of 8663 continued to dwindle. Zilong Zhang of Irvine California was the leader with 4.8 million chips.

The Main Event continues with Day 5 on Monday at Bally’s.

“Poker is the only sport where amateurs can sit down and face off against the pros” Marincola said. “I love poker so much for that reason. Everyone has a shot and you have to take yours.”

Marincola finished in 288th place last year for $38600 after using the credit card to play in his first Main Event.

With his winnings the 37-year-old landlord and bartender said he paid off the credit card debt and also invested in the properties he owns.

But his elimination on Day 5 of the tournament remained a source of motivation. After climbing back from having one big blind the previous day Marincola lost with ace-king against ace-queen for all his chips.

“I can’t get over the fact that I had the best hand” Marincola said. “The second I got knocked out I’m like ‘I’m coming back.’ ”

Marincola opened a new credit card about a month ago with a $19000 limit more than enough to travel to Las Vegas and play.

“I’m a credit card gambler” he said.

In preparation for his return to the Main Event Marincola ran to the Philadelphia Museum of Art like Rocky Balboa did in the movie. Unlike last year when Marincola had to nurse his short chip stack to reach the money he had a smoother ride this time.

Marincola doubled his 60000-chip starting stack at the end of Day 1 and continued to run it up on Days 2 and 3. He had close to 300000 chips when the money bubble burst early Sunday on Day 3 after more than an hour of hand-for-hand play.

“It was so exciting” Marincola said. “It was a lot more relaxing because I had a lot of chips this year. Last year I was struggling. This year I kind of had a smooth ride until (Sunday).”

Marincola started Day 4 with about 37 big blinds but wasn’t able to double up at any point. He went out about two hours before the dinner break when he shoved all-in from the button for 17 big blinds with ace-queen but ran into the big blind’s pocket kings.

Marincola said he hoped his runs in November and this month serve as inspiration to his poker-playing friends and others in his Philadelphia neighborhood.

“Bottom line it’s an underdog story and there’s a lot of things relatable” Marincola said. “Sometimes I don’t know if I’m being grateful enough or realizing how special it is in the present moment. I’m trying to cherish it. I’m doing the best I can to realize how special it is.”

""It'll be the last time you hear this.""

Indeed after a career stretching seven decades the veteran Rock & Roll Hall of Famer is in the midst of his last North American trek in which he'll play a catalog of his hits. He's not retiring but the 77-year-old promises future tours will be devoted to the Great American Songbook.

The number he was introducing for the last time on Friday was his breakthrough 1971 solo hit ""Maggie May."" A sad song about a young man hurt by his older seducer it's been transformed into a karaoke classic and something of a drinking song. On Friday Sir Rod began at a slow tempo pausing between phrases to emphasize the pain of youthful romance.

As his band joined in he picked up the pace belting the lyrics like a heartfelt heartbroken confused school boy. Because he's Rod Stewart perpetual bon vivant he danced a bit led a clap along swayed his hips and announced ""Here comes the mandolin."" Never one to sit still even during a ballad he kicked his legs waltzed with the mic stand shook his booty and in the end kept repeating ""Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face."" A young heart scarred for life.

The crowd responded like it was the last time they'd ever see that face with its prominent beak and rooster hair deliver one of rock's all-time classics.

""Maggie May"" turned around what had been a disappointing concert up to that point. The show had been too busy and too garish as if staged by Baz Luhrmann. ""Forever Young"" became forever long thanks to an unnecessary ""River Dance""-like tap dance and fiddle-and-drum segment in the middle. Later on ""Young Turks"" got hijacked by the refrain of ""America"" from ""West Side Story.""

More importantly early in the concert Stewart's raspy voice seemed to be fading away as if dulled by sandpaper. On the Motown duet ""It Takes Two"" his vocal partner obliterated him. On the Sam Cooke classic ""Having a Party"" Stewart missed his opening cue to start singing not once but twice. It felt like this concert was going to be a letdown like his last St. Paul gig in 2018.

It was time to get the Baz out on Friday to jettison the glitzy Vegas-y backup singers and let Stewart truly focus on singing instead of merely playing the rock star a role he's always performed at Oscar level.

On ""I'd Rather Go Blind"" the Etta James chestnut Stewart fell to his knees finding his inner bluesman and undying determination. He underscored his skills as a soulful balladeer on a five-song sit-down acoustic set featuring an inspiring ""People Get Ready"" (with images of Martin Luther King on the backdrop) and the romantic trio of ""Tonight's the Night"" ""You're in My Heart"" and ""Have I Told You Lately.""

Before the latter tune Stewart talked about meeting its songwriter Van Morrison for the first time recently at a benefit concert in London. The cantankerous Morrison has a reputation for being standoffish but Stewart said the Irishman knocked on his dressing room door wouldn't stop talking and thanked Stewart for being ""able to build a swimming pool"" with royalties from his hit recording.

While Stewart likes a good joke he can turn serious as he demonstrated dedicating ""Rhythm of My Heart"" to people in Ukraine and briefly discussing the situation there.

But he also likes to rock. And he sent the crowd home with the rollicking ""Hot Legs"" (during which he tossed and kicked soccer balls to fans) and the rambunctious care-free rocker ""Stay with Me.""

The memories of Stewart's 110-minute farewell-to-the-hits concert in St. Paul will stay with those 8500 fans for a long time.

Opening the evening was Cheap Trick the Rock Hall of Famers who have turned into something of a family band. Original members singer Robin Zander and guitarist Rick Nielsen have been joined by their sons Robin Taylor Zander on guitar and Dax Nielsen on drums; Tom Petersson is the longtime bassist. As a quintet the band sounded noisier than ever delivering a trippy treatment of the Beatles' ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and winning renditions of their own hits ""I Want You To Want Me"" and ""Surrender.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL211c2ljL3NoYXduLW1lbmRlcy1wb3N0cG9uZXMtd29uZGVyLXRvdXItZGF0ZXMtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shawn Mendes postpones tour dates to focus on mental health: 'I need to take some time to heal',"Shawn Mendes is taking a break from his Wonder world tour to focus on his mental health.

The Grammy-nominated singer 23 postponed three weeks of North American tour dates through Uncasville Conn. to tend to his health. ""This breaks my heart to have to say this but unfortunately I'm going to have to postpone the next three weeks of shows through Uncasville CT until further notice"" Mendes shared on Instagram Friday.

""I've been touring since I was 15 and to be honest it's always been difficult to be on the road away from friends and family"" he wrote. While he felt ""ready to dive back in"" after ""a few years off the road"" Mendes said the decision was ""premature and unfortunately the toll of the road and the pressure has caught up to me and I've hit a breaking point.""

Mendes said he consulted with mental health professionals and his team and determined that he needed to ""take some to heal and take care of myself and my mental health."" The singer concluded ""As soon as there are more updates I promise I will let you know.""

Mendes kicked off his world tour in June in Oregon to promote his 2020 fourth studio album Wonder. He was scheduled to continue the tour at Xcel Energy Center in Minnesota on Saturday. Other postponed dates span Nebraska Wisconsin Illinois Missouri Pennsylvania North Carolina and Washington D.C. The tour is scheduled to resume at the end of July in Canada and eventually span Europe including Italy and France.

Rangers recovered a body Thursday after receiving a call reporting a woman had gone missing from shore. Her body was located by a drone 10 minutes later and recovered from under 20 feet of water.

On Saturday only two days later CPW reported a woman died following a boating accident despite “life-saving measures” taken by CPW staff.

The agency did not identify either victim and neither have been given an official cause of death.

If both are confirmed as drownings it would bring statewide drownings up to 24 this year. Lake Pueblo alone accounts for four of those deaths — six if these are confirmed as drownings. The statewide record was set in 2020 when 34 people drowned.

Colorado wildlife officials are concerned by the high number of deaths this year and worry the state may see the record shattered with a little less than half the year remaining.

Officials have been urging people to wear a life jacket while on any lakes rivers or streams as well as helmets and footwear if near rapids or when participating in any activities that might elevate risk of injury.

Correction: This article very briefly stated the incorrect number of deaths on Lake Pueblo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy93aWxkLWtpcmlsbC1rYXByaXpvdi1kZW5pZWQtZW50cnktdXMtd2FudGVkLXJ1c3NpYS1mYWtlLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWlk0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3dpbGQta2lyaWxsLWthcHJpem92LWRlbmllZC1lbnRyeS11cy13YW50ZWQtcnVzc2lhLWZha2UtbWlsaXRhcnktaWQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild's Kirill Kaprizov denied entry into US twice amid reports of being wanted in Russia over fake military ID,"Minnesota Wild star Kirill Kaprizov is back in his native Russia after being denied entry into the U.S. on two separate occasions according to one report.

Kaprizov who signed a five-year $45 million contract with the Wild last year was first denied entry after recently traveling to Dubai to enter into the U.S. league sources told The Athletic's Michael Russo.

The the-23-year-old winger then tried again via the Caribbean Islands but was again denied entry and reportedly returned to Russia.

""He couldn’t clear into the U.S. though perhaps because he doesn’t currently have a work visa despite signing a five-year contract last September"" Russo reported.

Kaprizov is reportedly wanted in Russia for allegedly purchasing a fake military ID in 2017. The Wild have not confirmed reports but general manager Bill Guerin said Wednesday that he was in talks with Kaprizov’s agent.

""We're just trying to find out as much information as we can. We really don't ... I don't even know how credible the [report] was"" he said via ESPN.

Coach Dean Evason told The Athletic Friday that he hopes the situation ""gets sorted out correctly.""

""It’s scary. It’s scary for all of us"" he said. ""It’s a scary situation in our world. To see somebody as close as we know Kirill yeah it’s a scary situation. And we hope that it all gets sorted out correctly.""

News of Kaprizov’s situation follows reports that Philadelphia Flyers prospect Ivan Fedotov was taken into custody last week by Russian authorities for allegedly planning to evade military service.

Russian media reported that Fedotov who represented the Russian Olympic Committee in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing was taken into custody by members of Russia’s criminal investigation department outside an ice rink in Kupchino and taken to a military registration and enlistment office.

His agent told The Associated Press this week that Fedotov is now being held at a remote military base in northern Russia.

Captain America has the shield; Wolverine has claws; Thor has Mjolnir; Iron Man has his suit and so on. They use these gadgets to fight evil and protect the universe. Our supply chain and logistics partners are the world’s modern day superheroes because they have been delivering essential rations despite global crises. They fight through supply chain disruptions caused by pandemics natural disasters cyberattacks and everything else to deliver the goods that the world depends upon. Over the last two years during the pandemic the shortcomings of the global supply chain have been evident as we have suffered shortages of goods from computer chips to toilet paper. It impacts enterprises and households 94% of Fortune 1000 companies faced supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic. We need to equip our logistics superheroes with powerful gadgets that they can use to manage chaos and save the universe. The good news is that the technology is already here with 5G the Fifth Generation for broadband cellular networks and IoT the Internet of Things. Both are possible weapons that the Batmans and Robins of the logistics industry can use to save the day.

Digitization of the supply chain for streamlining operations is not new. A Deloitte report states that companies must improve end-to-end supply chain visibility through digitization. The combination of 5G and IoT bring benefits and capabilities that surpass what was previously possible. Just as no single gadget can fight all villains no technology or solution can fix all supply chain issues. We have all admired James Bond for his savvy use of different devices in different situations to beat his foes. Similarly we need to look at the dynamic duo of 5G and IoT.

5G is a wireless connection technology that can deliver multi-gigabit speeds at lower latencies. It can handle many connections per cell tower making it the ideal solution for connecting IoT devices. These IoT devices can relay information pinpoint their location take proactive measures and respond to remote commands depending upon their capabilities. 5G and IoT can combine to perform complex tasks in the supply chain and unlock new efficiencies and enable smarter business decision making.

The ability to track and trace every shipment is essential. Historically supply chains have relied on stale and manual methods of tracking. With 5G and low-cost IoT sensors the entire logistics process can be transformed by bringing near real-time visibility to the state of goods their location conditions and estimated arrival times. This valuable information can help manufacturers prepare efficiently stores can anticipate stocking needs and hand-offs in transportation can occur seamlessly. In the United States around 30-40 percent of the food is wasted due to spoilage from production to delivery. 5G and IoT can trace the risk of spoilage while in transit due to overstocking or equipment malfunction. Temperature and ambient light sensors can indicate if a product has been damaged or exposed to sunlight. This food can be rerouted to a closer destination or the equipment can be repaired saving the products to feed people in need.

5G and IoT can significantly enhance warehouses ports shop floors and factories. They can enable smart inventory tracking autonomous operations and inspections within a location. Automation reduces losses due to missing parts counterfeiting and theft. Crewless vehicles and drones operated via remote control or autonomous vehicles can optimize loading and unloading operations connected via 5G by keeping vehicles in lanes and avoiding collisions. Advanced sensors and high throughput low latency 5G connections can enable autonomous inspection of products by connecting mobile and fixed cameras to AI applications at the edge.

Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) over 5G networks with IoT sensors can provide remote assistance when required. They can allow for visualizing stocking options in warehouses so that businesses can utilize their space efficiently. Mixed (MR) reality can help spot issues before implementation. 5G and IoT-enabled virtual reality can be used for simulations and training so that routes and processes are fully optimized before products are sent.

Manual processes result in bottlenecks and blind spots in the supply chain. Our logistics superheroes need to focus their energy on creative pursuits and reimagining business models to improve efficiency reduce costs and enhance accuracy. Digitization with 5G and IoT will ultimately benefit the consumer. The dynamic duo of 5G and IoT are the perfect gadgets to digitize the supply chain. A McKinsey survey states that nearly 90 percent of supply chain executives said they expect to overhaul their IT within the next five years. Companies must adopt 5G and IoT as gadgets to empower our logistics superheroes to deliver the goods and make the world safer smarter and more sustainable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
