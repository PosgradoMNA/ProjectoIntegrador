On Thursday the research analysts of the broking firm ICICI Securities said in their note that ‚Äú3M India‚Äôs FY22 annual report highlights the following: (1) Company is expanding its local manufacturing capacity for respirators masks hand sanitisers etc; it will also supply industry consumables to mobile phone manufacturing companies availing the PLI schemes. (2) 3M India is steadily investing in increasing its offline and online reach for Scotch Brite. (3) It introduced four products in automotive and consumer segments. We expect launch of additional products in tandem with normalisation of the economy. (4) Royalty as a percentage of sales reduced from 5.3% in FY21 to 5.2% in FY22. We remain positive on 3M India due to its competitive advantages such as: (1) strong brands (2) established distribution network and global relationships with large manufacturers and (3) access to parent‚Äôs technology pool.""

They further added that ‚ÄúWe model 3M India to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 16.6% and 39.4% respectively over FY22-FY24E with steady improvement in RoE. Maintain BUY with a DCF-based target price of Rs26500. Key risks: prolonged weakness in the economy and failure of new products.""

How the skin heals determines how bright and of course how correct the tattoo looks. But worry not: all you need are a few tips and products to ensure a quick complete rebound.

We summoned some advice from Carl Kuo owner of Mission Ink Tattoo and Piercing in San Francisco. He offers ways to build habits that will preserve the ink‚Äôs color for years to come.

STEP 1: BANDAGE IT & let it heal

Pang

While each artist has a preferred method of covering fresh ink Kuo says that recovery is fastest with an ointment wrap ‚Äî specifically Saniderm or 3M‚Äôs Tegaderm. ‚ÄúLeave it on for three to five days‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou can shower with it but remove the wrapping if irritation develops at the edges of the wrap.‚Äù In addition avoid tight clothes and itching or scratching. If you follow these directions your skin should fully recover in under two weeks.

Jasmine Jackson reports

At the heart of the plans for Westhoughton Town Hall are that it remains a community hub and that its historical features are preserved as far as possible in maintaining the building.

A total of ¬£3M has been earmarked for the grand building.

A steering group has been set up to listen to people views and develop plans for the civic building

Bolton Council Leader Martyn Cox says that ¬£900000 has already been spent to replace the windows and fix the roof to ensure it is safe for when it reopens to the public.

And Cllr Cox is keen for all types of community groups to use the space.

He says that the steering group want the town hall to operate under three main functions: civic community and commercial use on the ground floor.

Cllr Cox added: ‚ÄúWe will preserve as much of the original features as much as we can whilst opening to community groups and retaining the civic function around the town council.

‚ÄúWe will also be operating some commercial space.‚Äù

One of the reasons behind having some commercial spaces in the town hall is due to the building being 120 years old and in need of maintenance and costs that have continued to increase over the years.

Cllr Cox added: ‚ÄúThe commercial aspect will help to cover the cost of maintenance for the town hall.

‚ÄúBut we also think it is important that the public come in and use the building as well.

‚ÄúOnce it is created and useable community groups can come forward and speak about allocation which is open to everybody.

‚ÄúWe are looking to have plans in place by the end of the year and start construction by the end of February.‚Äù

Carnegie Hall is one of the spaces that will be preserved for community use (Image: Newsquest)

He also says that the restaurant is just one suggestion which has been brought forward and that they are still open to more.

Cllr Cox said: ‚ÄúThe commercial space will be taken up by people with sustainable models which could be a number of things.

‚ÄúThe restaurant is only one suggestion.

‚ÄúThe council is under tremendous pressure in terms of costs for construction.

‚ÄúIn the industry inflation is at 20 per cent which lowers what we can do.

‚ÄúIf we delay the high levels of inflation we are experiencing in the construction industry will mean purchasing power of the money we have diminishes and we can‚Äôt complete the works.

‚ÄúSo we want to make sure we maximise spending in February and still implement sustainability within the final use.‚Äù

Cllr Andrea Finney ‚Äì who represents Westhoughton North and Chew Moor ‚Äì said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really exciting for the people of Westhoughton.

‚ÄúWe need to move quickly to get it up and running as a community building for the people of Westhoughton.

‚ÄúI am very passionate about the history of our town and the opportunities within the building.

‚ÄúIt is for the community and everybody who wants to go in can hire and use it.‚Äù

Carnegie Hall is one of the spaces that will be preserved for community use as well as the council chambers and old features such as stair banisters.

The library is currently still open which is also used by many local groups including the history group.

Protestors have opposed the plans and said they will stage a demonstration but Cllr Cox has said that a ‚Äòhistoric civic building‚Äô will still be at the centre of the community.

He has also insisted that the public will have a voice before the final plans."

Abbott sends 50 migrants to VP Harris' home,"Abbott also sent two buses of migrants to her residence on Thursday.

Fifty more migrants arrived outside Vice President Kamala Harris's residence in Washington D.C. on Saturday days after two buses carrying asylum seekers arrived at her Naval Observatory home from Texas earlier this week.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's Press Secretary Renae Eze confirms to ABC News 50 migrants were dropped off at the Vice President's Naval Observatory residence Saturday after a long bus ride from Texas.

Abbott said he sent two buses of migrants to Harris's residence on Thursday.

""We're sending migrants to her backyard to call on the Biden Administration to do its job & secure the border"" he tweeted at the time.

Abbott and other Republican leaders from border states have been sending migrants to Democratic-led cities for months calling it a protest of President Joe Biden's immigration policies amid an influx of migrants at the southern border.

Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis escalated the scheme this week by dropping off approximately 100 migrants outside Harris's Washington home and on Martha's Vineyard the island just south of Cape Cod where former President Barack Obama has a residence.

The moves sparked national attention and outrage from the White House and Democrats who said the lawmakers were using migrants as political pawns. Republicans have cheered the move arguing the Biden administration should do more to secure the border.

Some Democratic lawmakers said they received no prior warning the migrants were going to be arriving.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the state has since offered voluntary transportation of the migrants off of Martha's Vineyard to a temporary shelter at Joint Base Cape Cod.

One Venezuelan immigrant Victor told ABC News' Armando Garcia that he was there when someone was asking migrants to sign their name on a list to get a seat on the plane. He did not sign up because the offer sounded too suspicious and because it did not align with his plans to eventually get to New York City.

Victor said he feels for the people that were duped into taking those flights but he understands why they took that risk.

""It's complicated because they tell you you'll have everything you want but when they arrived people were basically lost"" he said.

The White House said FEMA administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate available federal support but have largely dodged questions on how to improve the immigration system -- stating they inherited a broken process from the Trump administration.

President Joe Biden criticized the migrant drop-offs as ""simply wrong.""

""It's un-American it's reckless and we have a process in place to manage migrants at the border"" he said at a gala for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ""We're working on making sure it's safe and orderly and humane. Republican officials should not interfere with that process by waging these political stunts.""

DeSantis on Friday also said more migrant drop-offs were coming.

""I have $12 million for us to use and so we are going to use it and you're gonna see more and more. I'm going to make sure that we exhaust all those funds"" he said at a press conference.

Editor‚Äôs Note: A previous version of the story said that the migrant buses came from El Paso. The governor's office later clarified that the migrant buses to the vice president‚Äôs residence were sent from Texas but not El Paso.

Device-related factors and all-cause death represented categories favoring Amplatzer Amulet against Watchman according to a news release.

Abbott designed its Amplatzer Amulet left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder with dual-seal technology. It features a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to close off the opening into the LAA. The company said it is the first and only minimally invasive treatment option to offer immediate and complete dual-sealing closure of the LAA. It reduces the risk of stroke and eliminates the need for blood-thinning medication.

The prospective international multi-center Amulet IDE trial is the largest randomized LAA occlusion study to date Abbott said. It included more than 1800 patients.

Abbott reported three-year outcomes demonstrating that device-related thrombosis or peri-device leak more frequently preceded strokes in patients with Watchman compared to those with Amulet. Additionally the company said that cardiovascular and all-cause death trended higher in the Watchman device than the Amulet device.

Data from last year‚Äôs TCT demonstrated that Boston Scientific‚Äôs next-generation Watchman FLX stroke prevention device outperformed the Amulet device. Findings from the SEAL FLX single-center retrospective study of 300 Danish patients found that Watchman FLX demonstrated superiority in the area of LAA closure and peri-device leak.

More Amulet data

Abbott also presented data from its PREDICT-LAA trial. The prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial evaluated the planning process of Amplatzer amulet procedures.

The study looked at the use of cardiac computed tomography-based computational models ‚Äî high-resolution heart scans generated by FEops HEARTguide. It evaluated if those scans help in the planning of Amplatzer Amulet procedures.

Results demonstrated improved procedural efficiency and safety outcomes associated with HEARTguide planning.

Abbott TriClip performs well

Abbott presented the first results from the TRILUMINATE pivotal trial at TCT 2022. It is the company‚Äôs first randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of TEER with TriClip. The study evaluated 700 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Patients spanned the U.S. Canada and Europe.

Results from the roll-in cohort through 30 days demonstrated high implant success rate of 99%. The study also observed at least a one-grade TR reduction in 91% of patients. Additionally 74% of patients achieved moderate or less residual TR.

Patients achieved around a 17-point improvement on the KCCQ score. The 30% improvement from baseline demonstrates a ‚Äúsubstantial improvement‚Äù in quality of life.

More to come

Abbott is presenting data from its CONFIDENCE Registry on Sunday. The international prospective real-world study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Portico TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation).

The study used the first-generation Portico delivery system in 501 patients and the second-generation FlexNav system in 500 patients."

Retail sales volumes dropped by 1.6 per cent in monthly terms in August the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said ‚Äì the biggest fall since December 2021 and worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a 0.5-per-cent fall.

The data are likely to add to worries about the strength of demand in Britain‚Äôs economy.

United Kingdom (UK) fashion retailers Primark and ASOS and online supermarket Ocado Retail have all warned about their profits this month.

The pound slid further towards USD1.14 on the back of the data.

‚ÄúWith a difficult winter to come it will come as a worry to retailers that shoppers have already reigned in their spending despite the hot summer‚Äù said retail lead at Accenture Lynda Petherick.

All of the main retail sectors ‚Äì food stores non-food stores non-store retailing and fuel ‚Äì fell over the month for the first time since July 2021 when COVID-19 restrictions on hospitality were lifted the ONS said.

The period of mourning following the death of Queen Elizabeth poses another challenge to retailers with widespread business closures due on Monday to mark the queen‚Äôs funeral.

‚ÄúThe sombre atmosphere in the UK this week and news of slow economic growth will be adding to the sense of concern among retailers as the weather gets colder‚Äù Petherick said.

Although inflation dipped below 10 per cent last month households are still grappling with the biggest price increases since the early 1980s caused mostly by surging energy prices in the aftermath of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

The ONS said people cut back on furniture purchases last month.

‚ÄúFeedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns‚Äù it said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ADBE,Adobe,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzkvMTcvMjMzNTc0MDQvYWRvYmUtZmlnbWEtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tMjAtYmlsbGlvbi1iZXQtY29udHJvbC1jcmVhdGl2ZS1tYXJrZXQtYW50aXRydXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe's Figma acquisition is a $20 billion bet to control the entire creative market,"Over the past several years Figma has built its name as a forward-thinking and collaborative design platform and a formidable competitor to Adobe the giant in the creative apps market. That rivalry ended on Thursday when Adobe announced that it has struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Figma.

The acquisition will allow Adobe to incorporate Figma‚Äôs popular design tools into its widely-used portfolio of creative apps. But the acquisition also means that Adobe will once again be taking a major competitor off the market and bringing it under its own umbrella to the dismay of many designers who rely on the tool and are wary of another critical platform joining the company‚Äôs Creative Cloud service. And they have a point: with Figma off the market the list of companies capable of challenging Adobe‚Äôs empire just got meaningfully smaller.

The Figma team will have ‚Äúcomplete autonomy‚Äù

Adobe says the current plan is essentially for nothing to change. ‚ÄúI think that acquisitions are only done well when they‚Äôre done uniquely based on the company and that you never follow a playbook‚Äù Scott Belsky Adobe‚Äôs chief product officer and EVP of Creative Cloud said in an interview with The Verge. Belsky says the Figma team will have ‚Äúcomplete autonomy.‚Äù

Figma‚Äôs independence is a point they have been underscoring repeatedly; a LinkedIn post from Belsky and a blog post from Figma CEO Dylan Field both mentioned that the plan is for Figma to continue operating autonomously. ‚ÄúThe last thing that anyone wants is to disrupt either one of our roadmaps‚Äù Belsky said. That means no plans to bring Figma inside of Creative Cloud and no changes to Figma‚Äôs pricing according to Belsky.

If anything the earliest changes might be on Adobe‚Äôs side. Adobe has been winding down its investment in Adobe XD its competing design platform for things like apps and websites and XD users could be nudged over to Figma in the future according to Belsky. ‚ÄúIt was never because we didn‚Äôt think product design and development and this vertically integrated stack was a big opportunity‚Äù he said. Right now Adobe has a ‚Äútiny team‚Äù supporting XD for its existing customers. ‚ÄúOnce [the acquisition] closes then we‚Äôll figure out how to serve those customers likely with Figma‚Äù he said.

Field knows that they have to earn customers‚Äô trust. ‚ÄúWe have to establish that trust for Adobe and for Figma by being really consistent over time around what we do the actions we‚Äôre taking and showing up for the community and doing what‚Äôs right here.‚Äù

Figma‚Äôs recently-added dark mode. Image: Figma

Adobe has a history of buying up some of the biggest tools in the creative space acquiring companies like Frame.io a video production collaboration tool and Behance which lets people showcase their creative work. (Belsky first joined Adobe through this acquisition.) The company has bought a lot of companies ‚Äî even Photoshop was an acquisition. That makes the Figma purchase all the more concerning for designers; one of the few notable challengers to Adobe has been swept up meaning Adobe will continue to consolidate creative app power in one location.

The purchase isn‚Äôt necessarily an antitrust concern but it could still fall under scrutiny by regulators. ‚ÄúIt certainly looks like Adobe is in a dominant market position and this acquisition would increase that dominance‚Äù Matt Kent a competition policy advocate for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen said in an interview. But just because Adobe is big doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the merger violates the law he said.

‚ÄúAny developers in that community being acquired by Adobe will likely be stifled‚Äù

Competing developers had mixed views on the acquisition. Affinity which offers its own suite of creative software thinks the acquisition could reduce innovation in the creative app space. ‚ÄúAny developers in that community being acquired by Adobe will likely be stifled as their objectives are realigned to what‚Äôs good for Adobe. Ultimately that can only reduce the choice available for creatives‚Äù Ashley Hewson managing director of Affinity developer Serif said in an emailed statement.

Alludo which makes the Corel suite of tools took a more positive tone. ‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt have a specific comment on Adobe‚Äôs news this move is definitely validating in terms of what we‚Äôve believed for many years now ‚Äî collaboration tools are critical in the design world‚Äù Prashant Ketkar CTO and CPO of Alludo said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúWe expect this movement will only gain momentum.‚Äù

Adobe‚Äôs also making this acquisition during a time when the regulatory bodies are getting more serious about cracking down on big tech mergers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed to block Meta‚Äôs acquisition of the company behind VR fitness app Supernatural in July for example and sued to block Nvidia‚Äôs now-scrapped acquisition of Arm in November.

Adobe on Thursday offered to buy Figma in a cash-and-stock deal that would be the biggest buyout of a software startup on record despite the sharp drop-off in tech sector valuations this year.

Dylan Field 30 who co-founded Figma in 2012 will easily become a billionaire if the deal closes as expected though his exact stake in the firm is not clear according to the Wall Street Journal.

He launched Figma after dropping out of Brown University under a $100000 fellowship financed by billionaire Peter Thiel who requires recipients to leave school and pursue entrepreneurship if they are awarded the grants.

Field is a bashful type who favors nights in with board games and wine friends say. His company offers popular tools that graphic designers use to collaborate on projects online.

Dylan Field 30 who co-founded Figma in 2012 is set to become a billionaire if Adobe's offer to buy the startup closes next year as expected

Adobe on Thursday offered to buy Figma in a $20 billion cash-and-stock deal that would be the biggest buyout of a software startup on record

Figma's web-based collaborative platform has gained loyal fans and is widely popular with employees at major tech firms including Zoom Airbnb and Coinbase.

Adobe based in San Jose California is a software titan that sells tools for creating publishing and promoting content and managing documents.

Wall Street reacted to the rich price of the deal with skepticism sending Adobe stock down 3 percent on Friday and wiping nearly $5 billion from the company's valuation.

Still Field told the Journal that he has no anxiety about the investor opposition.

'If this deal fell apart tomorrow I'd feel just fine' he said.

Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen hailed Figma's business as 'the future of work' and said there were 'tremendous opportunities' in combining it with his company's offerings such as document reader Acrobat and online whiteboard Figjam.

The $20-billion exit marked a major win for Figma's venture capital backers including Index Ventures Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins.

Field is seen as a teenager at the Foo Camp hacker conference in 2008. He dropped out of Brown University and founded Figma after accepting a $100000 fellowship

Billionaire Peter Theil founded the fellowship -- but requires anyone who accepts it to leave school and pursue entrepreneurship instead

Figma's valuation has skyrocketed at speeds that are rarely seen even in the world of Silicon Valley and Kleiner Perkins stands to make return of about 100 times its 2018 investment when the deal closes.

Josh Coyne partner at Kleiner Perkins praised the deal saying: 'This partnership will give Figma users access to Adobe's photography illustration and video technology all in one place.'

'And Figma in return can offer its deep expertise in building in the browser' he added.

Each company will run independently until the transaction closes. At that time Field who will continue to lead the Figma team will report to David Wadhwani president of Adobe¬¥s Digital Media business.

The deal is expected to close next year. It still needs approval from Figma's shareholders and regulatory approval.

Either company will have to pay a termination fee of $1 billion if they scrap the deal.

Field is a bashful type who favors nights in with board games and wine friends say

Elena Nadolinski Founder and CEO at Iron Fish and Dylan Field CEO and Co-founder of Figma attend the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media Conference in July

David Wagner portfolio manager and equity analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors which owns a 1.5 percent stake in Adobe questioned the wisdom of the deal.

He said Figma's annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $400 million a tiny fraction of Adobe's $14 billion making it an unreasonable for Adobe to pay the equivalent of 11 percent of its market value for 2.8 percent more ARR.

'We're disappointed with the price paid for the company (Figma)' said Wagner.

Adobe said it expected the deal to be accretive to its earnings three years after its completion. It added that Figma's total addressable market would reach $16.5 billion by 2025 across design whiteboarding and collaboration.

Adobe is one of the most acquisitive companies in the Silicon Valley and has bought numerous businesses over the years as it has looked to defend market share against competitors.

Prior to Figma its largest acquisition was that of software maker Marketo for $4.75 billion in 2018.

It has also bought other companies over the past 24 months to sharpen its focus on collaboration tools including those of video collaboration software Frame.io social media marketing startup ContentCal and collaboration tool maker Workfront.

Meanwhile Adobe's fourth-quarter revenue forecast of $4.52 billion came in below the $4.58 billion estimated by analysts according to Refinitiv data.

This year‚Äôs survey included 5000 emoji users in the US looking for ways that emoji encapsulate our efforts in self-expression inclusion searching for love and communicating at work among other things. These ‚Äúfrequent emoji users‚Äù from California Florida Illinois New York and Texas filled out a 20-minute online survey about their emoji use and the results are üíØ üëÄ üìà!

Don‚Äôt be a üçÜ use emojis.

Over 90% of US emoji users agreed that emojis make it easier for them to express themselves an overwhelming majority ‚Äî though perhaps there is a bias in a sample drawn from people who self-define as ‚Äúfrequent emoji users‚Äù as presumably people who do not find that emojis make communication easier will not use them. An equal 91% of emoji users like to employ them to ‚Äúlighten the mood of a conversation.‚Äù This makes sense because they are little cartoons (although as maligners of Clippy can tell you a cartoon does not help in every situation). I think we can generally agree that the presence of a little smiley face helps soften our tenth request that someone take out the trash that‚Äôs been sitting by the front door for two days üòâ.

For the most part top emojis keep things light-hearted and positive but there‚Äôs always room to shed a single tear when times get hard.

The top five favorite emojis seem to be perennial faves in the emoji game: cry-laughing thumbs up red heart cry-laughing extra hard and single tear. These also feature in the top three favorite emoji combos a progressive cry-laugh to harder cry-laugh hearts-surrounding-face and a blown kiss and a blown kiss and heart. Love is in the virtual air! It is probably unsurprising that 68% of the survey respondents feel that their primary reason for using emojis is to make conversations more fun but it is interesting to note that 60% of users agree that using emojis has improved their mental health. It‚Äôs possible that this says more about the state of mental health care in the US than the healing power of emojis.

In a country without universal healthcare emojis might be the only mental health services widely available.

As broken down by Adobe‚Äôs analysis of the 111-page report despite their goofy lighthearted application they are also a showcase for ways that we confront serious social issues.

‚ÄúNow more than ever we are having an important and overdue conversation about inclusivity equity and diversity‚Äù said the Adobe blog. ‚ÄúAnd because emoji are so integrated into our daily activities it is vital that they reflect the lives of as many people as possible. According to the survey age race/ethnicity culture and disability are the top four categories of inclusive emoji US emoji users would like to see expanded.‚Äù

Emojis seem to also play a substantial role in the love lives of texters with Gen Z in particular making ‚Äî and even breaking ‚Äî relationships over emoji usage. Leonardo DiCaprio better brush up his emoji game if he wants to keep dating 25-year-olds.

Break it to them gently say it with emojis.

Are emojis the best means of communication? As the survey shows even emoji users find them somewhat ambiguous with the top three misunderstood emoji being cowboy hat smiley cherries and upside-down smiley face. For the record I think these clearly mean: ‚ÄúYEEHAW!‚Äù ‚Äúyum I love cherries‚Äù and ‚Äúeverything is pretty shitty but I am nonetheless smiling.‚Äù Right?

Apologies to everyone who is confused by my overuse of the yeehaw guy I assumed my message was clear. My message was ‚ÄúYEEHAW!‚Äù

Whether you love them or hate them the report makes it clear that fluency with emojis is a useful social skill in the digital age garnering likeability and credibility at work ease with romance and a general sense of friendly fun. Even if you don‚Äôt feel confident splashing them all over the place there is one sacred rule that seems to be universal: Don‚Äôt ever use üí© or an unsolicited üçÜ unless you‚Äôre trying to end things on the rudest possible terms. In a divided world the great social unifier seems to be a dislike of the pile of poo emoji.

Thanks emoji for helping us find common ground. Happy texting!

Don‚Äôt ever use üí© or an unsolicited üçÜ unless you‚Äôre trying to end things on the rudest possible terms."

Some solar industry groups and researchers say that level of concentration poses a risk to the solar supply chain. They also argue that moving production elsewhere could decrease solar‚Äôs carbon footprint and avoid companies accused of using forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In the US the Inflation Reduction Act promises funds for restarting idle polysilicon factories and investing in manufacturing of other solar components. But companies must still turn that momentum into solar panels.

Wacker Chemie‚Äôs chemical plant in Charleston Tennessee is large enough to have its own street system. Lettered streets run roughly east to west intersecting numbered avenues at perfect 90¬∞ angles.

The 220-hectare site produces polysilicon a key material used to make solar panels and computer chips. Two pipe-covered distillation systems the length of football fields tower over Second Avenue while reactors used to make polysilicon occupy an entire block between C Street and D Street.

Site Leader Ken Collins says Wacker has already invested nearly $3 billion in the plant and the site is still growing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actively looking at things in F‚Äù he says pointing to the location of a future street on the edge of the facility. ‚ÄúAnd then long term it goes well beyond.‚Äù

Wacker is in the midst of spending $200 million to add the production of silicone polymers. Collins says the property is also laid out to allow for polysilicon expansion. Wacker hasn‚Äôt announced specific plans for new polysilicon infrastructure but national governments and the solar industry are pushing to increase production in places like Tennessee.

Producers don‚Äôt want to rely upon unstable sources. James May CEO REC Silicon

Most of the world‚Äôs polysilicon is made in China and the US solar industry is encouraging suppliers to increase production elsewhere. Solar companies argue that a less-concentrated supply chain will be more resilient emit less carbon and circumvent companies accused of using forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The US and Indian governments recently added momentum to this endeavor pledging billions of dollars to scale up domestic solar manufacturing and guarantee future access to clean energy.

Some companies are already responding. Reliance Energy says it will spend $7.5 billion on a green energy manufacturing hub in India that will include polysilicon production. The other two companies that make polysilicon in the US‚ÄîHemlock Semiconductor and REC Silicon‚Äîare also ramping up production. Hemlock turned on idle capacity for solar-grade polysilicon at its plant in Michigan this summer and REC Silicon plans to reopen a polysilicon facility in Washington. ‚ÄúProducers don‚Äôt want to rely upon unstable sources‚Äù REC Silicon CEO James May says.

Even with all that momentum challenging China‚Äôs preeminence in solar manufacturing will not be easy. In addition to its massive polysilicon capacity Chinese companies control the subsequent steps in the supply chain: the production of silicon ingot and wafers solar cells and final solar panels. Supply chain experts say other countries must build up capacity in those parts of the supply chain as well if they are to decrease the risk of disruptions. And polysilicon makers outside China must prove they can compete with rivals in China that have access to ample government support.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) an industry group argues that incentives in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will kick-start US solar production eventually making it competitive with China. Over the next 8 years SEIA hopes companies will build US factories capable of making 50 GW of solar panels per year nearly enough to power every home in Texas.

‚ÄúMaybe half of that crosses the finish line‚Äù Collins says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a lot of polysilicon demand. Much more than the three producers in the US make today.‚Äù

The process

Polysilicon is at the heart of a solar panel. Small amounts of other elements are added to polysilicon so that one side of the material has extra electrons. When sunlight hits a solar cell it displaces those extra electrons. They flow to the opposite side of the cell which has molecules that can accept them. The flow of electrons creates an electric current.

The process for making polysilicon starts in mines extracting quartzite which is essentially gravel with high levels of silicon dioxide and low levels of impurities like iron. Many of those mines are in China but quartzite reserves are abundant in Brazil Norway and the US. The gravel is melted down in a furnace with a carbon source usually coal or charcoal to produce silicon metal silvery-gray rocks that are at least 98% silicon.

Companies like Wacker use the Siemens process to remove the remaining impurities. The resulting polysilicon is a crystallized form of silicon that needs to be at least 99.9999% pure for solar applications‚Äîand even purer for computer chips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really technical plant that turns silver rocks into silver rocks‚Äù Collins says of the facility he leads.

In the first step at the Tennessee plant the silicon metal is crushed into a powder and combined with hydrogen chloride at high temperatures to form liquid trichlorosilane. Wacker distills the liquid in spiraling columns several stories tall to increase the purity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very similar to what you do to a bourbon‚Äù Collins says.

The purified trichlorosilane is converted to gas and pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a filament of polysilicon about the diameter of a pencil. Some companies use silane gas instead. Electricity runs through the filament illuminating it like a light bulb and increasing its temperature to 1000 ¬∞C. At those high temperatures silicon from the trichlorosilane slowly deposits onto the filament gradually turning it into a thick rod. As a final step the rod is broken into chunks.

MAKING POLYSILICON To create the polysilicon‚Äîa crystallized form of nearly pure silicon‚Äîneeded for solar panels manufacturers begin with quartzite gravel a compound that contains silicon dioxide. The multistep process results in 99.9999% silicon. Step 1: Quartzite gravel containing silicon dioxide is the starting material for polysilicon. Step 2: The quartz is melted down to silicon metal which is at least 98% pure silicon. Step 3: Silicon metal is combined with hydrogen chloride to form liquid trichlorosilane. Step 4: Impurities are removed by distilling the trichlorosilane. Step 5: Trichlorosilane is pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a thin filament of polysilicon. Electricity runs through the filament heating it to 1000 ¬∞C. Step 6: The silicon deposits onto the filament turning it into a thick rod that is at least 99.9999% silicon. Step 7: The rods are broken into chunks and sold to companies that make silicon wafers for solar panels.

Some companies such as REC Silicon use a slightly different method called the fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) process. REC Silicon says the FBR process uses less energy. Companies using the Siemens process have to use lots of energy to heat the filament but they also have to use additional energy to cool the walls of the reaction chamber so that silicon doesn‚Äôt deposit there.

At the start the FBR process looks similar to the Siemens process with conversion of silicon metal into silane. But then the gas flows through a column seeded with tiny polysilicon beads rather than a chamber with a filament. Silicon deposits on the beads which grow into polysilicon spheres a few millimeters wide.

Beads from the FBR process or chunks from the Siemens process are sold to companies that turn them into cubed ingots which are sawed into paper-thin wafers. The wafers are textured and treated with other elements to turn them into individual solar cells. Multiple cells are soldered and sandwiched between a glass panel and a plastic back sheet to form solar panels.

Outsourcing

It‚Äôs a complex process and China dominates nearly every step of it. The country makes more than three-quarters of the world‚Äôs polysilicon according to data compiled by polysilicon consultant Johannes Bernreuter. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China also manufactures over 80% of all solar cells and assembled solar panels. The country produces virtually all the wafers used for solar panels.

It wasn‚Äôt always this way. In 2010 polysilicon production was split almost evenly among the US Europe South Korea Japan and China. In 2014 the US had nearly a dozen factories producing ingots and wafers according to SEIA data. Today there are none. The IEA estimates that companies in China have invested more than $40 billion in solar manufacturing since 2014 15 times what companies in North America have invested.

Bernreuter says the Chinese government fueled the growth of the country‚Äôs solar industry by offering favorable loans affordable land and cheap electricity. ‚ÄúChina early on recognized that solar will be a huge market‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey have strategically bet on that industry and supported it.‚Äù

US polysilicon producers also suffered a blow in 2014 when China imposed an import tariff cutting off US facilities from some of their most important customers.

Hemlock and Wacker were both building polysilicon plants in Tennessee when the tariffs took hold. Hemlock abandoned its $1 billion project in Clarksville in 2014 as it was on the verge of starting up. Wacker originally intended to focus on the solar market but shifted production to semiconductor-grade silicon when its plant came on line in 2016. In 2019 the tariffs forced REC Silicon to mothball its $1.7 billion polysilicon plant in Moses Lake Washington.

Heymi Bahar an IEA analyst who directed the organization‚Äôs report says China‚Äôs investment helped decrease the price of solar panels but also concentrated too much production in one place.

The report notes that a single factory in China produces 14% of the world‚Äôs polysilicon. In 2020 an explosion at a plant operated by China‚Äôs GCL-Tech temporarily halted a tenth of the world‚Äôs production capacity according to a report from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ‚ÄúIf there is a supply chain disruption the whole world is affected‚Äù Bahar says.

Xinjiang

Because China gets much of its electricity from coal-fired power plants making polysilicon and other solar materials outside China would also reduce the industry‚Äôs carbon footprint some companies and sustainability researchers argue.

Michael Parr executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance an industry group says the heat used to deposit silicon from trichlorosilane onto the rod requires enormous amounts of power so production is usually located in places where electricity is cheap.

‚ÄúIn China that means western China in Xinjiang . . . and increasingly Inner Mongolia where the grid is almost entirely coal based‚Äù Parr says.

He estimates that polysilicon made in China is three times as carbon intensive as polysilicon from other countries largely because of the Chinese electricity grid‚Äôs reliance on coal. The IEA reports that even the most carbon-intensive solar panels make up for all their manufacturing-related emissions in less than a year by generating carbon-free electricity but Parr still wants to see production move to places that have access to cleaner electricity grids. He says cheap power from hydroelectricity plants works especially well for polysilicon production.

Dominating solar



REC Silicon‚Äôs Washington plant will run on hydropower and the company boasts that the FBR process it uses will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hemlock the largest single energy user in Michigan also says it has access to renewable energy that reduces polysilicon‚Äôs carbon footprint.

Reliance on coal-based power isn‚Äôt the US solar industry‚Äôs only concern with the Xinjiang region. In May of last year Laura Murphy a human rights professor at Sheffield Hallam University coauthored a report accusing four of the largest polysilicon makers in Xinjiang as well as companies that supply them with silicon metal of participating in a forced labor program operated by the Chinese government.

Murphy says the labor program conducted ostensibly to increase economic prosperity in a poor region forces everyone in Xinjiang with Uyghur or Kazakh background to have a job. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the case even if they have to be forcibly placed there by a government agency‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere are government agents who go door to door.‚Äù

Murphy says China‚Äôs government will separate Uyghur and Kazakh families take away their land and even demolish whole villages essentially forcing them to leave their homes and work in their assigned jobs.

There is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect. Alan Crawford polysilicon consultant

An environmental social and governance report from Daqo New Energy a polysilicon maker with operations in Xinjiang denies that the company uses forced labor and says its suppliers have signed declarations attesting that they don‚Äôt use forced labor. A spokesperson for the company declined to answer specific questions. Other major polysilicon makers in Xinjiang‚ÄîGCL-Tech Xinte Energy and East Hope Group‚Äîdid not respond to emailed questions.

The evidence of forced labor use was strong enough that earlier this year the US government started enforcing a ban on essentially all products made in Xinjiang. Parr expects the ban to have a big effect. ‚ÄúThe game has changed and easy access to Chinese solar is a thing of the past‚Äù he says.

Polysilicon consultant Alan Crawford says polysilicon is made in other places in China without forced labor and with a lower carbon footprint. The problem is that ethically produced polysilicon‚Äîfrom other parts of China or other countries‚Äîmust flow through ingot factories in China where it‚Äôs blended with polysilicon from Xinjiang making it almost impossible to say with certainty whether a solar panel was made without forced labor. ‚ÄúThere is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect‚Äù Crawford says.

Jill Engel-Cox director of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory says companies buying solar panels are starting to pay more attention to such issues. She says there‚Äôs an expectation that renewable energy projects will benefit the world broadly‚Äînot just its climate.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been so focused on economics making them as cheap as possible which is important because they need to be able to compete with other types of energy‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut now how do we consider the social benefit and the environmental benefit?‚Äù

REshoring

The US‚Äôs ban on solar products from Xinjiang the ongoing trade war between China and the US and the current difficulties of shipping products across the ocean are problems for AES Clean Energy a power company that buys lots of solar panels. President Leonardo Moreno says the supply of panels coming from China has become unreliable. ‚ÄúWe have to build hundreds of megawatts of renewables in the US. We want a supply chain that‚Äôs stable‚Äù he says.

AES is part of a consortium of solar companies trying to incentivize a more resilient supply chain in the US. The consortium is promising to spend more than $6 billion on solar panels as long as suppliers set up US manufacturing operations. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what gives them certainty‚Äù Moreno says. ‚ÄúThey can build and the demand will be there.‚Äù

To encourage production outside China and avoid supply chain risks IEA analyst Bahar says governments also need to offer solar manufacturers support. He says they should use tax policies or incentive schemes to reduce the start-up costs for polysilicon manufacturers and ensure that they have access to cheap electricity just as China has done.

In August US president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. It offers a direct tax credit for the production of solar-grade polysilicon and also offers incentives for other parts of the supply chain like ingot and wafer manufacturing.

In an investor call the day after the signing REC Silicon‚Äôs May said the tax credits were a big part of the company‚Äôs decision to restart operations at its plant in Washington. The company expects to receive $48 million in credits annually once the facility is operating at full capacity.

The South Korean company Hanwha Solutions which made a major investment in REC Silicon earlier this year is scouting out sites in Texas South Carolina and Georgia for a facility to produce ingots wafers and solar panels according to documents filed with the Texas comptroller‚Äôs office. If the project moves forward the company says it would begin operating in 2025.

Building wafer manufacturing in the US would have a domino effect Bernreuter says and likely complete a solar supply chain outside China. ‚ÄúIf you solve that step of the value chain I think a lot of the other steps could follow relatively easily‚Äù he says.

The US could also avoid silicon-based solar panels altogether by using another technology: thin-film cadmium telluride which makes up about 5% of the global solar market. First Solar the largest producer of cadmium telluride panels has operations in the US Malaysia and Vietnam and will soon add a base in India.

The same forces fueling the growth of silicon-based solar manufacturing outside China are also boosting cadmium telluride. The US Department of Energy recently announced $20 million in funding for a consortium to advance the technology and First Solar says it will invest $1.2 billion in US manufacturing now that the Inflation Reduction Act has passed.

They can build and the demand will be there. Leonardo Moreno President AES Clean Energy

Other countries are also hoping to build up their solar industries. In 2021 for example India started offering incentives to help expand its capacity. Shirdi Sai Electricals Reliance Energy and Adani Infrastructure have all committed to building at least 4 GW of manufacturing capacity‚Äîfrom polysilicon to finished panels‚Äîbefore 2024.

‚ÄúConsidering the economies of scale and to be more cost competitive most manufacturers are actually planning for probably 10 GW plus especially for the polysilicon‚Äù says Balachander Krishnan who is overseeing the launch of Shirdi Sai Electricals‚Äô planned ingot wafer and module plant.

REC Silicon‚Äôs May welcomes the Inflation Reduction Act but he notes that the clock for adding the new capacity started ticking as soon as the tax credit was approved. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs designed to promote investment‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe caveat is that it‚Äôs got a time limit: 10 years.‚Äù After that May says US solar companies will have to be able to compete on their own.

Moreno says the tax credits will give companies the confidence they need to scale up solar manufacturing in the US. That should reduce costs he says. When the countdown hits zero the US will be ready he thinks. ‚ÄúThe reason the Chinese panels became very cheap over the years is not technology itself‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the scale.‚Äù

At Wacker‚Äôs Tennessee plant Collins says the company is focused on the long-term opportunity for polysilicon rather than the Inflation Reduction Act.

The US plant is modeled after Wacker‚Äôs flagship industrial park in Burghausen Germany which started operating in 1916 with 450 employees. Today the facility has 10000 employees and an app to help them navigate the sprawling campus.

The company wants to replicate Burghausen in Tennessee. ‚ÄúWhen the Wacker family . . . came to this site they said this is the Burghausen of the US‚Äù Collins says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs their vision.‚Äù

Driving around the plant in Tennessee Collins points to all the empty spaces where buildings may rise in the decades to come. Given the pace of solar‚Äôs growth it‚Äôs a good thing Wacker left some room to build.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel Becerril/Reuters

Hazardous ""forever chemicals"" called PFAS are contaminating drinking water food and air.

It may be impossible to completely avoid PFAS but there are a few simple ways to reduce your exposure.

Eating at home ditching nonstick pans and unnecessary carpets and filtering your water can help.

Hazardous long-lasting ""forever chemicals"" are all over the news lately and they're all over our day-to-day environments too.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS is a class of thousands of man-made substances that are common in everyday objects but research is making it increasingly clear that they may be harmful to human health. Peer-reviewed studies have linked them to some cancers decreased fertility thyroid disease and developmental delays.

That's bad news since PFAS last for decades without breaking down earning them the ""forever chemicals"" nickname. Researchers have found them in drinking water and household dust across the planet in the oceans at both poles and drifting through the atmosphere.

In a paper published last month leading researchers at the University of Stockholm concluded that all the planet's rainwater and probably all of its soil are contaminated with unsafe levels of PFAS. Ian Cousins who spearheaded that research fears it's impossible to avoid the chemicals.

""I don't bother"" Cousins told Insider adding ""It's almost mission impossible. You can't really do it.""

Even if you can't completely dodge PFAS there are a few easy ways to reduce exposure in your daily life.

Eat at home with minimal grease-resistant packaging

PFAS were developed in the 1940s to resist heat grease stains and water. That means they've ended up in a lot of food packaging. That includes pizza boxes microwave popcorn bags some wrappers and grease-resistant paper.

Restaurants and fast-food chains may use such packaging more than grocery stores do. A 2019 study found that people had lower PFAS levels in their blood after eating at home and higher levels after eating fast food or at restaurants.

Throw out scratched nonstick pans

The coating used in nonstick cookware usually contains PFAS and they can easily leach into your food at high heat and once the coating gets scratched.

The Washington Department of Ecology advises against heating nonstick cookware above 400 degrees Fahrenheit and recommends throwing it out once the nonstick coating scratches. Cast-iron pans are a safe alternative.

Ditch your carpet and stain-resistant fabrics

Other household items like carpeting water-resistant clothing and stain-resistant treatments for fabrics can also contain PFAS. Researchers don't think the chemicals can easily absorb into your body through your skin but those fabrics shed fibers that can travel through the house as dust eventually getting ingested or inhaled.

Vacuum dust and open the windows

PFAS accumulate in dust which lingers in the air and allows humans to breathe the chemicals into their lungs. By dusting and vacuuming regularly along with opening windows to allow for airflow and ventilation you can keep dust levels low in your home and reduce the amount of PFAS you inhale.







Test and maybe treat your drinking water

You can test your water for PFAS through a laboratory certified by your state. If the water exceeds guidelines you may want to consider doing something about it especially if you have children.

Even at very low levels exposure to two of the most common PFAS ‚Äî called PFOA and PFOS ‚Äî has been linked to decreased vaccine response in children. That research prompted the US Environmental Protection Agency to revise its drinking-water guidelines decreasing the safe levels of those substances by a factor of 17000. In August the agency issued a proposal to classify those two PFAS as hazardous substances.

A few types of water filters can diminish PFAS levels though they may not completely remove the chemicals from the water. State environmental departments recommend filtration systems that use reverse osmosis for tap water. They also recommend filter systems that use granular activated carbon (aka charcoal) which can be installed on faucets house-wide or used in a tabletop pitcher but a 2020 study found mixed results from those systems.

If you get your drinking water from a well the EPA recommends testing it regularly and contacting your state environmental or health agency for certified labs and safety standards.

Check before you buy cosmetics

Last year a group of researchers published the results of testing 231 cosmetic products in the US and Canada for PFAS. More than half the products contained indicators of the chemicals.

The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has a public searchable database of cosmetics and personal-care products highlighting ingredients with potential risks to human health such as PFAS like Teflon. They also maintain a map where you can check if you live near a PFAS contamination site.

The Green Science Policy Institute also keeps a list of PFAS-free products including a guide to cosmetics.

Ultimately Cousins said people don't need to be ""super worried"" about low-level exposure since there's no strong evidence of major health impacts across the population. Still reducing PFAS use in consumer products could keep the problem from getting worse in the future.

""I think we should use this to get a bit angry about what's happened and try and make change so that we don't keep doing this"" Cousins said. ""Maybe we have to use [PFAS] in some cases but only when they're absolutely essential. And then we should also try to innovate to try and replace them in the longer term.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2xlYWRlci9uYW1lL2pvaG4tc3RlbG1hY2stb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1Mzc3MDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Stelmack Obituary (2022) - Dupont PA - Times Leader,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/timesleader/name/john-stelmack-obituary?id=36537706 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aW1lc2xlYWRlci9uYW1lL2pvaG4tc3RlbG1hY2stb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1Mzc3MDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwc2NhbGVsaXZpbmdtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYnJhbmRzLW9mLWFpci1jb25kaXRpb25pbmctc3lzdGVtcy1mb3ItbHV4dXJ5LWhvbWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brands of Air Conditioning Systems For Luxury Homes,"When you need a new air conditioning repair company for your luxury homes there are several brands to choose from.

Some Airbnb hosts are charging cleaning fees and asking guests to complete a list of chores.

Frustrated travelers say they've been asked to mow the lawn take out the trash and wash the sheets.

The trend is causing some people to ditch short-term rentals for hotels WSJ reported Friday.

Some Airbnb hosts are requiring guests to complete lengthy chore lists on top of paying cleaning fees up to $375 the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Frustrated travelers have pushed back on social media with some saying they've been asked to take out the trash wash the sheets and even mow the lawn during their stay.

One TikToker @Melworeit said in a viral video that she decided not to book on Airbnb because it charged a $125 cleaning fee and asked guests to take out the garbage remove bed linens run the dishwasher and do a load of laundry.

The post amassed 66000 views and nearly 5000 comments many of which shared similar encounters with Airbnb chore lists.

""If I'm paying $229 a night to stay somewhere plus a $125 cleaning fee I'm not doing any laundry"" the TikToker said. ""I know it's like one load of laundry and it'll take me two minutes to do but it's the principle that really bothers me.""

Another Airbnb guest took to Reddit in July to ask if it was ""normal for a host to tell the guest to mow the lawn themselves?""

""Seems like a strange response given the premium being paid for staying here (to me at least) but if that's standard then I'll roll with it"" the user wrote. ""I just don't want to be penalized/charged/poorly reviewed for 'neglecting' the lawn if I don't do it.""

An Airbnb spokesperson told Insider that while hosts choose their own cleaning fees the company has provided recommendations for keeping the amount reasonable and suggests hosts consider not charging cleaning fees at all. According to the company 45% of global Airbnb listings do not charge a cleaning fee and for those that do the fee on average is less than 10% of the total reservation cost.

""Would you like guests to load dirty dishes into the dishwasher or strip the bed linen before checkout? If so consider charging a very minimal cleaning fee ‚Äì or no fee at all"" the Airbnb host resource page on cleaning fees says. ""With a higher fee guests may expect to just walk away from your space at checkout as they would a hotel room.""

Kimanzi Constable a full-time digital nomad who has stayed in over 100 Airbnbs told Insider that some hosts have asked him to complete chores without providing basic cleaning and laundry supplies.

""Airbnb hosts have asked me to do chores such as take out the garbage when checking out do the dishes clean up and other measures to help the host despite me paying a cleaning fee which can be high these days. I'm more than happy to contribute ‚Äî if I have the supplies needed"" Constable wrote. ""Hosts should either provide all the necessary items or scrap the cleaning fee entirely.""

Mary Healey who lives next door to where the shooting occurred said the neighborhood‚Äôs short-term rentals are out of hand. There is often loud partying at the property she said but the shooting was a next-level disruption.

‚ÄúThat bullet could have been through the garage and through my bedroom and in my head‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty scary.‚Äù

The non-fatal shooting happened near McDowell Road and North Hayden Road at 4 a.m. on Sept. 9. The victim was shot three times according to the Scottsdale Police Department. Police later arrested two people in connection with the shooting.

Opposition to Airbnbs and other short-term rentals was already significant in Scottsdale and other parts of the Valley. Some residents and elected officials say they make neighborhoods less safe and eat up the city‚Äôs desperately-needed housing supply.

A shooting has only added fuel to the fire as community leaders gear up to consider new local restrictions on short-term rentals.

In a written statement provided to The Republic Scottsdale Mayor David Ortega called the shooting ‚Äúa tragic illustration of the problems that vacation rental homes are bringing to our neighborhoods‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthe sense of safety in this neighborhood is shattered.‚Äù

A representative for Airbnb said the property listing has been deactivated while the company investigates.

Short-term rentals and safety

Scottsdale has seen an explosion of Airbnbs Vrbos and other short-term rental listings in recent years. The New York Times recently dubbed the city the ‚Äúbachelorette-party capital of the West"" in part because of the popularity of short-term rental homes where groups of friends can congregate.

Loud parties are a regular complaint to police but concerns about safety are not uncommon. Valley short-term rentals have been host to several shootings and other serious crimes including a 2020 incident where a teenager was shot during a house party.

Super Bowl 2023:Arizona Airbnb hosts get their Phoenix rentals ready

Public safety concerns related to short-term rentals are popping up across the country. A 2021 study by Northeastern University found that higher rates of short-term rental listings in Boston neighborhoods were linked to increased crime. That‚Äôs likely because converting housing units into short-term rentals ‚Äúundermines a neighborhood‚Äôs social organization‚Äù and its natural ability to ‚Äúcounteract and discourage crime‚Äù the study said.

Between July 1 2021 and June 1 2022 Scottsdale police were called to short-term rentals almost 800 times according to city data. And in the first six months of this year roughly half of the nuisance party police service calls citywide were to short-term rentals. A party might be considered a nuisance for many reasons according to Scottsdale Police including underage drinking litter excessive noise or traffic public drunkenness or fights.

In 2021 Scottsdale created a short-term rental working group to address the challenges created by the properties. The city has since enacted new rules based on recommendations from the group including a $1000 penalty for short-term rental owners who fail to respond within one hour to an emergency on their property when contacted by police.

The Scottsdale Police Department is also creating a short-term rental police squad to respond to calls a spokesperson said.

Many public officials and opponents of short-term rental housing in Arizona say short-term rental safety issues as well as concerns of depleting housing stock and driving up rent costs for residents stem in part from a 2016 state law that prohibits cities and towns from banning short-term rentals.

‚ÄúThis hands-off anything goes attitude you wind up with shootings‚Äù said Bill Hunter a Paradise Valley resident and co-founder of Neighbors Not Nightmares a community group that advocates against short-term rentals.

While cities still cannot prohibit short-term rentals a new state law that takes effect this month will give municipalities more leeway to crack down on nuisance properties. The law will allow cities and towns to require short-term rental owners to obtain a license from the municipality. It will also enable municipalities to suspend the licenses of properties that violate local or state law three times in one year.

Ortega said the Scottsdale City Council is planning on reviewing a draft ordinance for a local license requirement on Sept. 20.

Impact on housing affordability

As Arizona grapples with an affordable housing crisis housing advocates worry that vacation rentals are gobbling up homes and depleting the housing stock available for full-time residents.

The state needs 270000 additional homes to tackle its housing crisis according to the Arizona Department of Housing. If short-term rentals were available for residents it would chip away at the housing shortage. There are almost 6000 active Airbnb and Vrbo listings in Scottsdale alone according to AirDNA a company that tracks short-term rental data. Most of those listings are for entire homes not single rooms.

In a recent report the Arizona Housing Coalition said cities‚Äô inability to restrict short-term rentals is one of several barriers to affordable housing in the state particularly in high-tourism areas like Sedona Flagstaff and Scottsdale. Former Sedona City Manager Justin Clifton told The Arizona Republic in 2019 that short-term rentals accounted for 20% of the city‚Äôs entire housing stock.

The Arizona Housing Coalition report highlights steps other communities have taken to balance short-term rentals with preserving their affordable housing: Chicago imposed a tax surcharge for short-term rentals that funds a local housing trust fund and Vail Colorado created a program that incentivizes residents to put a restriction into their home's deed so that only full-time residents can buy or rent it.

Kate Bauer co-founder of the Arizona Neighborhood Alliance said constructing more housing won‚Äôt solve Arizona‚Äôs housing shortage until the short-term rental market is under control.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt fix this problem you‚Äôre never going to fix the housing problem‚Äù Bauer said. ""You can‚Äôt keep building what will essentially be investments for people and not homes for people.‚Äù

ALB,Albemarle Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZWxieXN0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9yZXNpZGVudHMtc3BlYWstb3V0LWFnYWluc3QtbmV3LWRyaXZlLXRoZWF0ZXItYW5kLWNhbXBncm91bmQvODA2MjkwMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residents speak out against new drive-in theater and campground,"The owners of the Hounds Drive-In movie theater and campground in Kings Mountain have plans to open a second location in the county but have run into some road blocks.

A request to rezone property near Grover was denied last week.

The current theater which also included a campground was sold to Albemarle Corp. for $22 million in February of this year. Co-owners and business partners Mike and Preston Brown previously announced that they planned to continue running the businesses for several years. They have a five-year lease with the lithium company.

Now they hope to open a second location at 1256 Cleveland Ave. but requested that it be rezoned from residential to general business. The 50-acre property is located on N.C 226 between Patterson Springs and Grover.

The zoning request was first presented to county commissioners in August and a public hearing was held. Commissioners voted to continue the hearing and a decision until last week's meeting where it faced significant opposition.

The county's land use plan designates the area as secondary growth and encourages the maintaining of a rural area.

When it was presented to the planning board the board voted three to one to deny it because it was inconsistent with the land use plan.

Multiple people spoke during the public comments to speak against the theater and a campground in particular.

Roy James who lives on nearby Silverado Drive was concerned about the potential for crime. He cited multiple issues at the existing Hounds campground including drugs larceny and criminal and civil problems.

Preston Brown said they have three screens at Hounds Drive-in and plan to do the same thing at the new location.

""It is a professionally-run business"" he said. ""We are the number one theater. Not just in drive-ins but all theaters. We want to put it back into the community.""

Brown said he had looked at other cities but ultimately decided he wanted to stay in Cleveland County. He said they learned how to control traffic so it isn't a problem and emphasized there is no noise because people listen to the movie through their car stereos. They also don't have bright lights to ensure people can see the screens.

""We bring in people from all over the states"" Brown said.

He admitted that the campground previously had problems but since he has taken over there haven't been any.

""We may want 25 camp sites in the future"" Brown said. ""But right now we want the theater on the property.""

Natalie Conner a resident of Grover was also strongly opposed to the rezoning and a campground in particular. She voiced concerns about noise and crime.

""I moved to the county for a quieter way of living"" Conner said. ""It will disrupt all of this. We do not want this in our community.""

Others worried that with the increased traffic there would be more wrecks.

Angela McKee said most of the residents in the area live on family farms and her family owns and operates a small farm with cattle and chickens.

""Grover is for farms and families"" she said.

Mike Brown pointed out that the theater brings money back into the county and pays thousands in sales taxes. He said they have been featured in Our State magazine twice.

Brown said they can still build a drive-in theater even if the zoning request is denied they would just have to go about it a different way.

Chris Martin county planning director said because 226 is a state highway zoning already covers 500 feet from the road onto the property and they could utilize that space.

Commissioner and vice-chair Deb Hardin made a motion to deny the request and all but Johnny Hutchins voted against the zoning change.

Or follow us on Google News

I probably saw news of the new Tesla blind spot camera feature when it was introduced in December 2021 and then forgot about it or maybe it was somehow in my social media and Google News blind spot (haha) and I never noticed it at all. Well recently while going through my settings for something else I noticed ‚ÄúAutomatic Blind Spot Camera‚Äù in the Autopilot settings and enabled it. The description says ‚ÄúShow side repeater camera when turn signal is engaged.‚Äù

In short when you turn on a turn signal a video feed of one of your cameras shows up on the bottom left corner of the screen. (Reportedly you will soon be able to move where on the screen the blind spot camera feed shows.)

If you engage the left turn signal you‚Äôll get a video feed from the back left corner of the car. If you engage the right turn signal you‚Äôll get a video feed from the back right corner of the car. Here‚Äôs a short video from the internets showing use of the Automatic Blind Spot Camera feature:

I love this new(ish) feature. It provides great visibility to the areas behind my car where another car may be hiding out and asking for a horrific accident if I start changing lanes or turning without checking the blind spots adequately.

The one downside of the camera feed is that you do have to look down and away from the road for a moment to view it so you still have to remember to use it and you do have to take your eyes off of other potential issues in front of you or on the side of you at the same time that you‚Äôre preparing to change lanes or turn. This is one case where it would truly be nice to have a little screen behind the steering wheel ‚Äî like the IONIQ 5 has (though the IONIQ 5‚Äôs camera feed seems to be notably smaller and thus not quite as useful as Tesla‚Äôs in that respect):

But clearly we‚Äôre not getting that screen added to a Model 3 and I have a bigger request anyway.

The blind spot that has caused me the most risk isn‚Äôt actually one of the ones in the back of the car. It‚Äôs the blind spot caused by the front-right pillar. There have been a handful of instances in which someone (in a car on a bike or walking) was going from right to left at just the same rate as I was moving forward such that they remained hidden behind that pillar for a few seconds or even several seconds.

It seems impossible when you look at the pillar but it happens. It‚Äôs like the magic of a solar eclipse and the fact that the moon is just the right size to perfectly block the much larger sun due to how much further away the sun is. A full car can fit behind the pillar as it drives along a crossroad probably aided in its cover by the rear-view mirror.

Ideally when I turn on my left turn signal I‚Äôd have two blind spot camera feeds pop onto the touchscreen ‚Äî one for the back left and one for the front right.

I know ‚Äî this is probably too much to ask and my wish won‚Äôt be granted. But one can try.

The company already has a significant presence in the State with a long-standing 49 per cent stake in the Greenbushes lithium mine in the South West and a new lithium hydroxide plant at Kemerton as part of a joint venture with Mineral Resources which also involves a 50 per cent stake in the Chris Ellison-led company‚Äôs Wodgina mine in the Pilbara.",,,,,,

When it comes to dividend-paying ASX shares chances are one's mind doesn't immediately spring to the tech sector. There are many sectors on the ASX renowned for their hefty dividend payments. ASX bank shares? Of course. Resources? Definitely. But ASX tech shares? Not so much.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has many famous names in its tech sector. But few are famous for paying dividends. This is not unique to the ASX. Some of the largest tech companies in the world don't pay dividends despite some having mountains of cash on their balance sheet.

Giants like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) have never paid a dividend despite all being valued at over US$1 trillion at various points in time.

But that doesn't mean the ASX has no dividend-paying tech shares. So let's embark on a mission to find the highest-yielding tech share on the ASX today.

So yes plenty of ASX tech shares have never paid out a dividend. This includes Xero Limited (ASX: XRO) Zip Co Ltd (ASX: ZIP) and Block Inc (ASX: SQ2). Block's Afterpay didn't fund any dividends when it was an ASX share either.

But plenty of others do. Some ASX tech shares that currently pay dividends include Altium Limited (ASX: ALU) Appen Ltd (ASX: APX) and WiseTech Global Ltd (ASX: WTC).

Dicker Data dividend dominates the ASX tech sector

But these companies are not even close to being the highest-yielding ASX tech dividend share. That honour probably goes to Dicker Data Ltd (ASX: DDR).

Dicker Data is a company that provides a range of hardware software and cloud-based technology services. It is probably best known for its hardware which includes selling data storage servers networking equipment and more.

This company has spent the past few years cultivating what is now a fairly impressive dividend record. Dicker Data has been paying dividends consistently for over a decade now.

What's more it has managed to deliver a dividend pay rise every single year since 2012. That includes through the COVID-ravaged year of 2020.

In 2011 the company paid out a total of 9 cents per share in dividends. But this year Dicker Data has doled out a total of 26 cents per share in dividends all fully franked.

That gives this company a dividend yield of 4.87% at the market close share price on Friday or 6.96% grossed-up with the full franking.

That is a decent dividend yield by any ASX standards even coming in above what Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) is offering right now. And compared to other ASX tech shares it is certainly a sector leader.",,,

When it comes to dividend-paying ASX shares chances are one's mind doesn't immediately spring to the tech sector. There are many sectors on the ASX renowned for their hefty dividend payments. ASX bank shares? Of course. Resources? Definitely. But ASX tech shares? Not so much.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) has many famous names in its tech sector. But few are famous for paying dividends. This is not unique to the ASX. Some of the largest tech companies in the world don't pay dividends despite some having mountains of cash on their balance sheet.

Giants like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) have never paid a dividend despite all being valued at over US$1 trillion at various points in time.

But that doesn't mean the ASX has no dividend-paying tech shares. So let's embark on a mission to find the highest-yielding tech share on the ASX today.

So yes plenty of ASX tech shares have never paid out a dividend. This includes Xero Limited (ASX: XRO) Zip Co Ltd (ASX: ZIP) and Block Inc (ASX: SQ2). Block's Afterpay didn't fund any dividends when it was an ASX share either.

But plenty of others do. Some ASX tech shares that currently pay dividends include Altium Limited (ASX: ALU) Appen Ltd (ASX: APX) and WiseTech Global Ltd (ASX: WTC).

Dicker Data dividend dominates the ASX tech sector

But these companies are not even close to being the highest-yielding ASX tech dividend share. That honour probably goes to Dicker Data Ltd (ASX: DDR).

Dicker Data is a company that provides a range of hardware software and cloud-based technology services. It is probably best known for its hardware which includes selling data storage servers networking equipment and more.

This company has spent the past few years cultivating what is now a fairly impressive dividend record. Dicker Data has been paying dividends consistently for over a decade now.

What's more it has managed to deliver a dividend pay rise every single year since 2012. That includes through the COVID-ravaged year of 2020.

In 2011 the company paid out a total of 9 cents per share in dividends. But this year Dicker Data has doled out a total of 26 cents per share in dividends all fully franked.

That gives this company a dividend yield of 4.87% at the market close share price on Friday or 6.96% grossed-up with the full franking.

That is a decent dividend yield by any ASX standards even coming in above what Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) is offering right now. And compared to other ASX tech shares it is certainly a sector leader."
MO,Altria,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE3LzItZGl2aWRlbmQta2luZy1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tbWFrZS15b3UtbW9uZXktaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Dividend King Stocks That Can Make You Money in Your Sleep,"Target and Altria look well positioned to continue rewarding investors.

When it comes to dividend stocks there's nothing more important than reliability. Retirees and other investors rely on dividend stocks to pay them consistently so if you're an income investor you want to make sure you choose stocks that can pay you in good times and bad.

A great place to find these stocks is the list of Dividend Kings S&P 500 members that have raised their dividend payouts every year for at least 50 years. That's a period of time that includes the coronavirus pandemic the financial crisis the dot-com crash double-digit inflation in the early 80s and the energy crisis of the 1970s.

Only 42 stocks get to claim this title. It's a group that covers several industries though the majority of the companies are either in consumer goods or industrials. If you're looking for dividend stocks you can count on to keep printing money two great choices today are Target (TGT -0.53%) and Altria (MO 1.02%).

1. Target: An underappreciated growth story

In the retail industry most investors seem to think that Amazon is destroying everything in its path. While the e-commerce giant has turned the industry upside down some brick-and-mortar retailers are still thriving. Target is one of them. In fact Target stock has even outperformed Amazon over the last five years as the chart below shows though both have fallen in the recent market sell-off.

Target has delivered strong growth thanks to a unique multi-pronged strategy. First the company has invested in store-based fulfillment. Unlike Amazon or Walmart Target aims to use its stores to fulfill nearly all of its digital orders and it's prioritized same-day fulfillment options like curbside pick up and delivery through Shipt the Instacart competitor it acquired in 2017.

The retailer has also invested in its private-label owned brands which generate higher margins than name brands and reinforce customer loyalty as customers can only get those products from Target. The retailer now owns at least 10 billion-dollar brands and it continues to launch new ones.

Target is also aggressively opening small-format stores in underserved neighborhoods in cities and college towns across the country a high return-on-investment strategy that pairs well with its focus on same-day fulfillment. The small-format stores are also something that rivals like Amazon Walmart and Costco can't match therefore giving Target a competitive advantage.

Target has struggled this year -- it's been hit by excess inventory like many of its peers and faces difficult comparisons with its performance a year ago as consumer spending shifts back to services. But the company still seems poised for reliable long-term growth. Over the long term the company is aiming for high-single-digit earnings-per-share growth which combined with a modest valuation and a dividend yield of 2.6% sets the company up well to deliver double-digit annual returns.

Target's track record of 51 years of dividend hikes should also give investors confidence that it will continue to raise its quarterly payout.

2. Altria: An unbeatable dividend powerhouse

If you like dividends it's hard to find a better stock than Altria (MO 1.02%) the domestic parent of Marlboro. The tobacco company currently offers a dividend yield of 9% better than any other Dividend King and has a track record of 53 straight years of increases dating back to before its 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris.

Dividends are the principal reason investors hold Altria stock and the management team knows that. Altria just raised its quarterly dividend by 4.4% to $0.94 marking its 57th increase in 53 years. The company has a dividend payout ratio target of 80% meaning it aims to pay out 80% of profits as dividends.

Though cigarette sales have been declining in the U.S. for decades Altria has managed to continue growing earnings per share thanks largely to price increases and share repurchases -- even if operating profits are flat. Despite cigarette volumes falling 11% in the most recent quarter revenue after excise taxes was down just 0.7% because of price increases.

What's also noteworthy about Altria's growing dividend and earnings per share is that they've come in spite of disastrous investments in JUUL and Cronos Group which have led to billions of dollars in write-downs.

Altria will eventually have to transition away from smokeable products and its partnership to sell Philip Morris' IQOS product seems like the most promising next-gen opportunity right now. Bt management has demonstrated its ability to grow earnings per share in a declining industry for a long time.

Investors should feel confident in Altria's dividend payout and its 9% yield makes it an attractive way to ride out the bear market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

So far neither the government nor private plaintiffs have prevailed in cases arguing that Amazon's tactics are illegal. A similar case brought by Washington DC's attorney general was dismissed in May. However this time just might be different antitrust lawyers and economists say. Amazon is coercing sellers into a price war that only the e-commerce giant can win the California case argues.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs certainly an anticompetitive story to be told but to me there‚Äôs also a compelling free rider defense for Amazon‚Äù said Penn State Law professor John Lopatka who's referring to Amazon's concern that sellers will use Amazon's platform to generate interest in their products then sell them elsewhere.

Bonta's suit is distinct from other antitrust cases that have targeted Amazon's seller terms as it alleges violations under California law narrows the so-called ""relevant market"" and focuses on the company's alleged punishment of seller behavior.

But the case is still one that's difficult to prove Lopatka said. That's in part because Amazon's seller agreements technically permit sellers to set their own prices and in part because of Amazon's push to feature the lowest possible price ‚Äî both tend to appear as policies that foster competition.

In reality the complaint alleges Amazon artificially inflates prices on rival retail websites ‚Äî such as Walmart.com (WMT) Target.com (TGT) and eBay.com (EBAY) ‚Äî and even on sellers' own websites by coercing its third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers to lower prices for goods sold online.

'It's a nightmare'

According to the claims Amazon penalizes sellers for failing to get the price right by demoting products in search results and disqualifying products from the ‚ÄúBuy Box‚Äù feature which allows shoppers to add their products into a checkout cart the lawsuit claims. For wholesalers Amazon‚Äôs agreements require sellers to refund the company for price gaps in the event that their product is offered for less on a competing website.

""It‚Äôs a nightmare"" said Lesley Hensell co-founder of Riverbend Consulting a firm that helps third-party Amazon sellers reactivate their suspended accounts. She says accounts are suspended when Amazon identifies certain sellers as failing to meet its pricing expectations citing what's known as a ""high pricing error."" Without warning Amazon's systems automatically deactivate the seller's product listing she said.

""No-one can deal with that kind of uncertainty in their business"" Hensell said. ""I can tell you that sometimes the high pricing errors are completely inaccurate. To remedy the problem sellers must adjust prices downward until they are low enough to reactivate the product listing."" Sellers often struggle to sell at a profit under those demands Hensell said especially as their own manufacturing supply and shipping costs escalate.

Heller said that while she's never known Amazon to retaliate against sellers who are targeted by the company for raising their prices she also knows sellers are reluctant to criticize Amazon for their troubles.

""For some of these people it is their personal income or their revenue fuels a business with a lot of employees they care about"" Heller said. ""When challenging things happen in their account even if they think it's unfair they're often afraid to speak up publicly or even to escalate the issue within Amazon. They fear it will put a target on their back.""

Amazon's succeeded in winning antitrust fights so far

One reason for Amazon's past success disputing antitrust claims is its argument that its low price edicts promote more not less competition driving down prices for goods sold online.

‚ÄúThis is a common misconception‚Äù Yale University economics professor Florian Ederer told Yahoo Finance. ‚ÄúIt sounds like it would be pro-competitive but it is actually anti-competitive.‚Äù

In March 2022 a judge dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine. Racine argued that Amazon violated the district‚Äôs Antitrust Act because its contracts prevented sellers from offering lower prices for their products on competing websites. Given the requirement Racine alleged that Amazon's approximate 40% commission on sales further drove up online prices.

Another antitrust case against Amazon is still playing out in Seattle where a class of consumers lost part of Amazon's request to dismiss federal antitrust claims yet convinced a judge to maintain part of their case. According to the judge Amazon's requirement that sellers add Amazon fees to the cost of their products ‚Äî even those sold elsewhere ‚Äî could potentially run afoul of federal anti-competition law.

Amazon has maintained its position that its policies promote competition in a statement to Yahoo Finance saying: ""Like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively. The relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law.‚Äù

In 2019 under the threat of investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and regulators in Germany Amazon dropped a provision from its seller contracts commonly referred to as a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù (MFN) clause. The provision required sellers to offer items for sale on Amazon on the most favorable terms when compared to other online retail platforms.

The California complaint alleges that Amazon's seller penalties are much like the ones that Hensell describes and achieve the same force as its prior MFN provisions.

‚ÄúAbsent these agreements a greater selection and total output of lower-priced products would be available across online stores‚Äù the complaint states.

Ederer explains that true price floors are only exposed without Amazon‚Äôs restrictions on sellers. Sellers who offer the same products on their own platforms he explains would tend to sell at a slightly lower price than on Amazon or on other online retail sites because outside retailers take a cut of their sales revenue in exchange for carrying the product and exposing it to their consumer base.

As a seller Ederer says ‚ÄúI could completely give up on Amazon but then I'm going to lose all of that revenue and not be able to sell on Amazon. Instead what I do is because Amazon is punishing me for charging a higher price on my own platform I raise the price on my own platform.‚Äù

Lopatka explains that the effect California‚Äôs trying to prove ‚Äî that Amazon is responsible for higher prices on other websites ‚Äî is also difficult to isolate.

Ederer agrees. ‚ÄúAmazon essentially makes that very very difficult by these implicit MFNs‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to require a fair amount of evidence‚Ä¶That‚Äôs the type of evidence that the judge felt wasn‚Äôt really there in the DC case.‚Äù He questions whether sellers can provide enough evidence that they are being downgraded in search results or deprived of the Buy Box to prevail in the California case.

New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox views California's case as one with potentially compelling legal arguments though she expects it to play out on ideological rather than legal terms.

‚ÄúA conservative judge is more likely to dismiss the case‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe conservative philosophy presumes that markets work well and are self-correcting and are reluctant to apply antitrust.‚Äù

Fox adds that she expects scenarios like this one to play out across more states.

""States are very much on top of the Big Tech issues"" she said.

The cheapest base model had paltry storage bitsy battery life and a slow low-resolution screen. Meanwhile the extravagant Kindle Oasis luxuriated in its sleek aluminum chassis fully adjustable lighting big battery and physical buttons for turning pages.

But the models have slowly begun to blend together with the less expensive Kindles adopting premium features previously only found in the Oasis. The mid-tier Paperwhite got some sprucing up in 2021 when Amazon added adjustable lighting and a USB-C port. (It‚Äôs still WIRED's pick for best e-reader.) At last Amazon is juicing up the base-model Kindle as well.

The new Kindle gets an upgraded display‚Äîa 300-ppi-resolution screen versus the previous Kindle‚Äôs 197 ppi. Storage is doubled to 16 GB. The new Kindle also‚Äîfinally!‚Äîfeatures a USB-C port like the newest Paperwhite models. It charges in as little as two hours over USB-C.

Unfortunately the prices have started to converge too. The new base-model Kindle costs $100 which is 10 bucks more than the previous version. Spend another $20 and you get a version that doesn‚Äôt bombard you with ads on the lock screen.

Here‚Äôs some more news from the world of consumer technology.

Alexa Speaks Brand

The worst thing about searching for something on Google is all the ads that show up at the top of the page. Well now Amazon is planning something like that for its Echo smart speakers.

In a blog post with the not-at-all-dystopian title ‚ÄúAlexa Can Now Help Brands Answer Customer Questions‚Äù Amazon laid out a new business strategy that will allow brands to provide answers to user questions that might relate to the products the brand wants to sell. Amazon gave an example of asking Alexa how to remove pet hair from the carpet. Such a query could cause a brand-backed response to spring forth offering to send you links to Amazon pages selling the brand‚Äôs products.

In Amazon‚Äôs brand registry system sellers will be able to view common user questions and attach their branded answers to them. Amazon says the questions and branded answers will be reviewed by content moderators before they can be used by Alexa. Amazon insists these are not ads and that brands won‚Äôt be able to pay to submit answers. The company also says branded answers will be attributed to the brand that answered them but it didn‚Äôt elaborate on what form that disclosure would take.

The company plans to test the feature starting in October then roll it out across the US after that.

TikTok Wants to BeReal

Every app is trying to be TikTok but sometimes the viral video-sharing app has to play a bit of catch-up itself.

If you are hip and cool (read: young) then surely you know about BeReal. The popular app prompts users with a notification at a random time every day that reads ‚ÄúTime to BeReal.‚Äù Users then have two minutes to snap a photo that captures images from both the front and back cameras. The results are quick and candid; the point of catching people unawares is to encourage more ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù moments than the carefully staged shots you see on platforms like Instagram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJlc3RpbmdlbmdpbmVlcmluZy5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9mb3Jlc3QtaXNsYW5kcy1jcmVhdGVkLWluLWFtYXpvbi1hcmVudC13b3JraW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thousands of forest islands created in the Amazon rainforest aren't working ‚Äî here's why,"That‚Äôs the theory at least. And the Balbina Dam gave us a perfect chance to see it in practice.

22 forest islands 608 species

Over the past decade or so scientists from many different institutions have made huge efforts to investigate which species are vanishing and which are persisting in the Balbina reservoir. In this study we were able to compile those efforts.

In particular we studied 22 forest islands of varying sizes. We also looked at three nearby sites that were connected to the main forest and weren‚Äôt islands which we considered as a baseline reflecting the scenario before damming. We recorded 608 species representing eight biological groups: medium and large mammals small mammals (excluding bats) diurnal lizards (active during the daytime) understorey birds frogs dung beetles orchid bees and trees.

Our results are now published in Science Advances. We found that just a few larger islands held most of the diversity and had complete or nearly complete species assemblages. Meanwhile smaller islands suffered. There only more adaptable species like armadillos or rodent acouchis were able to survive for over three decades. These medium-sized animals can occupy relatively small areas. In contrast bigger mammals such as tapirs and jaguars need more space and might have vanished even from mid-size islands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2Nhc3RpbmcuY29tL3dpbGwtYW1hem9uLXByaW1lLXN1cGVyLWJvd2wv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Amazon Prime Get a Super Bowl?,"The Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers played the first-ever NFL game exclusively on a streaming service on Thursday. The game was compelling (a 27-24 Chiefs win) the broadcast was solid (Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit) and best of all for Jeff Bezos and Rodger Goodell ‚Äî who prominently watched the game from a skybox ‚Äî Amazon Prime Video didn‚Äôt crash. That‚Äôs a low bar for Amazon to clear but the Ney York Post‚Äôs sports media insider Andrew Marchand says it was the first step to an Amazon Prime Super Bowl.

Will the NFL put a Super Bowl on Amazon Prime Video?

Amazon Prime Video kicked off its NFL broadcasts on September 15 2022. Some viewers struggled with their own internet issues and the sound at the beginning of the Chiefs vs. Chargers game was a little rough but other than that it was a rousing success.

After Jeff Bezos‚Äô company paid the NFL around $1 billion a year for the rights to broadcast this game and for Amazon it‚Äôs an investment in the future.

This TNF game likely got 7-8 million viewers (numbers will be out next week) according to New York Post sports media critic Andrew Marchand on the Dan Patrick Show. That‚Äôs under the projected 12.5 million but still good enough to call Amazon‚Äôs first foray into football a success.

On the sports talk show on Friday Dan Patrick asked Marchand if this is the first step toward Amazon Prime eventually being the exclusive broadcaster of the NFL‚Äôs crown jewel the Super Bowl.

Right now Amazon has a chance to get playoff games under the current deal if the streamer hits certain numbers on Thursday nights. However Marchand says that while a Super Bowl is possible and will likely happen someday it won‚Äôt be in the next few years.

‚ÄúThe issue is everyone‚Äôs going to have to be able to get the stream perfectly‚Äù Marchand told Patrick. ‚ÄòAnd I think people act like that‚Äôs impossible ‚Äî and maybe it is I don‚Äôt know the technology ‚Äî but where will we be five ten years from now.‚Äù

Marchand‚Äôs guess is that we‚Äôll be in a place where Amazon gets a Super Bowl:

To answer your question do I think they‚Äôll get it next contract? I‚Äôd probably say no if I were predicting. The one after that? I can see Amazon in play for that. But even maybe next contract. I mean they have more money than anybody. That‚Äôs the scary thing for the networks when they compete with Amazon and Apple. Andrew Marchand on an Amazon Prime Super Bowl

An Amazon Prime Video Super Bowl is on the horizon and that makes perfect sense with the history of the NFL and its broadcasting partners.

The NFL on streaming is the logical evolution of pro football broadcasting

Amazon Thursday Night Football coverage | Leslie Plaza Johnson/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)

The NFL has long been the king of sports on television in the United States. There are fewer games than any other major pro sport and they are concentrated on only a few days a week unlike almost any other league.

Up until the 1990s the NFL was the exclusive domain of the big three broadcast networks. From the AFL/NFL merger in 1970 until the mid-‚Äô90s you could only find pro football in America on ABC NBC and CBS.

In 1987 looking to get a piece of the booming cable market the NFL created a new timeslot ‚Äî Sunday nights ‚Äî and gave those games to a little cable network called ESPN. This move not only continued to expand the NFL‚Äôs popularity but also legitimized ESPN (and cable as a whole in many ways) turning the four-letter channel into the behemoth it is today.

Seven years later in 1994 the fledgling Fox Network was scratching and clawing to try to reach the level of ABC NBC and CBS.

To do this Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs company bid $1.58 million over four years to steal CBS‚Äôs Sunday afternoon NFL package. The bid was over $100 million per year bigger than CBS‚Äôs offer and Fox NFL Sunday was born.

The move legitimized Fox as a major network and is why there are four major networks today not just three.

Now in 2022 the NFL is doing it again.

Cable providers are in their dying days and streaming services are picking up the households‚Äô cable is losing at an increasingly fast rate. The NFL once again gave credibility to streaming as the future of television by awarding Amazon the Thursday Night Football package.

Pro football has always been on the cutting edge of television (and has always made billions by being there). Right now is no different which is why someday a Super Bowl will be on Amazon and likely other streaming services as well.

That's the outlook from airlines and the tourism industry going into the fall travel season and looking forward to the winter holidays.

Hopper a travel agency that analyzes data for airfare price predictions is seeing strong booking demand for holiday travel after an ""extraordinary"" summer.

The pent-up demand after two pandemic years is in part because for some travelers this will be the first time they visit family for the holidays since COVID-19 erupted said Hopper spokeswoman Lindsay Schwimer.

""Last year omicron was surging around the holiday season so people will be eager to take holiday trips this year and see family and friends"" she said.

U.S. airline employment in June 2022 increased by 6775 workers to a total of 767263 including 458136 full-time passenger airline workers according to the most recent data from the Department of Transportation. That's an increase from the same month in 2019 before the pandemic.

Three airlines drove the increase: Delta Air Lines hired 2981 people that month United Airlines added 1322 and Southwest Airlines added 1007.

Airlines for America a trade group representing U.S. airlines said its seven-member passenger carriers ‚Äì Alaska American Delta Hawaiian JetBlue Southwest and United ‚Äì were staffed with 10% more pilots per block hour compared with before the pandemic.

(In the airline industry block hours measure the time from when an aircraft's door closes at departure to when it opens at arrival.)

American Airlines hired about 12000 people across a variety of job categories last year Isom said during the conference. He also said the company is ""making good progress"" as American continued hiring through the summer to prepare for the coming months.

But there will be fewer flights this fall

Despite the staffing growth airlines still don't have enough workers to meet the demand.

Many responded by removing flights from their schedules.

""Flight schedules for September and October are down by 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels and carriers are reducing September flights by 5% compared to what was planned at the start of the summer"" Airlines for America spokeswoman Marli Collier said.

""Airlines set their schedules months in advance and are constantly evaluating to optimize performance and prioritize smooth operations.""

American Airlines which operates the majority of flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport recently published its final schedule for November that showed 30000 fewer flights.

A spokesman for American Airlines Brian Metham said the airline works off what it calls a ""placeholder schedule"" which is published about a year in advance and adjusts it closer to the time the flights are scheduled.

Its final schedule is published about 100 days in advance he said. On average American operates nearly 5300 departures daily nationwide.

American's full-year flight capacity for 2022 is forecast to end about 7.5% to 9.5% lower than before the pandemic Metham said.

How to book your holiday 2022 flights

‚ñ∫ Don't delay: Industry experts suggest travelers book their flights as soon as possible.

Now through Oct. 20 is when consumers will find the best airfares for Thanksgiving and the December holidays Schwimer said. Higher prices and limited options are likely after mid-October.

""There are still deals available now for the holidays which is why we recommend booking as soon as you see a price you‚Äôre comfortable with"" she said.

‚ñ∫ Save money by flying off-peak: Avoiding peak travel days can result in savings.

Expedia found in its flight data for Thanksgiving that travelers could save an average 5% on airfare by flying on the Sunday Monday or Tuesday before the holiday instead of Wednesday.

""For some destinations the savings are even bigger ‚Äì average ticket prices for Las Vegas for example drop from around $550 to $380 (round trip) just by changing the departure date to earlier in the week"" said Francheska Taveras spokeswoman for the Expedia Group.

‚ñ∫ The two best days to fly: For travelers flexible on their dates or waiting until the last minute Schwimer said the best deals for the holidays are when the fewest travelers are expected: Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful to see those new power lines‚Äù Elder Uchtdorf said. ‚ÄúI was told that before [the community was electrified] everyone tried to clean up their properties to make it a real occasion for when the light was turned on. The light was brought in and I think that‚Äôs what we need to do ‚Äî we need to bring light to people.‚Äù

Elder Uchtdorf also applauded the multiagency efforts to fund the project through various state and Navajo Nation resources.

‚ÄúWe are only adding to those [contributions] from the community‚Äù the Apostle said. ‚ÄúThe Church is so grateful when we can pitch in and help and it shows when we counsel together we are all on the same team. I think if we move closer together and lift where we stand no situation in the world could keep us from being successful.‚Äù

Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) water services will also be brought into the Din√© community with the project expected to be completed in the spring of 2023. The project also procures a new deepwater well for Blanding City.

Lena Hutchinson-Lovell is one of about 100 residents who live in the Westwater community where 19 of 29 lots have been electrified since September 1. Previously Hutchinson-Lovell‚Äôs family relied on a generator for their energy needs. Other homes also relied on alternative power sources such as domestic wind turbines and solar panels.

‚ÄúWe never had electricity. We used flashlights and kerosene lanterns. The generator was costing us $20 per day to fill up the gas to last for six hours‚Äù Hutchinson-Lovell said. ‚ÄúNow that I can turn on the porch light it keeps my kids safe at night when they come home late. It feels good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small group and about 100 people affected ‚Äî but are we our brother‚Äôs keeper?

Some solar industry groups and researchers say that level of concentration poses a risk to the solar supply chain. They also argue that moving production elsewhere could decrease solar‚Äôs carbon footprint and avoid companies accused of using forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In the US the Inflation Reduction Act promises funds for restarting idle polysilicon factories and investing in manufacturing of other solar components. But companies must still turn that momentum into solar panels.

Wacker Chemie‚Äôs chemical plant in Charleston Tennessee is large enough to have its own street system. Lettered streets run roughly east to west intersecting numbered avenues at perfect 90¬∞ angles.

The 220-hectare site produces polysilicon a key material used to make solar panels and computer chips. Two pipe-covered distillation systems the length of football fields tower over Second Avenue while reactors used to make polysilicon occupy an entire block between C Street and D Street.

Site Leader Ken Collins says Wacker has already invested nearly $3 billion in the plant and the site is still growing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actively looking at things in F‚Äù he says pointing to the location of a future street on the edge of the facility. ‚ÄúAnd then long term it goes well beyond.‚Äù

Wacker is in the midst of spending $200 million to add the production of silicone polymers. Collins says the property is also laid out to allow for polysilicon expansion. Wacker hasn‚Äôt announced specific plans for new polysilicon infrastructure but national governments and the solar industry are pushing to increase production in places like Tennessee.

Producers don‚Äôt want to rely upon unstable sources. James May CEO REC Silicon

Most of the world‚Äôs polysilicon is made in China and the US solar industry is encouraging suppliers to increase production elsewhere. Solar companies argue that a less-concentrated supply chain will be more resilient emit less carbon and circumvent companies accused of using forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The US and Indian governments recently added momentum to this endeavor pledging billions of dollars to scale up domestic solar manufacturing and guarantee future access to clean energy.

Some companies are already responding. Reliance Energy says it will spend $7.5 billion on a green energy manufacturing hub in India that will include polysilicon production. The other two companies that make polysilicon in the US‚ÄîHemlock Semiconductor and REC Silicon‚Äîare also ramping up production. Hemlock turned on idle capacity for solar-grade polysilicon at its plant in Michigan this summer and REC Silicon plans to reopen a polysilicon facility in Washington. ‚ÄúProducers don‚Äôt want to rely upon unstable sources‚Äù REC Silicon CEO James May says.

Even with all that momentum challenging China‚Äôs preeminence in solar manufacturing will not be easy. In addition to its massive polysilicon capacity Chinese companies control the subsequent steps in the supply chain: the production of silicon ingot and wafers solar cells and final solar panels. Supply chain experts say other countries must build up capacity in those parts of the supply chain as well if they are to decrease the risk of disruptions. And polysilicon makers outside China must prove they can compete with rivals in China that have access to ample government support.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) an industry group argues that incentives in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will kick-start US solar production eventually making it competitive with China. Over the next 8 years SEIA hopes companies will build US factories capable of making 50 GW of solar panels per year nearly enough to power every home in Texas.

‚ÄúMaybe half of that crosses the finish line‚Äù Collins says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a lot of polysilicon demand. Much more than the three producers in the US make today.‚Äù

The process

Polysilicon is at the heart of a solar panel. Small amounts of other elements are added to polysilicon so that one side of the material has extra electrons. When sunlight hits a solar cell it displaces those extra electrons. They flow to the opposite side of the cell which has molecules that can accept them. The flow of electrons creates an electric current.

The process for making polysilicon starts in mines extracting quartzite which is essentially gravel with high levels of silicon dioxide and low levels of impurities like iron. Many of those mines are in China but quartzite reserves are abundant in Brazil Norway and the US. The gravel is melted down in a furnace with a carbon source usually coal or charcoal to produce silicon metal silvery-gray rocks that are at least 98% silicon.

Companies like Wacker use the Siemens process to remove the remaining impurities. The resulting polysilicon is a crystallized form of silicon that needs to be at least 99.9999% pure for solar applications‚Äîand even purer for computer chips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really technical plant that turns silver rocks into silver rocks‚Äù Collins says of the facility he leads.

In the first step at the Tennessee plant the silicon metal is crushed into a powder and combined with hydrogen chloride at high temperatures to form liquid trichlorosilane. Wacker distills the liquid in spiraling columns several stories tall to increase the purity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very similar to what you do to a bourbon‚Äù Collins says.

The purified trichlorosilane is converted to gas and pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a filament of polysilicon about the diameter of a pencil. Some companies use silane gas instead. Electricity runs through the filament illuminating it like a light bulb and increasing its temperature to 1000 ¬∞C. At those high temperatures silicon from the trichlorosilane slowly deposits onto the filament gradually turning it into a thick rod. As a final step the rod is broken into chunks.

MAKING POLYSILICON To create the polysilicon‚Äîa crystallized form of nearly pure silicon‚Äîneeded for solar panels manufacturers begin with quartzite gravel a compound that contains silicon dioxide. The multistep process results in 99.9999% silicon. Step 1: Quartzite gravel containing silicon dioxide is the starting material for polysilicon. Step 2: The quartz is melted down to silicon metal which is at least 98% pure silicon. Step 3: Silicon metal is combined with hydrogen chloride to form liquid trichlorosilane. Step 4: Impurities are removed by distilling the trichlorosilane. Step 5: Trichlorosilane is pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a thin filament of polysilicon. Electricity runs through the filament heating it to 1000 ¬∞C. Step 6: The silicon deposits onto the filament turning it into a thick rod that is at least 99.9999% silicon. Step 7: The rods are broken into chunks and sold to companies that make silicon wafers for solar panels.

Some companies such as REC Silicon use a slightly different method called the fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) process. REC Silicon says the FBR process uses less energy. Companies using the Siemens process have to use lots of energy to heat the filament but they also have to use additional energy to cool the walls of the reaction chamber so that silicon doesn‚Äôt deposit there.

At the start the FBR process looks similar to the Siemens process with conversion of silicon metal into silane. But then the gas flows through a column seeded with tiny polysilicon beads rather than a chamber with a filament. Silicon deposits on the beads which grow into polysilicon spheres a few millimeters wide.

Beads from the FBR process or chunks from the Siemens process are sold to companies that turn them into cubed ingots which are sawed into paper-thin wafers. The wafers are textured and treated with other elements to turn them into individual solar cells. Multiple cells are soldered and sandwiched between a glass panel and a plastic back sheet to form solar panels.

Outsourcing

It‚Äôs a complex process and China dominates nearly every step of it. The country makes more than three-quarters of the world‚Äôs polysilicon according to data compiled by polysilicon consultant Johannes Bernreuter. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China also manufactures over 80% of all solar cells and assembled solar panels. The country produces virtually all the wafers used for solar panels.

It wasn‚Äôt always this way. In 2010 polysilicon production was split almost evenly among the US Europe South Korea Japan and China. In 2014 the US had nearly a dozen factories producing ingots and wafers according to SEIA data. Today there are none. The IEA estimates that companies in China have invested more than $40 billion in solar manufacturing since 2014 15 times what companies in North America have invested.

Bernreuter says the Chinese government fueled the growth of the country‚Äôs solar industry by offering favorable loans affordable land and cheap electricity. ‚ÄúChina early on recognized that solar will be a huge market‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey have strategically bet on that industry and supported it.‚Äù

US polysilicon producers also suffered a blow in 2014 when China imposed an import tariff cutting off US facilities from some of their most important customers.

Hemlock and Wacker were both building polysilicon plants in Tennessee when the tariffs took hold. Hemlock abandoned its $1 billion project in Clarksville in 2014 as it was on the verge of starting up. Wacker originally intended to focus on the solar market but shifted production to semiconductor-grade silicon when its plant came on line in 2016. In 2019 the tariffs forced REC Silicon to mothball its $1.7 billion polysilicon plant in Moses Lake Washington.

Heymi Bahar an IEA analyst who directed the organization‚Äôs report says China‚Äôs investment helped decrease the price of solar panels but also concentrated too much production in one place.

The report notes that a single factory in China produces 14% of the world‚Äôs polysilicon. In 2020 an explosion at a plant operated by China‚Äôs GCL-Tech temporarily halted a tenth of the world‚Äôs production capacity according to a report from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ‚ÄúIf there is a supply chain disruption the whole world is affected‚Äù Bahar says.

Xinjiang

Because China gets much of its electricity from coal-fired power plants making polysilicon and other solar materials outside China would also reduce the industry‚Äôs carbon footprint some companies and sustainability researchers argue.

Michael Parr executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance an industry group says the heat used to deposit silicon from trichlorosilane onto the rod requires enormous amounts of power so production is usually located in places where electricity is cheap.

‚ÄúIn China that means western China in Xinjiang . . . and increasingly Inner Mongolia where the grid is almost entirely coal based‚Äù Parr says.

He estimates that polysilicon made in China is three times as carbon intensive as polysilicon from other countries largely because of the Chinese electricity grid‚Äôs reliance on coal. The IEA reports that even the most carbon-intensive solar panels make up for all their manufacturing-related emissions in less than a year by generating carbon-free electricity but Parr still wants to see production move to places that have access to cleaner electricity grids. He says cheap power from hydroelectricity plants works especially well for polysilicon production.

Dominating solar



REC Silicon‚Äôs Washington plant will run on hydropower and the company boasts that the FBR process it uses will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hemlock the largest single energy user in Michigan also says it has access to renewable energy that reduces polysilicon‚Äôs carbon footprint.

Reliance on coal-based power isn‚Äôt the US solar industry‚Äôs only concern with the Xinjiang region. In May of last year Laura Murphy a human rights professor at Sheffield Hallam University coauthored a report accusing four of the largest polysilicon makers in Xinjiang as well as companies that supply them with silicon metal of participating in a forced labor program operated by the Chinese government.

Murphy says the labor program conducted ostensibly to increase economic prosperity in a poor region forces everyone in Xinjiang with Uyghur or Kazakh background to have a job. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the case even if they have to be forcibly placed there by a government agency‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere are government agents who go door to door.‚Äù

Murphy says China‚Äôs government will separate Uyghur and Kazakh families take away their land and even demolish whole villages essentially forcing them to leave their homes and work in their assigned jobs.

There is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect. Alan Crawford polysilicon consultant

An environmental social and governance report from Daqo New Energy a polysilicon maker with operations in Xinjiang denies that the company uses forced labor and says its suppliers have signed declarations attesting that they don‚Äôt use forced labor. A spokesperson for the company declined to answer specific questions. Other major polysilicon makers in Xinjiang‚ÄîGCL-Tech Xinte Energy and East Hope Group‚Äîdid not respond to emailed questions.

The evidence of forced labor use was strong enough that earlier this year the US government started enforcing a ban on essentially all products made in Xinjiang. Parr expects the ban to have a big effect. ‚ÄúThe game has changed and easy access to Chinese solar is a thing of the past‚Äù he says.

Polysilicon consultant Alan Crawford says polysilicon is made in other places in China without forced labor and with a lower carbon footprint. The problem is that ethically produced polysilicon‚Äîfrom other parts of China or other countries‚Äîmust flow through ingot factories in China where it‚Äôs blended with polysilicon from Xinjiang making it almost impossible to say with certainty whether a solar panel was made without forced labor. ‚ÄúThere is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect‚Äù Crawford says.

Jill Engel-Cox director of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory says companies buying solar panels are starting to pay more attention to such issues. She says there‚Äôs an expectation that renewable energy projects will benefit the world broadly‚Äînot just its climate.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been so focused on economics making them as cheap as possible which is important because they need to be able to compete with other types of energy‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut now how do we consider the social benefit and the environmental benefit?‚Äù

REshoring

The US‚Äôs ban on solar products from Xinjiang the ongoing trade war between China and the US and the current difficulties of shipping products across the ocean are problems for AES Clean Energy a power company that buys lots of solar panels. President Leonardo Moreno says the supply of panels coming from China has become unreliable. ‚ÄúWe have to build hundreds of megawatts of renewables in the US. We want a supply chain that‚Äôs stable‚Äù he says.

AES is part of a consortium of solar companies trying to incentivize a more resilient supply chain in the US. The consortium is promising to spend more than $6 billion on solar panels as long as suppliers set up US manufacturing operations. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what gives them certainty‚Äù Moreno says. ‚ÄúThey can build and the demand will be there.‚Äù

To encourage production outside China and avoid supply chain risks IEA analyst Bahar says governments also need to offer solar manufacturers support. He says they should use tax policies or incentive schemes to reduce the start-up costs for polysilicon manufacturers and ensure that they have access to cheap electricity just as China has done.

In August US president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. It offers a direct tax credit for the production of solar-grade polysilicon and also offers incentives for other parts of the supply chain like ingot and wafer manufacturing.

In an investor call the day after the signing REC Silicon‚Äôs May said the tax credits were a big part of the company‚Äôs decision to restart operations at its plant in Washington. The company expects to receive $48 million in credits annually once the facility is operating at full capacity.

The South Korean company Hanwha Solutions which made a major investment in REC Silicon earlier this year is scouting out sites in Texas South Carolina and Georgia for a facility to produce ingots wafers and solar panels according to documents filed with the Texas comptroller‚Äôs office. If the project moves forward the company says it would begin operating in 2025. SPI Energy hopes to set up wafer production in the US by 2023 and Convalt Energy hopes to be producing wafers in upstate New York by 2024.

Building wafer manufacturing in the US would have a domino effect Bernreuter says and likely complete a solar supply chain outside China. ‚ÄúIf you solve that step of the value chain I think a lot of the other steps could follow relatively easily‚Äù he says.

The US could also avoid silicon-based solar panels altogether by using another technology: thin-film cadmium telluride which makes up about 5% of the global solar market. First Solar the largest producer of cadmium telluride panels has operations in the US Malaysia and Vietnam and will soon add a base in India.

The same forces fueling the growth of silicon-based solar manufacturing outside China are also boosting cadmium telluride. The US Department of Energy recently announced $20 million in funding for a consortium to advance the technology and First Solar says it will invest $1.2 billion in US manufacturing now that the Inflation Reduction Act has passed.

They can build and the demand will be there. Leonardo Moreno President AES Clean Energy

Other countries are also hoping to build up their solar industries. In 2021 for example India started offering incentives to help expand its capacity. Shirdi Sai Electricals Reliance Energy and Adani Infrastructure have all committed to building at least 4 GW of manufacturing capacity‚Äîfrom polysilicon to finished panels‚Äîbefore 2024.

‚ÄúConsidering the economies of scale and to be more cost competitive most manufacturers are actually planning for probably 10 GW plus especially for the polysilicon‚Äù says Balachander Krishnan who is overseeing the launch of Shirdi Sai Electricals‚Äô planned ingot wafer and module plant.

REC Silicon‚Äôs May welcomes the Inflation Reduction Act but he notes that the clock for adding the new capacity started ticking as soon as the tax credit was approved. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs designed to promote investment‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe caveat is that it‚Äôs got a time limit: 10 years.‚Äù After that May says US solar companies will have to be able to compete on their own.

Moreno says the tax credits will give companies the confidence they need to scale up solar manufacturing in the US. That should reduce costs he says. When the countdown hits zero the US will be ready he thinks. ‚ÄúThe reason the Chinese panels became very cheap over the years is not technology itself‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the scale.‚Äù

At Wacker‚Äôs Tennessee plant Collins says the company is focused on the long-term opportunity for polysilicon rather than the Inflation Reduction Act.

The US plant is modeled after Wacker‚Äôs flagship industrial park in Burghausen Germany which started operating in 1916 with 450 employees. Today the facility has 10000 employees and an app to help them navigate the sprawling campus.

The Great Depression caused Americans to doubt the country‚Äôs economic system. World War II and the Cold War presented threats from global totalitarian movements. The 1960s and ‚Äô70s were marred by assassinations riots a losing war and a disgraced president.

These earlier periods were each more alarming in some ways than anything that has happened in the United States recently. Yet during each of those previous times of tumult the basic dynamics of American democracy held firm. Candidates who won the most votes were able to take power and attempt to address the country‚Äôs problems.

The current period is different. As a result the United States today finds itself in a situation with little historical precedent. American democracy is facing two distinct threats which together represent the most serious challenge to the country‚Äôs governing ideals in decades.

The first threat is acute: a growing movement inside one of the country‚Äôs two major parties ‚Äî the Republican Party ‚Äî to refuse to accept defeat in an election."

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant‚Äôs processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance.

View the current offers here.

One of the greatest things about credit cards is that some give you statement credits to make the things you enjoy free. That includes perks like Global Entry Uber rides and streaming services.

But one of the greatest frustrations is keeping track of these statement credits to make sure they post correctly giving you the rebate that you deserve.

American Express offers the most statement credits out of any major issuer. Given how many you may have at your disposal keeping track of them can be difficult. That's why we have a monthly checklist of credit card perks you should be using.

But what happens if these credits don't post properly? Here's how you can claim missing statement credits from Amex.

Make sure you qualify for the statement credit

Before assuming that a statement credit is missing make sure you are eligible for that credit first. Many statement credits from American Express require enrolling for the benefit in advance. Thus if you didn't enroll for the benefit prior to making a purchase you might be surprised to find out that you aren't eligible for a statement credit.

Here's a look at some benefits you must enroll for in advance in order to receive statement credits from Amex:

Thus if you make a purchase with one of these merchants you may not receive the statement credit you are expecting if you didn't enroll for the benefit in advance.

How to claim your missing Amex statement credits

Before contacting Amex make sure you have the information on the merchant the purchase amount and what day it posted to your account. To find these details log in to your American Express account online or via the app.

Next navigate to the card that the purchase was charged to and open the ""Statements & Activity"" page. Then scroll down until you find the relevant charge the date and the amount. And then look through all other charges in that same month to see if you received the statement credit associated with your purchase.

If you are certain you're eligible for a statement credit and have waited a sufficient amount of time here's how you can claim your missing credits from American Express.

Related: How long does it take to receive statement credits from Amex Capital One and Chase?

For contacting Amex there are two options: You can use the online chat feature or call the number on the back of your card.

In March it took 12 days to receive my Walmart+ credit but I received the credit on the very same day in June. AMERICANEXPRESS.COM

Once you are speaking to a customer service representative mention that you have missing statement credits and identify exactly which benefit they are related to. From here mention the date of the charge for which you didn't receive the appropriate credits.

AMERICANEXPRESS.COM

In both July and August I didn't receive statement credits for my Walmart+ membership which is a benefit of The Platinum Card¬Æ from American Express. This was apparently a wider issue as reported by Doctor of Credit. However the chat representative said billing should be fixed from September 2022. My chat session to resolve the missing credits took less than five minutes from start to end. Enrollment required.

Related: How 5 minutes of chat got me 85000 points plus $150

If you decide to call the conversation model will be the same. Explain which credits are missing and the date of the relevant charge then request the credit from the employee you are talking to.

Most likely one of two things will happen during your conversation. It's possible the customer service agent will tell you to wait longer before they can manually post the credit for you. If that happens ask how much longer you should wait for the statement credit to post to your account before you contact Amex again for further help.

It's also possible that the representative will post courtesy credits to your account while talking to you. If that happens ask how long you should wait for these to show up.

In either situation make sure you take note of this timeline and ask what you should do next if things don't go as planned. I usually ask ""If the credits don't show up by then what should I do?""

Bottom line

When technology works as expected life is great. You enroll for a benefit offered by your credit card make the corresponding purchase and then a statement credit posts to your bill a few days later.

Unfortunately it doesn't always work this way. The good news here is that claiming your missing statement credits from Amex isn't overly difficult. The most time-efficient way to get your missing statement credits is to use Amex's online chat function.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2VvcmdlY2FsaG91bi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3RoZS1iaWdnZXN0LWNyeXB0by1mYW50YXN5LW9mLWFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Biggest Crypto Fantasy Of All,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2022/09/18/the-biggest-crypto-fantasy-of-all/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ2VvcmdlY2FsaG91bi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3RoZS1iaWdnZXN0LWNyeXB0by1mYW50YXN5LW9mLWFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYm9jYW5ld3Nub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvYW1leC1zdWVzLWRlbHJheS1iZWFjaC13b21hbi13YW50cy1pdHMtMzkwMDAtYmFjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMEX SUES DELRAY BEACH WOMAN WANTS ITS $39000 BACK,"BY: STAFF REPORT | BocaNewsNow.com

DELRAY BEACH FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright ¬© 2022 MetroDesk Media LLC) ‚Äî American Express is sending a very loud message to a Delray Beach resident who apparently hasn‚Äôt been paying her bill: paying off your Amex card isn‚Äôt optional.

In a filing obtained by BocaNewsNow.com American Express says that Denise Katz of the 7000 block of Vivaldi Lane in Delray Beach owes $39361.45 plus court costs. While her card is in the name of ‚ÄúComplete AV Solutions Inc.‚Äù the card issuer says there‚Äôs no question about who is responsible for payment. It‚Äôs Katz and she hasn‚Äôt made even the minimum payment in quite some time.

According to the filing in Palm Beach County Circuit Court Katz‚Äô problems keep getting worse. She‚Äôs been assessed $6416.16 in interest during 2022 and $234 in fees. Her balance as of August was $38219.44 but $986 in new interest brings her current total to $39361.45. Her minimum payment due is $8878.

American Express makes the point in its filing that if Katz pays just the minimum due moving forward it will take 31 years to pay off the debt and she‚Äôll pay a total of $89674. The smart move: pay it off now.

The lawsuit states that Katz is using an ‚ÄúExecutive Business Card.‚Äù The Florida Secretary of State says that ‚ÄúComplete AV Solutions Inc.‚Äù remains in business at the Vivaldi Lane address.

Led by Chef d‚ÄôEquipe Bobby Costello the team stayed composed and focused as the technical track designed by Uliano Vezzani (ITA) proved challenging with rails coming down throughout the course. The final phase was incredibly influential changing the team standings multiple times as the top 25 combinations concluded the end of the day making for an exciting championship finale. All five U.S. combinations finished yesterday‚Äôs phase in the top 25 and jumped in the second session of competition on the grass field at Centro Equestre Federale. Of the team‚Äôs performance Costello elaborated on the work and commitment from the athletes their staff the owners and all the support team to produce a historic result for the U.S.



‚ÄúIt was just such a crazy day. I had a feeling when I walked the course that it was going to be very influential. I‚Äôd never seen such a consistently big and very technical track and have those three lines all single jumps to combinations with three completely different distances. It was a real important phase and no team went unscathed and you had to keep fighting to the end‚Äù said Costello.



‚ÄúI hope this means great things for the future. I feel the program has been on the slow burn of the swing for a couple of years and I think there was still something missing. My number one priority when I took this interim position was to try and change the culture and really make sure that everyone had each other‚Äôs backs and building trust among the riders‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe riders the owners the staff people have never given up on the sport and I‚Äôm so happy for everyone even those at home who get to watch and get to be proud so really good just all around for us.‚Äù



Will Coleman and Off The Record produced the only clear round for the team managing the questions asked throughout the difficult track with poise demonstrating the scopiness rideability and talent of the 2009 Irish Sport Horse gelding owned by The Off The Record Syndicate. The pair finished as the highest placed U.S. combination taking seventh place overall on a score of 27.2. Coleman purchased the gelding as a four-year-old and has developed him throughout his career noting that the progress and accomplishments of their partnership is something he continues to cherish.



‚ÄúIt was great. I‚Äôm so thrilled. It was par for the course for this entire week for us to be honest. I feel like he‚Äôs punched above his weight in every phase and I‚Äôm just so happy with him‚Äù said Coleman. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of my horse and my team and everyone involved with this program. I‚Äôve had him since he was four and produced him myself and it‚Äôs cool to see him go in there and rise to the moment.‚Äù



Lauren Nicholson and Vermiculus were the trailblazers for the team and finishing in 19th place overall on a final individual score of 41.1. The pair had two down and finished slightly over the optimum time to add 8.4 to their score following their sharp cross-country round yesterday.



‚ÄúHe tried his heart out for me out there. We had the two down that have caused loads of people problems at the end of the course but he‚Äôs come out of this week feeling good. This was a really tough track. It‚Äôs super technical and a real show jumping track. He jumped well and feels great so I‚Äôm really happy with him overall.‚Äù



In a notoriously challenging phase for Boyd Martin and Tsetserleg TSF a 2007 Trakehner gelding owned by Christine Turner Tommie Turner and Thomas Turner the pair dropped four rails for a total of 16 faults for a final score of 41.2 to finish in 20th place overall. Of the team camaraderie Martin spoke of the drought the U.S. program has had since their last team podium at a world championship and how much energy and excitement he can feel as the program looks ahead to the future.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm very proud to be an American today. Having five clear rounds yesterday in the cross-country was awesome and just looking at the results here any three of the five of us could have gotten a team medal‚Äù said Martin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been on many of these teams and we‚Äôve been so close over and over again and it‚Äôs a massive sigh of relief. I‚Äôm really thankful for this team and proud to be here with these guys sitting next to me.‚Äù



As the last combination to contest the course Tamie Smith and Mai Baum a 2006 German Sport Horse gelding owned by Alex Ahearn Ellen Ahearn and Eric Markell added eight faults to their original score of 24.0 to finish on a 32.0 to take ninth place individually. Smith while disappointed to be out of the individual medal running after her round said the focus was always on the team result and their overall performance throughout the week meant more than an individual medal.



‚ÄúWe came here to do our best and I have to say we all knew that potentially we could medal and I think we‚Äôre pleasantly surprised and we‚Äôre less than a point away from third and it shows to the quality of the field and the riding. It‚Äôs impressive and I‚Äôm just so honored to be here‚Äù said Smith. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very proud of my horse. I feel like it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be and that‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre here and we got the silver medal and that‚Äôs what we came here for. I have to push that to the side that this isn‚Äôt about my individual performance it‚Äôs about the team performance and I‚Äôm ecstatic with our result.‚Äù



Ariel Grald (Southern Pines N.C) noted yesterday that her goal was to finish the championship on her dressage score of 32.5 which is exactly what she did. Aboard Leamore Master Plan a 2009 Irish Sport Horse gelding owned by Annie Eldridge Grald guided the stunning gelding to a masterful clear round inside of the time. In her first championship appearance for the stars and stripes Grald felt that it was her moment to prove that she deserved to be on the world stage while also taking in every piece of knowledge and learning she could to help continue to prepare her for the future.



‚ÄúI was a bit nervous going in and he‚Äôs such a great show jumper. I just have to trust him and trust that he‚Äôs going to go in and try and I knew after the first fence that he was good. The combinations can be hard for him because he has such a huge step but all credit to my horse. I really have to mess up as a jockey for him to not jump clear so it‚Äôs a lot of pressure of me to give him a good ride. He‚Äôs absolutely brilliant. I wanted to finish on my dressage score and we did so I couldn‚Äôt be happier for him and that‚Äôs all you can ask for.‚Äù

The Great Depression caused Americans to doubt the country‚Äôs economic system. World War II and the Cold War presented threats from global totalitarian movements. The 1960s and ‚Äô70s were marred by assassinations riots a losing war and a disgraced president.

These earlier periods were each more alarming in some ways than anything that has happened in the United States recently. Yet during each of those previous times of tumult the basic dynamics of American democracy held firm. Candidates who won the most votes were able to take power and attempt to address the country‚Äôs problems.

The current period is different. As a result the United States today finds itself in a situation with little historical precedent. American democracy is facing two distinct threats which together represent the most serious challenge to the country‚Äôs governing ideals in decades.

The first threat is acute: a growing movement inside one of the country‚Äôs two major parties ‚Äî the Republican Party ‚Äî to refuse to accept defeat in an election."

The U.S. Commerce Department is investigating the potential data collection and transmission capabilities of equipment from Chinese tech company Huawei that was installed on cell towers near U.S. military installations including missile silos in western Nebraska as Reuters reported.

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood R-Neb. wrote to the Commerce Department this week seeking an update on the investigation which he said he supports. He sought confirmation from Commerce about any Huawei tech on cell towers within 20 miles of Offutt or other Nebraska military facilities.

Huawei equipment has been found that close to Offutt and to nuclear missile silos in Cheyenne County home to Sidney several sources told the Nebraska Examiner. State and federal leaders have not yet discussed specifics publicly.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a slap in the face to every airman that goes to work‚Äù said Flood whose 1st Congressional District includes Offutt. ‚ÄúI want to know where this is in Nebraska what companies are using it and why it hasn‚Äôt been removed.‚Äù

Adm. Charles Richard commander of Offutt‚Äôs U.S. Strategic Command acknowledged during a conference in July the reality of nation-states trying to access military information. He said U.S. intelligence services and others are working to protect key military assets from cyberattack.

Huawei was founded by former members of the Chinese military. The company has denied that its equipment is a spying threat or that it is working in concert with the Chinese government. Tech experts say the Chinese state can force companies in China to share users‚Äô information.

Crystal Rhoades a Democrat who represents much of the Omaha area on Nebraska‚Äôs Public Service Commission would not discuss the locations of specific cell phone towers in Nebraska with Chinese equipment on them citing national security concerns.

But she said nearly every Viaero Wireless tower in Nebraska has Huawei equipment on it. She said the company has discussed applying for up to $330 million in federal funds to rip out and replace Chinese equipment in Nebraska with tech approved by the U.S. Department of Defense. The company did not return repeated messages seeking comment.

‚ÄúThis is a big deal‚Äù Rhoades said. ‚ÄúIt needs to get fixed.‚Äù

Flood said he hopes the Commerce Department acts with a sense of urgency. He said the United Kingdom banned the use of Huawei equipment on its cell towers and the U.S. should be able to act with similar speed. He said the public needs answers and soon.

‚ÄúChina is a real threat‚Äù Flood said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt trust Chinese technology when it comes to protecting our national security. ‚Ä¶ My hope is this should not be drawn out.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9hb2EuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamVob3ZhaHMtd2l0bmVzc2VzLWJhY2staW4tZmllbGQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jehovah's Witnesses back in field,"Having grown during the pandemic with great participation on Zoom the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses have zestfully reopened their Kingdom Halls and returned to visiting people door to door and handing out The Watchtower magazine that the organization has published since 1879.

There are three Kingdom Halls in Odessa and two in Midland where 15 congregations ‚Äî seven English and eight Spanish ‚Äî meet at various times.

‚ÄúWe have had a substantial amount of growth and are excited to go person-to-person again‚Äù said Coordinator Chuck Dietz of Odessa adding that more information about the church worldwide and in the Permian Basin is available at jw.org.

Spokesman Mark Childs of San Angelo said there are nearly 1.3 million Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses in 12000 congregations in the United States and the worldwide membership is 8.7 million.

‚ÄúHouses of worship called Kingdom Halls were reopened April 1 witnessing in public places resumed May 31 and we started delivering the The Watchtower again Sept. 1‚Äù Childs said. ‚ÄúIn-person conventions are being planned for 2023.‚Äù

For the first time in history Watchtower deliveries were suspended in March 2020. ‚ÄúThe Watchtower is published in over 1000 languages telling people about the importance of God‚Äôs kingdom and what that kingdom will do for mankind‚Äù Childs said.

‚ÄúGod‚Äôs son Jesus Christ is the king of that kingdom.‚Äù

Childs said the Witnesses‚Äô door-to-door evangelism inviting people to attend services and handing out The Watchtower ‚Äúis what Jesus commanded his disciples to do back in the first century: go out and preach the good news and teach people about the Bible.‚Äù

Noting that Zoom access has been continued for those who prefer it Childs said it wasn‚Äôt just the pandemic that heightened interest in spiritual matters.

‚ÄúThese are critical times that cause people concerns and they want to know how the times are related to the Bible‚Äù he said.

The Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses also known as The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania began as the International Bible Students Association in 1872 in Pittsburgh Pa. under the leadership of Christian restorationist minister Charles Taze Russell who was born in 1852 and died in 1916 in Pampa Texas while returning to Brooklyn N.Y. by train according to references.

Student missionaries were sent to England in 1881 and the first overseas branch was opened in London in 1900.

The second and third presidents of the group were Joseph Franklin Rutherford (1869-1942) and Nathan Homer Knorr (1905-‚Äò77). The worldwide headquarters is in Warwick N.Y.

As the film progresses the characters fall out of their historic lanes: the steel worker appears in a Moravian church; the nurse stares up at the rusted stacks of the steel plant; the blackjack dealer appears in front of Bethlehem‚Äôs iconic illuminated star atop South Mountain.

The film does not tell a story per se but rather shows different aspects of Bethlehem past and present. Then scrambles them up. Layers of history are condensed into the same time and space.

Between the two projection screens is an exact miniaturization of the Bethlehem Star the 91-foot steel tower shrunk to about 11 feet. Attie says the star neatly encapsulates many of the themes he is working on in ‚ÄúStarstruck‚Äù: it references Christianity and the birth of Jesus Christ; it‚Äôs made of steel; and it was made in 1937 through an act of capitalism created by the city‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce to brand Bethlehem as ‚ÄúChristmas City.‚Äù

Instead of mimicking the illumination of the giant star on the mountain ‚Äî which is steady white light ‚Äî Attie‚Äôs smaller structure lights up in an animated multi-colored pattern similar to a gambling machine you might find in a casino.

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre all Bethlehem and this is all of our history‚Äô

‚ÄúStarstruck‚Äù uses artistic techniques Attie has employed in other cities around the world particularly places that have felt the boom and bust of industrialization like a former steel plant in Luxembourg and the site of a coal mining disaster in Wales.

‚ÄúFor me the best art remains complex all the way through. If it‚Äôs reduced to one simple message that‚Äôs not really an experience that‚Äôs a piece of information‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping to give people an experience a way to reflect both on the specifics of Bethlehem locally but also on the American story the very particular American brew of capitalism religion industrialization and its collapse.‚Äù

To brew that concoction Attie asked local talent to represent the different layers of the city. Most of the actors are playing versions of themselves: the nurse is actually a nurse the steelworker is the grandson of a Bethlehem Steel worker and the 18th century Moravian woman is Sarah Hriniak who regularly portrays 18th century Moravian women.

‚ÄúPortraying Moravian women of the time period is something that I do for fun‚Äù said Hriniak who when not teaching at Bethlehem‚Äôs Nitschmann Middle School is a docent at the Moravian Historical Society in nearby Nazareth.

‚ÄúI dress up in costume a lot‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of my favorite things to do.‚Äù

She even has her own historically accurate wardrobe down to the weave of the linen which she wears in the film.

‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôll portray specific characters in Moravian history‚Äù said Hriniak. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve portrayed Anna Nitschmann before. I‚Äôve portrayed Benigna Zinzendorf before. But sometimes it‚Äôs just regular Moravian women of the time period.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdC1pLXJldmVhbGVkLWdvaW5nLXByaXNvbi1jb3N0LW1vdmllLXJvbGVzLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T.I. Once Revealed How Going to Prison Cost Him Movie Roles,"T.I. was once in consideration for several potentially big movies that starred huge actors but prison time got in the way of his acting career.

Rapper T.I. once set out to make a presence in the world of Hollywood after already making an impact in the music industry. But going to jail once played a role in impeding the star‚Äôs acting career.

T.I. missed out on ‚ÄòTower Heist‚Äô because of his prison sentence

Superstar T.I. was in the middle of a rising film career before his stint in prison. He was already making a name for himself in Hollywood having starred in features like American Gangster and Takers. But his prison sentence in 2010 cost him a couple of roles that might have further benefited his acting prospects.

One of those films was the heist movie Tower Heist which ended up starring Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller. In an interview with Daily Beast the multi-platinum artist shared he was also supposed to be a part of the comedic roster.

‚ÄúActually man I was supposed to be in Tower Heist. I was ‚Äòindisposed.‚Äô Me and Brian Grazer who produced American Gangster were speaking about it when it was just a script and Brett [Ratner] hadn‚Äôt even came on to direct it yet so it was years ago‚Äù T.I. said.

By the time the project was on the way to becoming an actual film T.I was serving his time.

‚ÄúAfter that it went away then came back with Brett attached to it and Ben Stiller and I was reconsidered and Brett and I had some very very positive discussions about it and I was right there. And then life happened. But I still believe it‚Äôs going to be a good movie‚Äù he said.

Other roles rapper T.I. missed out on

Tower Heist wasn‚Äôt the only movie that prison time cost the rapper. There were other blockbusters that T.I. was being discussed for and many major actors he missed out on working with.

‚ÄúG.I. Joe II [G.I. Joe: Retaliation] they called me for that. World War Z with Brad Pitt. They called me for that. The Joel Silver movie [Bullet to the Head] ‚Äì I would have been co-starring with Sylvester Stallone. They called me for that too‚Äù T.I. once told Sister 2 Sister (via Contact Music).

However T.I. still managed to bounce back with his acting career. After being released from prison the rapper beefed up his film resume by starring in films like Get Hard and Ant-Man. The last feature film the rapper starred in was 2020‚Äôs Monster Hunter.

Why T.I. was once sentenced to 11 months in prison

In September 2010 T.I. was once reportedly stopped in Los Angeles by police for a traffic violation. The officers involved in the case found drugs in the rapper‚Äôs car leading to his arrest and subsequent imprisonment. Prosecutors were looking to sentence T.I. to two years for the crime. But T.I. managed to get a more lenient sentence of 11 months.

The hip-hop mogul vowed to change his ways after the arrest citing drug addiction as a major reason for his behavior.

‚ÄúAs I discovered in talking to my probation officer I had many problems from my childhood. Now I am down to the disease of addiction. I need help for me my mother my kids. I need the court to give me mercy. Judge don‚Äôt send me back to prison‚Äù T.I. once told the judge during his sentencing according to CNN.",,,

These stocks don‚Äôt have the highest dividends in the market but they offer among the highest payouts in the sector.

Aside from water stocks‚Äô dividends however there are several reasons to consider investing in the sector. To begin with water is a commodity that will always be needed. This is particularly true because water crises are emerging in several countries including the United States. In several Western states a multi-year drought may necessitate government restricting water use by up to 25%.

And like many commodity stocks a key reason to invest in water stocks is their reliable dividends. In volatile markets it‚Äôs always a good idea to invest in companies that pay you to own their stocks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

And then there‚Äôs the current ‚Äúrisk-off‚Äù environment. In light of all of these factors you can see why water stocks with dividends are in a sweet spot between growth and value. Many of these stocks are outperforming the market simply because of the laws of supply and demand.

So if you‚Äôre looking for some income during your retirement or you just want to find some stocks to combat the market‚Äôs current volatility here are seven water stocks that are worth a look.

AWK American Water Works $148.40 WTRG Essential Utilities $45.57 AWR American States Water Company $85.79 MLI Mueller Industries $59.67 GRC Gorman-Rupp $25.43 AOS A.O. Smith $51.72 XYL Xylem $93.26

American Water Works (AWK)

When investors look for water stocks with dividends utilities are a good place to start. American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is one of the leading water utilities in the country. The company‚Äôs current dividend yield is 1.77%.That‚Äôs not particularly impressive but it‚Äôs good.

The company currently pays its stock‚Äôs owners $2.62 per share on an annual basis. That‚Äôs 44% higher than the sector average.

And when it comes to the balance sheet there‚Äôs a lot to like as well. The company has a profit margin of 3.99% which is almost twice the sector‚Äôs average. And with a price‚Äìearnings (P/E) ratio of just over 20 times the valuation of AWK stock is becoming more attractive.

Essential Utilities (WTRG)

The next company on my list is not a pure-play water utility. That‚Äôs because in addition to the water services that it provides through municipalities and other parties Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) also has exposure to the natural gas sector. That adds some volatility to WTRG stock but it‚Äôs still one of the best names for income-oriented investors.

Story continues

The company pays $1.15 per share of dividends annually. That currently equates to a 2.5% dividend yield. Indicating that the company‚Äôs dividend is safe WTRG is in the exclusive Dividend Aristocrat club as it has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years.

And at a time when investors are looking for growth wherever they can get it Essential Utilities is a solid choice. The company‚Äôs balance sheet is sound and it continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth.

In fact over the next five years Essential Utilities is projecting high single-digit-percentage growth in both metrics. That‚Äôs a combination that should allow Essential Utilities to continue increasing its dividend over time.

American States Water Company (AWR)

Another utility company on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends is American States Water Company (NYSE:AWR). About 25% of its customer base is in California. Specifically the company serves over 250000 customers in the Golden State making it one of the state‚Äôs largest water utility companies.

AWR stock has advanced at an average annual rate of approximately 15% over the last five years. And as of the market close on September 15 the stock was up 21% since bottoming in June.

The company is projecting single-digit-percentage revenue and earnings growth over the next five years. That should be enough to satisfy dividend investors.

American States Water is a Dividend King that has increased its payout for the last 62 consecutive years. And there‚Äôs little reason to believe that the streak will be interrupted.

Mueller Industries (NASDAQ:MLI) is the first water stock on this list that is not a water utility. However the company is vital to water infrastructure. The company makes pipes valves and fittings for commercial and residential applications.

In its most recent reported quarter Mueller generated record revenue of $1.15 billion. And the company reported a healthy backlog. Meanwhile its balance sheet is more than fine as it has zero net debt and continues to increase its free cash flow.

Also making the shares attractive is that investors can still buy MLI stock at an attractive P/E ratio of just over five times earnings. Plus the company pays an annual dividend of $1.00 and has increased its dividend by approximately 9% annually over the last three years.

Gorman-Rupp (GRC)

Like many companies in this sector Gorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC) is an established name. The company has been making pumps and pumping systems for its customers since 1933. And today the firm has a global presence as it generates about one-third of its revenue outside the United States.

About 58% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from water and water-related products. Investors can count on the specialized firm to generate steady revenue and earnings . Throughout its history Gorman-Rupp has grown through acquisition but that hasn‚Äôt stopped it from issuing dividends for the last 72 years.

That payout by itself would make the stock worth including on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends. However for the last 49 years Gorman-Rupp has increased its dividend putting it on the cusp of being a Payout King.

A.O. Smith (AOS)

A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) is one of the country‚Äôs leading manufacturers of boilers water treatment products and water heaters. In June 2022 InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth gave AOS stock a ringing endorsement calling it one of his favorite stocks to buy.

At that time the company had just acquired Atlantic Filter Corporation. The water treatment company was A.O. Smith‚Äôs fifth such acquisition since 2016. Water treatment is becoming a key niche and A.O. Smith appears to be committed to grabbing a substantial share of the market.

AOS has some work to do. That may be why the company is looking to grow its water heater business in China and India. In the meantime investors can enjoy the company‚Äôs dividend which pays out $1.12 on an annual basis. That works out to a yield of 2.17%.

Xylem (XYL)

The last stock on this list of water stocks with the highest dividends is a company that‚Äôs using technology to address the emerging issue of water scarcity. Xylem (NYSE:XYL) claims that within the next three years 1.8 billion people will be living in areas without sufficient water.

To that end the company delivers hundreds of innovative and smart technology solutions. The company specializes in fixing leaky pipes.

While that may sound unimportant it‚Äôs becoming an increasingly prevalent problem because of our country‚Äôs aging water infrastructure. In fact the average water main in the U. S. hasn‚Äôt been replaced since the 1970s.

XYL stock is down 21% for the year but it‚Äôs been rallying since June. As of September 15 2022 XYL has posted a 29% gain.

The company‚Äôs revenue should remain solid as the nation upgrades its aging infrastructure. Consequently expect Xylem‚Äôs dividend to continue to increase. It currently pays the owners of XYL $1.20 annually and the payout has been growing at an average rate of 10% over the last three years.

Right now many of them are paying about $7 more a month according to Virginia American Water which requested a rate hike in May. At that point water bills went up while the State Corporation Commission considers the increase.

The city of Alexandria is a water customer along with citizens and the mayor says the increase is not fair.

‚ÄúWe feel as we have in the past we feel the rate increase is excessive and we feel an obligation to speak up for our residents about the level of increase the water company is seeking‚Äù said Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson.

Virginia American Water issued this statement to 7News



""No utility likes to request rate increases. At the same time investments necessary to keep our water service safe and reliable cannot be avoided. Unfortunately the situation in Jackson MS is a stark reminder of the consequences when such investments are deferred. With interim rates implemented May 1 2022 Virginia American Water‚Äôs average residential customer in Alexandria has seen an increase of $6.88 per month and the company will issue bill credits with interest to all customers if rates determined by the SCC‚Äôs final order are lower than the interim rates. We also want to remind customers that we have bill payment and other assistance programs available for customers who may need help‚Äù said Barry Suits Virginia American Water president.

While residents are paying more now Mayor Wilson is hoping the commission will lower the rate increase which would provide residents with a credit for what they have been paying.

Virginia American Water maintains the investments are needed to safeguard the water supply and Wilson agrees with some improvements.

‚ÄúWe have old infrastructure in this city and an old water system and we want to see them invest in that. I think our concerns are when the level becomes excessive‚Äù said Wilson.

The mayor is urging citizens to reach out to the State Corporation Commission with their concerns about the water rate increase before the commission makes a final decision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8va2F1YWlub3duZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2ZpZnRoLWdyYWRlcnMtZW5qb3llZC1tYWtlLWEtc3BsYXNoLXdhdGVyLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1mZXN0aXZhbC1pbi1saWh1JUNBJUJCZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fifth-Graders Enjoyed Make a Splash Water Education Festival in Lƒ´hu ªe,"The Make a Splash with Project WET Festival returned Sept. 15 to the Vidinha soccer field in Lƒ´hu‚Äôe after a 2-year postponement due to the pandemic.

The Arkansas Legislative Council on Friday granted the Arkansas Department of Agriculture's request for spending authority to use $280 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds for water wastewater and irrigation projects in Arkansas.

The council also voted to authorize the state Department of Human Services to transfer $6.07 million in American Rescue Plan funds to Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden with the aim of helping the hospital avoid closure soon.

""We are bleeding red in Camden Arkansas"" said Peggy Abbott president and chief executive officer of Ouachita County Medical Center.

""We have not quite five days' cash on hand.""

The council voted to send the North Arkansas Regional Medical Center's request for $10 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to its Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee. Rep. Michelle Gray R-Melbourne said she doesn't favor providing $10 million in American Rescue Plan funds to North Arkansas Regional Medical Center because she doesn't feel like closure is imminent for the hospital.

The council's actions came after some lawmakers aired their frustrations and disagreements about the state's use of federal American Rescue funds.

""We have communities drinking brown water"" said state Rep. Fran Cavenaugh R-Walnut Ridge in making a pitch for authorizing the use of $280 million in American Rescue Plan funds for water wastewater and irrigation projects.

She said no state lawmaker thinks it's OK for a community to have brown drinking water.

The council's Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee recommended on Tuesday that the Legislative Council grant spending authority for the Department of Agriculture to use $280 million in American Rescue Plan funds for water wastewater and irrigation projects; for the Department of Human Services to use $5 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to support the training and certification of teams employed by behavioral health agencies in evidence-based models; and for Black River Technical College to use $4.6 million of the federal funds to construct short-term training and housing facilities.

But the Legislative Council on Friday balked at approving all of the committee's recommendations and voted to send the Department of Human Services' request for $5 million and Black River Technical College's request for $4.6 million back to the council's Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee.

The committee voted Tuesday to delay action on several state government requests collectively seeking about $105 million in spending authority to use federal American Rescue Plan funds. These requests include the state Department of Human Service's requests for $60 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to assist hospitals in immediate jeopardy of closure and $10 million in federal funds and $5 million in state restricted reserve funds for services to benefit rural hospitals through the Arkansas Rural Health Partnership as well as several requests by colleges and Women and Children First for about $35 million in federal funds for building projects.

Among other things the Legislative Council on Friday declined to approve a motion to authorize the use of $5 million in American Rescue Plan funds for Northwest Technical Institute Education Foundation to help in the construction of an allied health facility on the institute's campus in Springdale and the use of $3.2 million in these federal funds for Arkansas Tech University to remodel Morton Hall to create space for the growth of nursing programs.

Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey R-Texarkana said Tuesday he wants each hospital seeking federal American Rescue Plan funds to avoid closure to explain to state lawmakers how much federal money the hospital needs why the hospital needs the money and how the federal money is going to help the hospital be sustainable in the long run.

That led Ouachita County Medical Center to request that the Legislative Council on Friday authorize the use of $6.07 million in American Rescue Plan funds for the hospital in Camden and North Arkansas Regional Medical Center to request that the council authorize $10 million in American Rescue Plan funds for the hospital in Harrison.

Increased costs and labor shortages have resulted in reduced revenue for the hospitals and that's meant several hospitals across the state particularly those that serve rural populations are at immediate risk of closure the Department of Human Services said in its request for $60 million in American Rescue Plan funds.

Hospitals received advanced Medicare payments early during the covid-19 pandemic and are receiving lower Medicare reimbursements in order to pay back that money to the federal government said Mark White chief of staff at the Department of Human Services.

The state Department of Human Services also is working with the Arkansas Hospital Association to undergo a rate review for Arkansas' inpatient and outpatient hospital rates as well as examine policies to help address the strains placed on hospitals through the pandemic.

Sen. Jonathan Dismang R-Searcy said many hospitals are in a financial bind and he hopes they will find ways out of their financial binds.

In May 2021 Gov. Asa Hutchinson appointed the state's American Rescue Plan steering committee -- comprising nine Hutchinson administration officials and six state lawmakers -- to recommend the best uses of $1.57 billion in American Rescue Plan state fiscal recovery funds and $158 million in American Rescue Plan capital project funds.

In March 2021 President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act that is designed to help the United States recover from the economic and health effects of the covid-19 pandemic.

The state Department of Agriculture's request for $280 million in American Rescue funds includes $135 million for grants for drinking water-related projects; $135 million for grants for wastewater treatment and collection and stormwater-related projects; $5 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds for a White River Irrigation District project to construct five county road crossings over a 10-mile canal segment that is under construction as phase 1 of the Grand Prairie project; and $5 million for a Bayou Meto Water Management District project to construct 10 pumping stations for water delivery.

State Department of Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward told state lawmakers on Tuesday the department wants to administer $135 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to distribute grants for drinking-water-related projects and $135 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to distribute grants for wastewater treatment and collection and stormwater-related projects through its Natural Resources Division.

Ward said the Department of Agriculture plans to allow for about 50 days for grant applications to be submitted and to have the applications reviewed and scored by staff before the Natural Resources Commission makes decisions on which projects to fund.

But Regulators‚Äô Error-Strewn Records ...,"Lea este art√≠culo en espa√±ol.

Last month with California in the grips of a megadrought Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a plan centered on ‚Äúthe acute need to conserve water‚Äù in the face of a drier hotter future caused by climate change. The plan outlines actions to ‚Äútransform water management‚Äù and calls on California residents to step up and do their part to conserve water.

Yet the plan does nothing to limit use of California‚Äôs dwindling water supplies by one of the primary drivers of climate change: the oil and gas industry.

An Inside Climate News analysis of data collected by the California Geologic Energy Management Division or CalGEM shows high-quality water is being diverted from state domestic and agricultural supplies predominantly in Kern County to extract viscous crude from some of the world‚Äôs most climate-polluting oilfields.

The analysis also reveals deep problems with the quality of the data collected by CalGEM that make it very difficult to establish the quantities of water used to produce oil‚Äîdespite a 2014 law that was supposed to overhaul the industry‚Äôs water-use reporting in order to provide greater transparency.

Oil and gas extraction in California uses tens of billions of gallons of water each year. It also generates massive amounts of wastewater known as ‚Äúproduced water‚Äù which returns to the surface with extracted fuels. This produced water is laced with cancer-causing chemicals added to facilitate oil extraction harmful petroleum-derived compounds and naturally occurring toxic elements such as arsenic and radium.

Although most of the water the industry injects into wells to help extract oil is recycled produced water that is used again to pry out more oil some extraction techniques require high-quality water. Under these circumstances it can be cheaper to buy clean water from municipal suppliers than it is to treat produced water to remove contaminants.

Extracting heavy crude oil in parts of Kern County requires more water and disproportionate amounts of high-quality water than other regions in California because the oil is so viscous and the wells are so old.

Kern County produces about three-quarters of California‚Äôs onshore oil and gas but wells there account for more than 99.5 percent of this high-quality water injected for fossil fuel extraction across California according to the Inside Climate News analysis. This water could otherwise go to farms and municipalities that have had to ration their water supplies.

Across the rest of the state only about one hundredth of one percent of the water used to extract oil and gas came from sources marked as suitable for domestic use or irrigation. But for Kern County over the same time period the figure was almost 1.3 percent or more than 1.5 billion gallons. That‚Äôs enough water to supply 2300 households over that time range.

This high-quality water comes from two main sources: Bodies of water at the surface and domestic water systems which CalGEM defines as primarily intended for residential or commercial use.

Diversion from the State Water Project

Last March California water officials reduced allocations from the State Water Project a massive system of dams and aqueducts that ferries rain and snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada mountains to thirsty Southern California to 5 percent of most water agencies‚Äô requested amounts citing the driest start to a year in more than a century.

California‚Äôs Central Valley Water Board allows oil companies to sell less tainted produced water for irrigation to help farmers cope with such restrictions citing studies it oversaw to prove the controversial practice is safe. Yet an Inside Climate News investigation found that members of the water board‚Äôs own expert panel disputed that conclusion and that the firm hired to do the study has close ties to Chevron the largest provider of the wastewater.

The industry has touted its role in providing a reliable source of water to farmers in drought-stricken California. But as the Inside Climate News data analysis shows the industry is also using freshwater that might otherwise have gone to farms.

The vast majority of the surface water injected into wells in Kern County totaling more than 645 million gallons was diverted from the State Water Project. Between 2018 and 2021 about two-thirds of this water was used by Berry Petroleum a Texas-based company that develops conventional oil reserves in California and Utah. Berry Petroleum did not respond to requests for comment.

The diversion of water from the State Water Project for injection into oil and gas wells in Kern County has been falling in recent years according to CalGEM‚Äôs data from more than 234 million gallons in 2018 to around 58 million gallons in 2021. But the fact that any of this increasingly scarce resource is still being used for oil extraction points to a dangerous paradox: It makes little sense that a state regarded as a climate leader lets the oil industry use water needed by farms and cities to boost the extraction of the fossil fuels that drive global warming and have left water reservoirs critically depleted. Yet experts say limiting the oil industry‚Äôs use would require an act of the state Legislature.

To cope with exceptionally dry conditions California passed emergency water conservation measures in June and threatened residents with mandatory restrictions in addition to cutting State Water Project allocations that supply 27 million residents and hundreds of thousands of farmland acres.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre suffering from one of the worst droughts we‚Äôve ever had‚Äù said Brian Gray a water policy expert at the Public Policy Institute of California. ‚ÄúWhy is any State Water Project water going to oil and gas production at this point?‚Äù

Thomas Borch an expert on treating and reusing produced water at Colorado State University hopes oil companies will have cheaper treatment options available in the future. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs hard to compete with the low cost of freshwater‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever that might not matter since we are running out of freshwater.‚Äù

Use of Domestic Water Supplies

In total CalGEM‚Äôs records indicate that more than 681 million gallons of high-quality water from domestic supplies were injected into oil and gas wells in Kern County between 2018 and 2021. But as Inside Climate News dug further into the data and quizzed oil companies about their water use it became clear that CalGEM‚Äôs data is riddled with errors making it impossible to determine accurately how much high-quality domestic water has been used for fossil fuel extraction.

Sentinel Peak Resources an operator based in Colorado that has focused on acquiring and developing wells in California accounted for more than two-thirds of the use of this high-quality water according to CalGEM‚Äôs records. When approached by Inside Climate News the company disputed the figures blaming errors in its quarterly reports for a surge in its reported use in 2021. ‚ÄúUpon further investigation it appears that there are inaccuracies reflected in our reports which overstate our use of freshwater. We will work expeditiously to correct this issue‚Äù a company spokesperson replied. ‚ÄúThe 2021 number reported is inaccurate.‚Äù

Additional analysis revealed clear discrepancies between the numbers Sentinel submitted in its quarterly reports and those in monthly reports covering the same periods. Indeed Sentinel‚Äôs monthly reports failed to document any use of water from domestic suppliers across all of its wells‚Äîmaking it impossible to reconcile the company‚Äôs quarterly and monthly reporting.

Queried about its use of water from domestic systems Chevron admitted that it had used substantial quantities of water supplied by the West Kern Water District but had mislabeled this high-quality water as being unsuitable for domestic or irrigation use in its quarterly reports to CalGEM.

‚ÄúWe are continuing to investigate and will take appropriate corrective action‚Äù said Chevron spokesperson Sean Comey who blamed software errors for the problem. He noted that the company‚Äôs use of this high-quality domestic water in Kern County had decreased from 369 million gallons in 2018 to around 20 million gallons in 2021. Chevron discontinued the use of this high-quality water for oil extraction in early 2021 Comey added.

Still adding Chevron‚Äôs corrected numbers to CalGEM‚Äôs data more than doubled the amount of high-quality water from domestic suppliers used for fossil fuel extraction in Kern County from 2018 to 2021 to a total of more than 1.4 billion gallons. That‚Äôs about 4500 acre feet in the units favored by policymakers or enough to supply nearly 2400 households with water over the same period.

The problems revealed by the Inside Climate News analysis and reporting reinforce earlier complaints about the quality of CalGEM‚Äôs data.

Concerned about freshwater availability state legislators overhauled oil industry water-use reporting requirements in 2014 during the last devastating California drought when they passed Senate Bill 1281. The law required companies to provide more details on the sources of water used which CalGEM made publicly available in quarterly reports. This data was used for the Inside Climate News analysis.

The quarterly reports offered unique insights into the industry‚Äôs water use scientists with the nonpartisan California Council on Science and Technology or CCST wrote in a report released last year. But their review of CalGEM‚Äôs records flagged ‚Äúsystematic reporting errors‚Äù leading mostly to underreporting of industry water use. Numerous data quality problems the scientists concluded ‚Äúmade accurate analysis challenging.‚Äù

The CCST report offered ‚Äúpages upon pages‚Äù of recommendations to improve the accuracy of the data and serve the intent of the law said Laura Feinstein a lead author of the report and sustainability and resilience policy director for San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association or SPUR a public policy nonprofit. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve done a single one.‚Äù

Without accurate records state regulators and public advocates can‚Äôt tell whether the oil industry is using excessive amounts of high-quality water that could otherwise go to cities and farms‚Äîthe reason legislators required expanded reporting in the first place.

Last fall the nonprofit environmental group FracTracker Alliance analyzed CalGEM data to determine how much water the oil industry was using in drought-stricken California. The results should be ‚Äúconsidered a minimum‚Äù due to numerous omissions in the data and ‚Äúvery different‚Äù amounts recorded in different reports for the same years the report cautioned.

That study‚Äôs author Kyle Ferrar western program coordinator for FracTracker Alliance said it‚Äôs ‚Äúincredibly difficult‚Äù to track oil industry water use in California even as competition for scarce water supplies intensifies. ‚ÄúWhen oil company operators inject water it is gone forever removed from the water cycle‚Äù he said.

Inside Climate News asked CalGEM what the agency has done to implement the CCST report‚Äôs recommendations to improve the quality of its data but the agency failed to provide a clear answer.

‚ÄúCalGEM is committed to continuously improving data collection and analysis. CalGEM relies on sound science including research in the CCST report to help inform its work‚Äù said CalGEM public outreach coordinator Christina Jimenez in an emailed statement.

Fran Pavley a former state senator who wrote the law requiring better accounting of oil industry water use had hoped for better results.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important especially during this extended drought that every drop of water counts‚Äù said Pavley who chaired the state senate‚Äôs Natural Resources and Water Committee. ‚ÄúI authored S.B. 1281 during the last drought to provide at least transparency to the oil industry‚Äôs water usage and wastewater disposal practices.‚Äù

California‚Äôs most overdrafted aquifers are often in the vicinity of many of the state‚Äôs oilfields which monitoring has shown affect groundwater Pavley said. Careful monitoring reporting and oversight by regulators she said ‚Äúare essential.‚Äù

Lingering Arsenic Concerns

California is in the third year of another severe drought exacerbating historic disparities in access to clean safe drinking water for communities in Kern County and other parts of the San Joaquin Valley. In Arvin a small predominantly Latino farmworker town in Kern County the local water district finally met federal drinking water standards for arsenic contamination by drilling new wells with the help of $20 million in funding from the state. Exposure to arsenic is linked to cancer skin disorders heart disease diabetes cognitive problems and other serious conditions.

For years Arvin‚Äôs domestic water supplies had dangerous arsenic levels likely from natural sources contaminating groundwater. But scientists have also linked arsenic contamination of groundwater to oilfield operations.

Extracting Kern County‚Äôs notoriously viscious crude from aging oilfields requires more and more water to get the same amount of oil. Oil operators statewide produce more than 130 billion gallons of wastewater a year and their disposal practices have polluted threatened groundwater supplies.

Over the past two and a half years as deeper wells helped bring safe drinking water to Arvin oil companies injected nearly 20 million gallons of wastewater into disposal wells in the oilfield the town straddles according to CalGEM‚Äôs online data dashboard. If that wastewater leaks from disposal wells it could trigger chemical reactions that release arsenic from sediments into groundwater.

Last month a withering report from California‚Äôs state auditor blasted water regulators for delaying efforts to provide clean drinking water to Arvin and other economically strapped Central Valley towns placing the lives of nearly a million people at risk. More than half of those without safe water‚Äîcodified in state law as a human right‚Äîlive in five counties including Kern. The risks of having contaminated drinking water and having to bear the costs of buying expensive water disproportionately affect communities of color.

Estella Escoto has long fought for the right to clean water as president of the Committee for a Better Arvin. She is proud of an early victory in that fight when nearly a decade ago she helped bring filtered drinking fountains and bottle-filling stations to local schools. But many Arvin residents either haven‚Äôt gotten the word that their tap water now meets federal arsenic standards Escoto said or remain unconvinced by official assurances that it‚Äôs finally safe to drink.

When Escoto learned from a community organizer that oil companies still use high-quality domestic water supplies elsewhere in Kern County to extract fossil fuels she was angry. ‚ÄúIf we had information about this‚Äù she said ‚Äúwe would definitely push towards making sure it didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù

Kern County Board of Supervisors Chairman Zack Scrivner did not respond to multiple requests to explain why the county allows the oil industry to draw on its coveted supply of freshwater.

Oil companies could reduce their impact on regional water sources with treatments that remove all the contaminants from wastewater. But treatments to produce high-quality water can be expensive experts say and point to a simpler solution.

‚ÄúYou have the State Water Project carrying Sierra water right down the center of the valley‚Äù said David Bunn a former director of the California Department of Conservation which includes CalGEM. Instead of saddling Central Valley towns with arsenic-laden groundwater people can‚Äôt drink he suggests regulators let towns tap into that clean Sierra water though the necessary infrastructure is currently lacking.

Even so Bunn said ‚ÄúAccess to safe drinking water ought to be a first priority coming out of the state project.‚Äù

That‚Äôs exactly what Arvin resident Gabriela Ojeda thinks. ‚ÄúThey asked us to make sure that we use as little water as possible‚Äù she said through an interpreter. ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre using a lot of water to drill. It just doesn‚Äôt seem fair.‚Äù

An Incoherent Approach to Managing Water

Without a rapid reduction in fossil fuel emissions scientists say California‚Äôs droughts will only get worse. So why does the state allow its increasingly scarce water supplies to support oil and gas production?

The short answer: California does not restrict oil and gas companies‚Äô water use. Rather the state treats the industry as a ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù water user like any other industrial user that generates economic value per gallon of water (by for example creating jobs and contributing state and local revenues).

The Department of Water Resources which oversees State Water Project allocations has no jurisdiction over the oil and gas industry‚Äôs water use an agency spokesperson said. And the State Water Resources Control Board regulates water quality not how much anyone uses.

California is considered this ‚Äúbig regulatory state‚Äù yet it doesn‚Äôt quantify or manage water in a coherent way said Felicia Marcus a fellow at Stanford University‚Äôs Water in the West program and former chair of the State Water Resources Control Board.

And no one‚Äôs allocating water for a particular use said Marcus. When it comes to surface water ‚Äúyou either have a water right or you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

And regulators‚Äô power to govern those rights took a blow on Monday when an appeals court ruled that the state water board lacks authority to curtail water use for those with senior rights.

The vast majority of high-quality water used by the California oil industry comes from the West Kern Water District which relies primarily on groundwater.

But regulators had no authority to regulate groundwater until 2014 when the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act or SGMA was enacted.

SGMA passed during the height of a severe drought alongside the law that expanded oil industry water reporting requires local agencies to bring long-exploited aquifers into sustainable levels of pumping and replenishment by 2040.

Declining water tables from groundwater pumping left thousands of domestic wells without water at the peak of the last drought researchers reported in 2020. Those wells were mostly in the southeastern Central Valley where oil companies also draw on groundwater.

Most well failures happen in economically disadvantaged communities leaving families of modest means struggling to pay for bottled water when nothing comes out of the tap.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an embarrassment that this is happening in California‚Äù said study author Scott Jasechko a water resources expert at the University of California Santa Barbara.

Yet no one really knows how much water is being withdrawn from depleted aquifers Jasechko said.

Skirting Environmental Review

In 2015 former Gov. Jerry Brown announced ‚Äúthe most aggressive benchmark enacted by any government in North America‚Äù to reduce carbon emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2030.

The same year Kern County supervisors‚Äîwho have dismissed local oil producers‚Äô contributions to global warming‚Äîvoted unanimously to streamline permits for tens of thousands of new oil wells over the same period.

Several groups quickly challenged the county‚Äôs 2015 ordinance including Escoto‚Äôs Committee for a Better Arvin after a potentially explosive gas leak forced eight families to evacuate for nearly nine months.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous to have wells in the middle of neighborhoods‚Äù Escoto said frustrated that the hazards aren‚Äôt obvious to regulators. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking for basic human protection. I don‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs so much to ask.‚Äù

Since 2020 oil companies injected nearly 20 million gallons of wastewater in wells around Arvin California which lacked safe drinking water until last year. Credit: Liza Gross

The county‚Äôs environmental review had failed to account for the serious effects expanded drilling would have on water supplies air quality and farmland among other issues the challenge argued.

The threat of contamination from oil and gas operations in a water-starved state is a major concern for SPUR‚Äôs Feinstein who oversaw the CCST oil industry water use report. Her fears are well-founded.

Lax oversight of the industry‚Äôs waste disposal practices posed widespread risks to groundwater researchers reported last year in Environmental Science & Technology. In the few cases when monitoring did occur impacts to groundwater needed for municipal and agricultural supplies were deemed too expensive to clean up.

Keith Gardiner a third-generation Kern County almond farmer was a victim of that lax oversight.

The trouble started when an oil company began injecting wastewater into an old oil well next to Gardiner‚Äôs property contaminating his irrigation well. ‚ÄúIt happens all the time‚Äù he said.

Gardiner had to stop using his polluted well and drill a much deeper one. He settled with the responsible company which shut down its disposal well and his orchard recovered. Gardiner won‚Äôt say more citing a gag order.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll tell you that there‚Äôs never been a suit that‚Äôs been won or lost for water contamination‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because they settle them all.‚Äù

Gardiner later heard about the county‚Äôs plan to fast-track permitting with limited environmental review an effort spearheaded by the oil industry‚Äôs major lobbyists the Western States Petroleum Association and California Independent Petroleum Association.

The county and oil companies were making pulling permits much easier Gardiner said ‚Äúlike an over-the-counter kind of deal.‚Äù

But the county didn‚Äôt plan to offset damage caused by oil operations as required by the California Environmental Quality Act Gardiner said. So he filed another lawsuit this time against the county and soon joined legal forces with Escoto and her allies.

Kevin Slagle a spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association said he could not comment on an ongoing legal case.

The Committee for a Better Arvin charged the county with failing to account for oil operations‚Äô effects on residents‚Äô health and safety and vulnerable water supplies among other harms. ‚ÄúWe have to make sure these things don‚Äôt happen because they‚Äôre not happening in a safe way‚Äù Escoto said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt feel safe.‚Äù

County officials projected that industry demand for municipal and industrial water would reach nearly 4 billion gallons by 2035 a 34 percent increase that would significantly impact regional water supplies. Then they decided against making any effort to mitigate those impacts calling available methods either unfeasible or unaffordable even as they conceded that there was ‚Äúno surplus water‚Äù in the region.

In 2020 a court agreed with Escoto and Gardiner ruling that Kern County violated California environmental law by among other things failing to mitigate water impacts.

Kern County did another review reapproved its ordinance but then quickly turned on ‚Äúthe permit firehose‚Äù said Kevin Bundy a partner at Shute Mihaly & Weinberger. Bundy went back to court on Gardiner‚Äôs behalf in a joint case with Escoto‚Äôs coalition. The county had to wait until the court determined whether its new review complied with state environmental law they argued in the appeal.

The court agreed and in June ordered Kern to stop issuing permits until it had come to a decision. That ruling is expected soon.

Board Chairman Scrivner did not respond to requests for comment about the board‚Äôs plans.

While local and county politicians were eager to let the oil industry extract more oil in violation of California‚Äôs Environmental Quality Act regulators for the state‚Äîwhich proudly touts its environmental bona fides‚Äîdid nothing to intervene.

‚ÄúThis is such a critical moment for addressing both climate change and the public health and community impacts of the fossil fuel industry‚Äù said Bundy. ‚ÄúAnd it is breathtaking how the industry is doubling down at every level of government to preserve business as usual.‚Äù

It‚Äôs inspiring to see the people of Arvin stand up against ‚Äúone of the most powerful industries on earth‚Äù and its government allies Bundy said.

Escoto though won‚Äôt rest until regulators make sure oil companies‚Äô wastewater stays far away from Arvin‚Äôs new drinking water wells. And save high-quality water for the many communities in need.

Several disturbances in the audience cut short the New Bedford High School Whalers' opening night football game vs. the Taunton High Tigers Friday night after police were called to Paul Walsh Field.

Arthur P. Motta Jr. New Bedford Public Schools Community & Public Affairs manager said the information he had received indicated that an argument between two people drew in others. The football teams were not involved.

He also noted that no arrests were made and no firearms were found after a thorough sweep and search of the perimeter by police.

Taunton was leading 33-7 and as the game was eventually called that became the final score.

The Retirement Board has denied a city request to reconsider former Deputy Fire Chief Paul Coderre Jr.'s retirement though he was fired for allegedly moving a heavy smoker grill from the back of his truck while on injury leave.

According to evidence provided in a June hearing Coderre had been acting chief since December 2018 when he went out after being injured on duty on April 3 2019.

He had received over $208574 in benefit pay over approximately two years but was fired by the city on Jan. 25 following a disciplinary hearing in which just cause was found for the termination.

According to surveillance videos through the city's insurer Guardian Claims Services taken on June 10 June 15 and Aug. 30 2021 Coderre was seen moving the grill in his truck.

Coderre's appeal of his termination before the Civil Service Commission is still pending as is his accidental disability retirement application before the city Retirement Board according to the hearing report.

AMGN,Amgen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGhhcm1hcGhvcnVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FsZXhpb25zLXNoYXJlcy1zbGlkZS1hZnRlci1zb2xpcmlzLXBhdGVudC1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtYW1nZW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alexion's shares slide after Soliris patent challenge from Amgen,"Amgen‚Äôs famously voracious legal team is living up to its reputation once again this time with a surprise challenge on the patents surrounding Alexion‚Äôs rare diseases blockbuster Soliris.

The patents surrounding Soliris (eculizumab) extend its period of market exclusivity from 2022 to 2027 but Alexion thinks it has found a chink in the legal armour.

Soliris is still the mainstay of Alexion‚Äôs business and accounted for around four-fifths of the company‚Äôs revenue in the last quarter.

With sales of almost $1 billion each quarter Alexion would be in deep water without Soliris which is approved in several rare diseases but is also very expensive at almost $500000 per year in the US.

That‚Äôs why the protection is so important to Alexion which is hoping to move rare disease patients on to a longer-lasting version of the drug before it loses its exclusivity.

But Amgen‚Äôs move could make this far more difficult should it get a biosimilar approved in time to treat rare diseases related to the complement system such as generalised myasthenia gravis paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome.

The US patent office has said it will review patents on Soliris after Amgen challenged them according to court filings that surfaced on Friday.

The challenge relates to patents covering the composition of the active ingredient eculizumab its formulation and use to treat proxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria

Alexion‚Äôs shares were down more than 10% after the market learned about news of the decision while Amgen‚Äôs shares ticked up.

The decision came from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board the patent office‚Äôs administrative court which said it was beginning an inter partes review of the patents.

The board‚Äôs decision means that it thinks there is a good chance that the challenge may succeed and decisions are made within a year with the possibility of a six-month extension.

Infamous for its litigious behaviour in the pharma industry Amgen lost the latest round in a legal battle with Sanofi over patents over cholesterol drug patents.

In the ruling a district court judge said aside a jury decision from February and said some of Amgen‚Äôs patent claims to protect its PCSK9 drug Repatha were invalid because they did not sufficiently outline the company‚Äôs claimed innovations.

Amgen said it would appeal against the decision in the long-running feud between the two companies with competing drugs from the same class which were approved within a few weeks of each other in 2016.

Aside from the patent challenges the California-based pharma‚Äôs legal department has been typically busy this year ‚Äì in April Amgen became embroiled in a row with Novartis after trying to kick the Swiss pharma out of a development partnership over the migraine drug Aimovig.

Amgen is reportedly unhappy that Novartis‚Äô subsidiary Sandoz is supplying materials to Alder Biopharmaceuticals which is developing a rival calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) class migraine drug.

Novartis has stated that the agreement with Alder is being terminated and the contract manufacturing agreement will only continue until the end of 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But some hardware startups are taking a throwback approach for AI computing to counter the more-is-better approach. Companies including Innatera Rain Neuromorphics and others are creating silicon brains with analog circuitry to mimic brain functionality.

The brain is inherently analog taking in raw sensory data and these chipmakers are trying to recreate the way the brain‚Äôs neurons and synapses work in traditional analog circuitry.

Analog chips can be very good low-power sensing devices especially for some sound and vision applications said Kevin Krewell an analyst at Tirias Research.

‚ÄúAnalog is a closer representation of how the brain acts using distributed memory cells to hold neuron weights or some other way to hold an analog weight‚Äù Krewell said.

AI and machine learning rely mostly on digital chips on the edge or in data centers. But there is a place for analog chips on the edge like in smartphones or cars which need instant intelligence without sending data to the cloud which is used to deliver AI services.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt aim to replace the complete AI pipeline‚Äù said Sumeet Kumar CEO of Innatera Nanosystems BV which is based in Rijkswijk Netherlands.

Innatera‚Äôs third-generation AI chip has 256 neurons and 65000 synapses and runs inference at under 1 milliwatt which doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot compared to the human brain which has 86 billion neurons and operates at around 20 watts. But Kumar said it is possible to create a fully connected recurrent network on top and the chip can operate on coin cell batteries.

The chip is being used by customers to run radar and audio applications with performance that is competitive to other chips in the same class. The goal of the chip is to incorporate low levels of learning and inference on the device which is considered a big challenge for AI among participants at the show.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre trying to do is what we recognize is that when data is moving from a sensor into the cloud it actually gets transformed at multiple stages by different kinds of AI. And what we very often see is customers doing low level sensor data handling in the cloud which is completely unnecessary‚Äù Kumar said.

The Innatera chip takes information coming in from a sensor which is converted into spikes and the content of the input is encoded into exactly when these spikes occur.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly how it happens in your brain. When you hear something there are ‚Ä¶ tiny hair [cells] in your ear which actually detects every frequency band and what is the energy within that band. And those hair [cells] will vibrate produce spikes which then go into the rest of your auditory cortex. Essentially we‚Äôre following that exact same principle‚Äù Kumar said.

Underlying that principle inside of the neurons of brains there are calcium ions and low sodium ions and those concentrations change over time. Innatera‚Äôs chip replicates that same sort of behavior using currents.

‚ÄúWe scale how much current is going into the neuron and coming out of the neuron. That‚Äôs how we are mimicking the brain‚Äù Kumar said.

The idea isn‚Äôt to disrupt the current AI flow into the cloud but to replace the current crop of AI chips on the edge that aren‚Äôt capable of making on-device decisions. The chip also reduces the process of converting analog signals to digital.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt really translate an analog signal over a long distance because then you actually have degradation. We avoid that by converting that analog signal into a spike‚Äù Kumar said.

The foundation of AI today is based on simulating the action of the brain‚Äôs neurons using digital chips and techniques which has been very successful. Based on the progress in Moore‚Äôs law those digital circuits and networks have gotten larger and faster.

But analog has its problems. For example it is harder to gain consistency across the analog chips with calibration issues like drift

‚ÄúAnalog circuits and memory cells don‚Äôt scale like digital circuits. And most times analog eventually has to be converted to digital to interact with the rest of the system‚Äù Krewell said.

To be sure the concept of neuromorphic chips isn‚Äôt new. Companies like Intel and IBM have been developing brain-inspired chips and universities are developing their own versions with analog circuitry. Intel and others have raised awareness of the difference between neuromorphic chips and conventional AI but the startups felt the need to push out their products as AI compute requirements and power efficiency are growing at an unsustainable pace.

Another AI chip company Rain Neuromorphics said its brain-mimicking chip would be used in particle accelerators at Argonne National Laboratory.

In a presentation at the AI Hardware Summit the company didn‚Äôt provide much detail on how the chip would be used but the company‚Äôs CEO Gordon Wilson said that the chip will act like silicon brains that would help the research lab study and draw conclusions on particle collisions.

The silicon brain will provide on-device intelligence to protect against sensor drift which can cause faulty data to be fed to AI systems. The concept of sensor drift is similar to model drift in AI in which bad data fed into a learning model can throw the AI system off course.

Wilson claimed the chip‚Äôs on-device capabilities are more power efficient compared to AI in the cloud.

‚ÄúYou need the ability to learn on the fly. You need the ability to train and fine tune against that sensor drift to maintain the performance of this system‚Äù Wilson said.

The first iteration of the Rain chip ‚Äúwill essentially not look radically different from ‚Ä¶ other analog or mixing of chips‚Äù Wilson said. But it will have the capacity to learn which will unlock more value.

Wilson pointed to possibly different types of memory like memristor circuits providing the ability to learn. Memristors have been under development since the 1960s and pursued by HP (which later became HPE) to use in a mega-computer called The Machine but the technology still remains a novelty.

‚ÄúMemristor serves as a memory resistor. It‚Äôs a resistor that can adjust its resistance. It‚Äôs used as an artificial synapse‚Äù Wilson said. In a brain synapses are not required to be perfect and the requirements will be different for Rain‚Äôs memristors.

Forgot to link last timeList of SNES games that use special chips for those pondering things though it appears to be less of an issue here.I have not seen them yet though if it were to be done today it would probably be quite expensive.The usual cycle (and while I hesitate to use the word usual with FPGA stuff it has been enough years now) is we will see something done on a high end dev board by someone working with them an enthusiastic hacker (few thousand on a FPGA dev kit is within the realms of enthusiasts particularly if you can actually program one in anger) or someone in a university that is using them for a project. Somewhere in there someone will probably decap a CPU (and for the n64 probably the RDP as well https://www.retroreversing.com/n64rdp ) but it is not strictly necessary though can accelerate things. After that then we might see one repurposed from something elseYou may also recognise the name from various hacking scenes. https://debugmo.de/2008/03/thank-you-datel/ or one made for not so portable devices (making it all battery powered is a project in and of itself though this could change as some do also change). Only then would I expect portables to get a look in. Somewhere in the mix will also be fixes for certain problem chips modchips of notable scope and ability (in this case probably bypass some graphics concerns) some in hardware debugging expansion replication (don't know if we will see a N64DD a la https://gbatemp.net/threads/the-upc...h-cart-with-onboard-megacd-recreation.542791/ but it is the sort of thing I would be looking out for).The FPGA market is quite odd and subject to all sorts of oddities. Bitcoin changed things for a minute but then everything went for ASICs* low latency/high frequency wall street trading types bought them and were taught to program them (silliness ensued) when it became apparent they were very good for that (and then sold them on when they were done for next to nothing compared to what they were) they are quite often found in consumer devices that get recycled which changes things for some hackers. Similarly the makers of such things made things a bit easier in recent years as well as dropping the power draw somewhat.I do however have to also note the N64 is more a niche device than many others tackled -- it was a failure at the time and while some enthusiasts have sprung up in the years since then... yeah. Of course said enthusiasts have driven the prices sky high which is a thing to consider in this.*which could be an option here as well -- there are firms that for a not unreasonable amount of money will turn your FPGA code into silicon. Given the original N64 CPU was 350nm then quite reasonable to expect something even better for this (custom firms won't do modern Intel/Nvidia/AMD sort of levels but rather smaller than that).Others playing along at home then this video illustrates some of the trials and tribulations of making a N64 mini many of which will bleed over into the development of this though others get dodgedOthers still more of the ""what is an FPGA?"" persuasion wanting a bit more depth than it is a programmable chip then eevblog is good stuff",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YW5rb2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9zbG9wZS1pcy1hbi1hbmFsb2ctd3JpdGluZy10b29sLWFuZC1vcmdhbml6ZXItdGhhdC10YWtlcy15b3VyLW5vdGUtbWFraW5nLXRvLXRoZS1uZXh0LWxldmVsL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YW5rb2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9zbG9wZS1pcy1hbi1hbmFsb2ctd3JpdGluZy10b29sLWFuZC1vcmdhbml6ZXItdGhhdC10YWtlcy15b3VyLW5vdGUtbWFraW5nLXRvLXRoZS1uZXh0LWxldmVsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slope is an analog writing tool and organizer that takes your note-making to the next level,"As someone who loves combining digital and analog elements in my workflow you‚Äôll even find my desk filled with my laptop tablet various notebooks and of course the ubiquitous sticky notes.

International and regional broadcasters including reli¬≠gious platforms have shown interest in telecasting their pro¬≠grammes on the Walesi Digital Television and radio channel platform.

Prime Minister Voreqe Bainima¬≠rama revealed this to the public during his visit to the Seaqaqa Primary School on his Northern Division tour on Monday.

Mr Bainimarama said there was positive interest from interna¬≠tional and regional broadcasters and religious platforms who opted to telecast their material on the Walesi channel platform.

These included: ABC Australia BBC and Hope channel to join the Walesi Digital television and radio services.

A first-ever High Definition TV channel would be launched later this year through the Walesi plat¬≠form with the FBC Sports channel expected to bring programmes in high definition (HD) quality.

These would enhance the public to view the sports programmes in better HD clarity and view.

Walesi currently had over 700000 users on its online app which is available for both Android and IOS users.

It is also in the process of upgrad¬≠ing from its current app to provide customers with better-improved user access.

‚ÄúFBC has secured exclusive rights on the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar which will be telecasted on the FBC Sports channel in HD quality‚Äù the PM said.

This telecast for the football com¬≠petition would begin on November 21 this year.

Govt assists 218065 Fijians with Walesi Setup Devices

The Government through its Walesi Initiative has assisted 218065 Fijians with Walesi setup devices in the form of Digital Ter¬≠restrial Setup boxes with a further 3164 people receiving Digital Satel¬≠lites.

Marshmello has become one of the world's most recognizable electronic music producers and DJs. However his fame has been associated with the mask not the face behind it. The masked DJ prefers to perform with it no matter what.

When Marshmello first came into the music scene everyone wanted to know who he was and fans became detectives to reveal his true identity.

While he manages to protect his privacy personal space and even the mystery of his looks under the mask people now know who he is as Forbes conducted their investigation and delivered proof.

It Is Already Known Who Is behind the Mask of DJ Marshmello

DJ Marshmello began his career in 2015 by creating remixes of other musicians. His work attracted fans and he began to receive support from musicians DJs and music producers like Skrillex that same year.

During that period his friend unknowingly revealed his real identity. While in an interview with journalist producer presenter and author Katie Couric Skrillex's phone rang.

At the time Couric was looking into his phone and she informed him that Chris was calling. When she said Chris Skrillex said it was Marshmello and told Couric that Marshmello was an upcoming and skilled talent.

As DJ Marshmello was not famous then no one gave the interview another thought until some time later when committed fans wanted to know the man behind the mask.

In November 2017 Forbes decided to unmask the masked DJ and did their investigations. They tracked him through the music rights management site BMI where they discovered that he had registered as a songwriter and performer.

The site excellent for linking pseudonyms with real names showed that Marshmello was linked to Christopher Comstock. Forbes contacted Marshmello's management and what happened next proved they were on the right track.

Less than 24 hours after reaching out to his management with links from the website the data on DJ Marshmello got wiped off the site. They and his lawyer also refused to comment on his identity.

Fans who were also digging into revealing his identity discovered that Skrillex had posted a video in 2016 celebrating the DJ's birthday on the same day as Comstock's birthday.

Shortly after Forbes' initial investigation while they began the vetting process for their ""30 Under 30"" they confirmed that they were right about his identity from their previous investigation.

DJ Marshmello Doesn't Want to Show His Face

Despite their confirmation the DJ has never acknowledged any information on the internet about his true identity. In 2017 he revealed why he prefers to remain under his mask. He tweeted:

""I don't take my helmet off because I don't want or need fame. I'm genuinely trying to create something positive for people to connect with.""

In another tweet he stated ""The helmet makes me Marshmello and also makes you Marshmello...we are all Marshmello."" Marshmello was a name the DJ had picked based on his music's mellow feel.

Marshmello's manager Moe Shalizi also said their concept for the DJ was to create a universal character. He said:

""For us it was how do you create a brand that is accessible to everybody that everyone can be and relate to?""

And He Jokes about Fans' Attempts to Unmask Him

DJ Marshmello has a great sense of humor despite everyone wanting to know everything about his personality. In 2018 he trolled his Canadian fans with a false identity reveal at the iHeartRadio MMVAs.

After the hosts called out his name as the winner of the Best EDM/Dance Artist or Group the hitmaker got on stage to receive his award. He proceeded to unmask himself as fans screamed but instead Shawn Mendes was the one under his mask.

In May 2022 the DJ also sent fans into a frenzy when he liked a fan's tweet of Comstock whom she called Marshmello. The tweet and his reaction quickly went viral with fans calling it a confirmation of his identity.",,,,,,,,,

Photo credit: Screen shot Apple.com

Apple Inc. iPhone 14 models contain a chip from San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. that can talk to satellites according to an analysis of the phone by iFixit and an Apple statement.

They also have have additional custom-designed Apple components used in the phone‚Äôs biggest new feature the analysis determined.

Apple released the new iPhone 14 lineup on Friday. One of the major new features is the ability to connect to satellites to send emergency messages when there is no WiFi or cellular data connection.

Apple said earlier this month that iPhone 14 models contain new hardware for the emergency message service which the company plans to turn on with a software update coming in November.

iFixit a San Luis Obispo-based firm that disassembles iPhones and other consumer electronics to assess how easily they can be repaired took apart an iPhone 14 Pro Max model on Friday revealing the Qualcomm X65 modem chip.

The Qualcomm chip provides 5G connectivity for cellular networks but is also capable of using what is called band n53 the frequency band used by satellites from Globalstar. Qualcomm headquarters is in Sorrento Valley.

Globalstar earlier this month announced a deal in which Apple will take up to 85% of Globalstar‚Äôs satellite network capacity to enable Apple‚Äôs new emergency messaging feature.

In a statement to Reuters on Saturday Apple said there is additional proprietary hardware and software in the iPhone 14 for the new messaging feature.

‚ÄúiPhone 14 includes custom radio frequency components and new software designed entirely by Apple that together enable Emergency SOS via satellite on new iPhone 14 models‚Äù Apple said in a statement.

Apple did not give details about the satellite-specific hardware. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.

Apple is releasing three new watch models (Apple Watch SE Series 8 and Ultra) two iPhone models (the 14 and 14 Pro each in two sizes) and the second-generation AirPods Pro. As a Bloomberg Pursuits journalist who focuses on lifestyle products I'm going to home in on those packed with the most features and therefore the priciest ones‚Äîthe Apple Watch Ultra (from $799) and iPhone 14 Pro (from $999).

Apple Watch Ultra

With a 49mm titanium case and a rugged appearance the Apple Watch Ultra is not your ordinary smartwatch. Yes it has all the features other Apple Watches have but it's able to handle extreme outdoor conditions.

The customizable ‚Äúaction button‚Äù available only on the Apple Watch Ultra is on the left side of the device and coated in a color called ‚Äúinternational orange.‚Äù It's a new hardware addition to make the watch easier to navigate. By pressing the physical button you can track workout intervals start up a built-in diving computer (the Oceanic app by Huish Outdoors LLC available this fall which automatically launches after you submerge and calculates and monitors dive parameters) set up a stopwatch or drop waypoints‚Äîgeographical pinpoints‚Äîalong your route.

Coupled with dual-frequency GPS the waypoints feature allows anyone from hikers to people living in dense urban areas to accurately document the locations they've been to and retrace the route they took in case they get lost. Although I didn't go into the woods to test the GPS system the working of the function felt intuitive. One push on the action button will drop a pin on the location you're at and a simple scroll of the crown on the watch's right side can take you to the previous point you dropped. Selecting the ‚ÄúBacktrack‚Äù function within the Action Button app will map the route you've taken.

The regular Apple Watch Series 8 also has the upgraded compass that allows waypoint dropping and backtracking but it requires more manual maneuvering without the action button‚Äîwhich is probably fine for many folks who don't worry about getting lost in the wilderness on a regular basis.

In a noisy environment‚Äîsay because of the harsh wind on a mountaintop or the hustle and bustle of a big city‚Äîthe Apple Watch Ultra has an upgraded microphone system to pick up your voice for clear phone calls as well as a new speaker that can blast a loud emergency siren that Apple says can be heard up to 600 feet or 180 meters away. (The demonstrator at the presentation said it was too loud to test there.) Another lifesaving function also available for the Series 8 is a new sensor to detect a car crash and notify emergency services.

Along with older features for tracking sleep ECG heart rate and blood oxygen both watch models added two sensors one on the back of the device and the other inside and behind the display to discern changes in body temperature. Apple pitches the feature as a family planning tool: By wearing the watch all the time women can track their ovulation cycles (after it analyzes at least two months of temperature readings) and decide on the best time to get pregnant. The idea seemed cool but I have reservations about wearing a chunky device on my wrist to bed. And to voluntarily relinquish so much data and control to a piece of technology gave me a bit of Black Mirror flashbacks.

The Apple Watch Ultra priced at $799 can also sustain 36 hours of battery life or 60 hours on a low power setting endure temperatures from -4F to 131F and remain water-resistant to a depth of 100 meters.

iPhone 14 Lineups

As mentioned Apple is prioritizing the ‚Äúlifesaving‚Äù aspect of many of the new features. All the iPhone 14s are capable of sending an emergency SOS via satellite (the service will be available in November). That means even without Wi-Fi or cellular data the phones can make emergency calls using satellite technology. They also have a crash detection sensor that will alert emergency services if you're in an accident.

Other than the lifesaving functions there are cool features like setting up multiple lock screens taking better photos in low light and more stabilized action videos. I tested the autofocus front camera while uncomfortably taking a selfie under the gaze of a model dressed in all kinds of shades of green who eventually joined me in a photo and exclaimed ‚ÄúLook it can focus on both of us. ‚Äù It did. In a dim-lit room I captured another model's bored face with cameras on both an iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro. The trio of cameras balanced the dark purple and brown colors while showing the person clearly.

The iPhone 14 (from $799) and iPhone 14 Plus (from $899) seem like a standard upgrade from the iPhone 13‚Äîincluding better 12-megapixel wide cameras and different colors (midnight blue starlight purple and (PRODUCT)RED). Apple offers a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen respectively for the two identical designs and eliminated the Mini option.

In comparison the most exciting features are packed in the pricier iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Available in a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen the two cost at least $999 and $1099 respectively. A notable addition is the pill-shaped black area at the top of the screen where the speaker and front camera are located. Apple calls it the Dynamic Island. It's a multitasking tool that helps people track what they're doing. Say if you're listening to music and need to switch to another app the music app will be automatically shifted up to the island. You can later expand the island to change songs or pause the music. You can also glance at it for a phone call's duration and an animated waveform of the audio; a voice memo's recording; a timer's progress; or see a combination of apps working in the background.

The camera system is a big deal for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max which each have three cameras in the back. The main wide camera is 48 megapixels a monumental boost from 12 megapixels for the iPhone 13 Pro.

The Always-On display for the new models dims the screen instead of completely turning it off so users can see essential information such as the time date and temperature without tapping the screen‚Äîthe essentials are customizable and you can turn off the Always-On display too.

And the Fitness app that used to appear on your iPhone only after pairing with an Apple Watch? It'll show up on your home screen once you upgrade to iOS 16 even if you don't own an Apple Watch. The Fitness tab within the app (coming this fall) is filled with workouts meditations and motivational episodes. New Apple Watch buyers get Apple Fitness for free for three months (existing owners get one month free) then the subscription is $9.99 a month or $79.99 annually.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3RyYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L2FwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXVsdHJhLWdpdmVhd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Apple Watch Giveaway - Win a Free Apple Watch Ultra,"This competition has ended and we have a new Apple Watch Giveaway for 2024 here.

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year ‚Äî her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website ‚Äî the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page ‚Äî so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being na√Øve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

Through the agreement the companies will work with corn farmers in Iowa to implement sustainable farming practices for the production of Spiber‚Äôs biomaterials.

Made from corn-based dextrose Brewed Protein is a next-generation polymer that replaces petroleum-derived materials in a variety of applications ranging from clothing to car seats. ADM and Spiber first partnered in 2020 to build a manufacturing facility in Clinton IA to convert corn dextrose into Brewed Protein using ADM‚Äôs massive microbial fermentation capabilities.

Now both companies are working to expand the environmental impact of Brewed Protein by encouraging Iowa farmers to adopt regenerative farming practices such as the use of cover crops the reduction of tillage and improvement of nutrient management.

Better soil

Many positive benefits are associated with regenerative practices including enriched soil health reduced soil erosion and increased farm profitability. Sustainable practices can also improve the ability of soil to sequester carbon which can result in lowered greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Through the ADM-Spiber project farmers will receive financial compensation and technical support to implement the on-farm changes. The project‚Äôs impacts will also be monitored using Field to Market‚Äôs methodologies and will be ISCC certified for GHG emissions.

Animal-free fibers

Based in Japan Spiber uses precision fermentation to create polymers that can be used to make animal-free spider silk wool leather fur and more. As of 2021 the company had raised an incredible $565M for US expansion including a mass production facility in Iowa.

‚ÄúSustainability is powering ADM‚Äôs growth strategy and more importantly it represents who we are as a company‚Äù said Paul Scheetz ADM‚Äôs director of Climate Smart Ag Origination. ‚ÄúAs evidenced by our Scope 3 commitments we‚Äôre committed to leading in the decarbonization of our entire value chain and regenerative agriculture is a key element of that strategy.‚Äù

Improved supply chain

‚ÄúThrough our in-house life cycle assessment we know that our primary feedstock source is one of the biggest drivers of Brewed Protein polymer‚Äôs environmental impact‚Äù said Sunita Darbe VP of Sustainability at Spiber America.‚ÄùThanks to ADM‚Äôs experience with regenerative agriculture programs in Iowa we are able to incorporate these practices into our supply chain from the beginning of Brewed Protein polymer production in the US. We appreciate their support in making this project possible.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

Drake Milligan may not have won season 17 of America's Got Talent but he's got a whole legion of fans supporting him in the next phase of his career.

After being touted as the early winner throughout the latest NBC installment viewers were left flabbergasted when host Terry Crews announced the country singer had placed third in the competition. Despite not earning the coveted title and $1 million prize Drake didn't let the news get him down. In fact shortly after the AGT 2022 finale he quickly jumped on social media to thank his fans for their support. What's more he reminded folks that there was still lots to celebrate thanks to the release of his debut album Dallas/Fort Worth.

""Alright we did it ‚Äî third place baby!"" he said in an Instagram video posted on September 15. ""Thank you to everybody who voted. This has been the journey of a lifetime. It changed my life and new record Dallas/Fort Worth is coming out tonight! Keep an eye out for it. Thank y'all so much.""

Unsurprisingly AGT fans were ecstatic to find out that they would still be hearing more music from the season 17 contestant. Many immediately took to his Instagram comments section to share their excitement about the album's release. Other took to the opportunity to congratulate Drake on his stellar run.

""Not winning IS Winning !!! No AGT contract. The world is your oyster. You are already won and I can‚Äôt wait to see you on tour!!!"" one fan wrote.

""You're the winner in my book! You've made me love country again so thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"" one person wrote. ""You should‚Äôve won but what a great jumping off point! You‚Äôve got fans for life!"" a different viewer noted. ""You killed it! Such a great performer! Such a pleasure to watch you! üî•üëèüôå"" another added.

Aside from the new album Drake has a lot more in store this year. He is currently embarking on a cross-country tour through the end of October performing hits like ""Sounds Like Something I'd Do"" from his 2021 self-titled EP.

Folks may know ""Sounds Like Something I'd Do"" well since it was the song Drake auditioned for AGT with. He quickly solified himself as a fan-favorite when he later performed ‚ÄúKiss Goodbye All Night.‚Äù At the time judge Simon Cowell dubbed his moment ""the best performance of the night.""

We can't wait to see what he next!

Spurs could have handed north London rivals Arsenal an advantage over City in the Premier League title race had they taken points off the visitors.

Postecoglou's side needed to beat City at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to keep hopes of a top-four finish alive but lost 2-0.

""The foundations are really fragile"" the Australian said. ""The last 48 hours have shown me that.

""It's inside the club outside the club. Outside inside everywhere. It's been an interesting exercise. It's just my observations mate.""

In the build-up to the match Postecoglou was bewildered by some Spurs fans being happy to lose to City because it would damage Arsenal's title chances.

Spurs put up a strong fight against City but Erling Haaland's 51st-minute opener was met with home supporters chanting ""are you watching Arsenal?""

The atmosphere in north London was noticeably flat and when Postecoglou was asked whether this influenced his players he said: ""Of course it does. It is what it is. I can't dictate what people do.

""They're allowed to express themselves any way they want. But yeah when we've got late winners in games it's because the crowd's helped us.""

Postecoglou was captured on video arguing with a Spurs fan in the stadium while two home supporters were filmed doing City's Poznan celebration shortly after the opening goal.

When quizzed on the Spurs fans' chants Postecoglou replied in a spiky media conference: ""I'm not interested mate. I just don't care. Maybe I'm out of step but I just don't care I just want to win.

""I want to be successful at this football club it's why I was brought in. So what other people how they want to feel and what their priorities are are of zero interest to me.

""I know what's important to build a winning team - that's what I need to concentrate on.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwtY29uc3VtZXIvd2FsbWFydC1sYXktb2ZmLWh1bmRyZWRzLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1zdGFmZi1yZWxvY2F0ZS1vdGhlcnMtd3NqLXJlcG9ydHMtMjAyNC0wNS0xNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart to cut jobs at headquarters relocate others,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/walmart-lay-off-hundreds-corporate-staff-relocate-others-wsj-reports-2024-05-14/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwtY29uc3VtZXIvd2FsbWFydC1sYXktb2ZmLWh1bmRyZWRzLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1zdGFmZi1yZWxvY2F0ZS1vdGhlcnMtd3NqLXJlcG9ydHMtMjAyNC0wNS0xNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ldGZsaXgtYXJrYW5zYXMtcHVsYXNraS11bmxvY2tlZC1oaWdnaW5zLWE0YmM0NzI5MjY2NzM4MjM0YjkwYjE5NmQ1NTRhNWY00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sheriff faces questions from Arkansas lawmakers over Netflix series filmed at county jail,"LITTLE ROCK Ark. (AP) ‚Äî Arkansas lawmakers on Tuesday raised questions about a sheriff‚Äôs decision to allow a Netflix documentary series to be filmed at the county jail with one critic saying the move exploited inmates.

Pulaski County Sheriff Eric Higgins defended the decision to allow the series ‚ÄúUnlocked: A Jail Experiment‚Äù to be filmed at the county jail. The eight-episode series which premiered last month highlights a program giving some inmates more freedom at the Little Rock facility.

The decision has prompted scrutiny from local and state officials who said they weren‚Äôt aware of the series until shortly before its premiere. The series focuses on a six-week experiment that gave inmates in one cellblock more freedom by unlocking their cell doors. Higgins said he did not approach Netflix or Lucky 8 the production company that filmed it about the series.

‚ÄúI took action to ensure that we have a reentry program to help those who are booked into our facility to come out and be better individuals‚Äù Higgins told members of the Joint Performance Review Committee.

Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang said he doesn‚Äôt have a problem with the sheriff‚Äôs reentry program or trying something new to address recidivism. But he said he was concerned with it being the focus of a show and questioned how it could be considered an experiment if it was being filmed.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an exploitation of your prisoners that you allowed a film crew to come in‚Äù Dismang said.

Another Republican lawmaker said he was worried about what the show would do to the state‚Äôs reputation comparing it to a 1994 HBO documentary about gangs in Little Rock.

‚ÄúFor most of the people that watched this docuseries this is the first time they‚Äôve ever been exposed to Pulaski County or perhaps to the state of Arkansas‚Äù Rep. David Ray said. ‚ÄúI worry about the brand damage that our state sustains from this being the first perception of our state to other people.‚Äù

Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde ‚Äî the county‚Äôs top elected administrator ‚Äî said he wasn‚Äôt aware of the series until he saw a trailer before its premiere. Hyde has said that the agreement between the sheriff and the production company was illegal because Hyde didn‚Äôt sign it. The county has since returned a $60000 check from the production company that filmed the series.

Higgins a Democrat who was first elected in 2018 and is the county‚Äôs first Black sheriff has had the backing of some community members. The Little Rock chapter of the NAACP has supported Higgins‚Äô decision and supporters of the sheriff filled a committee room for Tuesday‚Äôs hearing.

Democratic Sen. Linda Chesterfield said Higgins‚Äô supporters are looking for ‚Äúsomeone to provide humane treatment for people who have been treated inhumanely.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are viewing this through different lenses and it‚Äôs important we respect the lenses through which we view it‚Äù Chesterfield said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9uby1iYWQtYmxvb2QtYXQtY29uZmVyZW5jZXMtc3ByaW5nLW1lZXRpbmdzLWJ1dC1kaXZvcmNlLWJldHdlZW4tYWNjLWZsb3JpZGEtc3RhdGUtYW5kLWNsZW1zb24tc3RpbGwtbGlrZWx5L9IBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9uby1iYWQtYmxvb2QtYXQtY29uZmVyZW5jZXMtc3ByaW5nLW1lZXRpbmdzLWJ1dC1kaXZvcmNlLWJldHdlZW4tYWNjLWZsb3JpZGEtc3RhdGUtYW5kLWNsZW1zb24tc3RpbGwtbGlrZWx5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No bad blood at conference's spring meetings but divorce between ACC Florida State and Clemson still likely,"AMELIA ISLAND Fla. -- It's business as usual in the ACC for Florida State and Clemson at the conference's annual spring meetings even if the schools continue to quarrel with the conference inside the courtroom.

The ACC is a battleground with Florida State and Clemson locked in multiple legal disputes as they challenge the league's grant of rights and contemplate a departure from the conference. The catalyst for this upheaval is the growing disparity in revenue between the ACC and the more financially robust Power 2 conferences (Big Ten and SEC) which could amount to as much as $40 million per year for their members.

For now everyone is acting professionally even if it seems inevitable Clemson and Florida State's marriage with the ACC is nearing an end. Clemson and Florida State administrators were not excluded from meetings this week at the conference's spring get-together and the lawsuits -- FSU v. ACC ACC v. FSU Clemson v. ACC and ACC v. Clemson -- were not a topic. Athletic directors were cordial and professional. Alford joked with colleagues. Wake Forest AD John Currie even elicited a laugh from Alford as he hunched behind his colleague during an impromptu gathering with the media.

And no one spoke in hushed tones in the hallways of the Ritz-Carlton as meetings stretched into the evening Tuesday.

Still the silent question lingered: is this marriage salvageable?

""We'll just wait for that to play out"" Florida State athletics director Michael Alford said Tuesday. ""We have great partners in this conference great relationships but at the end of the day we've got to do what's best for Florida State and look at the changing environment of collegiate athletics and make sure we're there to be successful.""

Alford maintains there is ""no ill will inside the room"" in conference meetings. Money however steers everything -- and it can sour relationships no matter how strong. One year ago here Florida State and Clemson successfully pushed for new ""success initiatives"" that would reward schools in the ACC for their on-field success. Those revenue structures are still being tweaked Alford said.

It was also here one year ago that news leaked seven schools in the ACC had explored potential exits from the conference after studying the league's ironclad grant of rights. Such an exit before the expiration of the media deal with ESPN (2036) could cost schools more than $500 million apiece.

Since then Florida State's Board of Trustees has held multiple meetings to discuss the university's future in the ACC. In August trustee Justin Roth asked Alford and university president Richard McCullough for an exit plan by August 2024.

""If you go back to the president and myself we've never come out and said 'Hey we want to leave the conference'"" Alford said. ""We're letting the court proceedings play out. What our job is to make sure with all the changes in college athletics -- and I've said this the last two years -- is to make sure Florida State is in the best position possible to be successful.""

Clemson athletics director Graham Neff declined to comment when reached by CBS Sports.

Developments within college athletics have also loosened the ACC's grip as a power player. Undefeated Florida State was excluded from the College Football Playoff in December perhaps hastening FSU to file suit against the ACC. Earlier this year the CFP opted to provide the ACC 17% of revenue shares starting in 2026 which amounts to about $8 million less than colleagues in the Big Ten and SEC. Meanwhile the collegiate athletics model is ticking toward implosion as the House v. NCAA case could be settled as soon as May 23 according to CBS Sports' Dennis Dodd. The settlement will likely put schools on the hook for a new revenue-sharing model with players that will cost between $15 million and $25 million per year.

Meanwhile unrest continues in the ACC. North Carolina trustees this week voiced frustration with the widening revenue gap and openly criticized longtime athletics director Bubba Cunningham Monday for an expected $17 million deficit in the school's athletics budget.

""I really don't have any reaction"" Cunningham said Monday after exiting a meeting of the ACC's athletics directors. ""I haven't talked to anybody. You know I've been here the whole time.""

UNC's board of trustees will meet Thursday and Cunningham will attend that meeting to address those concerns.

The landscape has shifted and will continue to shift. The Pac-12 has all but dissolved -- only Oregon State and Washington State remain. The Big Ten is expanding and so is the ACC which has shattered geographical lines with the additions of Cal and Stanford plus SMU. The SEC is adding Oklahoma and Texas. The Big 12 has added eight schools in the span of a calendar year.

In the ACC Clemson and Florida State might just be the linchpin from another round of chaos.

""We're looking at two institutions that want success and see the changing environment in collegiate sports and want programs to compete at the very top level and understand that to compete at that top level we need to have our options available"" Alford said. ""And I'm speaking really for Florida State that we need to have our options but I'd assume that Clemson is also looking at the same model that's going on in the collegiate landscape and want their programs to compete at a national level at an elite national level.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1L3VzLW5hdnktcmVtb3Zlcy1maXJzdC0xNTVtbS1hZ3MtZnJvbS11c3MtenVtd2FsdC1hdC1pbmdhbGxzLXNoaXBidWlsZGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Navy removes first 155mm AGS from USS Zumwalt at Ingalls Shipbuilding,"US Navy removes first 155mm AGS from USS Zumwalt at Ingalls Shipbuilding US Navy destroyer USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) has moved one step closer to Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) integration with the removal of one of its Advanced Gun System (AGS) on May 7th.

The addition of the hypersonic CPS missiles to USS Zumwalt will provide unparalleled capabilities for firepower and range.

The guided missile destroyer arrived at HII‚Äôs Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula Mississippi in August 2023 for a homeport change ahead of its planned Drydocking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA). USS Zumwalt entered a floating drydock at Ingalls Shipbuilding around November 28th as seen on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Naval News also found that USS Zumwalt entered HII‚Äôs Integration Area between November 28th and December 13th which marked the beginning of its refit to carry hypersonic missiles.

Several months after the ship arrived at Ingalls Shipbuilding a photo published on the official Facebook page of USS Zumwalt shows the first 155mm AGS being removed from the ship. Satellite imagery taken May 9th showed one AGS missing from the Zumwalt a clear change from previous weeks showing no visible work.

Program Executive Officer (PEO) Ships Rear Admiral Tom Anderson emphasized the urgency of CPS integration onto the DDG-1000 platform during a tour of USS Zumwalt in Pascagoula during a tour of the USS Zumwalt in drydock in April:

‚ÄúThe Navy / Industry team is moving with a sense of urgency to integrate CPS capability into USS Zumwalt. Many steps have been taken and are on track to get this important player on the field on time.‚Äù

The removal of the first AGS from the USS Zumwalt represents a step forward in the evolution of the Zumwalt-class destroyer program which was once built around the AGS concept that provided ship-to-shore precision firepower with the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP).

The original contract for CPS integration was awarded to Lockheed Martin in February 2023. The initial contract was valued at $1.1B with modifications that could bring the overall contract value to $2B over the entire Zumwalt-class if the US Navy chooses to execute on that portion of the contract.

Following Lockheed Martin‚Äôs integration work Huntington Ingalls Industries was awarded a $154.8M contract for the modernization of USS Zumwalt In August 2023 following an earlier $10.3M contract for modernization planning for the two-year period. The same month USS Zumwalt arrived in Pascagoula Mississippi to begin modernization work.

When complete USS Zumwalt will have four Multiple All-Up Round Canisters (MACs) carrying three CPS missiles each adding to a total of twelve hypersonic boost-glide missiles. The aft AGS will be removed at a later date but it is not known at this time what will be put in its place.

The Zumwalt-class Advanced Payload Module is expected to take up one or both of the 155mm AGS currently installed on all three ships in the class. Graphic courtesy of H.I. Sutton.

A second Zumwalt subsystems contract for CPS integration has already been awarded to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works for the procurement of Large Missile Vertical Launch Systems ‚Äì Ship Set Two. This contract was awarded as a firm fixed-price modification to the previously awarded contract for DDG-1000‚Äôs Large Missile Vertical Launch Systems.

Work on this set of VLS systems is expected to be complete by June 2025‚Äîwhen DDG-1001 USS Michael Monsoor is expected to enter Drydocking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) for its modernization and refit to receive CPS launch canisters."

Christy Reeves executive director for Lubbock Habitat for Humanity said local volunteers along with 68 national volunteers from Blitz Home Builders and numerous donors including Atmos Energy made this year‚Äôs build a success.

‚ÄúI don't know how we ever did this without Atmos Energy‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúBut these are going to be the first zero-net-energy houses ever built in Lubbock Texas. It's incredible.‚Äù

Becky Palmer president of the West Texas Division for Atmos Energy said these zero-net-energy homes are designed to produce as much energy as they consume during the year.

Habitat for Humanity builds three homes in 12 days

This is achieved through installing solar panels on the roofs of the homes along with using windows that are Energy Star rated efficient spray insulation and efficient natural gas appliances.

‚ÄúThis balanced energy approach with natural gas really creates this reliable and sustainable home that will fuel the family's safe and driving future‚Äù Palmer said.

When creating the homes for families Palmer said it was important to remember affordable house need affordable energy costs to go with them.

This year's build was also a special operation for Habitat for Humanity because it was dedicated to one of their founding board members who died recently.

Former Director Larry Landusky presented Joy Vann with a commemorative hammer in honor of her husband and founding board member William ‚ÄúPenny‚Äù Pennington Vann.

‚ÄúHe was so humble that he refused to let (the) Habitat board name an award in his honor‚Äù Landusky said. ‚ÄúSo that's the reason why it's a special privilege ‚Äî special day today ‚Äî that this will forever be known as the 2022 William Pennington Vann Blitz Build.‚Äù

Habitat also received its largest personal gift from veteran Cheryl Boyd Madison which will go toward Habitat‚Äôs first Veteran‚Äôs Day Blitz Build to build a home for a veteran.

Reeves said the event will be a one-week build starting on Nov. 5 and ending on Veterans Day with a red white and blue celebration.

‚ÄúWe want everyone in Lubbock to help veterans because our vision for Habitat is everyone in the world deserves a decent place to live and above all people who served our country do‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúWe're going to start making that happen in Lubbock.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,,,,

The county board of elections rebuffed the attempts by Recorder Becky Lynch and Clerk of Courts Faith Andrews because state and federal laws tightly restrict who can access information about the machines which if disseminated could pose a security risk for safe elections.

Lynch in an email to cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer however claims she found the manuals online and sent them to members of the county‚Äôs automatic data processing board. She said Andrews sought the information at a time when the board of elections began the process of buying new voting machines.

‚ÄúThat sparked the requests for more information and the manuals to the machine all among the many headlines of voter fraud at the time‚Äù Lynch‚Äôs email said.

The requests happened at a time when Republicans at local levels across the country began pushing for information on voting machines to try and find proof that fraud contributed to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs loss in the 2020 presidential election in what has become known as the ‚ÄúStop the Steal‚Äù movement.

Dozens of court challenges and investigations turned up no evidence of any widespread fraud in the election. Criminal investigations into data breaches and attempted data breaches in other parts of the country have been launched and appear similar to the one in Lake County.

Lynch in a follow-up email to a reporter forwarded the manuals and said she later found them by conducting an internet search using the voting machine model numbers.

Lake County Board of Elections Director Ross McDonald had said he and the board of elections attorneys determined that Andrews and Lynch should not have received the manuals and denied their requests.

‚ÄúWhat really mattered to us is that this is a very sensitive document and it‚Äôs a security record which is exempt from public records laws in Ohio‚Äù McDonald said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of potential to give people insight into administrator-level information that only election officials should know.‚Äù

McDonald said there are several levels of elections security that likely would thwart a potential attempt at hacking. Still he said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a risk that shouldn‚Äôt be there.‚Äù

Andrews did not return multiple messages seeking comment.

On May 4 2021 the day of a special election someone using Lake County Commissioner John Hamercheck‚Äôs security card swiped into the building logged onto the county‚Äôs server with a non-county laptop in Hamercheck‚Äôs office and recorded county computer data officials previously said. The attempted hack never reached the board of elections servers and only amounted to showing wireless printers linking up with each other officials previously said.

Screenshots of what was accessed ended up displayed at a cyber symposium that MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell a Trump supporter had promised would demonstrate election fraud.

Lindell posted a video message on social media Wednesday that said the FBI seized his phone and asked him questions about an elections data breach scheme in Mesa County Colorado in which authorities have charged local elections clerk Tina Peters and a deputy clerk with breaching the county‚Äôs voting system technology.

The information stolen from Mesa County ‚Äî a hard drive copy of proprietary software developed by Dominion Voting Systems that is used across the country ‚Äî ended up featured in Lindell‚Äôs symposium alongside the benign information taken from the Lake County commissioner‚Äôs office.

Both Peters and Hamercheck had spoken with Lindell associate Doug Frank a former Cincinnati-area teacher who worked with local officials across the country prior to the symposium according to The Washington Post. Frank on Wednesday wrote on Telegram that the FBI also seized his phone.

Hamercheck previously denied any involvement in the incident. A spokeswoman for the Lake County commissioners referred a reporter to county prosecutors. Assistant Lake County Prosecutor David Hackman declined comment.

Ohio Attorney General spokesman Steve Irwin said the investigation remains on-going as did Ohio Secretary of State spokesman Rob Nichols. An FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson confirmed the existence of the investigation to The Washington Post in August 2021. When asked about the status of the case this week the agency‚Äôs new spokeswoman Susan Licate said she couldn‚Äôt confirm or deny the investigation existed.

Elections officials have said attempts to gain access to voting machine information could undermine the confidence in secure elections and in cases across the country where information has been turned over could render voting machines and tabulators vulnerable to hackers.

McDonald Lake County‚Äôs director of its board of elections said he has never had requests for voting manuals in the last seven years. He said he doesn‚Äôt believe Lynch or Andrews did anything nefarious though they may have been motivated by rampant unsubstantiated rumors of fraud that permeated the country since the 2020 presidential election he said.

‚ÄúI think they just wanted the manuals because there was a lot of talk in circles regarding the 2020 election that they believe that there was a lot of fraud that occurred‚Äù McDonald said.

Lynch has posted on social media about 2020 election fraud and re-posted statements from Trump about how the election was stolen.

In April 2021 shortly before the breach Lynch asked the board of elections for the manuals for the county‚Äôs voting machines and tabulators both for the machines they used at the time and the new ones the county was considering buying. It eventually bought the machines. McDonald said he denied the request and never heard back from Lynch.

Lynch a member of the county‚Äôs data board later tried to route the purchase of the machines through the data board. McDonald said that was improper and Lynch‚Äôs request was denied.

The day after the attempted breach Andrews emailed McDonald and said she had previously asked for the manuals for machines being used at the time and during the 2020 presidential election along with the manuals for the new machines.

‚ÄúStill don‚Äôt have those‚Äù Andrews wrote. ‚ÄúI need to see copies as soon as possible please.‚Äù

McDonald sent her the poll workers‚Äô manual the same day and sought an opinion from Lake County prosecutors on the machines‚Äô manuals. Andrews immediately responded saying: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any indication on this manual anywhere that it was produced by the manufacturer of the machine‚Ä¶ ES&S. I need the manual produced by ES&S for their machine‚Ä¶operations manual and those that would contain specifications for the voting machine itself as well as the tabulator.‚Äù

She followed up five days later after hearing that McDonald asked the prosecutor‚Äôs office for legal advice.

‚ÄúYou had to ascertain whether another elected official for the County of Lake an officer of the Court could view the manuals for the existing voting machines. Wowser‚Ä¶that‚Äôs intense‚Äù she wrote.

Assistant Lake County Prosecutor Michael DeLeone responded two weeks after Andrews‚Äô initial request and denied it citing Ohio law that bars the dissemination of the manuals.

‚ÄúIn hindsight I‚Äôm not sure we really thought about it too much‚Äù McDonald said. ‚ÄúMaybe if we knew about the attempted data breach in real time we would have looked at it differently.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFzY2llbmNlY2VudHJhbC5jb20vaG93LWFsZ29yaXRobWljLXRyYWRpbmctY29tcGFuaWVzLWF1dG9tYXRlLXRoZWlyLWludmVzdG1lbnQtc3RyYXRlZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Algorithmic Trading Companies Automate Their Investment Strategy - DataScienceCentral.com,"It‚Äôs worth remembering that many machine learning algorithms had their start in investment trading.

Algorithmic or automated trading refers to trading based on pre-determined instructions fed to a computer ‚Äì the computers are programmed to execute buy or sell orders in response to varying market data. It‚Äôs a trading strategy widely adopted in the finance industry and still growing. The global algorithmic trading market is predicted to reach $18 billion by 2024 compared to $11 billion as of 2019.

The rise of algorithmic trading has coincided with declining barriers to information access and computing resources. Algorithmic traders can program computers to detect price discrepancies and act on them within milliseconds. The idea is to leverage computers‚Äô speed and processing power to produce better results.

Many participants in the global markets use algorithmic trading‚Äì banks hedge funds mutual funds insurance companies and even retail traders. To trade algorithmically investors must first develop or buy their trading algorithms. They‚Äôll then test it on historical or live market data to ensure it‚Äôs profitable. Once deployed live the algorithm will place trades based on instructions e.g. buy shares of Company A if the 30-day average trading volume rises above 2 million.

Algorithmic trading can bring sizeable profits but it carries significant risks like any investment strategy. If your algorithm isn‚Äôt well-designed or if market conditions change suddenly it can lead to severe losses.

How Companies Automate their Investment Strategy With Algorithmic Trading

When a company has decided to adopt algorithmic trading there are various steps to follow. They include:

Fetching the data Designing the algorithms Testing Market access Review Fetching the Data

Market data and automated trading are inseparable. You‚Äôll need data to validate your trading strategy test it and execute it on the live markets. Fortunately there are various ways to get the data that you need.

You can pay for historical market data from an exchange or financial portal even though it can be expensive. Exchanges also usually give real-time market data for a fee. Otherwise you can get it from your broker or external data vendors.

There are many data vendors on the market and some even offer considerable datasets for free. Google the popular search engine provides a tool that lets you search for datasets from around the web. For instance you want to know the price of crude oil going back years. A simple ‚Äúcrude oil price‚Äù search query yielded the results: you can observe that Google linked to over 100 datasets of historical crude oil prices. It lets you filter the datasets by usage rights topic download format and if they‚Äôre free or paid. This tool is effective for finding datasets to test your algorithms on.

Another way to get data is using web scraping bots to gather information from different websites. The bots are free to create and are very customizable but you need sufficient programming skills to do this. This option is ideal for people that need uncommon datasets.

Designing the algorithms

When you‚Äôre sure of getting the datasets to test your intended algorithm it‚Äôs time to start developing it. Creating trading algorithms requires an in-depth knowledge of the financial markets alongside computer programming skills. Mathematical knowledge is also essential if you want to create practical trading algorithms.

Hedge funds insurance funds and their ilk often have dedicated quant teams consisting of people with proficient analytical skills. These people think of algorithmic trading strategies and work alongside programmers to implement them. Some might be programmers and not need external help to execute their strategies.

Some companies don‚Äôt have the resources to hire an in-house team to develop trading algorithms. Others may have the resources and choose not to. Instead they buy algorithms built by third-party developers.

There are many marketplaces where you can buy trading algorithms if you lack the skills to build yours. One example is the MQL5.community marketplace where you can find over 26000 ready-made trading solutions created by experts. Likewise if you have a trading algorithm planned out and need a programmer to write the code you can hire one of over 1200 developers through the freelance marketplace.

If you‚Äôre coding a trading robot by yourself it‚Äôll be wise to use the MQL5 language. This high-level language (based on C++) features a set of built-in functions for managing trades. You can use a simple script to execute trading actions (e.g. close all open orders) and there are custom indicators to analyze currency and stock prices.

Testing

Once the trading robot based on your algorithm is ready you must first test it before deploying it. The aim is to know how your algorithm will perform on the live markets and spot any mistakes. If you notice that your trading bot is generating losses during testing you can review the code to see what went wrong. If the problem is from your underlying algorithm you can adjust it or scrap it and build a new one.

There are two main types of testing;

Backtesting : Testing your trading strategy on historical data to see how it would have fared over a specific period.

: Testing your trading strategy on historical data to see how it would have fared over a specific period. Forward Testing: Testing your strategy on real-time market data.

Backtesting is the first step in determining your trading algorithm‚Äôs effectiveness while forward testing gives more chances to evaluate its accuracy. They both play critical roles in developing a successful strategy no matter what asset you‚Äôre trading (stocks bonds commodities etc.).

You can use the MQL5 Cloud Network to conduct multiple backtests simultaneously on the backs of over 41000 CPU cores across the globe. These cores made available by a network of individual users are more affordable than a typical cloud provider because of reduced infrastructure costs. You can also earn money by adding your spare CPU space to the network.

Market Access

If you‚Äôre satisfied with the testing results it‚Äôs time to deploy your algorithm on the live markets. The key here is finding the right platform to deploy it on. You‚Äôll need to connect with an established brokerage platform that lets you buy or sell different types of assets according to your algorithm‚Äôs specifications.

Critical considerations when choosing your brokerage include:

Connectivity to the markets: Don‚Äôt expect an exchange to give you access to all the global markets. Look for the ones that connect to the specific markets you‚Äôre trading on. For example if you want to trade Chinese stocks and bonds it‚Äôll be wise to pick a local exchange rather than a foreign one.

You don‚Äôt just deploy your algorithm and call it a day. It‚Äôs necessary to continually review its performance to see if it‚Äôs giving you the expected results. Are your orders executing at their intended price levels? Have market conditions changed that warrant an adjustment? Is the algorithm‚Äôs real-life performance matching the back-tested results? These are examples of vital things to watch out for.

High-frequency trading

High-frequency trading is the most common form of algorithmic trading that finance firms adopt today. It involves using sophisticated computer programs to transact in large amounts at very high speeds. It‚Äôs estimated that high-frequency trading accounts for 50% of trading volume in the U.S. equity markets and between 24% and 43% in European equity markets.

High-frequency trading systems use algorithms to analyze the markets recognize trends in fractions of seconds and act on them. To get into this sector you‚Äôll need high-speed computers real-time data feeds and trading algorithms. You may also need to rent servers located as close as possible to the exchange servers to reduce time delays and they don‚Äôt come cheap.

With the proliferation of information access and decreasing costs of cloud computing resources it has become easier than ever to set up a high-frequency trading operation.

Benefits of Algorithmic Trading

Trades are timed correctly and executed at the best possible prices. Computers have laser-like focus and can observe changing market conditions down to a few milliseconds to execute trades based on pre-programmed instructions.

With algorithmic trading you avoid the risks of human errors that can cause significant losses.

You can test algorithms on historical or real-time market data to see if it‚Äôs a feasible strategy before deploying it.

You can adopt algorithmic trading if you think you‚Äôre cut out for it. This article gives a good overview of the requirements and how you can leverage them to set up a successful automated trading operation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vYmVjb21pbmdodW1hbi5haS9uby15b3UtZG9udC1uZWVkLW1sb3BzLTVlMWNlOWZkYWE0YtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No You Don‚Äôt Need MLOps. Keep It Simple: the complexity of full‚Ä¶ | by Lak Lakshmanan,"No You Don‚Äôt Need MLOps

MLOps started from a straightforward problem statement ‚Äî that the technical debt associated with ML models becomes intolerable if the models are not adjusted over time to account for changes in the environment. Since that 2015 observation ML models and frameworks have been built that make it relatively easy to avoid the most glaring potholes in the way of the ML practitioner. However in the past year or so the MLOps buzzword has taken on a life of its own. At this point most things sold as MLOps are overkill and unnecessary for most teams.

In this article I take a back-to-first-principles approach to the MLOps field talk about the original problems how they can be elegantly addressed in today‚Äôs ML frameworks and why any additional complexity beyond these keep-it-simple (KISS) solutions is unnecessary.

What‚Äôs MLOps?

MLOps is the concatenation of machine learning (ML) and operations (Ops) and is analogous to DevOps which is the concatenation of software development and operations. DevOps came about because lots of software was developed by software engineers and then handed over to systems administrators who didn‚Äôt code and couldn‚Äôt make changes. This meant that every single change that needed to be made to the production system had to be escalated back to the software development team. The solution was DevOps ‚Äî have people in production who understand the code and can make changes to it. In order to do this the ability to quickly make changes track dependencies etc. needed to be done.

By analogy the purpose of MLOps is for operations people to administer ML models. As long as your ML system is simple enough that an ops person can (1) find out when it isn‚Äôt working properly (2) make small changes to it and (3) redeploy the model you are achieving the goal of MLOps. The technology solutions associated with MLOps are optional because the ML frameworks themselves have come a long way.

Long way since what?

An observation and a viral image by D. Sculley et al

D. Sculley and co-authors from Google wrote a NIPS paper in 2015 titled ‚ÄúHidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems‚Äù. There they observed:

Developing and deploying ML systems is relatively fast and cheap but maintaining them over time is difficult and expensive.

Included in that paper is a viral image that you will find in pretty much every introduction to MLOps:

Viral image from D. Sculley et al 2015

They observed that the machine learning model is a small part of the overall ML system and that you will find that changes anywhere in this complex system will make changes to the ML model itself necessary.

The paper resonated with me because this it described precisely how I was building and productionizing ML models in the 2010s. For example one of the models I built was to apply quality-control to weather radar data to remove biological artifacts from it:

ML model to remove biological artifacts from weather radar data from V. Lakshmanan C. Karstens J. Krause and L. Tang ‚ÄúQuality control of weather radar data using polarimetric variables‚Äù J. Atm. Ocea. Tech. vol. 31 pp. 1234‚Äì1249 6 2014

This involved a complex orchestration of data collection feature extraction data verification and a series of steps that then needed to be precisely repeated in production to avoid training-serving skew:

So the goal of MLOps as articulated in the Google Cloud MLOps whitepaper does resonate with me:

MLOps provides a set of standardized processes and technology capabilities for building deploying and operationalizing ML systems rapidly and reliably.

So what‚Äôs the issue?

MLOps tries to automate too much

At a high-level the ‚Äústandardized process‚Äù in MLOps is all about automation. Having recognized that there is a lot of complexity surrounding the ML model the solution that MLOps practitioners have landed on is to make the surrounding processes (e.g. data validation feature creation etc.) systematic so that it can be automated. Once it is fully automated the argument goes you don‚Äôt need to worry about complexity.

Again from the Google Cloud MLOps white paper:

[MLOps] advocates formalizing and (when beneficial) automating critical steps of ML system construction

with the following steps described as being necessary to automate:

Steps of an ML workflow that need to be automated according to MLOps practitioners. Image from Google Cloud MLOps whitepaper

The problem is that automation takes a life of its own and after a while you find yourself spending more time on automation than on the thing you are supposedly making time for.

xkcd by Randall Munroe. Automation takes a life of its own.

It is necessary now to go back to first principles. Is all this automation necessary if your goal is to enable ops people to administer ML models?

Here‚Äôs the thing. While the systems people were out there automating the ML ecosystem ML capabilities and ML frameworks have not stood still. Advances in NLP and computer vision as well as frameworks like Keras and Pytorch have greatly simplified the ML workflow. Also the general awareness of ML has gone up. Therefore:

You don‚Äôt need to automate something that is now automatic. For example data preprocessing layers in Keras make what used to be a really complex text processing workflow a single function call. As does the ability to directly embed text sentences using models like Bert. Much of the text preprocessing workflow that MLOps people were trying to automate is no longer necessary.

A manual step is okay if your workflow is streamlined and the situation is rare enough. You don‚Äôt need to automate absolutely everything. Thus for example CI/CD is unnecessary if launching a job is a matter of running a single command. You don‚Äôt need to build complex automated drift detection if someone can easily launch a retraining job if they see the model drifting.

You can teach ops people new tricks. They can monitor GPU usage and correlate changes in GPU utilization with potential changes in the data being processed by the model.

Key challenges that cause technical debt in ML models

Given this let‚Äôs go back to first principles and consider that MLOps came about as a way to address the build up of technical debt in ML models. Let‚Äôs look at why technical debt builds up. The key challenges that cause technical debt to build up in ML models are:

Training-Serving Skew where differences crop up between training and serving stacks. Take the case of an NLP model. Suppose you remove all stop words (‚Äúthe‚Äù ‚Äúand‚Äù etc.) before you train the model. The model has never seen these words so you‚Äôd better remove the stop words before feeding any text to the model in production. If you don‚Äôt do that you have no idea what the model will do. Precisely replicating the training steps when serving is a key challenge. Clients are interested in a capability that involves multiple steps only one of which is the ML model. Suppose the client wants to find out what interest rate you can offer them. Your code invokes an ML model which provides back a credit score for the client. Based on the credit score you choose a bank and obtain that bank‚Äôs current offer. The point is that the client capability requires three steps: (a) computing the credit score which is ML (b) choosing the bank which is based on rules and (c) getting the current offer which is an API call. Every time any of these systems change you have to do an integration test. The incoming data changes characteristics. Suppose a new law is passed that raises the minimum wage. The distribution of income that your credit score model sees will be different in production than in training. How does this affect the ability of your model to assess applicants? The correct answer changes over time. Perhaps you a model that recommends items in your product catalog. As new items get added to the catalog and some items are retired the correct answer from the recommendation model will have to change. Model fairness issues arise. Suppose a new college is built in a town. The number of young people with no credit history from that area will increase. You might have as one of your features the ratio of applicant income to average income at the location. How does this affect the ability of your model to fairly assess applicants from that area? Parts of the system aren‚Äôt changed when new code is checked in. Suppose your credit score model uses a library to determine the lat-long location given an applicant‚Äôs street address. If that library is changed to be more coarse in order to protect applicants‚Äô privacy but the model isn‚Äôt retrained you will have a problem. Need to be able to troubleshoot old results. It may be possible for a regulator or court to ask you to explain you made a certain decision 2 years ago. Will you be able to resurrect the entire ML model and associated ecosystem to be able to playback and troubleshoot the results?

The challenges can be solved through automation

These key challenges can be solved through automation. Specifically one way to precisely align feature creation between training and serving is to use a feature store so that you can get the value of a feature as of a certain time and version. Similarly a way to ensure that consistency in all the steps in a capability to code it up as a set of containerized steps called an ML pipeline.

These options are summarized below:

Key challenges that lead to technical debt in ML and automation solutions for them. If you are unfamiliar with Feature Store ML Pipelines etc. I recommend that you read Machine Learning Design Patterns (of course I‚Äôm biased)

If the incoming data can change characteristics sample the requests and store them in a data warehouse. Once you know the correct answer (whether it is through manual labeling or because the predicted outcome has come to pass) run an evaluation query that joins the request predicted answer and true answer and computes the evaluation metric.

If drift is detected or the correct answer has changed launch a training job automatically. This is called continuous training.

If model fairness issues automation is supposed to help. But I haven‚Äôt heard a good explanation of how.

In order to be able to troubleshoot old results make sure to store all datasets and models in a registry so that you can retrieve them later. Of course you are already storing your code in a version-control system.

But is automation the only way to solve these problems? Or have simpler methods come about?

Simpler solutions exist

Take the concept of training-serving skew. Do you need to go all the way to a Feature Store to solve this problem?

Nope. There are classes of ML problems (such as computer vision) for which feature engineering is now unnecessary. My radar quality control application would now be done with an off-the-shelf image segmentation model such as UNet and readily deployed. Advances in data engineering mean that a streaming pipeline capability such as Apache Beam can efficiently invoke an ML model even if it is deployed as a web service

Advances in ML modeling and data engineering have made my radar QC application much easier to implement today

Even if you do need custom preprocessing as the Machine Learning Design Patterns book suggests a simpler solution to the problem of training-serving skew is to use the Transform pattern. In Keras this involves using preprocessing layers (for built-in capability) and Lambda layers (for custom capability)

The Transform pattern is a simpler solution to Training-Serving skew

The set of simpler solutions is summarized below:

If clients are interested in a capability that involves multiple steps export your ML model and then deploy it as a web service with no state (this is called a Stateless Serving Function and is supported directly by Keras for the export and Sagemaker/VertexAI for the deploy). This way the steps can all change independently because they are loosely coupled through REST APIs.

While continuous evaluation is fancy there are few systems where you need to detect changes in the incoming data distribution immediately. Besides even if you detect changes in the incoming data distribution you will often wait a while to make sure the change isn‚Äôt just a blip. So you can often get away with doing the evaluation once a week or once a month. Scheduled evaluation is a lot simpler to orchestrate than continuous evaluation. Keep It Simple.

While continuous training sounds fancy automated drift detection is extremely hard to get right. You are better off writing a bunch of rules that will trigger retraining. For example: every Sunday at 2am whenever a new product catalog is released etc.

To check for model fairness you will need to do sliced evaluations and interpret the results. This is necessarily a manual process.

Instead of launching off a complete rebuild retraining and redeploy whenever any small bit of code changes you are often better off doing a from-scratch build periodically. Perhaps make code releases one of the systematic triggers.

To be able to troubleshoot old results you do need to store versions of everything. However you could do this with standard technologies such as git data warehouses and API versioning. You don‚Äôt need a special purpose tool for this. Keep It Simple.

So is MLOps just all hype then?

It‚Äôs not all hype

There are situations where you need the complexity. A few months ago I wrote an article titled ‚ÄúDo you really need a feature store‚Äù where I summarized:

In most cases feature stores add unnecessary complexity. There are however a few instances in which a feature store will be invaluable. Use a feature store if you need to inject features server-side especially if the method of computing these features will keep improving.

That same sort of advice applies for all the technical debt challenges.

Understand the situations where complexity is warranted:

Use a feature store if you need to inject features server-side. Otherwise the Transform pattern is simpler and requires no extra tooling.

Use ML pipelines if two or more of your steps are ML models. In that case you will need to retrain the downstream model based on the output of the upstream model. ML pipelines make tracking such experiments easier.

Do continuous evaluation if you have a robust mitigation plan available for example if you have a way to quickly change over to a shadow model that doesn‚Äôt use this piece of data.

Do continuous training if you are building a truly adaptive system.

Do automated sliced evaluations and other checks if your use case is such that you will have to completely turn off the ML service if there is any doubt about its fairness.

Implement CI/CD for ML models if you have a large monorepo (that will take too long to build from scratch) and you have frequent model changes.

Use special-purpose registries for models and data if you have hundreds of models in production. Until then go with simpler general-purpose solutions.

Realize however that these situations that require complexity are getting rarer because the simple solutions have been becoming more powerful.

Is this all just my opinion?

Not just me

Fortunately real-world systems do tend to keep it simple. This for example is the operational machine learning system used by Pandera:

Operational machine learning at Pandera. From https://www.panderasystems.com/operational-machine-learning-on-google-cloud/

Notice the use of general purpose tools (SQL for data preparation run through Dataflow during serving). Even the ‚Äúfeature store‚Äù is just BigQuery. I love that they are simply paying lip-service to the hype while doing the practical thing.

Todd Underwood also seems to have reached this conclusion in 2021. In the preamble to a talk on making sure data semantics is consistent between training and serving he notes:

Abstract from Todd Underwood‚Äôs talk in 2021: https://www.tecton.ai/apply/session-video-archive/the-only-truly-hard-problem-in-mlops/

Paraphrasing Todd a bit:

The majority of problems ‚Äúsolved‚Äù by MLOps solutions are already well addressed by standard data processing approaches. You don‚Äôt need special ML processing architecture.

What modern data processing approaches? Data Warehouses (BigQuery Snowflake) Data Lakes (GCS/S3 Parquet/Iceberg/Delta Lake) and stream processing (Apache Beam).

MLOps these days is mostly just a sales pitch by tools vendors. While the principles of MLOps remain valid you don‚Äôt need what‚Äôs being sold as MLOps.

The company Axon Enterprise Inc. is an Arizona-based manufacturer of the Taser -- the company's signature electroshock weapon often used by police departments -- as well as body-worn and vehicle-mounted cameras and software.

""Axon a leading software and technology company for public safety is the festival's presenting sponsor"" the news release said.

With the festival less than a month away the news release also contained some details about what residents can expect from LITFest though it did not include a comprehensive calendar of events or lineup of musical acts.

A LITFest partnership with local venue The Hall will feature two bands Lucero and BoomBox the news release said. According to The Hall's website Lucero will perform at 8 p.m. on Oct. 6 and BoomBox at 9 p.m. the following night.

A singer Keia Johnson will perform at the club Trois on Oct. 6 as part of the festival according to the news release.

Events on Oct. 7 will include an ""Equity in Economics Summit"" at the Robinson Center and a block party in the River Market District with live music the news release said: ""A diverse group of bands and artists selected from more than 100 who applied to participate in this year's festival represent some of Arkansas's best talent.""

On Oct. 8 officials will hold a ""Family TECH Fest"" and a food truck festival in the area of 9th Street and the Mosaic Templars Cultural Center the news release said.

The same day a ""TECH Summit"" will take place at The Hall featuring ""topics such as innovative municipal government public safety technology and the business of sports while an outdoor stage on Ninth Street will offer a variety of performances and entertainment all day.""

Residents will have to pay to attend the musical performances at The Hall but other LITFest events will be free according to the city.

More information will be announced next week the news release said.

Mayor Frank Scott Jr. has promoted LITFest in his two most recent State of the City speeches as an arts food and business showcase with similarities to Riverfest the long-running festival in Little Rock that was discontinued several years ago.

""LITFest is an exciting new way to celebrate Little Rock"" Scott said in a statement included with the news release Friday. ""We are thankful for our sponsors and excited about our participants and we look forward to a festival that features the diversity of our city and unites the community through multiple programs at multiple venues.""

The city's efforts to produce LITFest are being conducted in partnership with Think Rubix a politically connected public-affairs firm that was awarded a $45000 city contract for LITFest earlier this year.

Think Rubix hired Scott's former chief of staff Charles Blake following his resignation from city government in late January.

Additionally the firm's managing principal is Tristan Wilkerson who contributed at least $4000 to Scott's first campaign for mayor in 2018 according to campaign-finance records.

During that election cycle Scott's campaign reported paying Think Rubix at least $1500 in consultant fees the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported in July.

When asked how much Axon contributed to the city or Think Rubix in order to become LITFest's presenting sponsor mayoral spokesman Aaron Sadler wrote in an email that he did not have the information and deferred to Think Rubix.

September 16: ""Runathon of Hope"" is an annual running event well organised and run with efficacious precision by the Rotary Club of Nigdi.

Runathon started in 2010 and continues to attract hordes of enthusiastic runners and corporate participants. Throughout the years 56000 runners of all abilities have participated in this event organised by PCMC.

This year around 25 corporates are participating in the Runathon including Tata Motors Bank of Maharashtra Manipal Hospitals Decathlon Tulip Group DoubleTree by Hilton Enpro Industries Pooja Castings Rishab Industries SKF Singhal Packaging Gulmohar Pack-tech Creative Components Oerlikon Balzers Agsa Springs Baker Hughes and many more.

In this 11th edition of the race generous prize monies have been announced in all categories namely the 10km 5km and corporate 5km races. Additionally there are separate prizes for ladies and for the 45+ age categories.

A new special addition is a 3 km Rotary Charity Run wherein Rotarians from across the 141 clubs in Pune District 3131 are expected to participate. Leading from the front in this race will be the chief guest District Governor Dr Anil Parmar and District First Lady Dr Hema Parmar.

Renowned cricketer Kedar Jadhav has been roped in as the Brand Ambassador for the event.

Runathon is on Sunday 25th September from 5:45 am. The venue is Mayor's Bungalow Plot Near Bhel Chowk Nigdi.

Registration details and further marathon information can be found on www.runathon.org.in

The funds raised from the Runathon are used for community upliftment projects. In recent years the Rotary Club of Nigdi has donated life-saving equipment to Sassoon hospital Akurdi hospital and ICU ward and the oxygen plant in Moraya hospital. Building Water tanks and pipelines in rural areas school improvements etc. have also made a big difference in the life of the underprivileged.

At a press conference held on 14th Sept at Doubletree Hilton Rotary club of Nigdi President Pranita Alurkar noted ""Runathon of Hope is back with a bang after the Pandemic. First time in its 12-year history we are hosting a Monsoon Runathon to generate funds at the beginning of the Rotary year. We are pleased to announce three new additions;

- A special race for Visually impaired children

- A special race for the Armed Forces

- And a 3km Rotary charity Run for Rotarians and their families

The funds raised will be used for projects in Rotary-focused areas to name a few- Environment Water & Sanitation Basic Education & Literacy and Disease Prevention. As the President of 2022-23 I appeal to everyone please join us in the event to help the society at large.""

At the Press conference Dr Balasaheb Hodgar Chief Admin Medical Officer PCMC Akurdi hospital spoke about the Neonatal ICU donated by the club and how it has already saved the lives of newborns.

Vaibhav Thombare a recent Iron Man who received his accolade in Kazakhstan spoke about his running journey which was inspired by (began with) his first Runathon.

Alka Karkare MD of Enpro Industries spoke about the benefits to corporates and their employees who enjoy participating in the Runathon.

The film which serves as a metaphor for climate change depicts Chinese scientists leading the nations of the world‚Äîwith the notable absence of the U.S.‚Äîin order to save the planet. The film takes the virtues of collectivism as self-evident and is sharply critical of selfishness.

We can also learn from the disappointment of celebrated Asian-American films such as Crazy Rich Asians ($175MM in the U.S. $1.7MM in China) and The Farewell ($18MM and less than $1MM). Both movies were ostensibly about China but placed Americans with Chinese ancestry at the center of the narrative. Even the director of The Farewell Lulu Wang who was born in Beijing but raised in Miami foresaw the muted response in China having previously told Variety ‚ÄúI do think this film is a little bit more Chinese than Crazy Rich Asians but it‚Äôs still told through the perspective of an American woman.‚Äù

The decline of Disney Hollywood‚Äôs leading studio in China is already reflected in much of the history listed above. But it‚Äôs important to stress that in the mid-2010s it truly appeared that the House of Mouse had cracked the Chinese market. It‚Äôs striking from the vantage point of 2022 that Bob Iger made Disney‚Äôs Chinese foray the centerpiece of his 2019 memoir The Ride of a Lifetime. Consider that as part of the launch of Star Wars: The Force Awakens Disney was allowed to adorn the Great Wall of China with the franchise‚Äôs familiar Storm Troopers. (Imagine the difficulty involved for an American corporation to stage a promotional event in communist China using dictatorial imagery on the country‚Äôs most famous cultural site!) Over the next few years Disney racked up several more hits in the country. But then suddenly there was a dramatic and near-total shift away from the studio.

Disney‚Äôs 2016 animated film Zootopia ranked 2nd in China with $246MM while Coco ranked 10th with $189MM ‚Äì huge results for a pair of films respectively set in American-style cities police departments and DMVs as well as Santa Cecilia Mexico and D√≠a de Muertos. But two years later Incredibles 2 set in an American metropolis could only muster 42nd with $52MM 2019‚Äôs Toy Story 4 finished 64th with $29MM and even in the release-light 2020 calendar year Soul which focused on a Black jazz musician failed to crack the top 20 netting $58MM. Disney made extensive (and in the U.S. roundly criticized) accommodations to the CCP in order to secure a Chinese release for Mulan which was based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan. But Mulan landed with a thud in China barely grossing $41MM (71% of Soul). Notably Alan Horn the chairman of Disney Motion Pictures had told The Hollywood Reporter a year before Mulan was released that ‚ÄúIf Mulan doesn't work in China we have a problem.‚Äù Of course it turned out that Mulan imploded worldwide and it was often mocked for its clumsy and incorrect cultural anchors but poor cultural tailoring is far from the only reason the film fell short.

The Pandoran Gauntlet

China is an exaggerated example of the global shift away from Western tentpoles. For years China has been the second-largest film market globally (it‚Äôs likely to be the number 1 once the pandemic finally settles). This has enabled the country to produce and support more films than any other market. In addition the CCP controls the fate of foreign films‚Äîincluding release date the number of weeks its in theater and which films it competes with‚Äîand often uses this influence to boost the prospects of domestic productions. The government has also had a long-running strategy to specifically build up domestic capability. In the early 2000s China began relaxing its import restrictions on Hollywood films. By the late 2000s the CCP began to ‚Äúencourage‚Äù Hollywood to promote Chinese actors and products. This is why the 2012 James Bond title Skyfall includes a prominent set piece in Macau while Iron Man 3 features famous Chinese actors who perform surgery on lead Tony Stark (the roles of the surgeons are expanded in the Chinese release) and who then reappear in Avengers: Age of Ultron without any explanation. It‚Äôs also the same reason that why Captain America uses a Chinese-made Vivo smartphone in his films even though the device isn‚Äôt even available in his home country. Around the same time China began to push for co-financing of Western projects while the country‚Äôs media-tech giants began making a number of investments into Hollywood (e.g. Wanda with AMC and Legendary Alibaba into Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Amblin Tencent with Skydance China Media Capital into Ron Howard and Brian Grazer‚Äôs Imagine as well as CAA etc.). But by 2018 China and its companies had refocused their investments on its domestic industry. In 2021 Wanda exited the last of its stake in AMC with Legendary sold a year later.

Though China is obviously a unique marketplace it‚Äôs easy to read too much into governmental decisions and investments which accelerated but did not create the outcomes listed above (though there are reports that on occasion filmgoers were advise to buy a ticket for domestic film A but then walk into the specific theater showing foreign film B). Historically Hollywood has been the only market capable of making high-quality productions and especially high-quality blockbusters. No one else had the industry the talent the capital and the business model. But that is rapidly changing.

An entire generation has taught itself how to shoot edit graphically augment and develop an audience for their content via TikTok YouTube and Snapchat. The cost of both training and production continues to drop while the tools continue to improve. The rise of game engines in film production will further lower the cost and complexity of filmmaking while unlocking new opportunities for filmmakers. LED volumes remain scarce and costly but they are far cheaper than traveling to a foreign locale and securing permits (The Mandalorian has roughly half of the budget of a typical Star Wars film with a running time three times as long). And in an LED volume the director has perfect control over their set and shot. A sunrise can be both perfect and last for as long as filming - and can seamlessly be retrieved a day a month or a year later while the sand dunes of Tunisia or the mythical forests of Zhangjiajie can be licensed for a few hundred dollars (finally we can stop using the Vasquez Rocks for every foreign planet!). Rather than pay dozens of extras in the backgrounds systems to simulate dense city streets will supply these roles with software able to instantly add subtract move and alter these characters (and years after production too).

These technologies are not yet fully mature of course but the progression is clear. In 2009 the original sci-fi epic District 9 made by first-time South African director Neill Blomkamp was shot on location in Johannesburg for $30MM and garnered an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture. Or consider the 2019 film Koma from Russia. It‚Äôs not very good but its visuals often exceed those of the Warner Bros. Christopher Nolan film Inception and it has far more SFX shots too. Such a film was impossible even ten years ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1Z2xlbmV3c3BhcGVycy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8wNi8xNi9uZXdzL3RoZS1ncmFuZC1nYXJkZW4tb3BlbnMtYXQtdGhlLW1vcnRvbi1hcmJvcmV0dW0tc2VwdC0xOC8xOTY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Grand Garden opens at The Morton Arboretum Sept. 18,"Major garden feature celebrates the Arboretum's 100th anniversary

The Morton Arboretum will open its lush colorful new 2-acre Grand Garden to the public at 1:00 p.m. Sept. 18 as part of its yearlong centennial celebration in 2022.

Arboretum President and CEO Gerard T. Donnelly Ph.D. explained that the garden was designed to showcase the beauty and diversity of plants as a masterful horticultural display. It will be a central attraction for Arboretum guests located just steps away from the Visitor Center spanning the length of two football fields and reimagining the footprint of the Arboretum's former Hedge Garden dating back to 1934.

""The Grand Garden will have great appeal to the public with vibrant plantings delightful water features and spaces designed for celebration and joy"" said Donnelly who spearheaded the vision and fundraising for the project. ""The garden adds a significant new dimension to the Arboretum guest experience. It is brimming with beautiful blooms bright vistas and the alluring sounds of falling water.""

The expansive new garden features three main spaces-Centennial Plaza the Celebration Garden and the Joy of Plants Garden. Each provides guests with a different experience from a series of plant-filled rooms defined by hedges near a large shimmering fountain and plaza dedicated to Morton family descendant Jane Morton Berry to a spacious terrace for weddings and other special events.

Susan Jacobson the Arboretum's head of site planning and design described the Joy of Plants Garden as having distinct garden rooms created using decorative metal treillages as doorways. Each room is centered around a mature ginkgo tree in addition to a different signature ornamental tree. In contrast to the immersive rooms Jacobson said ""There is a stunning long view from east to west where you can take in the sweeping expanse of the entire garden.""

The Grand Garden is a major feature of the Arboretum's year-long anniversary celebration that has included monthly special programs and events and the launch of its Centennial Tree Planting Initiative on Arbor Day in April which is adding more than 3000 trees throughout the seven-county Chicago region through 2023.

The $16.6 million garden was funded through philanthropic gifts covering capital costs and establishment of an endowment for its ongoing care and maintenance as well as a $500000 matching grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity for its development. Lead donors Doris Christopher founder and chairman of Pampered Chef Anna Ball and Susannah Ball and the Hamill Family Foundation made seven-figure gifts to the garden project. Anna Ball is president and CEO of Ball Horticultural Company and serves on the Arboretum's Board of Trustees.

In recent years the Arboretum has made a number of site improvements to engage guests and advance its tree-related mission with the last major specialty garden being the Children's Garden which opened in 2005.

The Morton Arboretum was established in 1922 by Morton Salt Company founder Joy Morton as a nonprofit organization with a mission to plant and protect trees for a greener healthier and more beautiful world.

During the public opening event from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Sept. 18 guests will enjoy music refreshments available for purchase face painting and the hospitality of volunteer docents to share information about the garden and answer questions. Access to The Grand Garden is included with timed-entry admission to the Arboretum.",,,,,,,,,

Israel who is based in Tel Aviv was in Fort Worth to share his ideas with local leaders.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. For the unabridged version please listen to the audio file attached to this article

Bob Francis: How did you get in this field?

Haim Israel: I‚Äôve been head of thematics for give or take four years. I‚Äôve been with the bank 18 years now. I joined in 2004. At the time I was the head of the Israeli research team. Starting from 2009 I started covering telecoms and emerging telecoms. And my previous position before heading thematics was the head of emerging TMT (telecom media and technology) research team. Before that I was in an Israeli local broker house a small one and then jumped to what used to be Merrill Lynch at the time.

Francis: If you‚Äôve been covering technology and this a few years before you joined but the year 2000 there was a big drop off in technology stocks. Maybe it was ‚Äô99 2000 somewhere in there.

Israel: What thematic is and what we do and I really would like to draw the parallel to 2000 because that‚Äôs a great question. So what we do in thematics we try to look at the future. You can look at it as the futuristic position of the bank. What our world is going to look like in 10 15 20 years from today? What are the big mega trends which can impact it good and bad?. We‚Äôre not just talking about good things that might happen but unfortunately some of the mega trends are not good at all.



So when we talk about those kinds of mega trends there are three categories that we look at:

Innovation. So technology like big data AI robotics cybersecurity privacy and so on and so on.

The second category for us is people. Everything that has to do with demographics Gen Z millennials inequality aging education. Everything that is really around how our society is going to look like.

And the third one is Earth. Everything that is impacting our planet. So climate change energy transition climate wars as we call it hydrogen water waste and so on and so on. All those those are the things that we look at.



In 2000 there was a big bubble. And then yes it burst and we saw a downturn in technology. But I didn‚Äôt see that as a bubble. I actually saw that as a natural evolution of what used to be a bubble before that. So many different companies raised and had crazy valuations and so on. But the companies that survived this crisis actually became stronger much stronger.



So from 2000 we got Google and we got Apple and Amazon and we got PayPal and got all the big companies of today.



So I think that no we are right now in a market downturn and we are heading into our world of inflation and high interest rates and you see markets being very choppy. Companies that will survive this cycle I think will just come stronger. And so I really draw the parallel to 2000.

Francis: That‚Äôs interesting. Before 2000 Amazon was big but it was nothing like it is now. And I would say the same thing for Apple and they hadn‚Äôt yet introduced some of their big innovations.

Israel: Yes 2000 gave it to them. So no the technology the internet everything that‚Ä¶ We need to remember that yes the bubble burst but the internet stayed. And the internet and digital and online all that stuff helped us hook up to the iPhone and all the revolutions of Amazon and Facebook and social media and whatever everything that happened happened on the back of that.

Francis: What have you been talking to clients about now? What are the big ideas that you‚Äôre talking to them about in terms of change?

Israel: There are a couple of things that are really impacting our world right now. The first one is energy transition. We are heading into a world of energy transition partly because of the geopolitical events that we‚Äôre seeing right now because of the war in Ukraine. One of the key themes that came from the war in Ukraine is energy independence and self-reliance and accelerating the process of de-globalization. That means we are heading into a world where every country has to look closely at their natural resources and their relative advantages and leverage them and be less and less dependent on other countries. That of course leads to a process of de-globalization getting access to resources developing resources bringing operations back home rather than just relying on other countries. Same time it applies also to energy.

We need to remember that most of the world close to 80% of the planet is importing oil not exporting oil. So we are seeing countries moving very fast to alternative energy. Now alternative energy can be green energy can be other forms of energy can be developing of their own resources. Not necessarily renewable energy but the process eventually will accelerate dramatically investments in renewable energy and decrease the prices and invest and increase investment in infrastructure.

And the interesting thing is that it‚Äôs less to do with the question of whether we do or do not have a climate change problem. That‚Äôs something irrelevant. This is happening because of the geopolitical landscape right now and the need to be less dependent on fossil fuels. Because renewable energy is cheaper and getting cheaper with it when scalability is increasing.



Again that is really dependent on different technologies and different regions and whatever. But we‚Äôre talking about 20 to 30% cheaper. And so countries have an interest to move there. It‚Äôs cheaper and it makes me independent. So that‚Äôs why we are heading into a world of energy transition. And eventually I think we‚Äôll move closer to net zero. Not necessarily because of the debate do we need to save our planet yes or no?

Francis: That‚Äôs going to have some fallout consequences obviously as well right?

Israel: Yes. It has consequences on oil. We believe that we are long term reaching peak oil. It might take a decade it might take more but the demand for oil will never ever disappear. It‚Äôs very clear we need to understand that. We‚Äôll always rely on oil and fossil fuels for a very long time but the portion of oil will go down compared to other forms of energy.

And I think that it will probably peak this decade. Some estimates are already talking as soon as 2027 2028. And the portion will start to go down. So of course it has huge implications for countries which are relying on fossil fuel as their source of export Russia for example. And it has implications on the balance of power.

And the theme that we call because of that we call it climate wars. This is an important theme that we cover. What do we mean? Because of those trends that we‚Äôve seen of just that countries are moving to other forms of energy you‚Äôre starting to see that the big superpowers meaning China Europe and the United States are racing over to clean tech. Who will dominate clean technology? Because if you do dominate clean technology you control the future. If oil eventually is peaking I want to move to the next big thing. Now let‚Äôs compare to like who decades and decades ago who controlled oil. World supremacy goes through dominance in clean energy and clean tech. And China is today leader by far investing in all sorts of renewable energy wind solar batteries capacity EVs everything you can think of. Europe is not that far behind and the U.S. has to close the gap and is closing the gap. It‚Äôs starting to close the gap.

There are trillions of dollars on the line there‚Äôs world supremacy on the line and we see that accelerating all the time. So access to resources no you want renewable energy you need batteries you need lithium you need nickel you need all these stuff. So access to batteries supply lines technology R&D. Everything around that they use you see there‚Äôs a massive race to who will dominate it. Now that‚Äôs interesting because that‚Äôs actually a chicken and egg issue. Because the faster the superpowers are rushing to control clean tech the faster peak oil is coming. And again the idea is a geopolitical fight over here war over here. So again there‚Äôs this climate war thing that I think is happening. So the war in Ukraine has accelerated that. That started before the war. But now that because countries are moving rushing to diversify the energy sources the dependency on whoever controls cleantech is increasing.

Francis: We‚Äôre talking about some minerals involved here too that are currently I think only produced primarily in China.

Israel: They‚Äôre mined in different places of the world. But you‚Äôre right because the mines are controlled directly or indirectly by China. For example cobalt is mined in the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo) but China has a lot of leverage on that cohort.

Same thing with lithium. There are two things that are happening. First of all China today controls 40% of all rare earth metals directly. Indirectly this number can reach as high as 80%. Second thing is the refining of this material. So it‚Äôs not just enough to mine lithium you need to refine it. And 80% of all refineries are in China. Because those supply lines that are mining in Chile refined in China it‚Äôs completely inefficient. I don‚Äôt need to refine in China. And you know that when you buy an electric car it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a Tesla or an EV or whatever when you buy an electric car the lithium in your battery has to travel 50000 miles up to 50000 miles before you even start driving. It‚Äôs mined in Chile refined in China the cathodes are done in Japan assembly is done in the United States and then the selling is done in Europe. Completely completely inefficient.

Francis: Sounds like it.

Israel: The idea is that no countries like the United States are waking up saying ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù A) I don‚Äôt want to be reliant on China. B) I can decrease cost dramatically. So it‚Äôs mined in Chile. The mine is where the mine is you can‚Äôt move it. But all the other processes why not do it on U.S. soil or closer to home? And by cutting down dramatically the supply lines and as a result the cost as well. That could be a very deflationary process in the end because this deglobalization trend that we are seeing right now is making every country examine supply lines examine their advantages. They can‚Äôt bring everything back home. They‚Äôll never bring everything back home. They can‚Äôt. But whatever they can makes economic sense ‚Äì they‚Äôll do it. That‚Äôs I think a very deflationary process we‚Äôre saying.

Francis: They just held their opening three months ago a company MP Material they own a mine in California and they‚Äôre making the magnets going to make the magnets here in Fort Worth for the electric motors. And I realize that‚Äôs a small piece of the supply chain but ‚Äì

Israel: Yes that is just one side of it yes. I can‚Äôt remember the exact number. I think it‚Äôs like when you do that there are 80 different processes on the way done in different countries and different regions. I think it was 80 I‚Äôm not sure. But a lot of it was completely inefficient. Plus we are heading into an environment right now of slowdown of slower economic activity. If I can bring an operation back home and support employment I‚Äôll do that. A lot of it‚Äôs been based on automation it‚Äôs going to be based on new supply lines and new production facilities. So you always start to see that all over the world.

Francis: Sounds like you‚Äôre saying we need a Henry Ford of the electric car industry that will build something like he did the Rouge plant where he built made the steel and built the cars is all in one giant process.

Israel: Tesla was mumbling recently about building a lithium facility I think it was in Louisiana or something. They said exactly this ‚ÄúWhy do I need to start buying lithium from other places? And the quality is very different and then I‚Äôm relying on other countries and then I‚Äôm refining in other countries and there‚Äôs a lot of different elements in the production that I have no control over if I can do it back home.‚Äù Because I need to think about them they think about vertically. So the Henry Ford example is really good because he thought vertically.

Francis: We‚Äôve certainly seen issues with the supply chain around the world anyway in the past few years.

Israel: It started before Ukraine. Ukraine just accelerated this whole trend. Though again we can‚Äôt de-globalize. We still live in one big world and know everyone is trading with everybody but all supply lines will be examined and viewed and operations are going to be brought back home. And that‚Äôs the reassuring bring back home. That‚Äôs one thing.

The other thing which we‚Äôre actually seeing which is quite interesting is not just reshoring it‚Äôs what we call friendshoring. Because I can‚Äôt bring everything back home but if I can start buying stuff from friends countries that I trust rather than countries I don‚Äôt trust that‚Äôs another trend that we‚Äôre seeing right now. I know we spoke about batteries. You can rely on lithium which as I said a big part of the supply lines is all over the world and in different countries in Russia and in China and whatever. Or maybe I can replace that with phosphates which eventually I have at home or I have it in Canada. I trust Canada much more than I trust Russia with all due respect.

Yeah so that‚Äôs another trend that we‚Äôre seeing right now. But I think the broad line here is that this whole independence theme is getting a lot of momentum. The bottom line is I think it‚Äôs going to create it will change the supply line dramatically composition how we do things and so on and eventually economics.

Francis: And eventually there‚Äôll be some companies rising up like Amazon or Apple or someone who will dominate this area probably.

Israel: You see the big are getting bigger. And now you live in a world where cash is king. If I have cash and a lot of cash which I‚Äôll deploy it or buy stuff invest in stuff yes. So yes you will. You can see now the Google of lithium. I have no idea what‚Äôs going to be but you‚Äôll see that controlling the supply lines.

Francis: When do you see this happening? You mentioned the war in Ukraine and right before that we had COVID which also accelerated some trends. Working at home we‚Äôve talked about it for years and then it became a reality. And the war in Ukraine it really disrupted the supply lines to Europe in particular for energy. So some of these trends could accelerate but you have a timeframe?

Israel: Usually we talk about between five to 10 years. But every time you are so right because every time we say 10 years it happened before that. For example I‚Äôll give you now when I started covering thematics we thought that we‚Äôre going to get to 100% of new cars will be EVs by 2040. Now we are talking about 2030 2028 so the timeline is getting shorter and shorter all the time. And what we call techceleration the acceleration of trends because of technology. And now we have to also have geopolitics which accelerates right now.

And that‚Äôs why we say that the short term and the long term don‚Äôt exist anymore. Because think about it you get in the last two years COVID now we all stayed at home Ukraine inflation everything happened in two years. No the world has every time something big massive happens those are defining moments.

Francis: Can I ask how you see the political reaction to these changes? Are you seeing changes in laws or in the government and in terms of that they recognize this is happening?

Israel: Definitely. A lot of the stuff we‚Äôve seen recently in the United States the Inflation Reduction Act is aimed for that. We saw before that the semiconductors act. I am not exporting semiconductors technology outside without supervision and so on. Plus I‚Äôm incentivizing the semiconductors industry to manufacture back in my country. We saw the Fit for 55 bill in Europe that from here onwards whatever‚Äôs been imported to Europe has to go through a process of carbonization. And we have to see exactly what is the carbon footprint for each and everything and put carbon taxes on top of it. We saw the Versailles Declaration Committee in Europe how do I increase dramatically different industries in Europe? Semiconductors technology FinTech healthcare. Countries are putting a lot of regulation out there right now to defend and to bring back operations back home and defend their technologies.

Francis: Is there a cybersecurity component to this as well?

Israel: Oh yes big time. And we actually know I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôve mentioned it because for us this is probably one of the key themes out there when I look at the future about cybersecurity. We call it actually the beast that cannot be controlled anymore.

The beast that cannot be controlled anymore. It‚Äôs become way too big to ignore.

Just let me give you the numbers. The numbers are in 2014 there were 122000 cyber attacks all over the world every week. In 2017 this number jumped to 17 million. 2023 100 million. And the initial number we calculated for 2021 was 1.8 billion cyber attacks every week all over the world and a detection rate of 0.05%. You will never know. Most chances you will never know you‚Äôve been hacked. So I always say that the world has been divided into two people that got hacked and people that have no idea they got hacked. That‚Äôs as simple as it is.

And why now? And I‚Äôm so happy you raised that because what happened now is the war in Ukraine. Now it‚Äôs very clear and I think that although it was before that but now it‚Äôs so obvious that this is not just my problem or my organization‚Äôs problem Bank of America problem. Now it‚Äôs a national security problem. And we‚Äôve seen attacks on national critical infrastructure on a daily basis everywhere and all over the world. This is how wars are being fought. We saw that happening in Ukraine we saw hackers everywhere. We saw that on facilities in the United States. It‚Äôs huge. And it‚Äôs just becoming bigger and bigger.

And let me just give you one example how much we‚Äôre not focusing on that. So if we take the total economic damage of extreme weather of climate change in 2021 extreme weather immigration everything that happened because of climate change $3 trillion 2021. Cybersecurity has reached six. Two times and growing two times faster. So no one‚Äôs really focusing on that. And the numbers are as I said the numbers are scary in terms of how much. 92% of all eCommerce traffic are hackers. 92%.

Francis: That‚Äôs like saying take the freeway so you would have eight people who were actually going to work and 92 of them are thieves basically.

Israel: Trying to steal those 8%. Exactly those eight cars.

Francis: I know a guy who owns a cybersecurity company and he said he doesn‚Äôt have to do any advertising. He just gets calls every day basically.

Israel: Yeah. It just comes. Now there‚Äôs a saying it‚Äôs very difficult for companies to invest in cybersecurity because it‚Äôs an intangible threat. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to get tomorrow I don‚Äôt know what flood and I have to defend on that. It‚Äôs an intangible threat. And unfortunately you don‚Äôt think about it but it happens. It happens. So now finally there‚Äôs a big wake up call that we see in companies left and right defending themselves.

Francis: That‚Äôs quite a statistic.

Israel: We should talk about the moonshots about the future technologies.

So for us we define moonshots as technologies which are going to change the world but have not been commercialized yet so they‚Äôre in their development stage.

So we‚Äôve mapped 14 of these. Quantum computing is one of them. I personally think that quantum computing is a revolution that‚Äôs going to be bigger than fire and bigger than all the revolutions that humanity has seen. This is the machine that can change it all. Look at 2019. In 2019 Google announced quantum supremacy. Their announcement and I‚Äôm not saying if they‚Äôre right or wrong but their official announcement was that in 200 seconds their quantum computer made more calculations than the IBM supercomputer the fastest computer on the planet today will make in 10000 years.

Francis: Wow.

Israel: That‚Äôs their announcement. I‚Äôm not saying the right or wrong but they officially announced it. That shows the power of the machine. So it can change everything from pharmaceuticals developing drugs in seconds and do calculations very very complicated calculations on everything on genomics on big data sets on cybersecurity. That‚Äôs technically a machine that can hack everything. So it will change everything. We‚Äôre a big big believer in that. That‚Äôs one moonshot.

Couple of other examples. The metaverse. And not necessarily what you‚Äôre picturing for gaming or socializing but for us the cool applications are actually the industrial side of things. And we saw a lot of announcements done recently at Boeing that they‚Äôre going to develop the next plane on the metaverse of being a virtual marketplace where all the engineers will meet and exchange opinions and so on and have virtual models and so on. So they said the next plane if it‚Äôs going to be developed like this the costs are going to go down by 15%. That‚Äôs amazing.

And Ericsson which is a telecom equipment company tower company announced that they‚Äôre going to develop their next generation of towers and network first of all in the metaverse before they will go test it live. And Dyson the same thing the vacuum cleaner company. Dyson Hyundai have signed an agreement I think it was with Roblox. Roblox will build their own metaverse for Hyundai and Hyundai will build up the next generation of cars and future mobility on the metaverse first. So you see that the industrial segment actually took that as a great tool for efficiency for development for planning and so on rather than just not what we picture as gaming and socializing and buying real estate with places and I don‚Äôt know what. So this is what I think it‚Äôs actually quite a fascinating theme.

The other one nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion. The first nuclear fusion for cities is about to be launched in 2025 in ITER. It‚Äôs called ITER in France. But what it means it means that‚Ä¶ First of all what is nuclear fusion? Nuclear fusion is the holy grail of energy. It means that you have an unlimited amount of energy. The process that is being done basically in the sun. Unlimited amount of energy all clean and never ending. The first plant is going to come in 2025 but it‚Äôs not going to be operational at least up until the middle of the next decade. It‚Äôs just going to start creating plasma. I don‚Äôt want to get into too many technicalities but those plasma cannot be contained.

They‚Äôre expecting that by the middle of next decade it will be fully operational. And according to our calculations they can power the world or a nuclear fusion facility can power the world with the same amount of material nuclear material nuclear fuel that is equal to 11 barrels of oil. So that shows you how much energy can be created for this thing. It‚Äôs all clean. This is the holy grail but we‚Äôll see still.

Francis: And who is doing that?

Israel: ITER is a combination of all European countries. It‚Äôs not a private company. I don‚Äôt know even how many billions of dollars have been sucked into this project and keep delaying the timeline. But it‚Äôs fascinating if it‚Äôs going to work out. This is going to change-

Francis: I thought they had announced some sort of breakthrough recently.

Israel: Yeah it‚Äôs on plasma on plasma creation. But they can‚Äôt contain the plasma. They have no idea how to contain it. And that‚Äôs actually easy enough if you link it with quantum computing. That could be fascinating. Because the biggest problem in containing plasma is the amount of sheer calculation that you need to do. That‚Äôs where a lot of things are so there‚Äôs been companies like Deep Mind which came up with an AI machine learning base that actually can think about how to contain this plasma. But if those two technologies are going to be parallelly commercialized the possibilities are endless. That‚Äôs another one.

What else? We call it the nano satellites. It‚Äôs already happening. It‚Äôs not really a moonshot because this is actually a technology which we see as a technology which has already been commercialized. Starlink in Ukraine is a great example. So what we are talking about is satellites which are as big as the palm of your hand that can give you all the communication you need. And they‚Äôve already been sent by the thousands into space and we‚Äôve seen that they are already providing all your communication needs. Now Ukraine was unfortunately a case study but think about Africa that you don‚Äôt need to deploy massive infrastructure but that still can supply broadband to people everywhere. So it has a huge opportunity to change the world. So again we‚Äôre a big believer that‚Äôs actually a technology that‚Äôs already starting. Again it‚Äôs not really a moonshot. So you see Starlink you see how the companies already start to deploy those thousands of nano satellites in space.

Francis: And several companies are working on that?

Israel: There‚Äôs many Starlink is just one. There are a few. 6G is another moonshot we think. 6G is an interesting concept because 6G actually shows you how fast the world is progressing. So we believe that by 2028 5G is just not going to be enough. We are creating so much data that we are reaching full capacity of 5G. The amount of data that we‚Äôre creating every day is just humongous. The number is 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. Quintillion is a million trillion. And this number is multiplying itself every two years. So we are in a stage where we are seeing it developing the sheer amount of data is developing so fast that 5G is just not going to be enough.

So actually 5G that we always thought that going to be technology that‚Äôs going to change it all and going to change everything it‚Äôs probably going to be the shortest-lived G and will be replaced before it will be really fully globally deployed by 6G.

And 6G has depends on how or who‚Äôs defining it but anywhere between 100 to 1000 more capacity than 5G. AI embedded capabilities in it so they can do calculations. And then data trafficking the network can do it alone you don‚Äôt need human intervention. It can handle complex data. The complex data we defined as data that is being generated on other platforms would have to communicate. So for example a connected car. The car generates a lot of data but needs to communicate with all the traffic lights and the other cars and sensors and whatever. And that‚Äôs what the concept we create that we call the complex data. So 6G is one of those technologies.

I think those are the key ones that I would highlight.

Francis: Those are fascinating. And in a way it looks like we‚Äôre coming up with technologies to solve problems. You mentioned the amount of data that we manufacture it looks like we‚Äôre looking for ways to take that data and actually put it to use in some ways.

Israel: Yeah and that‚Äôs really interesting Bob because right now we are generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. You know how much we‚Äôre using out of those 2.5?

Francis: Probably a minuscule amount.

Israel: 1%. We are throwing away 99% of global data. We are not using it. So all those technologies can start using more than 1%. So think about the world that global data is multiplying faster and faster. In 2000 it was every 15 years it was doubling. In 2010 every six years. Now we are talking about every two years. Plus we are going to use 2% 3% 4%. So the rate of acceleration we‚Äôre just starting it. We didn‚Äôt see anything yet. That‚Äôs the beauty of it. So I‚Äôm really excited about it.

Merrill Lynch vs. Schwab: Online and Mobile Experience

Both companies‚Äô apps have favorable ratings but customer feedback contains numerous complaints. Schwab sometimes can overwhelm the average user with data. However it offers an intuitive interface on mobile and desktop. That said active traders will probably like the Schwab Street Smart desktop version because the mobile version lacks certain features. Schwab Mobile has a 4.8-star rating on the Apple store and 3.7 stars on Google Play. On the other hand Schwab‚Äôs Street Smart mobile app has 1.5 stars on the Apple store and 2.2 stars on Google Play.

MyMerrill users give similar feedback and emphasize its streamlined nature especially for Bank of America customers. The app has a 4.7-star rating on the Apple Store and 4 stars on Google Play.

Who Should Use Which Investment Platform?

Merrill Lynch and Schwab both offer low-fee accessible investment options for investors. As a result novice investors prioritizing inexpensive investing could be satisfied opening an account with either company.

However the companies diverge from that point. Investors who want to use a robo-advisor are more likely to go with Schwab as Merrill Lynch does not offer a pure robo-advisor option. Additionally investors who want to dive deep into the data may prefer Schwab which provides additional investing tools and analysis through its Street Smart platform.

On the other hand wealthier investors who prefer white-glove treatment may be drawn to Merrill Lynch‚Äôs services. Its Guided Investing and Wealth Management products provide a dedicated financial advisor who can help you create a financial plan and invest accordingly.

The Bottom Line

merrill lynch vs charles schwab

Merrill Lynch and Schwab are significant players in the individual investing market. Both firms offer robust services from bank accounts and IRAs to college funds and charge minimal fees. In addition their mobile apps are generally easy to use. Investing with either company will help you make gains without suffering large fees. That said investors with more money may receive more individualized services from Merrill Lynch while investors who want to use market research or robo-advisors might prefer Schwab.

Inflation has made it hard to buy much with a buck these days.

$1 pizza has disappeared. Dollar stores aren‚Äôt dollar stores anymore.

So wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to start paying with $2 bills instead?

‚ÄúIf you had a $2 bill perfect‚Äù said Heather McCabe a writer and $2 bill evangelist who runs the blog Two Buckaroo chronicling her spending with twos and other people‚Äôs reactions. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very useful thing to pay for a small amount.‚Äù

Yet the $2 note is the unloved child of paper currency.

It‚Äôs considered a curiosity to some and scorned by others in the United States. The myths around the $2 bill ‚Äî nicknamed ‚ÄúTom‚Äù by fans because it features Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs portrait on the front ‚Äî are endless. Many Americans think $2 bills are rare are not printed anymore or have gone out of circulation.

Wrong.

$2 bills are lighter to carry around in our wallets than ones cleaner and more efficient. MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle/Getty Images

The Treasury Department‚Äôs Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) will print up to 204 million $2 bills this year based on an annual order from the Federal Reserve System. There were 1.4 billion $2 bills in circulation in 2020 according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve.

But $2 bills account for just 0.001% of the value of the $2 trillion worth of currency in circulation.

BEP doesn‚Äôt have to request new $2 bills each year like it does for other bills. That‚Äôs because $2 bills are used so infrequently and last longer in circulation. The Fed orders them every few years and works down the inventory.

‚ÄúMany Americans have pretty dubious assumptions about the $2 bill. Nothing happened to the $2 bill. It‚Äôs still being made. It‚Äôs being circulated‚Äù McCabe said. ‚ÄúAmericans misunderstand their own currency to the extent they don‚Äôt use it.‚Äù

Bad luck

The United States first issued $2 bills beginning in 1862 around the time the federal government first started printing paper money. Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs portrait was on the two until a new series was printed in 1869 with Jefferson.

But the deuce was unpopular and never gained a foothold with the public.

A major reason: The the $2 bill was considered bad luck. Superstitious people would rip off the corners of the bill to ‚Äúreverse the curse‚Äù making the bills unfit to use.

‚ÄúHe who sits in a game of chance with a two-dollar bill in his pocket is thought to be saddled with a jinx‚Äù the New York Times said in a 1925 article. ‚ÄúThey have been avoided as ill-starred.‚Äù

The two was also known for keeping controversial company. It was associated with gambling where it was the standard bet at racetracks and prostitution.

And during the nineteenth century crony candidates frequently used $2 bills to bribe voters. Someone holding a $2 bill was thought to have sold a vote to a crooked politician.

The Treasury Department during the 1900s tried unsuccessfully several times to popularize the use of the $2 bill. In 1966 it gave up and discontinued printing the bills ‚Äúbecause a lack of public demand.‚Äù

But a decade later as the United States approached the bicentennial the Treasury designed a new $2 bill series with a portrait of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back.

The aim was to cut the number of $1 bills in circulation and save the Treasury money on production costs.

But the relaunch in 1976 failed. People viewed the new version as a collector‚Äôs item and hoarded them instead of going out and spending them.

The Postal Service offered to stamp them only on April 13 the first day they were issued in honor of Jefferson‚Äôs birthday unintentionally adding to the idea that they were commemorative bills -‚Äî a misconception that continues to this day.

‚ÄúThe press and public now tend to link the $2 bill with the Susan B. Anthony dollar under the general heading of ‚Äòfiascos‚Äô‚Äù the New York Times said in 1981.

There‚Äôs no rational reason why $2 bills aren‚Äôt as popular as other bills said Paolo Pasquariello a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. But people exhibit a preference for multiples of 1 and 5 he said.

Another reason $2 bills never took off: Cash registers invented in the late 1800s were never designed with a place to hold them so cashiers didn‚Äôt know where to stash them.

‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt an alteration of cash registers for $2 bills‚Äù said Heather McCabe. ‚ÄúThe infrastructure of paying for things didn‚Äôt change. There was not an adjustment of how people work with that bill.‚Äù

If cash registers had a familiar slot for $2 bills the bill would be more popular she argued.

$2 subculture

But there are people who swear by $2 bills. In fact communities and subcultures have developed around them.

US Air Force pilots who fly U-2 spy planes always keep a $2 bill in their flight suits.

Since the 1970s fans of Clemson University‚Äôs Tigers football team have paid and tipped with $2 bills -‚Äî ‚ÄúTiger Twos‚Äù ‚Äî in other cities‚Äô restaurants bars shops and hotels. The tradition started as a way to prove to Georgia Tech in Atlanta that it would benefit the city to schedule games against Clemson.

‚ÄúThere is a degree of popularity to them. There is a sense of excitement‚Äù said Jesse Kraft a curator at the American Numismatic Society. ‚ÄúBut as far as putting them back into circulation that‚Äôs the key that‚Äôs missing.‚Äù

Kraft is a proponent of adopting $2 bills more widely.

He notes that it‚Äôs about half as expensive for the Treasury to print a $2 bill than higher denominations which come with costlier security features on the paper. It‚Äôs also more efficient to print $2 bills than $1 bills because the Treasury can print twice as much for the same amount of money and requires less storage.

John Bennardo who made a 2015 film about $2 bills called ‚ÄúThe Two Dollar Bill Documentary‚Äù has made it his mission to ‚Äúeducate people and enlighten them and start using $2 bills in their life.‚Äù

In short he concludes $2 bills are underappreciated in the United States and a way for strangers to meet and engage.

‚ÄúYou will get remembered if you use a $2 bill‚Äù Bennardo said. ‚ÄúIt has this ability to connect people in way that other bills don‚Äôt. It opens up a dialogue between you and the cashier.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a practical bill with inflation. But it‚Äôs social currency as well.‚Äù"

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing‚Äù said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

‚ÄúThere is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception‚Äù said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. ‚ÄúThe Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.‚Äù

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

‚ÄúThe rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected‚Äù Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

‚ÄúFor years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships‚Äù said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

The Bath Quays North project will see new shops and office blocks crisscrossed with pedestrian streets built across what is currently Avon Street Car Park.

Planning permission for the final details was granted by Bath & North East Somerset Council‚Äôs planning committee on Wednesday 8th May despite concerns that the development ‚Äúcould be anywhere not just Bath‚Äù and that the developers will provide no affordable housing.

The flagship project has been in the works for years and has been described as ‚Äúthe most significant development in Bath in a generation‚Äù.

But plans for the site to include affordable homes were dropped by developers over viability concerns.

Outline planning permission was secured by the council five years ago but applicants BQN Ltd acting on behalf of the council‚Äôs development partner Legal & General had to secure ‚Äúreserved matters‚Äù approval where the council grants planning permission for the final details and design of the scheme.

But as the planning committee debated the plans Shaun Hughes (Midsomer Norton North Independent) said: ‚ÄúI do have concerns with certain aspects of the design.

‚ÄúThe riverside side of the design has a very sort of Lego-like appearance to it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure where that design‚Äôs going and whether it truly reflects the city we are in.‚Äù

Fiona Gourley (Bathavon South Liberal Democrats) said: ‚ÄúI totally agree that this needs development [‚Ä¶] but I‚Äôm concerned that [Historic England] don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good enough; that they think it‚Äôs not in keeping with other bits of Bath. [‚Ä¶] I think it‚Äôs too blocky and plain.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my concern: it could be anywhere not just Bath.‚Äù

Historic England said in its official feedback as a consultee that it had ‚Äúexpressed strong reservations‚Äù throughout the planning process.

It said: ‚ÄúWhilst the applicant has made some attempts to address these concerns the scheme requires further alteration in order to ensure it will make a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness of Bath.‚Äù

But Tim Warren (Midsomer Norton Redfield Conservative) who was the leader of the council when the public were asked to have their say on the masterplan back in 2017 said: ‚ÄúBath has been in desperate need of grade one office space for a long long time. [‚Ä¶] I actually don‚Äôt mind the design.

‚ÄúSome parts aren‚Äôt Georgian but in Georgian times did they say you can‚Äôt build up because it‚Äôs not Roman?‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe are a World Heritage Site which is fantastic we need to be proud of that. However we are still a living city and we can‚Äôt turn it just into a museum.‚Äù

The development will include over 16 thousand square metres of office space a 130-bed hotel space for retail financial services food takeaway and a drinking establishment.

Streets will extend across the development with a pedestrianised Avon Street leading through to the cycle path and riverside park a new ‚ÄúLittle Corn Street‚Äù running north-to-south across what is currently Avon Street Car Park and a new ‚ÄúBack Street‚Äù continuing the line of Somerset Street and leading to an area called ‚ÄúLittle Somerset Yard‚Äù.

There will be a basement car park with space for 411 cars 320 of which can be used by the public.

The development will also include 92 residential flats but none of them will be affordable housing.

A viability assessment found a ‚Äúsignificant overall deficit‚Äù for the developers and concluded affordable housing would not be possible.

A financial review will be carried out later before the completion of the scheme ‚Äúto establish whether the development is able to support the provision of affordable housing in the future‚Äù.

Ms Gourley said: ‚ÄúHow is it that we can have come to the conclusion that we need to house cars rather than people? This area was historically always an area of low cost housing until 70 years ago when it got bombed.‚Äù

Paul Crossley (Southdown Liberal Democrat) added: ‚ÄúGoing forward I would like to see a stronger commitment to social inclusion because we can‚Äôt forever say the value of land means we can‚Äôt have any social houses.‚Äù

But he seconded a proposal from Mr Warren to approve the planning permission.

Lucy Hodge (Lansdown Liberal Democrat) pointed out that some of the offices in Bath Quays South across the river had taken a long time to sell and called for the plans to be rejected but councillors voted to grant planning permission.

Mr Warren said: ‚ÄúI find the negativity around this difficult because you‚Äôve got a tip in the middle of Bath which has been like it for I don‚Äôt know how many years [‚Ä¶] and it just needs doing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre building an office block mainly ‚Äî you‚Äôre not building the Royal Crescent.‚Äù

The old multi-storey at Avon Street Car Park was demolished in September 2022 and a new bridge across the river to the Bath Quays South Development was opened in December 2022.

Angus farmer Fleur Baxter designed straw bales to reflect some of the monarch‚Äôs great passions ‚Äì horses and dogs.

The centrepiece of the display is the recreation of a tribute painting by Yorkshire artist Eleanor Tomlinson an image which has captured the nation since the monarch‚Äôs death on September 8 featuring the Queen with Paddington Bear and a corgi.

Fleur told STV News: ‚ÄúThis is a very poor copy of her beautiful beautiful painting which I think will be pen and water colour. It was just a small tribute to Her Majesty.

‚ÄúThe more I thought about it the more I thought ‚Äòwell the Queen loved her dogs and she loved her equines‚Äô so we‚Äôll just have a random selection of cartoon canines [too].

The display sits next to the main road between Forfar and Carnoustie near Crombie and has already attracted crowds since its completion.

Visitors‚Äô reactions are often emotional for Fleur to hear with some describing her artistic flare as a national institution.

Fleur Baxter thanks visitors to her display.

One visitor to the display told STV News: ‚ÄúThis year it‚Äôs extra special just with the installation of the Queen with Paddington.

‚Äú[Kids] it‚Äôs what they recognise with the Queen. They‚Äôll always remember and to have just captured that is very special.‚Äù

This is the eighth year Fleur has created the straw art displays raising money for charity. This year donations will be made to Cancer Research UK.

Gov. Jim Justice lawmakers and state officials gathered at the West Virginia Culture Center Tuesday to welcome BHE Renewables and Precision Castparts Corp. to West Virginia.

The two companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are purchasing more than 2000 acres at the former Century Aluminum site in Jackson County to build a modern titanium melt facility powered by solar energy.

The companies call it a first-of-its-kind renewable energy microgrid-powered industrial site representing an investment of $500 million.

‚ÄúThis is another big announcement in this state that is a testimony to all the different things we do how we are diversifying our state and moving forward in every way‚Äù Justice said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said over and over I‚Äôm going to take you on a rocket ship ride. ‚ÄúFor God sakes of living these people build the rockets.‚Äù

Titanium products from the new PCC facility will be used by the aerospace industry and other customers said Alicia Knapp president and CEO of BHE Renewables.

‚ÄúAs a Berkshire Hathaway Energy company I would tell you we are uniquely qualified to deliver this project and we‚Äôre excited to be partnering with Precision Castparts and with the State of West Virginia to deliver this project and truly revitalize Jackson County.‚Äù

Products made at the former Century Aluminum site would also be used by other Berkshire Hathaway companies such as PCC‚Äôs Timet Facility in Jefferson County Ohio. Timet builds parts for aircraft.

‚ÄúThis facility will be built and basically be the primary metal melting facility that will ultimately feed that facility in Toronto Ohio said Steven Wright president of PCC. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really excited to be able to start with this investment and power it with renewable energy.‚Äù

Century Aluminum was first established in 1954 and closed in 2009. Applied Partners of New Jersey purchased the plant‚Äôs assets in 2017 but the property was deeded back to the state in 2020. The value of the old Century Aluminum property is approximately $25 million.

The West Virginia Legislature passed a bill Monday during a one-day special session creating two 2250-acre high-impact industrial business development districts. The districts are aimed at encouraging the location and construction of large-scale industrial and manufacturing plants when the facilities require access to renewable sources of electricity.

The state Economic Development Authority entered into an agreement with BHE Renewables for use of the Century Aluminum property and a deal with PCC to create the high-impact industrial business development district and work with PCC to recruit new businesses for the site.

Mitch Carmichael the cabinet secretary for the Department of Commerce and a former senate president and lawmaker from Jackson County said the deal will breathe new life in a facility where his own father worked.

‚ÄúWhen these jobs are created it changes people‚Äôs lives. It affects families and future generations‚Äù Carmichael said. ‚ÄúI found my dad‚Äôs badge that he wore for 35 years on the property. This makes a difference in people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù

In 2020 a group of Democratic lawmakers led by state Sen. Glenn Jeffries D-Putnam wrote a letter to several investors including Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett encouraging them to invest in West Virginia. That led to a phone call between Jeffries and Berkshire Hathaway representatives

‚ÄúWhen I sent the letter to Mr. Buffett I never expected him to even look at it‚Äù Jeffries said. ‚ÄúFinally we have put a project together‚Ä¶The economic impact in that area is going to be huge. The downstream that‚Äôs going to come from this aeronautical company is beyond what I can express.‚Äù

The plant is expected to hire as many as 200 jobs to start and as many as 1000 jobs once it is up and running not counting construction jobs. Del. Jonathan Pinson R-Mason said the facility will have apositive effect on the entire region.

‚ÄúWhat you find is for the entire region this is such an incredible encouragement because this is a generational change for this community‚Äù Pinson said. ‚ÄúA community that once was so focused on the aluminum industry now has the ability to move beyond that to turn the page and find the niche of the aerospace industry in Jackson County and surrounding counties.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMva2Vuc2lsdmVyc3RlaW4vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9ob3ctYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWVuZXJneS1lc2NhcGVkLXRoZS1jb2FsLXRyYXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Berkshire Hathaway Energy Escaped 'The Coal Trap',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2022/09/18/how-berkshire-hathaway-energy-escaped-the-coal-trap/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMva2Vuc2lsdmVyc3RlaW4vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9ob3ctYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LWVuZXJneS1lc2NhcGVkLXRoZS1jb2FsLXRyYXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtbG92ZXMtdGhlc2UtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtc2VjdG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Loves These 3 Real Estate Sectors: Should You Too?,"Real estate is a proven money-making industry and companies operating in it have the attention of this billionaire investor.

Warren Buffett invests in a slew of industries through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.28%) (BRK.B -0.24%). From textiles to insurance to manufacturing to utilities to financial services to real estate Buffett's focus is on industries with a proven track record of growth demand and profitability.

When it comes to real estate there are three sectors in this industry that Buffett is focusing on right now. Does that mean you should too? Let's take a closer look at the sectors and how investors might benefit from buying in.

1. Brokerages: There is one that's set to outpace Berkshire

Liz Brumer-Smith (eXp World Holdings): HomeServices of America is Berkshire Hathaway's real estate brokerage firm. Focused primarily on residential home sales the brokerage has roughly 46000 real estate agents in over 900 brokerage offices in 33 states plus the District of Columbia. If you add in HomeServices of America's franchise network of around 360 franchisees it brings its agent total to 99000 making it the largest brokerage firm in the world.

Brokerage firms earn revenue from each sale their agents make. The more agents a brokerage has the more money it can potentially make. The residential real estate market has been on fire over the last few years which has been great for brokerage firms across the board. Although sales are slumping now over rising concerns about a housing market correction the business model at its core can still manage long-term profitability.

The only real estate brokerage that can even come close to effectively competing with HomeServices of America is eXp World Holdings (EXPI 2.86%). That makes it a potentially fantastic buy to gain exposure to this profitable sector of the industry. eXp World Holdings is a virtual brokerage meaning it doesn't maintain brick-and-mortar offices in cities across the U.S. the way HomeServices of America does. Yet it still managed to build a network of over 84000 agents in 22 markets across the globe (who work remotely from home).

The company is by far the fastest-growing brokerage today. In the past two years it's increased its agent numbers by 180% while expanding into 18 new countries. Unsurprisingly its revenue has soared. Since the company went public in 2015 its earnings per share (EPS) have grown by 37000% while its free cash flow has increased by 138000%. The company also has a major advantage over other brokerages in that it carries zero debt.

There are certainly headwinds for the brokerage firm the most obvious being the housing market slowdown which could affect its revenue in the coming years. The company's stock-sharing incentive program for agents could also have a dilutive impact on share values if the company doesn't maintain its share repurchasing program. But at the moment there is no major cause for concern. Its second-quarter revenue rose by 42% year over year gross profit was up 34% and it repurchased $50 million of stock in Q2 2022. It pays a $0.18 per share annual dividend which yields 1.33%.

The stock took quite the beating in the tech crash this year and trades down roughly 63% year to date making today's pricing an opportune time to get in.

2. Title insurance: Buy the big dog in a sector Berkshire competes in

Mike Price (First American Financial): In addition to residential real estate brokering HomeServices of America offers a host of other real estate services including mortgage originations and banking property and casualty insurance home warranties relocation services and title insurance. I want to drill down into that last category: title insurance.

Every home purchased with a mortgage is required to have title insurance. There is no central database in the U.S. with all title history so purchasing title insurance protects both the homeowner and the lender from an asset purchase where the seller doesn't actually have a strong claim to the title.

Title insurance companies typically do a load of research to trace the title sometimes back decades and then offer to insure once they are reasonably sure that the seller has true title. The title company also usually offers closing services to ensure that the deed of trust (or whatever the local term is) is correctly filed. This is an important point -- if the title research process is done correctly there shouldn't be a risk because the title company can prove that the title is legitimate and was transferred correctly.

First American Financial (FAF 0.47%) is the 800-pound gorilla in the title insurance space. According to a recent management presentation First American has a 23.1% market share in the title and settlement services sector. Its revenue is up 12.4% annually over the last five years and cash flow is up even more over that timeframe at 17.9% annually. It rode the bull market in real estate to new heights as a company.

The question is how it will do through a potential bear market in real estate? Interest rates are up prices are starting to drop and sales are slowing. Fewer home sales mean less revenue for First American.

This downturn isn't the company's first. First American managed well through the dot-com bust the Great Recession and the pandemic. Company management projects that new purchase and refinance originations in 2022 and 2023 will still be higher than what the company did in 2019 -- and any other year after 2007.

Even if the downturn is far worse than management projects the company can simply stand by investing the revenue it gets from existing premium payments and waiting for the market to come back. If a downturn forces its competitors out of business that just means more potential new customers.

3. Affordable housing: Berkshire believes in it. Do you?

Kristi Waterworth (LGI Homes): Buffett is a big fan of affordable housing. With his acquisition of Clayton Homes in 2003 he demonstrated this by putting his money to work investing in housing for the average Joe. Although Clayton Homes is mostly known for manufactured housing it completed approximately 11000 site-built homes across 12 states in 2021 as Clayton Properties Group.

Like Clayton Properties Group LGI Homes (LGIH 1.00%) focuses on affordable housing which is a niche in the construction industry that remains terribly underserved.

LGI Homes stand out from the competition and it looks similar to Clayton Properties Group because of its ability to make affordable housing widely available and also profitable. An average LGI Homes property sold for $356719 in the second quarter versus an average of $403800 for an existing home in the U.S. in July 2022.

In the second quarter LGI Homes' community count decreased to 91.3 (from 105 in Q2 2021). But its gross margin on each home sold has increased to 32% in Q2 from 27% last year. The improved margins give the company a little more wiggle room to maintain operations should real estate prices drop further due to rising interest rates.

Overall the real estate market continues to suffer from a lack of existing home inventory with just 3.3 months of supply available in July 2022. Economists at the National Association of Realtors consider six months of inventory to be a healthy amount and the industry has not seen that number for years. Even at 3.3 months the market is still 45% below that six-month mark. That shortage bodes well for LGI Homes.

Home builders -- especially affordable housing builders -- are just as important as ever regardless of what the headlines on rising mortgage rates might imply and LGI Homes is a quality builder with stock that can be had for a bargain right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL291dGJvdW5kLWludmVzdG1lbnQvZ2ljLW9hay1zdHJlZXQtanYtYnV5aW5nLW91dC1zdG9yZS1jYXBpdGFsLXJlaXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GIC Leads $14B Buyout of Warren Buffett‚Äôs Only REIT Investment GIC-Oak Street JV Buying Out Store Capital REIT,"Singapore‚Äôs GIC is making its second mega-bet on the US property market within the last month with the sovereign wealth fund having joined with an American partner to buy Warren Buffett‚Äôs favourite REIT for $14 billion in cash.

GIC teamed up with Oak Street a real estate private equity division of New York-based asset manager Blue Owl Capital to sign a definitive agreement to acquire all of the shares in NYSE-listed Store Capital the only REIT which Berkshire Hathaway boss Buffett has invested in.

‚ÄúWe are thrilled to lead this investment in Store Capital given its impressive cash flow profile long-weighted average lease term and highly diversified portfolio with strong rent coverage‚Äù said Lee Kok Sun chief investment officer of real estate division at GIC.

The buyout which remains subject to stockholder approval will give GIC and Oak Street ownership of Store Capital‚Äôs portfolio of 3012 single-tenant commercial and industrial properties across the United States according to a joint statement on Thursday.

Sale-Leaseback Bonanza

The joint venture is buying out Store at $32.25 per share in cash representing a 20.4 percent increase from its $26.79 stock price on 14 September and a premium of 17.8 percent when compared to its 90-day average share price. On the day of the announcement the trust‚Äôs stock rose 20 percent.

‚ÄúAs one of the largest dedicated US net lease real estate companies in a nearly $4 trillion-dollar market Store Capital is a strong addition to GIC‚Äôs diverse portfolio of US real estate investments‚Äù said Adam Gallistel GIC‚Äôs head of Americas real estate. ‚ÄúWe are confident the company will continue its trajectory of accretive growth by meeting the demand for long-term financing solutions from middle market US companies.‚Äù

The Arizona-based REIT focuses on sale-leaseback transactions through which it buys properties from operating companies occupying the facilities and then rents them back to the vendor. It is also one of America‚Äôs biggest net lease real estate platforms ‚Äì where lease agreements require tenants to pay for additional expenses such as utilities and taxes.

Excluding 16 properties that were vacant the Store portfolio was 99.5 percent occupied with an average lease contract term of 13 years as of 30 June. The trust is letting go of its assets after booking a 19 percent year on year jump in first half revenues worth $445.9 million as reported in its latest operating results.

GIC announced its investment in Store just over two weeks after the sovereign fund was revealed to be the backer of a $1.13 billion buyout of commercial real estate investor and operator Workspace Property Trust.

Store‚Äôs properties are dispersed across all US states except Hawaii with Texas Illinois California Georgia Florida and Ohio accounting for a third of its then 2886 assets as of the end of last year according to its most recent annual report.

As of 31 December that portfolio measured 100145 square feet (9304 square metres) in combined built area occupied by tenants across the service retail and manufacturing sectors. Based on revenue share last year the majority or 65 percent was sourced from facilities leased to the service sector 20 percent in the manufacturing sector and 15 percent from retail tenants.

GIC‚Äôs Chicago-based partner Oak Street also follows a net lease strategy and is primarily involved in structuring sale-leasebacks as well as providing seed and strategic capital. Oak Street was acquired by Blue Owl last December in a $1.6 billion deal.

The buyout of Store Capital which is subject to approval by Buffett (Berkshire Hathway owned 6928413 shares as of 30 June) and other stockholders is expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year. Store has also been given a 30-day period to solicit and consider other acquisition proposals.

GIC and Oak Street did not disclose their individual ownership stakes in the joint venture.

Monster Deal

‚ÄúWe believe the Store Capital platform complements Oak Street‚Äôs exposure to the triple-net industry and our focus on sale-leasebacks‚Äù said Oak Street president Marc Zahr. ‚ÄúThe potential scale of this combination and partnership can deliver one of the most diversified unique and long dated net lease platforms across the globe.‚Äù

The buyout deal if completed would become a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù transaction since Store is the third largest publicly traded net lease REIT said Scott Merkle managing partner at SLB Capital Advisors who was not involved in the transaction.

‚ÄúGIC and Oak Street are acquiring one of the most prolific sale leaseback investors that regularly deploys well north of $1 billion a year‚Äù Merkle said in an emailed statement on Friday.

The acquisition would also mark GIC‚Äôs second investment in the US net lease sector following a $1.2 billion retail JV it established alongside New York-listed RPT Realty and two other American partners in March 2021.

Eastdil Secured Advisors and Citigroup Global Markets served as financial advisors for GIC and Oak Street in the transaction while Store was assisted by Evercore and Goldman Sachs.

Closings of sale and leaseback deals in the US reached a record high of 236 transactions worth $10.2 billion in the second quarter according to a report by SLB.

GIC Keeps Buying

GIC which ranked as the world‚Äôs most active state-owned sovereign wealth fund last year is beefing up its exposure overseas having signed three deals worth more than $15.6 billion since August.

Late last month the Singaporean investor reportedly backed Florida-based real estate investor and operator Workspace Property Trust in purchasing a majority stake in 41 suburban office assets with combined space of eight million square feet (743224 square metres).

Now he's mad he didn't go to Costco,"Not the best? Ken Wolter/Shutterstock

What would you do if you were famous and loved?

Would you use your power for good? Or would it all go to your head? Or perhaps a little of both?

Also: Sony TV deal: Get the 75-inch X80J series TV for $549 at Best Buy

I only ask because of a fascinating diatribe just offered by very famous actor Diego Tinoco.

I say he's very famous even though I've never heard of him. He's appeared on Teen Wolf On My Block and many other TV shows I've never watched. He also has 4.7 million followers on TikTok. That's famous enough isn't it?

On TikTok he decided use his outsize influence to spend 3 minutes and 18 seconds raging against LG and Best Buy. But more against Best Buy.

He began: ""Do not ever in your life buy anything from LG Best Buy and more than anything don't ever buy that stupid little Geek Squad warranty that they offer you.""

This he followed with: ""Not only do they have absolute terrible customer service but their agents are literal trash at their jobs.""

Also: I went to Best Buy 4 weeks ago. They still won't let me go

Getting punchy?



What could have possibly tormented him so? Well he claims that he spent $3000 on an LG TV from Best Buy. He says his TV had some ""minor damage horizontal lines across the screen and it was glitching out.""

Is that minor damage or a considerable annoyance? You must decide. Tinoco however insists the Geek Squad ""agent"" told him this was fixable but accused him of having damaged it. That damage couldn't be fixed under the policy Tinoco says he was told.

This tale became quite strained. Tinoco says the Geek Squad agent accused him of ""punching and mishandling my television.""

Perhaps many have wanted to punch their televisions -- or even throw things at them when their team is losing -- but how many really go through with it?

Next says Tinoco the agent left and another agent arrived. ""It was hard to mislike the guy"" says Tinoco.

Until that is ""The man literally grabs my television on the bottom left corner of the screen squeezes it as hard as he possibly can and my TV blacks out completely. Glitches broken done.""

Was it still hard to mislike him? I don't know. I do know that Tinoco claims this agent told him the TV would turn on in 10 minutes. It didn't he claims.

Also: Which LG TV is right for you and how do the top OLED models compare?

Tinoco says he was forced to call LG Best Buy and the Geek Squad. ""And they all tell me the same damn thing: There's nothing we can do for you.""

Now says Tinoco he'll go to Costco or Sam's Club and ""buy anything other than an LG TV.""

Best not to react?



Tinoco says he's been buying from Best Buy for 10 years and has always bought the Geek Squad warranty. He's never needed to use it until now. So he thought he'd spend these minutes advising his millions not to buy LG TVs or shop at Best Buy.

This may be a story that's familiar to some. It may well be that somewhere along the way you feel as if you've been shortchanged by one of these brands.

But here's the part I found most fascinating. I contacted Best Buy and LG and didn't receive a response. I looked through the TikTok comments and couldn't find anything. It seems that both companies have chosen not to react at all to these allegations and provocations.

Also: I asked a Best Buy salesman for the best Windows laptop. He had no doubts

Which is odd. Most companies would likely try to smooth things over -- hey it's a famous person -- and even turn it in their own direction. They might apologize for at the very least a misunderstanding that may have led to a misliking.

In this case though -- at least as far as I can see -- nothing. The video now has more than 2 million views. It's had more than 12500 comments most thanking Tinoco and saying they've had similar experiences. (Disclosure: I've had plenty of encounters with Best Buy -- I also have an LG TV -- and I have always encountered quite good service).

Also: A Microsoft user raged against Outlook. Microsoft lovers fought back

You might conclude then that both LG and Best Buy feel there's more to this story and they're just going to try and let it slowly disappear.

It's an interesting approach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvYWlybGluZS1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvYmVzdC10aW1lLWJvb2staG9saWRheS1mbGlnaHRzLTIwMjIvMTAzNzc4NjUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best time to buy your holiday plane tickets,"If the summer was any indication air travel's hustle and bustle will carry over into the end of the year.

Hopper a travel agency that analyzes data for airfare price predictions is seeing strong booking demand for holiday travel after an ""extraordinary"" summer.

The pent-up demand after two pandemic years is in part because for some travelers this will be the first time they visit family for the holidays since COVID-19 erupted said Hopper spokeswoman Lindsay Schwimer.

""Last year omicron was surging around the holiday season so people will be eager to take holiday trips this year and see family and friends"" she said.

Expect huge demand for holiday flights in 2022

Though it's too early to tell just how busy the fall and winter holidays will be ‚Äì AAA doesn't issue its seasonal travel outlooks until two weeks before the holiday ‚Äì some indicators suggest travelers should expect end-of-year travel will be just as busy as the summer.

TripAdvisor's fall travel survey which forecasts trends from September to November showed 6 of 10 Americans plan to travel this fall. About 49% plan to fly.

At the Cowen 2022 Global Transportation and Sustainable Mobility Conference which took place virtually American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the airline's leisure bookings ""remain strong"" past Labor Day.

""As we take a look forward into the future I'm pleased with how we've managed through the summer and rebounded through the pandemic"" he said.

Airlines are hiring more workers

This summer was a challenge for flying: Many flights were delayed or canceled. Staffing shortages were a big contributor to that.

About 2.3 million fewer aviation jobs existed worldwide in September 2021 down 21% from pre-pandemic levels according to Oxford Economics. That included about 340000 fewer jobs in the airline industry.

Airlines are taking steps to improve their operations.

U.S. airline employment in June 2022 increased by 6775 workers to a total of 767263 including 458136 full-time passenger airline workers according to the most recent data from the Department of Transportation. That's an increase from the same month in 2019 before the pandemic.

Three airlines drove the increase: Delta Air Lines hired 2981 people that month United Airlines added 1322 and Southwest Airlines added 1007.

Airlines for America a trade group representing U.S. airlines said its seven-member passenger carriers ‚Äì Alaska American Delta Hawaiian JetBlue Southwest and United ‚Äì were staffed with 10% more pilots per block hour compared with before the pandemic.

(In the airline industry block hours measure the time from when an aircraft's door closes at departure to when it opens at arrival.)

American Airlines hired about 12000 people across a variety of job categories last year Isom said during the conference. He also said the company is ""making good progress"" as American continued hiring through the summer to prepare for the coming months.

But there will be fewer flights this fall

Despite the staffing growth airlines still don't have enough workers to meet the demand.

Many responded by removing flights from their schedules.

""Flight schedules for September and October are down by 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels and carriers are reducing September flights by 5% compared to what was planned at the start of the summer"" Airlines for America spokeswoman Marli Collier said.

""Airlines set their schedules months in advance and are constantly evaluating to optimize performance and prioritize smooth operations.""

Mother-daughter pilot duo:Pair makes history at Hawaiian Airlines

American Airlines which operates the majority of flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport recently published its final schedule for November that showed 30000 fewer flights.

A spokesman for American Airlines Brian Metham said the airline works off what it calls a ""placeholder schedule"" which is published about a year in advance and adjusts it closer to the time the flights are scheduled.

Its final schedule is published about 100 days in advance he said. On average American operates nearly 5300 departures daily nationwide.

American's full-year flight capacity for 2022 is forecast to end about 7.5% to 9.5% lower than before the pandemic Metham said.

How to book your holiday 2022 flights

‚ñ∫ Don't delay: Industry experts suggest travelers book their flights as soon as possible.

Now through Oct. 20 is when consumers will find the best airfares for Thanksgiving and the December holidays Schwimer said. Higher prices and limited options are likely after mid-October.

""There are still deals available now for the holidays which is why we recommend booking as soon as you see a price you‚Äôre comfortable with"" she said.

‚ñ∫ Save money by flying off-peak: Avoiding peak travel days can result in savings.

Expedia found in its flight data for Thanksgiving that travelers could save an average 5% on airfare by flying on the Sunday Monday or Tuesday before the holiday instead of Wednesday.

""For some destinations the savings are even bigger ‚Äì average ticket prices for Las Vegas for example drop from around $550 to $380 (round trip) just by changing the departure date to earlier in the week"" said Francheska Taveras spokeswoman for the Expedia Group.

This is only available today (Sunday September 18) improving on the already substantial discounts offered by the same retailer for Labor Day on all Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra storage configurations (in a single color option).

The Graphite-coated 14.6-inch Android giant can be yours for the next few hours for as little as $949.99 with 128 gigs of local digital hoarding room which is... not that little by conventional tablet standards.





But this is clearly not a ""conventional"" device somehow beating the wasp waist of Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro from 2021 while tipping the scales at a not-so-cumbersome 726 grams (considering that absolutely gigantic screen) and packing a massive 11200mAh battery with blazing fast 45W charging capabilities.





If you can afford to spend an extra 50 bucks you'll undoubtedly be delighted to know that the 256GB storage variant normally priced at a whopping $1199.99 also offers four gigs of RAM on top of the 8GB memory count of the aforementioned entry-level model.





And then you have the completely state-of-the-art 16GB RAM/512GB storage version of the early 2022-released Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra  currently sold by Best Buy for $1099.99 instead of its $1399.99 list price.





All three of these bad boys naturally come packing the same ultra-high-end Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor thus rivaling (although certainly not exceeding) the raw power delivered by the best iPads money can buy right now.





One important and very clear advantage the Tab S8 Ultra does hold over the competition is its built-in S Pen which you don't have to pay extra for either today or on any other day of the week.

That's an awesome price for this level of performance all in a compact 14-in chassis that's easy to tote around or work with on the go.

My love affair with the G14 has been going on for some time but the latest generation G14 reviewed by James earlier this year represents an absolute pinnacle of achievement by the Taiwanese company. He tested the top-spec version with an RX 6800S GPU but the overall lessons still apply here - performance is strong with the machine being plenty capable of running AAA games at 1440p 60fps while esports titles can make excellent use of the 120Hz refresh rate. The screen looks great with its taller 16:10 aspect ratio good contrast and accurate colours and the keyboard and trackpad are also strong performers - great if you like to bang out deals articles on the train to take a completely random example.

Gaming battery life is the one real downside with James recording less than an hour's use in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at max brightness... although the more modest components in this model should result in better longevity too. Ray tracing is not a strength either like other all-AMD builds and the absence of DLSS is a shame in a world where FSR 2.0 has yet to gain widespread adoption despite relatively strong results. Still these are fairly common weaknesses amongst other laptops with the same specs so there's little to really complain about with Asus' design decisions.

Apple sells three different MagSafe cases each with its own style and selection of colors.

This is great if you want to keep your iPhone safe without hiding the phone's body.

If you're looking for something more durable try the iPhone 14 Silicone Case with MagSafe. This isn't clear like the previous option but is thicker and offers more protection. It comes in eight different colors including Lilac pink Midnight black and (PRODUCT) red.

And if you want a mix of durability and style consider the iPhone 14 Leather Case with MagSafe. This case is made of tanned leather and easily stretches out to protect your entire iPhone. Like all leather it'll wear out over time and start to show creases over time ‚Äî but until then it's definitely the best looking of Apple's cases."

Its aim is to encourage international consultation on the principle of broadening dialogue in keeping with the growing economic importance of a certain number of countries.

Zambia is starting negotiations with private creditors this month to reduce the amount of debt owed. On 6 September the IMF called for $8.4 billion of Zambia‚Äôs debt payments between 2022 and 2025 to be cancelled.

In the letter the experts say:

‚ÄúBecause of the high interest rates Interest rates When A lends money to B B repays the amount lent by A (the capital) as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that A has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation. The interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low. To take a very simple example: if A borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5% the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed (10 million dollars) plus 5% of the capital owed i.e. 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars. In the second year he will again repay 10% of the capital borrowed but the 5% now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i.e. 4.5 million dollars or a total of 14.5 million dollars. And so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5% of that remaining 10 million dollars i.e. 0.5 million dollars giving a total of 10.5 million dollars. Over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127.5 million dollars. The repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments. In the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years. In this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher‚Ä¶



The nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted. The real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation. and the fact Zambia‚Äôs bonds have been trading Market activities

trading Buying and selling of financial instruments such as shares futures derivatives options and warrants conducted in the hope of making a short-term profit. at well below face value since 2018 many bondholders stand to make huge profits at the expense of both Zambian citizens and creditor countries if paid at face value. It is therefore imperative that BlackRock and other bondholders agree to fully engage in a large-scale debt restructuring including significant haircuts in order to make Zambia‚Äôs debt sustainable.‚Äù

They continue:

‚ÄúZambia‚Äôs bonds are all governed by English law. In 2010 the UK parliament passed a ground-breaking Act to enforce a previous debt relief scheme the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Heavily Indebted Poor Countries

HIPC In 1996 the IMF and the World Bank launched an initiative aimed at reducing the debt burden for some 41 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) whose total debts amount to about 10% of the Third World Debt. The list includes 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.



The idea at the back of the initiative is as follows: a country on the HIPC list can start an SAP programme of twice three years. At the end of the first stage (first three years) IMF experts assess the ‚Äôsustainability‚Äô of the country‚Äôs debt (from medium term projections of the country‚Äôs balance of payments and of the net present value (NPV) of debt to exports ratio.

If the country‚Äôs debt is considered ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù it is eligible for a second stage of reforms at the end of which its debt is made ‚Äôsustainable‚Äô (that it it is given the financial means necessary to pay back the amounts due). Three years after the beginning of the initiative only four countries had been deemed eligible for a very slight debt relief (Uganda Bolivia Burkina Faso and Mozambique). Confronted with such poor results and with the Jubilee 2000 campaign (which brought in a petition with over 17 million signatures to the G7 meeting in Cologne in June 1999) the G7 (group of 7 most industrialised countries) and international financial institutions launched an enhanced initiative: ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù criteria have been revised (for instance the value of the debt must only amount to 150% of export revenues instead of 200-250% as was the case before) the second stage in the reforms is not fixed any more: an assiduous pupil can anticipate and be granted debt relief earlier and thirdly some interim relief can be granted after the first three years of reform.



Simultaneously the IMF and the World Bank change their vocabulary : their loans which so far had been called ‚Äúenhanced structural adjustment facilities‚Äù (ESAF) are now called ‚ÄúGrowth and Poverty Reduction Facilities‚Äù (GPRF) while ‚ÄúStructural Adjustment Policies‚Äù are now called ‚ÄúPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper‚Äù. This paper is drafted by the country requesting assistance with the help of the IMF and the World Bank and the participation of representatives from the civil society.

This enhanced initiative has been largely publicised: the international media announced a 90% even a 100% cancellation after the Euro-African summit in Cairo (April 2000). Yet on closer examination the HIPC initiative turns out to be yet another delusive manoeuvre which suggests but in no way implements a cancellation of the debt.

The UK should do the same again to ensure that all private creditors comply with the terms of G20 Common Framework debt restructurings. New York ‚Äì the other key jurisdiction for sovereign debts ‚Äì should do the same.‚Äù

The signatories conclude by saying:

‚ÄúAt a time of global crisis it is economically inefficient and morally wrong for high interest Interest An amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender. Interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set. debts to be paid to private lenders while governments cut back on support for their own people. The world urgently needs a strengthened scheme to deliver debt restructuring for countries and people in need.‚Äù

Zambia first applied for debt relief through the G20‚Äôs Common Framework for Debt Restructuring in February 2021. No debt has yet been restructured but in July 2022 government lenders including China agreed in principle to conclude a restructuring in line with the IMF IMF

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.



When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.



As for the World Bank a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 1768% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).



The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (1674%) Japan (623%) Germany (581%) France (429%) and the UK (429%).

The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (657% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (155% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.

Exercise Cartwheel is a multilateral military-to-military training exercise with the U.S. Republic of Fiji Military Australian New Zealand and British forces that builds expeditionary readiness and interoperability by increasing the capacity to face a crisis and contingencies by developing and stressing units at the highest training levels.

The exercise features opportunities for subject matter experts from all nations to exchange best practices across several functional areas. 1st Lt. Corin Swarbrick a critical care nurse assigned to 402nd Forward Resuscitative Surgical Team U.S. Army Reserve points out that new ideas come from all partners.

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar.

CAPTION: Australian Corporal Louis Carbery an infantry soldier with 8/9RAR discusses how his army clears hallways and intersections at Blackrock Training Camp Fiji during Exercise Cartwheel. Story and photo by US Army Sergeant Brian D. Jones 343rd Mobile Public Affairs Detachment.

The temporary shoot houses were constructed by the US Army Reserve 797th Engineers Vertical Construction Company from Guam and New Zealand soldiers.

These shoot houses were used to show the different techniques the United States and Australian Armies have developed.

The Australian Army had several personnel demonstrating their tactics of entering a building and navigating hallways during combat scenarios.

Australian Army Corporal Louis Carbery an infantry soldier from the 8th/9th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment specialising in reconnaissance said the purpose of the activity was a training package that his unit developed that specialised in urban warfare.

‚ÄúWe are here to help support a little training mainly to build relationships with the Fijian forces United States government British government Royal Gurkha regiment and New Zealand forces‚Äù Corporal Carbery said.

Building a solid relationship with each partner nation is what the Australian Army has come here to do as their primary mission set and it shows how much they care about their job and want to share the skills they have learned.

Captain Harrison Negrone 8/9RAR said the Aussies were working with the Fijian Army the New Zealand Army and the United States Army and we are building relationships and getting the opportunity to cross over and see each other‚Äôs urban drills and skills to understand and increase interoperability between the nations.

‚ÄúWe are happy to show the best practices they have developed to help the partner armies and we appreciates the troops‚Äô willingness to learn‚Äù Captain Negrone said.

Exercise Cartwheel 2022 was developed to share best practices and build readiness through military-to-military training.

Specialist Connor MacDowell an infantry team leader from 1st Platoon B Company 2nd Battalion 27th Infantry Regiment 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team 25th Infantry Division said the shoot house was fantastic.

‚ÄúThe weather is about the same as Hawaii ‚Äì a bit more humid ‚Äì but it‚Äôs fun great atmosphere and I am feeling appreciative of the training being presented here in Fiji‚Äù Specialist MacDowell said.

‚ÄúI value how friendly the partner nations have worked alongside the different cultures.

‚ÄúThe Aussies are great ‚Äì I love them.

‚ÄúI have family from Australia so it‚Äôs nice to be close to family again.

‚ÄúThe Kiwis are fantastic and the Fijians are fun to be around‚Äù he said.

The urban training portion of Exercise Cartwheel kicked off the bilateral military-to-military training.

Partner-nation soldiers quickly came together to start the training as a success.

Captain Negrone summed up the atmosphere as an excellent opportunity that‚Äôs been put together by all the planning teams.

‚ÄúHats off to them it‚Äôs been great.

‚ÄúI like the exercise so far and looking forward to the rest of it.‚Äù

The S&P 500 tumbled 20% during the first six months of 2022 its worst first-half decline in half a century. Meanwhile the bond market experienced its worst decline on record. A typical portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds produced its worst return since the Great Depression.

The lackluster returns and nauseating volatility are leading more investors to seek alternatives to the public stock and bond markets. They're increasingly allocating more of their portfolio to alternative investments like private equity hedge funds real estate and infrastructure. Prequin a leading data provider to the alternative asset community sees investments in alternatives rising to more than $17 trillion by 2025 a roughly 10% annual growth rate from 2020's level. That should drive continued growth for leading alternative asset managers Blackstone (BX 3.14%) Brookfield Asset Management (BN 1.48%) and KKR (KKR 2.19%).

Cashing in on alternatives

Blackstone is the king of the alternative asset management sector. The company ended the second quarter with an industry-leading $940.8 billion of assets under management (AUM).

Investors are pouring capital into Blackstone's funds. Inflows were a jaw-dropping $88.3 billion in the second quarter alone. That was its second-best quarter ever and equal to its total AUM at its initial public offering in 2007.

Blackstone's rapidly rising AUM earns it two revenue streams. A large portion is fee-earning AUM ($683.8 billion at the end of the second quarter) which supplies it with recurring management fees. Blackstone recorded $1 billion of fee-related earnings in the second quarter up 45% year over year. In addition Blackstone earns performance revenues as its funds deliver on their return objectives. The company realized a net $1.1 billion of performance earnings in the second quarter boosting its total distributable earnings to over $2 billion.

The company distributes the bulk of this income to shareholders via a dividend that yields over 5%. Blackstone also repurchases shares and invests some capital into its funds to further enhance shareholder value. As more investor capital flows into Blackstone the company's earnings streams will rise enabling it to keep growing shareholder value.

Highlighting the value of asset management

Brookfield is another leading global alternative asset manager. The company had over $750 billion of AUM at the end of the second quarter.

The company currently has two businesses: Asset management and direct investment. Brookfield has historically retained a large percentage of its asset management income for reinvestment in its funds and other investments. However the company plans to separate these two businesses and spin-off a quarter of its asset management business to shareholders. That will enable them to benefit more directly from the value created by its asset management business.

Brookfield expects its asset management business to grow its fee-bearing capital to $1 trillion within the next five years. That positions the company to double its fee-related earnings to over $4 billion and realize significant carried interest (its share of the profits from managed investments). It expects the spun-out asset management business to pay out 90% of that steadily growing income stream to investors via a large and growing dividend. Meanwhile investors will retain the upside of its direct investment strategy positioning them for significant value creation as both businesses grow in the future.

Continuing to grow

KKR is another leading global alternative asset manager poised to capitalize on the rise in alternatives. The company ended the second quarter with $491 billion of AUM up 14% year over year. Of that amount $384 billion was fee-paying AUM a 20% year-over-year increase.

The company has been working to grow and diversify its business. It has increased its real estate AUM by 50% over the last 12 months to $114 billion by launching new funds and other investment products.

KKR's growth strategy has been paying off. Fee-related earnings are up 40% over the past year to $2.2 billion. Meanwhile after-tax distributable earnings have soared 60% to $4.1 billion. KKR pays a portion of that income out via dividends. It also retains earnings to reinvest in its funds positioning shareholders to capitalize on the income and upside produced by those investments. KKR expects to continue growing briskly as it launches new funds and other products to capitalize on the growing desire of investors to allocate more capital to alternative investments.

Capitalizing on the rise of alternatives

Investors continue to pour money into alternative investments with industrywide AUM expected to top $17 trillion by 2025. That will be a huge boon for leading alternative asset managers Blackstone Brookfield and KKR. They should continue rapidly growing their AUM enabling them to generate lucrative and recurring fee income and significant performance-based revenue. That will provide them money to pay dividends and invest in their funds giving shareholders some exposure to alternatives. These drivers position the companies to create significant value for shareholders in the coming years which is why investors won't want to miss out on this enormous opportunity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbWl4bWFnLm5ldC9yZWFkL2NpcmN1cy10by1jZWxlYnJhdGUtMjB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS13aXRoLXN0ZWxsYXItcGFydHktaW4tbGl2ZXJwb29sLW5ld3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Circus to celebrate 20th anniversary with stellar party in Liverpool,"Iconic Liverpool club night Circus is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a massive event at the city's Blackstone Street Warehouse.

We all know that Boeing aircraft have yokes and Airbuses (A300/310-aside) have sidesticks. But is it possible that Boeing could switch over sooner or later?

A lot of online discussion groups have devoted tens of thousands (or more) of words to the ‚ÄúBoeing Vs Airbus‚Äù debate. This takes many forms with discussions on the 737 and A320 historically focusing on fly-by-wire. There is a lot to cover there but this isn‚Äôt what this article is about. That‚Äôs because wherever you stand on sidesticks we can safely assume that the next Boeing design will be fly-by-wire.

Boeing has designed two ‚Äúblank-sheet‚Äù aircraft in the last three decades: the 777 and the 787. Both of these aircraft are fly-by-wire. Boeing has been mostly silent about the exact design and even the size of its next aircraft as we‚Äôve seen.

Boeing ‚Äì Yes To FBW No To Sidesticks

However the Boeing 777 and 787 both have yokes not sidesticks. Boeing has been vocal about the advantages of the yoke even in its latest designs. Since the yokes are mechanically linked one pilot can feel the other‚Äôs inputs ‚Äì if there are any which normally there shouldn‚Äôt be. Conversely it is impractical to link sidesticks mechanically.

There have also been tragic events where pilots of aircraft with sidesticks did not realize that they were out of trim. This involved cases where the aircraft switched to flight laws whereby it did not auto-trim. These events are quite rare but this is another factor keeping Boeing away from sidesticks.

Of course Airbus and other manufacturers of aircraft with sidesticks have systems and procedures to mitigate these issues. But what if both the ‚Äúdual-input‚Äù problem and the ‚Äúaircraft-out-of-trim‚Äù problems‚Ä¶ went away? What would happen if a new sidestick design eliminated both of these potential issues? Could Boeing then reverse its stance towards sidesticks?

As it happens there are already aircraft out there flying with sidesticks that DO solve these issues. The industry refers to them as ‚Äúactive sidesticks‚Äù. The first aircraft to use them was the Gulfstream G500 corporate jet. It uses a system designed by BAE who previously made sidesticks for military jets. In the G500 there is no mechanical link between the sidesticks. But they both have servos linking them electronically.

No Gaming Did NOT Get There First!

You might have heard of force-feedback joysticks (don‚Äôt worry this is the last use of the ‚ÄúJ‚Äù word in this article). As their name suggests these devices provide feedback to the user depending on what the simulated aircraft is doing. But gaming wasn‚Äôt the first application of this technology. Whatever its future attitude on sidesticks might be Boeing and others have used this principle in aircraft simulators.

BAE isn‚Äôt the only company making active sidesticks. There is also a company in France called Ratier-Figeac which is a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace in the US. Collins is itself a subsidiary of Raytheon. Ratier-Figeac has made Airbus‚Äô sidesticks since the introduction of the A320 family in the 1980s. It has also supplied them to Sukhoi for its SuperJet (SSJ100).

And until recently Ratier-Figeac was also a sidestick supplier to Irkut/UAC for the MS-21. The future of the MS-21 is quite uncertain these days. But in the configuration that Russia certified before the invasion of Ukraine the MS-21 had active sidesticks. If it actually enters service in this configuration it will be the first airliner to have them.

So could these developments finally sway Boeing towards sidesticks? The design solves the dual input and out-of-trim issues. It can also vary its resistance to the inputs of pilots accounting for differences in aerodynamic forces at different speeds. Also the sticks move when the aircraft is on autopilot to reflect the system‚Äôs control inputs.

An Odd Event (with yokes)

If Boeing adopts them sidesticks would also save a good amount of weight. It is much easier to install two sidesticks than two floor-mounted yokes and all their necessary mechanical connections. Ergonomically sidesticks allow pilots to have better reach to their displays. They make touch-screen MFDs practical for instance. Plus pilots get fold-out tables!

It is also worth noting that even though they don‚Äôt use sidesticks Boeing 777s and 787s can have some‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsidestick problems‚Äù. In April 2022 we saw a peculiar incident involving Air France flight AF-11. The pilots of a Boeing 777 were on approach to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (LFPG) when they perceived that the aircraft was ‚Äúfighting‚Äù their inputs.

BEA the French investigating authority is still working on this event. But in a press release it revealed that the two pilots were fighting each other. With enough force (50 lbs or 22.7 kg) the two yokes can ‚Äúdesynchronize‚Äù i.e. move in different directions. The full report will give us all the details. But the incident shows that even without sidesticks and despite the forces involved current Boeing fly-by-wire aircraft could have such issues.

Sidesticks And Boeing Type Ratings

However making such a design change isn‚Äôt that simple. Before it really embraces sidesticks Boeing would have to look at some broader factors. Despite entering service decades apart the 777 and 787 share the same type rating. We don‚Äôt know if this is something Boeing could pursue for its next aircraft to ease airline training.

But even if Boeing doesn‚Äôt do this fully type rating considerations could still delay the adoption of sidesticks. Airbus for instance has a common type rating for its A330/340/350 families which is different from that of its A320 family. But pilots with one of these ratings can benefit from a shorter/abbreviated course for the other.

If Boeing decides to pursue a similar strategy it will probably continue to eschew sidesticks despite these new innovations. But will it? Boeing has received a lot of criticism for its aircraft development choices regarding type ratings and training requirements. This criticism came not only with the 737 MAX but the 777X as well.

So could the company decide to make a point of moving ahead? Could active sidesticks with their advantages in ergonomics weight savings and pilot feedback lead to a change in direction for Boeing? We will have to wait to find out. If Boeing is to remain competitive with Airbus it will really need to launch its next aircraft in the next two years according to analysts.

There was no Boeing signature interior here but rather the overhead bins and overhead consoles looked old too.

There were dropdown screens overhead but the one in front of me was broken and would only go up halfway.

One thing this 737-800 had in common with the previous (much fresher one) was the complete lack of technology ‚Äî of course there were no personal televisions but there were no power ports no Wi-Fi and no streaming entertainment. It was honestly a step back in time.

Copa Airlines Boeing 737s have little technology

On the plus side a nice sunset makes for some great inflight entertainment‚Ä¶

Copa Airlines has three Boeing 737-800 configurations

In addition to having flat beds on Boeing 737 MAX 9s Copa Airlines seems to have three Boeing 737-800 configurations.

There are two kinds of Boeing 737-800s with 160 seats including 16 business class seats and 144 economy class seats. These are the two types of products I flew with one cabin being updated and one cabin not being updated.

Then Copa has some Boeing 737-800s with 154 seats including 16 business class seats and 138 economy class seats. These planes have a significantly more spacious business class product with legrests and personal televisions.

The issue is just how much Copa swaps planes so it‚Äôs hard to know what you‚Äôre going to get especially between 737-800 configurations. It goes without saying that not all of these products are created equal.

Bottom line

Unfortunately my Copa business class experience left a bit to be desired. My Copa flight from Panama to Lima had the oldest Boeing 737 interior I‚Äôve seen in a long time. It‚Äôs not just that the interior looked old but it was also incredibly low tech in terms of passenger experience with no entertainment or power outlets.

Anyway I‚Äôll have full Copa flight reviews soon but that‚Äôs all on Copa for now. On to other more exciting airlines‚Ä¶

Full Power

The incident occurred on the night of Friday September 17 when a United Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft with the registration N37510 was pushing back from one of the airport terminal gates. During this process reports from the ground crew stated that the aircraft rolled off the apron. A video taken by a ground crew employee of the Fort Myers Southwest Florida International Airport shows the pilots going full power on the aircraft's engines to try to get the stuck aircraft out of the muddy grass but to no avail.

When it became clear that the aircraft would not be able to exit the grass without assistance the pilots shut down the aircraft's CFM LEAP-1B engines and awaited help. Another picture posted to Twitter hours after the incident showed the United aircraft still stuck in the same place with air stairs connected to the aircraft's fuselage. Emergency crews were shown surrounding the Boeing aircraft attempting to find a way to remove the aircraft from the grass.

A Hefty Delay

The aircraft has most likely been towed out of the grass as data from flight tracking service Flightradar24 shows that the aircraft is scheduled to return to normal service today September 17 albeit with a four-hour delay. There is no damage to the aircraft including the landing gear nor was anyone injured in this incident.

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year ‚Äî her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website ‚Äî the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page ‚Äî so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being na√Øve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

The post-Labor Day jump was a huge increase over Kastle‚Äôs tally of 38% from the previous week ‚Äì and a quantum leap over the low 20s last winter.

But the news might be even better than that. Although Kastle is widely cited as the oracle of office occupancy its data are less inclusive than most market-watchers are aware. Because of that the number of employees back at their desks despite work-from-home and hybrid schedules is probably higher than Kastle‚Äôs data suggest.

The sample of buildings where the security provider counts entry swipes doesn‚Äôt include many of the city‚Äôs largest real estate empires where tenants include more law firms banks and financial-services firms than the city average. The Wall Street firms have more employees at their desks than tech creative and media firms.

Given the Kastle Barometer‚Äôs high profile ‚Äì Realty Check has often cited its findings like the rest of the real estate media ‚Äî it‚Äôs hardly unfair to note what the survey leaves out.

Kastle doesn‚Äôt cover properties owned or managed by Rudin Management Brookfield Properties Silverstein Properties Rockefeller Group Tishman Speyer BXP (formerly Boston Properties) and Related Companies according to their representatives.



Of 40 Manhattan locations with over 34 million square feet owned or managed by the city‚Äôs largest commercial landlord SL Green Kastle is present at only one recently acquired property.

Kastle‚Äôs security system is used to cite office occupancy in the city but its entry system is not used by many of the city‚Äôs major office buildings.

Empire State Realty Trust doesn‚Äôt use Kastle at the Empire State Building or at most of its other large towers. The Durst Organization uses Kastle in nine buildings but not in its two largest One World Trade Center and One Bryant Park.

Until last week Kastle‚Äôs estimate of New York city office use hovered in the 30%-to low 40%-range. But its latest tally of 46.6% brought it closer to the 49% estimate last week by the Partnership for New York City. The Partnership‚Äôs data is based on estimates provided by 160 major employers.

Partnership President Kathryn Wylde while noting that her organization‚Äôs findings ‚Äúhave been only a couple points off from Kastle through the pandemic‚Äù said ‚ÄúOur membership mix may obviously differ from theirs. We are heavy on financial services which is more present in the office than technology for example.‚Äù

Despite Kastle‚Äôs previous gloomy weekly snapshots August saw more Manhattan leasing volume than in any month since the pandemic began. The boom spilled into September with a nearly 140000 square-foot deal for Blue Owl Capital at the Seagram Building.



If Big Apple offices are as lonely as Kastle suggested why do very smart companies continue to sign leases?



There‚Äôs a second possible fudge factor as well. Kastle counts not the central business districts of 10 US cities but their ‚Äúmetro areas.‚Äù It turns out the ‚ÄúNYC Metro‚Äù includes suburbs far beyond the Big Apple.

We asked the Partnership why their numbers last week were 11 percentage points higher than Kastle‚Äôs. One reason was that the two organization‚Äôs measuring periods didn‚Äôt exactly coincide (the Partnership‚Äôs survey was based on employers‚Äô estimates between Aug. 29-Sept. 12 while Kastle reported only the week ending Sept. 7).

But when the Partnership asked Kastle to clarify its sample the security firm told them it defines New York Metro ‚Äúas the broader core-based statistical area which includes Long Island Westchester and other counties in New York in addition to parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.‚Äù



When The Post asked Kastle representative Audrey Chang to confirm that its sample included suburbs she acknowledged by e-mail ‚ÄúYes although the focus is on Manhattan Class-A ‚Ä¶ based on trending details from more than 200 buildings in New York City.‚Äù

Citing client confidentiality Chang wouldn‚Äôt say which locations it does or doesn‚Äôt include in its data.

CBRE tristate CEO Mary Ann Tighe commented ‚ÄúOf all the data I think the Partnership‚Äôs are the most reliable because its members are a cross-section of the city‚Äôs largest employers.‚Äù

Manhattan‚Äôs streets were jam-packed last week. Durst Organization spokesman Jordan Barowitz reported 75% occupancy on Sept. 13 across Durst‚Äôs entire 13 million-square foot Manhattan portfolio. Insiders at Related say its Hudson Yards skyscrapers with eight million square feet are 60% full.



JLL tristate CEO Peter Riguardi laughed ‚ÄúI equate this to when you look at your iPhone and it says it‚Äôs raining but you look outside and it‚Äôs sunny.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRyb3dlc3RkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ob21lLWdhcmRlbi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2ZyYW1pbmdoYW0taHVkc29uLW1hcmxib3JvdWdoLW5hdGljay1hbmQtbWV0cm93ZXN0LWhvbWVzLXNvbGQvMTAzOTcyNzgwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Framingham Hudson Marlborough Natick and MetroWest homes sold,"No commitment required.

MARLBOROUGH Mass. Sept. 17 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) has announced results from the PROTECTED TAVR clinical trial evaluating the SENTINEL‚Ñ¢ Cerebral Protection System which is designed to capture and remove embolic debris stemming from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) before it can reach the brain and potentially cause a stroke. Outcomes were presented during a late-breaking clinical science session at the 34th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in Boston and will be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System.

This randomized trial evaluated periprocedural stroke reduction and neurologic outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis treated with either the SENTINEL device to provide cerebral embolic protection (CEP) during TAVR or TAVR alone. The primary endpoint was not met as the data demonstrated a non-significant trend towards a lower rate of stroke in patients treated with the SENTINEL device representing a 21% relative risk reduction in all stroke through 72 hours or time of hospital discharge (2.3% with TAVR and CEP vs. 2.9% with TAVR only P=0.30). Importantly a secondary analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 60% relative risk reduction in disabling stroke through 72 hours or time of hospital discharge in patients treated with the SENTINEL device (0.5% with TAVR and CEP vs. 1.3% with TAVR only P=0.02).

""Data from the PROTECTED TAVR trial provide the physician community with evidence that the device plays an important role in reducing disabling strokes across patient types in those undergoing TAVR"" said Dr. Samir Kapadia chairman of the Robert and Suzanne Tomsich Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart Vascular & Thoracic Institute Cleveland Clinic. ""We also found that the rate of vascular complications in this trial was very low whether or not the device was used highlighting the safety of this technology in TAVR procedures.""

While outcomes with TAVR for the treatment of aortic stenosis have been shown to be comparable to surgery stroke remains an important and feared complication of the procedure. Representing the largest randomized TAVR trial to date the study enrolled 3000 patients spanning more than 50 global sites and all surgical risk levels with all patients receiving a neurological exam before and after the procedure. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the reduction in disabling stroke with the SENTINEL device was consistent across patient subgroups including age gender operative risk valve type and history of cardiovascular disease.

""Considering strokes are unpredictable can occur regardless of an individual's clinical background and often take a great toll on a patient's quality-of-life and financial stability we believe the data appear to demonstrate a consistent effect from CEP technology across all patient populations in the trial ‚Äì supporting the use of the SENTINEL device as an effective therapy to reduce the risk of the most debilitating form of stroke for patients undergoing TAVR"" said Dr. Ian Meredith global chief medical officer Boston Scientific. ""We look forward to additional data on this technology such as from the currently enrolling PROTECT TAVI trial in the United Kingdom which will similarly evaluate TAVR-related stroke reduction using the SENTINEL device.""

Previous clinical trials involving more than 3500 patients have demonstrated that the SENTINEL device is safe and effective including capture and removal of cerebral embolic debris in 99% of TAVR cases.1 To date more than 75000 patients worldwide have been protected with this technology.

Device-related factors and all-cause death represented categories favoring Amplatzer Amulet against Watchman according to a news release.

Abbott designed its Amplatzer Amulet left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder with dual-seal technology. It features a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to close off the opening into the LAA. The company said it is the first and only minimally invasive treatment option to offer immediate and complete dual-sealing closure of the LAA. It reduces the risk of stroke and eliminates the need for blood-thinning medication.

The prospective international multi-center Amulet IDE trial is the largest randomized LAA occlusion study to date Abbott said. It included more than 1800 patients.

Abbott reported three-year outcomes demonstrating that device-related thrombosis or peri-device leak more frequently preceded strokes in patients with Watchman compared to those with Amulet. Additionally the company said that cardiovascular and all-cause death trended higher in the Watchman device than the Amulet device.

Data from last year‚Äôs TCT demonstrated that Boston Scientific‚Äôs next-generation Watchman FLX stroke prevention device outperformed the Amulet device. Findings from the SEAL FLX single-center retrospective study of 300 Danish patients found that Watchman FLX demonstrated superiority in the area of LAA closure and peri-device leak.

More Amulet data

Abbott also presented data from its PREDICT-LAA trial. The prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial evaluated the planning process of Amplatzer amulet procedures.

The study looked at the use of cardiac computed tomography-based computational models ‚Äî high-resolution heart scans generated by FEops HEARTguide. It evaluated if those scans help in the planning of Amplatzer Amulet procedures.

Results demonstrated improved procedural efficiency and safety outcomes associated with HEARTguide planning.

Abbott TriClip performs well

Abbott presented the first results from the TRILUMINATE pivotal trial at TCT 2022. It is the company‚Äôs first randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of TEER with TriClip. The study evaluated 700 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Patients spanned the U.S. Canada and Europe.

Results from the roll-in cohort through 30 days demonstrated high implant success rate of 99%. The study also observed at least a one-grade TR reduction in 91% of patients. Additionally 74% of patients achieved moderate or less residual TR.

Patients achieved around a 17-point improvement on the KCCQ score. The 30% improvement from baseline demonstrates a ‚Äúsubstantial improvement‚Äù in quality of life.

More to come

Abbott is presenting data from its CONFIDENCE Registry on Sunday. The international prospective real-world study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Portico TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation).

The study used the first-generation Portico delivery system in 501 patients and the second-generation FlexNav system in 500 patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Byb3RlY3RlZC10YXZyLW5vLWxlc3Mtc3Ryb2tlLWVtYm9saWMtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi1zb21lLXNlZS1ob3Bl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROTECTED TAVR: No Less Stroke With Embolic Protection but Some See Hope,"There were fewer disabling strokes with protection and the procedure itself was safe so it‚Äôs not the end of the story.

BOSTON MA‚ÄîThose who were hoping that PROTECTED TAVR would provide a clear-cut result and bring closure to the question of whether cerebral embolic protection (CEP) reduces stroke in patients undergoing TAVI were disappointed Saturday when the findings were presented here at TCT 2022.

The trial missed its primary endpoint failing to demonstrate a significant difference in the rate of stroke within 72 hours of the procedure or before discharge‚Äî2.3% with use of the Sentinel cerebral protection system (Boston Scientific) versus 2.9% without (P = 0.30).

But that‚Äôs not the end of the story according to Samir Kapadia MD (Cleveland Clinic OH) global principal investigator because with embolic protection there was a lower rate of disabling stroke a secondary endpoint for which the trial was not powered (0.5% vs 1.3%; P = 0.02).

He told TCTMD the trial also showed that use of embolic protection was safe with no major complications and that stroke was an unpredictable event‚Äîno specific factors that could be used to identify a patient group most likely to benefit from protection emerged.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs negative‚Äù Kapadia said about the trial adding that it‚Äôs possible a larger study could have shown a significant advantage for protection on the primary endpoint. Moreover he added disabling stroke is a more meaningful outcome for patients. ‚ÄúThis is in my opinion a positive trial not a negative trial.‚Äù

He concluded that use of protection with the Sentinel device (Boston Scientific) should be considered for all patients undergoing TAVI as a way to reduce disabling strokes. The number needed to treat for this purpose was 125.

I don‚Äôt think we can completely discount and call this a negative trial because disabling strokes are important and [are] associated with significant disability and morbidity and mortality. Sachin Goel

The results were published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine; along with an accompanying editorial by John Carroll MD (University of Colorado School of Medicine Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora) and Jeffrey Saver MD (David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA Los Angeles) that provides a more-sobering assessment of the trial.

‚ÄúAs a whole this trial strikes a serious blow to the hope that this first CEP device would have a definitive effect in the prevention of TAVR-related strokes‚Äù they write. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòsmoking gun‚Äô of captured debris was not associated with high-quality evidence of stroke prevention. The safety of the device and its possible effect on disabling strokes provide a ray of hope but the concern persists that CEP approved and marketed on the basis of surrogate outcomes may not actually provide a clear and incontestable clinical benefit.‚Äù

PROTECTED TAVR is one of the most eagerly awaited RCTs‚Äîand the largest‚Äîin structural interventions Sachin Goel MD (Houston Methodist TX) commented to TCTMD.

Two important findings from the trial are that use of the Sentinel system was safe and feasible‚Äîwith the proportion of patients in whom the filter couldn‚Äôt be placed similar to what‚Äôs seen in practice‚Äîand that disabling strokes were reduced Goel said. He acknowledged that the primary endpoint was missed but said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can completely discount and call this a negative trial because disabling strokes are important and [are] associated with significant disability and morbidity and mortality.‚Äù

The safety information is particularly noteworthy Goel said because there had been concerns that the manipulations necessary to get the Sentinel filter in the proper position could actually increase the risk of stroke. ‚ÄúI think this is very reassuring that we haven‚Äôt seen an increase in the risk of stroke with this device‚Äù he added.

Uptake of the Sentinel system has been spotty since the US Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2017 on the basis of the Sentinel IDE trial. That study showed that debris was captured by the filter in nearly all patients although it also missed its primary endpoint by failing to show a reduction in the volume of new cerebral lesions on MRI.

Whether the PROTECTED TAVR results will actually change how cerebral embolic protection is used out in practice‚Äîwhere there are some strong believers in its benefits and others who are more cautious‚Äîand whether TAVI programs will take on the added cost of embolic protection without clear evidence of a clinical benefit remains to be seen.

Megan Coylewright MD (Erlanger Health System Chattanooga TN) editor of the American College of Cardiology‚Äôs CardioSmart said ‚ÄúWe were hoping there would be a very clear message that stroke was reduced with cerebral protection and the results show that there is no difference in stroke between control and cerebral protection. And typically in studies we stop there and we are curious about the subgroup analysis but we take the finding that the study was powered for as a way to guide clinical practice.‚Äù She noted that the trial was not powered to detect a difference in disabling stroke.

For his part Goel thought there would be some impact. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that all nonbelievers will start believing in this and start using this but I think there will be more believers now than nonbelievers perhaps and the shift will be towards using more cerebral embolic protection‚Äù he predicted.

Discussion during a press conference reflected uncertainty about the clinical impact of the trial.

Michael Young MD (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Hanover NH) said that his group does not universally use embolic protection during TAVI. This trial supports the safety and feasibility of using the Sentinel as well as a reduction in disabling stroke he said.

He added however that the trial ‚Äúmuddies the water somewhat for programs that are low-to-medium volume‚Äù pointing to the number needed to treat to reduce disabling stroke. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be a tough sell for some of those programs to ubiquitously use that for all their patients.‚Äù

Still patient preference may affect use he suggested. ‚ÄúPatients are savvy and they do their research and I‚Äôve had a number of patients asking ‚ÄòDo you use cerebral embolic protection?‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I think this may potentially change the equation and how people think about it.‚Äù

And it‚Äôs not just patient preference that could influence adoption of embolic protection. At the main presentation of the results several physician panelists responded to a question about whether they would opt for embolic protection if a loved one were undergoing TAVI. Of the seven only one responded no noting that at her center in Montreal Canada protection is not currently used in any patients.

PROTECTED TAVR

Stroke has been a feared complication of TAVI from the beginning and remains so despite substantial reductions in risk over time. One study using data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry showed that early postprocedural stroke was associated with a substantially higher risk of 30-day mortality (16.7% vs 3.7%) and a reduced likelihood of being discharged home (36.1% vs 78.9%).

The Sentinel cerebral protection system was developed as a way to capture debris created by the TAVI procedure to prevent it from embolizing to the brain. Though the Sentinel IDE trial missed its primary endpoint a post hoc analysis suggested that there was a lower rate of stroke in the 72 hours after the procedure in the protection group (3.0% vs 8.2%) providing the impetus to perform the PROTECTED TAVR trial.

PROTECTED TAVR conducted across 51 centers in Australia Europe North America enrolled 3000 patients (mean age 79 years; 40% women) who were undergoing TAVI and randomized them to use of the Sentinel protection system or not. Patients at all levels of surgical risk were included with an average STS score of 3.3% in the protection arm and 3.4% in the control arm. Neurology professionals examined all patients before and after TAVI.

Overall the Sentinel system was successfully deployed in 94.4% of patients in whom an attempt was made.

The primary endpoint of stroke shortly after the procedure was based on NeuroARC definitions. Most of the strokes recorded were ischemic both in the disabling and nondisabling categories. There was a lower rate of disabling strokes in the protection arm but that difference was not seen for nondisabling strokes (1.7% vs 1.5%; P = 0.67).

Of the eight disabling strokes in the embolic protection arm two were hemorrhagic and would not have been prevented by the Sentinel device. Only one an ischemic stroke in the left MCA territory occurred in what should have been a protected vessel.

There were no differences between the Sentinel and control groups in terms of several other outcomes including all-cause mortality/stroke (2.7% vs 3.0%) mortality (0.5% vs 0.3%) stroke/TIA/delirium (3.1% vs 3.7%) or acute kidney injury (0.5% in each arm). Only one patient had a vascular complication at the access site for the protection system.

Subgroup analyses showed consistency in the lack of difference between trial arms in terms of all strokes and in the lower risk of disabling stroke with cerebral embolic protection.

What Will Change?

PROTECTED TAVR is likely to fuel a debate about how extensively cerebral embolic protection should be deployed in practice.

I think it‚Äôs going to be a tough sell for some of those programs to ubiquitously use [the Sentinel] for all their patients. Michael Young

The problem with stroke after TAVI Goel said is that there aren‚Äôt any good predictors of who‚Äôs going to be affected. At his center the Sentinel device has been used in a minority of cases reserved for those with prior stroke or a bicuspid aortic valve as well as those undergoing a valve-in-valve procedure.

Goel noted that there is another similar trial‚ÄîBHF PROTECT-TAVI with a projected enrollment of 7000 patients‚Äîstill ongoing; a meta-analysis combining the results of that trial with those from PROTECTED TAVR is already planned. In addition there are other devices in the pipeline that may provide broader protection against stroke during TAVI.

Based on the results Goel said he will consider using embolic protection more frequently during TAVI and will discuss these data with patients when making a decision about TAVI.

Coylewright said the focus on disabling stroke by the PROTECTED TAVR investigators reminded her of the story around left atrial appendage occlusion where trial evidence indicated a reduction in disabling strokes versus oral anticoagulation. ‚ÄúWe want to lean into the outcome of disabling stroke because it shows a difference and because we believe that it is important to our patients‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe study was not powered for that though. Thus it makes it difficult to interpret the result showing less disabling stroke as a means to change our clinical practice.‚Äù

Coylewright highlighted the role patients themselves will play in determining how extensively embolic protection is used moving forward: ‚ÄúI think one of the things that is needed is further engagement with patients undergoing TAVR to help us understand how critical this all-stroke outcome is to them versus disabling stroke in order to further understand how to deploy the therapy.‚Äù

Though there didn‚Äôt seem to be a signal of risk associated with use of the Sentinel system Coylewright said ‚Äúthere are many other things that heart teams will be considering which includes the additional access point during the procedure time spent during the procedure and cost to the patient and the hospital and the health system.‚Äù

As for how the PROTECTED TAVR results would shift use of embolic protection out in practice Coylewright couldn‚Äôt predict but she said once a study is published the decision to change practice on the basis of the results is based partly on the science and partly on the discussions that are sparked locally and nationally. In this case each heart team will have to review the results have a detailed discussion and make a decision about whether to change practice she said.

Commenting during a panel discussion at the press conference Robert Cubeddu MD (NCH Heart Institute Naples FL) said ‚Äúa lot of this just boils down to cost and we need to be realistic about that.‚Äù He pointed out that many programs across the country are operating on tight margins: ‚ÄúCost-effectiveness is something we always look at in everything we do in medicine so I‚Äôd like to see how perhaps [the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] will stand on this.‚Äù

Cubeddu indicated the embolic protection will continue to be used however. ‚ÄúIt takes 5 minutes to do the procedure. We‚Äôve seen that it‚Äôs safe and technically feasible in over 94% 95% of patients. And if you‚Äôre able to prevent one disabling stroke out of 125 and you‚Äôre that one patient I think we would all love to benefit from this‚Äù he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmNsZXZlbGFuZGNsaW5pYy5vcmcvMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9jbGV2ZWxhbmQtY2xpbmljLWxlZC10cmlhbC1maW5kcy10aGF0LWNlcmVicmFsLWVtYm9saWMtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi1kZXZpY2UtcmVkdWNlZC1yaXNrLW9mLWRpc2FibGluZy1zdHJva2UtZm9sbG93aW5nLXRhdnItcHJvY2VkdXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Clinic-Led Trial Finds That Cerebral Embolic Protection Device Reduced Risk of Disabling Stroke Following ...,"Findings from a Cleveland Clinic-led trial show that a Cerebral Embolic Protection (CEP) device reduced the risk of disabling strokes by capturing and removing tiny pieces of calcium and other fragments resulting from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) before they can reach the brain.

Findings from the ‚ÄúCerebral Embolic Protection During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The PROTECTED TAVR Study‚Äù were presented today during a late-breaking clinical science session at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference and simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

In the trial the largest randomized TAVR trial to date researchers evaluated stroke reduction during or right after the procedure and neurologic outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis treated with either the CEP device to provide cerebral embolic protection during TAVR or TAVR alone. While the data showed a 21% relative risk reduction in strokes at 72 hours or at time of hospital discharge (whichever came first) the overall numbers of stroke were small and the reduction was not statistically significant enough to meet the all-stroke primary endpoint (2.3% with TAVR and CEP vs. 2.9% with TAVR only P=0.30).

However a secondary analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 60% relative risk reduction in disabling stroke through 72 hours or time of hospital discharge in patients treated with the CEP device (0.5% with TAVR and CEP vs. 1.3% with TAVR only P=0.02).

‚ÄúIn the practice of TAVR an important question for physicians and patients is risk of stroke‚Äù said Samir Kapadia M.D. chairman of Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic and the study‚Äôs lead author. ‚ÄúThis trial informs the doctor that the disabling stoke was reduced by the use of the CEP device and the device is safe to use.‚Äù

TAVR is an established treatment for patients with aortic stenosis which is the narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart and can lead to interferences in normal blood flow. TAVR is a minimally invasive procedure in which the aortic valve is replaced with a catheter.

Embolization of debris from the valve can cause a stroke during or right after the procedure leading to increased injury or death. Stroke continues to be an important complication of TAVR with 16.7% mortality at 30 days and remains a top concern for patients.

Although stroke is largely unpredictable the risk is primarily procedural with the vast majority resulting from embolic material released at the time of the valve implantation procedure.

In the PROTECTED TAVR trial a total of 3000 patients were enrolled and randomized between February 2020 and January 2022 at 51 centers in North America Europe and Australia with all patients receiving a neurological exam before and after the procedure.

Disabling stroke occurred in 8 of 1501 (0.5%) patients in the CEP group and 20 of 1499 (1.3%) in the control arm. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the reduction in disabling stroke with the CEP device was consistent across patient subgroups including age gender operative risk valve type and history of cardiovascular disease.

Vascular complications at the CEP access site were minimal ‚Äî one patient (0.1%) experienced major bleeding at the radial access site in the wrist during catheter removal.

‚ÄúThis study provides data from the largest randomized CEP trial with a clinical stroke endpoint that is relevant to healthcare providers and patients‚Äù said Dr. Kapadia. ‚ÄúAlthough stroke risk is decreasing with newer generation devices and is comparable to surgical aortic valve replacement it remains an important and troubling complication of TAVR.‚Äù

The PROTECTED TAVR trial was funded by Boston Scientific. Dr. Kapadia has not been compensated by Boston Scientific Corporation for his work on the PROTECTED TAVR trial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpY2FyZGlvbG9neS5jb20vY29udGVudC9sYXRlLWJyZWFraW5nLWRhdGEtc2hvdy1icmVhZHRoLWFiYm90dHMtbWluaW1hbGx5LWludmFzaXZlLXN0cnVjdHVyYWwtaGVhcnQtdGVjaG5vbG9naWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Late-Breaking Data Show Breadth of Abbott's Minimally Invasive Structural Heart Technologies,"September 17 2022 ‚Äî Abbott today announced data from five late-breaking presentations showing the benefits of its minimally invasive devices in treating people with a range of structural heart diseases. Data include findings that reinforce the value of MitraClip the world's first and leading transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) device to treat leaky valves in people with mitral regurgitation (MR).

The new data around Abbott's structural heart therapies were presented at the 34th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in Boston (September 16-19 2022). Results were also presented on TriClip the first therapy designed specifically for tricuspid heart valve repair; the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage Occluder a minimally invasive option offering the most complete closure of the left atrial appendage (LAA) to reduce risk of stroke; and Portico a self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system.

Structural heart diseases such as valve disease or openings in the heart that require closure can impair how the heart moves blood through the body. New minimally invasive technology has changed how physicians approach patient care and limits the need for more complex or risky surgery.

MitraClip EXPAND G4 Post-Approval Study

Data presented from the prospective multi-center global real-world EXPAND G4 study support the safety and effectiveness of the MitraClip G4 system for treating MR. The study represents the largest report of 30-day core lab-assessed outcomes which included more than 1000 patients. The data confirm that MitraClip offers high success rates in terms of MR reduction improvements in quality of life and low adverse event rates.

Key findings through 30 days include:

Significant MR reduction to mild or less (‚â§ grade 1+ on a four-point scale) is achieved in 91% of patients with lowest reported adverse event rates to date (1.3% all-cause mortality at 30 days)

Clinical improvements including 83% of patients achieving New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class I/II (a classification of functional limitations resulting from cardiac disease with Class I/II meaning slight or no limitation of physical activity) an improvement of 52% from baseline of 31%; and an 18-point improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score (a self-assessment of social abilities symptoms and quality of life) a 35% improvement from baseline score

Multiple clip sizes enable tailoring the therapy to patients' mitral valve anatomy and expand the spectrum of TEER-suitable patients

Use of MitraClip G4 improves procedural efficiency with lower number of clips and 24% reduction in device time

""MitraClip therapy has fundamentally changed the way doctors treat mitral regurgitation provides a valuable therapy option that does not require open-heart surgery and goes beyond simply managing symptoms with medications"" said Jason Rogers M.D. professor of cardiovascular medicine and director of interventional cardiology and structural heart training programs at the University of California Davis Medical Center. ""These late-breaking data demonstrate and strengthen the evidence that Abbott's MitraClip system consistently reduces MR in a broad range of patients while restoring proper function of the mitral valve and improving patients' quality of life.""

The MitraClip system has been commercially available in the U.S. since 2013 and in Europe since 2008. With more than 150000 patients treated worldwide MitraClip is approved in more than 75 countries spanning regions in Asia Africa Europe the Americas and Australia.

""These results add to what's been proven through nearly two decades of clinical experience in transcatheter mitral repair ‚Äì MitraClip provides long-term significant mitral regurgitation reduction that changes and saves lives"" said Michael Dale senior vice president of Abbott's structural heart business. ""Abbott was the first to offer a transcatheter mitral valve repair device that provides a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with MR who would otherwise go untreated and we remain committed to addressing the unmet needs of people with structural heart conditions.""

First Results from the TriClip TRILUMINATE Pivotal Trial

TRILUMINATE Pivotal is the first randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of TEER with TriClip in 700 patients with severe TR in the U.S. Canada and Europe. The data from the roll-in cohort through 30 days show:

High implant success rate (99%)

At least a one-grade TR reduction in 91% of patients with moderate or less residual TR achieved in 74%

Patients achieving around a 17-point improvement in the KCCQ score a 30% improvement from baseline score which demonstrates a substantial improvement in their quality of life

Three-Year Outcomes from the Amulet IDE Study

The Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder with dual-seal technology (consisting of a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to close off the opening into the LAA) is the first and only minimally invasive treatment option to offer immediate and complete dual-sealing closure of the LAA reducing the risk of stroke and eliminating the need for blood-thinning medication. The prospective international multi-center Amulet IDE trial is the largest randomized LAA occlusion study to date consisting of more than 1800 patients and three-year outcomes demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Amulet with data showing:

Device-related factors (device-related thrombosis or peri-device leak) more frequently preceded strokes in patients with Boston Scientific's Watchman‚Ä° than those with Amulet

Both cardiovascular and all-cause death trended higher in the Watchman device than the Amulet device

PREDICT-LAA Trial (Amulet)

Data were also presented from the PREDICT-LAA prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial that studied if the use of cardiac computed tomography-based computational models (high-resolution scans of patients' hearts generated by FEops HEARTguide) help in the planning of Amplatzer Amulet procedures. Key findings at three months include:

Improved procedural efficiency and safety outcomes with the Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder were achieved when planned with HEARTguide

Portico CONFIDENCE Registry

The CONFIDENCE Registry is an international prospective real-world study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Portico TAVI valve using the first-generation Portico delivery system in 501 patients and the second-generation FlexNav delivery system in 500 patients. Late-breaking data on valve hemodynamics (blood flow) at 30 days and one-year survival following implantation of the Portico TAVI device will be presented at TCT on Sunday Sept. 18.

Every now and then thanks to their expertise and persistence they achieve a eureka moment. Suddenly triumphantly our researchers understand something no one has ever understood before.

It's my privilege to lead Research and Early Development at Bristol Myers Squibb. In this role I oversee programs and technologies that drive our organization across all therapeutic categories from the ‚Äúaha‚Äù of discovery through the rigors of proof-of-concept. The best part of my job is getting to work with some of the brightest innovators in our industry ‚Äî each of whom is committed to bringing medicines to patients with unmet medical needs.

Nothing is more important to any of us. And when it comes to bringing our A-game every day nothing motivates us more than knowing that the research carried out in our labs can improve patient health and lead to a higher quality of life and even extended longevity. As scientists it doesn‚Äôt get any better than knowing our roles have the potential to transform lives.

But that takes some doing. At the outset the discovery of drugs calls for applying scientific disciplines such as biology chemistry and pharmacology. My ongoing challenge in leading research and early development is to make sure that our researchers have the right resources ‚Äî and equally valuable the creative freedom and support ‚Äî to keep our pipeline thriving.

Working together for patients

Building a strong pipeline and winning for patients is a team sport every time. I‚Äôm often reminded of the Olympic motto Citius Altius Fortius which translates to ‚Äòfaster higher stronger.‚Äô Our aspiration for ourselves and our patients is no different.

To be successful we must focus on discovering developing and delivering medicines to patients faster. It is not enough to be innovative; we must also embrace new ways to accelerate the overall R&D process.

Our sense of urgency drives us to be persistent in the face of scientific challenges and complexity and to seek new approaches to innovation.

Applying computer science. Introducing advanced solutions to our clinical trials. Building testing and deploying robust digital platforms that can achieve scale as sustainably as possible. New datasets that amplify our predictive power through all stages of our pipeline.

The combined power of these tools helps us deliver for patients.

The next big leap

Our pipeline is now more promising and diverse than ever. It‚Äôs currently flowing with more than 50 compounds in development across 40 disease classes. It‚Äôs no coincidence either that our efforts to incorporate diverse perspectives into the discovery of new medicines has made a big difference here.

We‚Äôve brought together leading researchers in the pharmaceutical industry hailing from a wide range of backgrounds and cultures all of whom are passionate about science and profoundly compassionate toward patients. We‚Äôve also educated inspired and hired a new generation of physicians and scientists from historically underrepresented communities to narrow the dangerous gaps in care facing those underserved populations. Only when our scientific workforce reflects the patient populations we serve after all can we truly unleash our potential to achieve the company‚Äôs mission.

I‚Äôm proud of these accomplishments. But of course our work is never done.

At the moment we‚Äôre moving toward our next big milestone for patients: identifying new biomarkers that can help predict how patients respond to our medicines and better target which patients should take those medicines. Every small step we take is an opportunity to make the next big leap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vcGhhcm1hcGhvcnVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL21lcmNrLXBheS1ibXMtNjI1bS1jYW5jZXItcGF0ZW50LWNhc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck to pay BMS $625m in cancer patent case,"Merck & Co has agreed to pay rival Bristol-Myers Squibb $625 million plus royalties to settle a patent case relating to the companies' rival cancer immunotherapies.

The agreement announced late last week resolves worldwide patent infringement case which claimed that Keytruda infringes on patents held by BMS and Ono.

Under the agreement Merck will make a one-time payment of $625 million to BMS and Ono and pay royalties on worldwide sales of Keytruda for a non-exclusive licence to market Keytruda in any market in which it is approved.

From Jan 1 this month until December 31 2023 the royalty will be 6.5% of global net sales falling to 2.5% of net sales from January 1 2024 and until December 31 2026. BMS will receive three-quarters of the royalty and Ono will receive the rest.

The parties have agreed to dismiss all further related claims.

The payment will be recorded in Merck‚Äôs Q4 and full-year 2016 results.

Merck‚Äôs CEO Kenneth Frazier said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement eliminates uncertainty and enables us to continue to focus on Keytruda our immuno-oncology medicine which is already helping thousands of patients around the world and becoming a foundation for the treatment of cancer through our industry-leading clinical development programme.‚Äù

Staining results were missing due to delayed tissue shipping from one centre lack and damage of tumour tissue on the TMAs (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The pS6 analysis cohort consisted primarily of males (86.5%) with median age at diagnosis of 64 years while the vast majority was of Caucasian ethnicity (99.1%). Former and current smokers represented 48.0% and 11.5% of the cohort respectively while 40.4% were never smokers. Most of the patients (76.8%) were definitely or possibly exposed to asbestos and for 45 of them (29.0%) asbestos fibres were detected in the lung. 114 (47.1% among those with available information) and 128 (52.9%) patients had ECOG performance status 0 and ‚â•1 respectively.

The majority of the cases (70.3%) were of epithelioid histology while 24.2% were biphasic and 5.5% sarcomatoid (i.e. 29.7% non-epithelioid). The epithelioid and sarcomatoid components in biphasic PMs were evaluated in a combined score. For dubious sarcomatoid and desmoplastic PMs a cytokeratin and calretinin stain were available for cases from Zurich. Unclear external cases with a sarcomatoid/ desmoplastic histology were excluded.

In addition among the total 364 patients of the analysis cohort 113 (31.0%) patients received palliative treatment as a first intention strategy (90 of them (80%) palliative chemotherapy) 249 (68.4%) patients had a macroscopic complete resection and only 2 (0.5%) patients did not receive any treatment (treatment details in Supplementary Table S3). Tumour tissue from biopsies at diagnosis and surgical resections were available. Of the 364 patients with tissue included in the pS6 analysis 188 (51.6%) were treatment-na√Øve 93 (25.5%) were pre-treated while 83 (22.9%) could not be classified.

Baseline patient tumour and other clinico-pathological characteristics for the pS6 analysis cohort (n = 364) as well as all registered Mesoscape patients (n = 499) are provided in Supplementary Table S4.

Furthermore the percentage of pS6 high in the cohort of 188 treatment-naive patients was 66.0% (95% CI: 58.7‚Äì72.7%) while for the 93 pre-treated patients pS6 high was significantly lower: 12.9% (95% CI: 6.9‚Äì21.5%) (p < 0.001).

Assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity

In our cohort 153 cases (42%) showed a homogenous intensity score among the TMA punches 151 cases (41%) revealed a minor heterogeneity in intensity (one intensity score difference) and 60 cases (16%) had a major heterogeneity (two or three intensity scores difference) in pS6 staining. Comparison of heterogeneity evaluated in TMAs and corresponding whole sections (n = 19) revealed a very good level of consistency with a non-significant difference in the derived H-score (Table S6).

Association of pS6 expression with histopathologic parameters

Patient tumour and treatment characteristics for the sub-cohorts of ‚ÄúpS6 high‚Äù versus ‚ÄúpS6 low‚Äù patients are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Baseline characteristics by pS6 status and overall. Full size table

The association of pS6 status with treatment strategy was found to be statistically significant. Complete resection was less common in pS6 high patients (60.8%) compared to pS6 low (76.8%) (p = 0.0032) (the % of pS6 high expression was 44% for patients with complete resection versus 61% for patients receiving palliative treatment).

Right side localization of the disease was also more common among pS6 high patients (61.3%) compared to 50.8% in pS6 low (the % of pS6 high expression was 43% for patients with left localization versus 54% for patients with right localization) p = 0.034 but we note that this observed difference was not significant after FDR adjustment. In addition even though only 8 cases in our analysis cohort were of clinical M stage 1 an association emerges with 7 of the 8 cases belonging to the pS6 high group (p = 0.036 not significant after FDR adjustment).

Finally with respect to histology the observed difference was not significant (p = 0.051) (Fig. 3).

More particularly among pS6 high patients 75.1% were epithelioid and 24.9% non-epithelioid (17.1% biphasic; 7.7% sarcomatoid) versus 65.6% epithelioid and 34.4% non-epithelioid (31.1% biphasic; 3.3% sarcomatoid) for pS6 low. The percentage of pS6 high expression was 53.1% for the epithelioid and 41.7% for the non-epithelioid cases (35% in the biphasic and 70% for the few sarcomatoid cases). Overall pS6 high expression was not significantly different between epithelioid and non-epithelioid patients (p = 0.051) while a significant differentiation emerges when assessing separately biphasic and sarcomatoid cases (p = 0.0024). Of note in our cohort the non-epitheloiod group primarily consists of biphasic patients.

In a post-hoc exploratŒøry analysis it is found that in the more recent cases a higher percentage of pS6 high patients was detected (60% for diagnosis in 2011‚Äì2017 vs 40% in 1999‚Äì2010 p < 0.001).

Prognostic value of pS6

The clinical outcome of the patients (OS PFS) was evaluated at a median follow-up of 53.8 months (interquartile range: 43.2‚Äì77.1 months) comparable between the two sub-cohorts (p = 0.32). Most of the patients had died with disease (71.4%) 15.1% died without evidence of disease or with unknown disease status while only 4.7% of the patients were alive and disease-free at their last follow-up and 8.8% were alive with disease or unknown status.

A total of 155 (85.6%) deaths were observed in pS6 high patients with median OS 18.3 months (95% CI: 16.4‚Äì20.9) and 160 (87.4%) deaths in pS6 low patients with corresponding median OS 21.7 months (95% CI: 16.7‚Äì23.7) not significantly different (p = 0.52 Fig. S3). The 1-year OS estimates along with the corresponding 95% CIs for pS6 high and low patients were 71.1% (63.9‚Äì77.2%) and 68.3% (61.0‚Äì74.5%) respectively. The OS estimates at 2-years were 37.1% (30.0‚Äì44.1%) for pS6 high patients and 41.5% (34.3‚Äì48.5%) for the pS6 low patients. Overall the effect of pS6 was not found significant in Cox models univariable (p = 0.52) or adjusting for baseline characteristics of interest (p = 0.28 with significant covariates: gender histology and treatment strategy).

Subgroup analysis for OS has been performed by histology (epithelioid/non-epithelioid Fig. 4) and by treatment strategy (Fig. S4A B). A statistically significant difference in OS for the pS6 status was observed only in non-epithelioid patients (p < 0.001) with median OS 10.7 months (95% CI: 7.4‚Äì13.6) for pS6 high versus 16.9 months (95% CI: 11.5‚Äì22.7) for patients with pS6 low expression.

Fig. 4: Overall survival (OS) according to histological subtype. A OS by pS6 status; epithelioid patients. B OS by pS6 status; non-epithelioid patients. Interaction p-value (from Cox model including pS6 status with histology interaction): <0.001. Overall median OS was 23.1 months (95% CI: 19.9‚Äì25.2) for epithelioid patients and 13.7 months (95% CI: 10.7‚Äì15.7) for non-epithelioid. Log-rank p-value comparing pS6 high vs. low: 0.88 for epithelioid; <0.001 for non-epithelioid. Full size image

The significant effect of pS6 status in non-epithelioid patients was also verified in the multivariable Cox analysis where the interaction of pS6 status with histology was significant (p < 0.001) with HR high vs. low = 2.12 (95% CI: 1.42‚Äì3.17); p < 0.001 for the non-epithelioid group (Table 2). In addition in both high and low pS6 groups histology was a significant prognostic factor with favourable outcome for epithelioid patients: HR epithelioid vs. non-epithelioid = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.18‚Äì0.38); p < 0.001 in pS6 high group and HR epithelioid vs. non-epithelioid = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.46‚Äì0.89); p = 0.0075 in pS6 low group. Furthermore female patients (HR female vs. male = 0.55 (95% CI: 0.39‚Äì0.79); p = 0.0011) as well as patients who underwent complete resection (HR complete resections vs. palliative = 0.50 (95% CI: 0.39‚Äì0.64); p < 0.001) exhibited significantly lower risk of death.

Analogous were the results for PFS. A total of 340 PFS events were recorded (166 (91.7%) in pS6 high patients and 174 (95.1%) in pS6 low patients with a median PFS estimate of 12.4 months for both pS6 high and low patients and no statistically significant difference (p = 0.97) (Fig. S5). The PFS estimates at 1 and 2-years along with the corresponding 95% CIs for the pS6 high patients were 51.6% (44.1‚Äì58.7%) and 23.4% (17.5‚Äì29.9%) respectively. The corresponding estimates for the pS6 low patients were 50.3% (42.8‚Äì57.3%) and 21.8% (16.2‚Äì28.1%). Overall the effect of pS6 on PFS was not found significant in Cox models univariable (p = 0.97) or adjusting for baseline characteristics of interest (p = 0.96).

Subgroup analysis for PFS has also been performed by histology (Fig. 5A B) and by treatment strategy (Fig. S6A B). As with OS a statistically significant PFS difference between high/low pS6 was observed in non-epithelioid patients (p < 0.001) with median PFS 6.2 months (95% CI: 4.1‚Äì8.9) for pS6 high versus 10.8 months (95% CI: 7.8‚Äì14.8) for patients with pS6 low expression.

Interaction p-value (from Cox model including pS6 status with histology interaction): <0.001. Overall median PFS was 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.4‚Äì15.9) for epithelioid patients and 8.8 months (95% CI: 6.3‚Äì10.4) for non-epithelioid. Log-rank p-value comparing pS6 high vs. low: 0.18 for epithelioid; <0.001 for non-epithelioid. Full size image

In the multivariable Cox analysis the interaction of pS6 status with histology was also found to be significant (p < 0.001) with HR high vs. low = 2.06 (95% CI: 1.39‚Äì3.07); p < 0.001 for the non-epithelioid group while the reverse effect on PFS was observed for the epithelioid patients; HR high vs. low = 0.74 (95%CI: 0.57‚Äì0.97); p = 0.028 (Table 3). The favourable effect of epithelioid compared to non-epithelioid patients was detected in the group of pS6 high patients: HR epithelioid vs. non-epithelioid = 0.32 (95% CI: 0.23‚Äì0.46); p < 0.001. In addition significantly lower risk of PFS event was observed for female patients (HR female vs. male = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.43‚Äì0.85]; p = 0.0034) and those who underwent complete resection (HR complete resections vs. palliative = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.44‚Äì0.70]; p < 0.001).

In a further exploratory subgroup analysis according to the type of TMA tissue (treatment-naive or pre-treated) the significant effect of pS6 in non-epithelioiod patients was confirmed in the subgroup of treatment-na√Øve tissue (n = 50 patients; with 26 being pS6 high) with median OS 8.6 months (95% CI: 5.7‚Äì10.8) for pS6 high versus 15.1 months (95% CI: 5.1‚Äì27.0) for pS6 low (p = 0.014) while in the smaller group of ‚Äúpre-treated‚Äù non-epitheliod patients (37 patients; with only 5 being pS6 high) pS6 effect was not significant (p = 0.17). Analogous were the results for the PFS endpoint (for the 50 non-epithelioid patients with treatment-na√Øve tissue) with median PFS 4.5 months (95% CI: 2.4‚Äì6.1) for pS6 high versus 9.2 months (95% CI: 5.0‚Äì26.1) for pS6 low (p = 0.017).

In the post-hoc exploratory analysis by diagnosis timing no significant difference was detected between the two time-groups of patients neither for OS (medians in months (95% CI): 17.4 (14.5‚Äì21.7) vs 21.3 (18.0‚Äì24.3) log-rank p = 0.23) nor for PFS (medians in months: 11.8 (9.7‚Äì13.7) vs 12.8 (10.8‚Äì14.9) p = 0.72). In addition the interaction effect of diagnosis time with pS6 expression was not found significant in unadjusted (p = 0.78 p = 0.82 respectively for OS/PFS) as well as in multivariable Cox models (p = 0.93 0.87).

Finally the sensitivity survival analysis based on three pS6 subgroups (140 cases with low pS6 H-score ‚â§ 1 102 cases with intermediate pS6 H-score between 1 and 1.84 and 122 cases with high pS6 H-score ‚â• 1.84) confirmed our primary findings that is in the overall cohort no difference in OS/PFS was found between the three pS6 subgroups (Figs. S7 S8) while the interaction with histology was significant in multivariable analysis (Tables S7 S8).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmlwZXMuY29tL3ZldGVyYW5zLzIwMjItMDktMTcvdmV0ZXJhbi1zdWljaWRlLXJhdGUtc3R1ZHktNzM2Mzc5MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study finds 37% greater veteran suicide rate than reported by VA,"U.S. airmen from the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing honor veterans who take their own lives symbolized by 22 pairs of boots Sept. 8 2021 from an undisclosed location somewhere in Southwest Asia. (Karla Parra/U.S. Air Force)

An exhaustive study four years in the making has found nearly a 40% higher rate of veteran suicides than that reported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The study‚Äôs interim report based on service records from the Defense Department and death records from eight states examined suicides and ‚Äúself-injury mortality‚Äù ‚Äî or deaths classified as accidental or undetermined ‚Äî in people aged 18 to 64 from 2014 to 2018.

America‚Äôs Warrior Partnership a suicide prevention group contracted with the University of Alabama and partnered with Duke University to gather state-provided death data and coordinate with the DOD to corroborate military affiliation. It was funded by the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation.

The study identified a 37% greater suicide rate than reported by the VA. That was because ‚ÄúOperation Deep Dive‚Äù as the study is called worked to get specificity of the decedent‚Äôs demographics military experience and death details.

The VA by contrast gets its suicide numbers reported by the county authorities where the death occurred. The study found that method failed to identify veterans about 18% of the time.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the VA‚Äôs fault. The issue is the counties‚Äù said Jim Lorraine an Air Force veteran and president of America‚Äôs Warrior Partnership.

The VA did not return phone calls or an email for comment.

The states that provided death information for the study were Alabama Florida Maine Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Montana and Oregon.

If the eight states represented a national rate study authors said approximately 24 veterans die each day by suicide as determined by a coroner or medical examiner compared to the VA‚Äôs average of 17.7 veteran suicides per day.

In addition some 20 former service members die each day by self-injury mortality ‚Äî listed as accidents or an undetermined cause of death. More than 80% of those were overdose deaths Lorraine said.

The study identified that veterans most at risk of suicide were those who served for less than three years had been demoted and lived alone in a suburban or rural area.

The study will continue for another four years Lorraine said with plans to get data from more states and drill down into the specifics of each suicide with the ultimate goal of creating prevention tools Lorraine said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get those numbers down‚Äù Lorraine said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcnl3ZWxsaGVhbHRoLmNvbS9mZGEtYXBwcm92ZXMtZmlyc3Qtb25jZS1kYWlseS1vcmFsLXBsYXF1ZS1wc29yaWFzaXMtZHJ1Zy02NzM1OTEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA Approves First Once-Daily Oral Plaque Psoriasis Drug,"Key Takeaways Regulators approved an oral once-daily drug called Sotyktu (ducravacitinib) for treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Clinical trials showed that the drug is more effective and better tolerated than the twice-daily oral psoriasis drug Otezla (apremilast).

An oral medication may be easier for patients to take than injectable biologics.

Last week the FDA approved Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) a once-daily oral pill by Bristol Myers Squibb for people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis‚Äîa chronic systemic immune-mediated disease.

The medication is meant to treat adults who have plaque psoriasis severe enough to make them candidates for systemic therapy and phototherapy.

Many of the drugs that are available to treat severe cases of plaque psoriasis are biologics that are injected or administered intravenously. These can be expensive and often require patients to routinely visit a provider to be treated and monitored. Even oral immunosuppressant options can increase the risk of infection and other undesirable side effects.

Deucravacitinib is the first oral treatment for plaque psoriasis that can be taken just once daily and the first oral medication approved for the disease in a decade. In clinical trials the drug appeared to be more effective than the popular psoriasis drug Otezla (apremilast).

More than 7.5 million U.S. adults live with psoriasis according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. As many as 90% of those patients have plaque psoriasis characterized by raised patches of inflamed and discolored skin and nearly a quarter of those have moderate to severe cases.

Unlike existing treatment for this population deucravacitinib doesn‚Äôt require laboratory follow-up and seems to be well-tolerated said April Armstrong MD MPH professor of dermatology and associate dean of clinical research at the University of Southern California who led the clinical trials.

‚ÄúThis is a breakthrough medication and in my opinion this drug will be the leading oral agent for our patients with psoriasis because of its robust efficacy and good safety profile‚Äù Armstrong told Verywell. ‚ÄúI'm very excited to talk to my patients about this drug.‚Äù

Clinical Trials Show Significant Plaque Improvement

The FDA approved the drug based on two clinical trials which compared deucravacitinib to apremilast in nearly 1700 adults with a mean age of 46 years.

These participants all had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. On average they experienced psoriasis for 17 years on a quarter of their bodies. More than a fifth had clinically severe psoriasis and nearly 40% had used biological therapies to control their condition.

One group took a 6-milligram tablet of deucravacitinib once per day. Other participants took 30 milligrams of apremilast twice daily or received a placebo.

By month four nearly 60% of patients achieved a meaningful benchmark: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75. This is a measurement indicating 75% improvement in the amount of skin surface area covered by plaques. In comparison fewer than 13% in the placebo group and 35% in the apremilast group reached PASI 75.

Additionally plaques cleared or nearly cleared in more than half of the people treated with deucravacitinib. That‚Äôs in contrast to only about 7% of people in the control group.

Patients who took deucravacitinib continued to improve over time. After six months of treatment 69% reached PASI 75 compared with 38% of those who took apremilast.

More Accessible Fewer Side Effects

For people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis providers often prescribe injections or biologics which can alter the immune system to slow or stop disease progression. (Topical treatments are typically reserved for plaque psoriasis that only covers a small part of someone's body.)

There are some existing psoriasis treatments that can be given orally such as Trexall (methotrexate) and Gengraf Neoral or Sandimmue (cyclosporine) but they tend to be less effective or lead to more serious side effects than the injectable options.

Biologic drugs are given by injection or intravaneously and target specific portions of the immune system. These include Humira (adalimumab) Enbrel (etanercept) and Stelara (ustekinuman). These options can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance.

Both biologic and non-biologic immunosuppressant drugs often raise the risk of infection and other health problems. Patients who take them often need to be monitored routinely.

Deucravacitinib meanwhile more specifically targets a key enzyme rather than suppressing the immune system broadly. This approach Armstrong said makes it a safer alternative to the other available drugs.

How Does Deucravacitinib Work?

The drug is the first to target tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) an enzyme that is linked to susceptibility for psoriasis.

TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. Many treatments for autoimmune disorders target JAKs but most JAK inhibitors don‚Äôt do much to affect TYK2. By blocking this specific enzyme the drug interrupts some of the cellular processes that are key for forming psoriatic lesions.

Plus a TYK2 inhibitor drug could be safer because it has a narrow target compared to other JAK inhibitors which can have a broad effect on the immune system.

‚ÄúBy having more specific targeting of the pathways that are involved in psoriasis we avoid essentially hitting the other pathways that are important for our normal human functions‚Äù Armstrong said. These include the effects on blood cell counts lipid and other types of metabolism and other types of immunity.

Deucravacitinib works similarly to the widely-used psoriasis biologic agent Stelara (ustekinumab). But that drug is a monoclonal antibody that needs to be injected in a hospital setting. Deucravacitinib on the other hand comes as an oral pill that patients can easily take at home or while traveling.

How to Take It

Deucravacitinib is much simpler to take than most of the other injectable biologic drugs currently on the market. The 6-milligram pill is taken once a day. It can be taken with or without food.

The drug should be most effective after five to six months of treatment but most patients will start to see improvement within just a few weeks Armstrong said.

There are no known drug-drug interactions so patients can use deucravacitinib alongside treatments for other conditions.

In clinical trials patients who took deucravacitinib were less likely to discontinuation the treatment than those taking apremilast.

‚ÄúPatients‚Äîonce they are on the medication‚Äîtend to stay on the medication"" Armstrong said.

As with many chronic conditions pausing or stopping treatment may allow the condition to re-emerge.

Known Side Effects

In clinical trials the most common adverse events associated with deucravacitinib were the common cold upper respiratory tract infection headache diarrhea and nausea.

More than 1% of patients who took deucravacitinib experienced upper respiratory infection increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (CK) in the blood herpes simplex mouth ulcers acne or inflammation of the hair follicles (folliculitis).

More people who took deucravacitinib experienced adverse events than those who took the placebo. However only 2% of participants stopped the treatment due to serious adverse events compared with 4% in the placebo group.

Additionally there were no herpes zoster infections opportunistic infections thromboembolic events hematologic or lipid abnormalities that are characteristic of JAK1 JAK2 and JAK3 inhibitors.

Armstrong said people with severe liver disease should not take deucravacitinib. It should also not be taken along with other immunosuppressants."

Chinese state-backed hackers have targeted computer systems used by ‚ÄúHeads of government‚Äù Prime Minister‚Äôs Office government institutions linked to finance aerospace defence companies telecom companies IT organizations and media companies in multiple countries in an intelligence gathering operation that has been in motion since 2021.

This has been unearthed by researchers of Broadcom Inc a Delaware-based corporation headquartered in San Jose California United States. The report by Broadcom has stated that the target of this cyber espionage were ‚ÄúAsian governments‚Äù and does not specify which country/countries of the 48 Asian countries were targeted by these Chinese state supported hackers.

Researchers from Broadcom‚Äôs Software‚Äôs Symantec threat hunter team told The Sunday Guardian that the company does not ‚Äúdisclose victim identities‚Äù. According to the research the hackers installed Shadow-pad malware into the systems of its intended victims. The said malware was able to execute keylogging take screenshots download files and steal clipboard data.

While the report does not name the Chinese entities as being responsible for these attacks Shadow-pad trojan malware is something that has been used by the Chinese government-sponsored Bronze Atlas group since at least 2017. Researchers in the past have found irrefutable evidence to link these cyber thieves to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) (Chinese intelligence agency) and the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA).

‚ÄúThe malware was likely developed by threat actors affiliated with Bronze Atlas and then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups around 2019‚Äù a Delhi-based cyber researcher told The Sunday Guardian. According to Broadcom the current campaign appears to be almost exclusively focused on government or public entities. According to experts the trojan programs were most likely installed on each compromised computer the attackers wanted to run malware on. In some cases it was likely installed on multiple computers on the same victim network. These malwares were mostly embedded in software including security software graphics software and browsers.

Bronze Atlas which also goes by the name of APT41 Barium Double Dragon Wicked Panda or Winnti has been termed as a prolific APT an Advanced Persistent threat (APT) actor a broad term used to describe an attack campaign in which the intruder or team of intruders establishes an illicit long-term presence on a network in order to mine highly sensitive information.",,,,,,,,,

LOUISVILLE Ky. ‚Äî Simmons College of Kentucky is bringing a piece of Louisville history back to life.

The school dedicated the old Central High School near the Limerick neighborhood on Thursday.

Simmons said it will now become the Ida B. Wells Hall named after the prominent journalist and early civil rights activist.

The building itself holds historical significance.

It was dedicated in 1873 and was the first locally and publicly funded school for African Americans. Many regarded the location as the ‚Äúbirthplace of Black public education in Kentucky‚Äù and one of the most progressive high schools for African Americans. It was also the only high school in Louisville for African American students.

""They said yes African Americans need to be trained with their hands but also with their minds and they wanted to train leaders and intellectuals"" George Wright University of Kentucky vice president for Institutional Diversity said.

Simmons hopes the building will now be returned to its status as a hub for Black education in Louisville and a key to a brighter future.

Cadence Design Systems has launched a data platform that pulls in the masses of data being collected by EDA tools and is using this to enable a suite of AI-driven verification applications that aim to boost coverage and accelerate root cause analysis of design bugs on complex systems on chip (SoCs).

Its new joint enterprise data and AI (JedAI) platform enables engineers to obtain ‚Äòactionable intelligence‚Äô from massive volumes of chip design and verification data opening the door to a generation of AI-driven design and verification tools that will help improve productivity and power performance and area (PPA). Cadence said this will result in a generational shift from single-run single-engine algorithms in EDA to algorithms that leverage big data and artificial intelligence to optimize multiple runs of multiple engines across an entire SoC design and verification flow.

Built on this JedAI platform the company also announced its Cadence Verisium verification platform a suite of applications using the big data analytics capability of JedAI to optimize verification workloads which is natively integrated with the Cadence verification engines. By deploying Verisium all verification data including waveforms coverage reports and log files are brought together in JedAI. Machine learning (ML) models are built and other proprietary metrics are mined from this data to enable dramatic improvement in verification productivity. Cadence said that the JedAI platform is able to unify its computational software innovations in data and AI across Verisium verification to Cadence‚Äôs Cerebrus Intelligent Chip Explorer‚Äôs implementation and Optimality Intelligent System Explorer‚Äôs system analysis.

Automating data analytics from EDA tools

Explaining the significance of the new platforms at a launch event in Munich Germany Moshik Rubin a director for marketing at Cadence hailed the company‚Äôs new AI-driven data platform and verification suite as the emergence of EDA 2.0. He said that SoCs are getting increasingly larger and more complex integrating hundreds of IP. With each of these IP blocks constantly changing as they evolve and improve it becomes harder to manually correlate the different results and test failures. Determining the root cause of the failure can require dozens of engineers and multiple weeks.

This is where automating the data analytics through an AI-driven platform can help cut verification and debug time and also reduce the number of engineers needed. The Cadence JedAI platform is meant to make it easier to manage design complexities associated with consumer hyperscale computing 5G communications automotive and mobile applications. Customers using Cadence analog/digital/PCB implementation verification and analysis software‚Äîand even third-party applications‚Äîcan use the JedAI platform to unify and analyze all their big data. The platform is cloud-enabled offering scalable compute resources in a secure design environment from leading cloud providers.

Pat Moorhead CEO founder and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy said ‚ÄúTo enable the semiconductor industry to continue on its strong growth trajectory it‚Äôs critical that the chip design process becomes much more efficient to keep pace with market demands. Improving design processes through AI and big data analytics creates a clear benefit for engineering teams who can now extract key learnings from the vast quantities of EDA data right at their fingertips. The new Cadence JedAI platform is designed to provide users with automated intelligent design insights and the ability to greatly scale engineering team productivity.‚Äù

Venkat Thanvantri VP of AI R&D at Cadence added ‚ÄúPreviously we saw that once a chip design project was completed the valuable data was deleted to make way for the next project. There are valuable learnings in the legacy data and the Cadence JedAI platform makes it easy for engineering teams to access these learnings and apply them to future designs to deliver optimal engineering productivity and PPA and ultimately more predictable higher quality product outcomes.‚Äù

As SoC complexity continues to rise verification become a critical path for system time to market often consuming significantly more compute and human resources than any other silicon engineering task. (Image: Cadence)

According to Rubin verification is becoming a large part of the design cycle. As SoC complexity continues to rise verification become a critical path for system time to market often consuming significantly more compute and human resources than any other silicon engineering task. He told embedded.com that this is the reason Cadence focused on debug as the first application for the JedAI platform. He said ‚ÄúDebug is the use case where RoI was looking the highest. The main challenge was in finding the right data sets.‚Äù He also said that with the shortage of verification engineers the Verisium platform with AI-driven analytics capability was effectively helping alleviate the issue by providing ‚Äòrobot engineers‚Äô.

He added. ‚ÄúThis will result in a paradigm shift in the way verification engineers will work.‚Äù

Cadence released a number of customer endorsements at the launch from MediaTek Samsung Electronics STMicroelectronics and Sony. S. Brian Choi corporate VP Samsung Electronics said ‚ÄúAs SoC complexity continues to grow SoC-level verification has become a rate-limiting step in our tapeout schedules. We see a great opportunity to leverage AI and big data to dramatically improve design and verification productivity. We are working closely with Cadence to deploy the Verisium platform on our mobile SoC designs and are already seeing impressive results to automatically triage and root cause bugs.‚Äù

Meanwhile Mirella Negro Marcigaglia STM32 digital verification manager at STMicroelectronics said ‚ÄúFunctional verification has continued to be a major concern to address the rapidly growing complexity of IP and SoC designs in STM32 Microcontrollers. Cadence‚Äôs data-driven functional verification platform and apps leveraging AI technology are a very promising approach to contain this problem. We have already observed a significant boost to functional verification productivity leveraging Verisium AutoTriage SemanticDiff and WaveMiner. Using the Verisium apps and the Cadence JedAI platform we aim to quickly achieve a dramatic productivity improvement in triaging and localizing bugs on our IP and SoC designs.‚Äù

Verisium apps

The initial suite of apps available in the Verisium platform:

Verisium AutoTriage: Builds ML models that help automate the repetitive task of regression failure triage by predicting and classifying test failures with common root causes.

Verisium SemanticDiff: Provides an algorithmic solution to compare multiple source code revisions of an IP or SoC classify these revisions and rank which updates are most disruptive to the system‚Äôs behavior to help pinpoint potential bug hotspots.

Verisium WaveMiner: Applies AI engines to analyze waveforms from multiple runs and determine which signals at which times are most likely to represent the root cause of a test failure.

Verisium PinDown: Integrates with the Cadence JedAI platform and industry-standard revision control systems to build ML models of source code changes test reports and log files to predict which source code check-ins are most likely to have introduced failures.

Verisium Debug: Delivers a holistic debug solution from IP to SoC and from single-run to multi-run with fast interactive and post-process debug flows with waveform schematic driver tracing and SmartLog technologies. Verisium Debug is natively integrated with the Cadence JedAI Platform and other Verisium apps to enable AI-driven root cause analysis with the support of simultaneous automatic comparison of passing and failing tests.

Verisium Manager: Brings Cadence‚Äôs full flow IP and SoC-level verification management solution with verification planning job scheduling and multi-engine coverage natively onto the Cadence JedAI platform and extends it to support AI-driven testsuite optimization to improve compute farm efficiency. Verisium Manager also integrates directly with other Verisium apps enabling interactive push-button deployment of the complete Verisium platform from a unified browser-based management console.

I now realize that the use of that word was not in good taste. Therefore I have updated this story to avoid any confusion. I recently visited the Apartheid Museum in South Africa and the word was on my mind but it was not constructive to even imply a link between the Virgin Atlantic policy and the policies of the South African state from 1948 until 1994. Thanks all for holding me accountable.

Those who gain entry by credit card are now second-class citizens at the Virgin Atlantic Lounge in Washington Dulles. Hopefully this is a fluke and not a sign of things to come in the chain of Virgin lounges outside of London run by Plaza Premium.

Second Class Citizenship For Credit Card Guests In Virgin Atlantic Lounge

I specifically chose the Virgin Atlantic Lounge (via my Capital One Venture X card) because of its a la carte menu which I was looking forward to after skipping breakfast and lunch.

After checking into the lounge I headed over to the restaurant and had a seat. I asked one of the staff members if there was a menu and she responded that there was only a buffet (and a very limited buffet at that‚Ä¶).

Others seated around me were being served food from the kitchen and I cannot imagine Virgin Atlantic suddenly deciding it would no longer offer menus in its lounges.

I had a QR code from a previous visit and pulled it up. Sure enough the menu. I put in my table number ordered a soup salad and plant-based burger and submitted my order.

It promptly arrived with the same lounge staff member saying ‚ÄúOh I didn‚Äôt know you were flying on Virgin today.‚Äù I told her I was not. Then she asked me how I ordered food and I said that I had the QR code. She responded that about a month ago the lounge eliminated a la carte dining for those entering via American Express or Plaza Premium‚Ä¶

Treating certain guests as second-class citizens at the same time in the same lounge is not only annoying but pretty devious considering Plaza Premium sells one-time access to this lounge and specifically praises the a la carte menu:

Passengers who don‚Äôt know better might also walk away disgusted at Virgin Atlantic which reflects poorly upon their brand as well.

It‚Äôs one thing to say that a la carte dining is only available during certain hours but it is quite another thing to cheapen out on credit card guests something so many of us unfortunately predicted when Plaza Premium took over management of these lounges.

CONCLUSION

I‚Äôm tempted to share the QR code here and encourage everyone to order off the menu but I‚Äôm going to reach out to Plaza Premium first. It isn‚Äôt clear if this is an IAD-only policy or will apply across the Virgin Atlantic lounge network operated by Priority Pass.

p.s. The food was very good‚Ä¶",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWZvcmxpdmVtdXNpYy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2lkZXNwcmVhZC1wYW5pYy10aGUtdGhlYXRlci1hdC1tZ20tbmF0aW9uYWwtaGFyYm9yLTktMTYtMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Widespread Panic Threatens To Overtake The Nation's Capital On First Night At MGM National Harbor [Audio/Videos],"Kings of jam rock Widespread Panic set up basecamp at a strategic location that the veterans of the road know well at this point having played there three times in four years. While WSP hunkered down for the weekend at The Theater at MGM National Harbor on the Potomac River just a few clicks downstream of the Washington Monument reinforcements of ‚ÄúGoodpeople‚Äù gathered from around the country for Friday night‚Äôs jubilee. As is tradition Panic brought the heat and performed nonstop jams with a second set that was as good as they‚Äôve ever played.

Rolling up their sleeves and getting to work after a customary welcome greeting from John Bell (‚ÄúG‚Äôevening everybody!‚Äù) the six-piece opened with ‚ÄúGive‚Äù for the first time since 2016. Two consecutive transitions connected the first three songs of the set as Dave Schools anchored the melody into a thumpin‚Äô ‚ÄúBear‚Äôs Gone Fishin‚Äô‚Äù until Jimmy Herring‚Äôs solo spilled over into a nasty ‚ÄúWorry‚Äù. (‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôm gonna get better babe / and take a little time to worry all about you.‚Äù)

The band paused to catch its breath but maintained the theme as JB crooned ‚ÄúC. Brown‚Äù (‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to worry‚Ä¶‚Äù) like a mother placating an agitated child. Before the song could fade away Duane Trucks revived the beat and introduced ‚ÄúSteven‚Äôs Cat‚Äù. For the fans who made the trek Jimmy Herring accelerated into the horizon of ‚ÄúShut Up and Drive‚Äù until parking inside the first cover of the night fIREHOSE‚Äôs ‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù.

Winding down the set Panic performed ‚ÄúYou Got Yours‚Äù on the 27th anniversary of the song‚Äôs debut. Both Jimmy and JoJo‚Äîon organ and piano‚Äîhad their say before moving on. To finish the first frame JB gnawed into a slice of blues history with a gritty version of Willie Dixon‚Äôs ‚ÄúTaildragger‚Äù.

Back from set break Panic staggered into the second set with a grooving ‚ÄúFrom the Cradle‚Äù before ‚ÄúGoodpeople‚Äù encapsulated JoJo‚Äôs ‚ÄúDark Bar‚Äù for another spirited round. After a brief pause Panic charged on without stopping until the end of the set.

A voodoo-infused performance of Dr. John‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Walk on Guilded Splinters‚Äù blazed the way into an early morning ‚ÄúDiner‚Äù run. Following a peaking solo and subsequent breakdown JB served up a tasty improvised rap (‚ÄúPut a quarter in the jukebox and make it sing this morning before all the respectable people come ‚Äôround.‚Äù)‚Äîsustenance for the soul.

Past the point of no return Panic dug into a heavy ‚ÄúPapa‚Äôs Home‚Äù until slowing the tempo down for a dreamy ‚ÄúJamais Vu‚Äù. Cranking the intensity back up Bloodkin‚Äôs ‚ÄúHenry Parsons Died‚Äù evolved into ‚ÄúConrad‚Äù to close the second set and ended over an hour of consecutive jams.

Widespread Panic came back for a pair of encores to finish the show in the same badass style that ran rampant throughout the first two sets. First Widespread honored fallen friend and brother Daniel Hutchens of Bloodkin with a lyrically packed cover of ‚ÄúTrashy‚Äù. The Panics closed out the first night with an explosive bombardment ‚ÄúJunior.‚Äù

Two more nights of beautiful weather and jam rock ahead. This run is shaping up to be monumental if you will.

According to witnesses who described the scene on social media the fight began after a dispute over whether a passenger had taken another person's chair at the Tides Bar located on the top deck next to the swimming pool.

Video footage taken by bystanders appears to show that the altercation began with a shouting match between two groups of women at the bar.

Later footage shows a male passenger hitting a female passenger on the deck while other passengers attempt to break up the fight. The participants knocked over several deck chairs while pushing each other around.

Carnival's code of conduct forbids disruptive behavior and warns that passengers who affect the safety or well-being of other guests ""will be disembarked at their own expense and banned from sailing on Carnival in the future.""

A similar fight broke out aboard the Carnival Magic in June. In the early hours of June 28 while the vessel was on her way back to New York City a large-scale fracas broke out in her nightclub. A group of 40-60 passengers joined into a physical altercation on the dance floor all captured on video by a bystander at the bar. The footage shows a sole security guard heavily outnumbered and radioing for backup. The U.S. Coast Guard escorted the vessel back to the pier where the NYPD was on hand to meet her. No serious injuries were reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi12cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1jaG9vc2luZy1iZXR3ZWVuLWJpZy1jcnVpc2UtbGluZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean vs. Carnival: Which Is the Better Cruise Line?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/royal-caribbean-vs-carnival-choosing-between-big-cruise-lines on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi12cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1jaG9vc2luZy1iZXR3ZWVuLWJpZy1jcnVpc2UtbGluZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWxhd25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXJpZ2h0cy9hbm90aGVyLWxhcmdlLWJyYXdsLWVydXB0cy1vbi1jYXJuaXZhbC1jcnVpc2Utc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another Large Brawl Erupts on Carnival Cruise Ship,"Another out-of-control brawl recently broke out on a Carnival Cruise Line ship. The Miami Herald reported on the large fracus which took place on the Carnival Sunrise on September 9th. Included in the article titled A massive fight broke out on a Carnival cruise ship. Cellphone cameras caught it all was video featured on Twitter.

The Miami Herald explained that ‚Äúfootage of the nasty bust-up . . . involved a handful of people punching and beating on each other . . . ‚Äù The ‚Äúhandful‚Äù of people were estimated to be around thirty. The fight occured between the pool and one of the ship‚Äôs many bars.

A fight between cruise passengers sailing on the Carnival Sunrise is caught on camera pic.twitter.com/DUyNSKci2J ‚Äî Parker Branton (@ParkerBranton) September 11 2022

The Daily Mail in the UK covered the cruise ship skirmish and included a TicTok video which showed the begining of the fight. The Sun newspaper included a video with a portion of the violent fight.

Fights on Carnival cruise ships are hardly rare as we have repeatedly reported. The last time a hoard of people began beating each other took place just last June on the Carnival Magic. Sixty 60 passengers were involved in an ‚Äúall-out brawl‚Äù around 5:20 a.m. when the Carnival cruise ship was returning to port in New York following an eight day cruise to the Caribbean. As usual no one was arrested or prosecuted although numerous cell phones caught many dozens of cruise guests in the melee.

We first wrote about the problem of violence on Carnival owned cruise ships back in 2009 in Cruise Ship Brawls ‚Äì A Problem that Will Get Bigger with Bigger Ships where we covered a ‚Äúmini-rampage‚Äù on the P&O cruise ship Ventura and a brawl involving passengers who punched scratched and bit it out with police in Antigua. The following year we covered another violent brawl on another Carnival ship in More Cruise Ship Violence ‚Äì A Drunken Brawl On Carnival‚Äôs Dream. We also wrote about this problem in Another Brawl Breaks Out on a Carnival Fun Ship. YouTube is filled with videotapes of violence on Carnival ships.

The problem arises when the ‚Äúwider audience‚Äù (a term coined by Carnival chairmen Micky Arison) finds their way onto cruise ships attracted by low prices. Add too much alcohol and too few well-trained security guards on these budget ships and this is what happens. Carnival security guards are often seen kicking or hitting the guests or trying to keep onlookers from videotaping the raucous conduct.

This week the cruise line issues a new letter to guests booked onboard two Carnival cruise ships sailing from New York and Baltimore saying internet connections would be limited.

This is the second time in a month that Carnival has informed guests of internet access issues onboard. The problem seems to only seriously affect ships sailing in this area. It is particularly painful as Carnival recently announced it would be increasing prices for internet connections onboard its vessels.

Guests Informed of Limited Wi-Fi Access

Guests sailing onboard Carnival Magic today September 17 from New York City and guests sailing onboard Carnival Legend from Baltimore Maryland today and September 25 have been informed that their cruises will have limited internet access during the voyage.

The email sent to guests booked on any of the three voyages said the following: ‚ÄúDue to challenges with some of the ship‚Äôs satellites there will be limited Wi-Fi access during your cruise.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will automatically refund all pre-purchased Wi-Fi packages as onboard credit to your Sail & Sign¬Æ account. The social and value plans will still be available for purchase at the discounted pre-cruise price should you decide to purchase on board on a daily basis. The premium plan will not be available.‚Äù

Carnival Magic‚Äôs cruise departs today September 17 from New York City and will be heading to Saint John New Brunswick; Halifax Nova Scotia; and Sydney Nova Scotia and is due to return to New York on September 24. The following cruise will be a six-night Bermuda cruise which seems unaffected now.

Carnival Legend

Carnival Legend will sail from Baltimore today on an eight-night Eastern Caribbean cruise. With calls to Turks and Caicos on September 21 and Amber Cove Dominican Republic on September 22 this voyage is also affected by the Wifi problems.

However there could be even more bad news for guests booked on this voyage. The cruise is scheduled to be in the exact area where tropical storm Fiona will pass in the coming days.

Carnival already issued a different letter to guests onboard Carnival Legend stating the following:

‚ÄúTogether with our Fleet Operation Center in Miami we have been actively monitoring Tropical Storm Fiona which is located in the Caribbean. Since the safety of our guests and crew is our number one priority we will remain a safe distance from the storm at all times. We will continue to monitor the weather and provide you with timely updates should our itinerary be impacted.‚Äù

The second voyage affected by Wifi issues is a six-night Bermuda cruise from Baltimore departing September 25 and returning to Baltimore on October 1.

Carnival Raises Prices for WiFi

Carnival Cruise Line issuing statements that the Wifi will not be strong enough to offer the premium package onboard comes at a painful moment for the cruise line.

The premium plan is the highest-rated Wifi package onboard Carnival‚Äôs ships and is supposed to enable guests to make video calls and perform other high-bandwidth activities on their devices.

Carnival said recently it would be implementing a price hike for its internet packages from October 1. The base package costs $8.50 per day if guests purchase the package before sailing. This price will increase to $10.20 per day.

The value package is increasing to $14.45 per day an increase of $3.40 per day from the old rate of $11.05. The Premium package will increase with $2.55 to $17.00 per day. These are the pre-purchase prices if guests decide to purchase onboard these prices go up by an additional 15%.

The issues with internet connections have persisted for some time now onboard the Carnival Cruise Line ships pointing to a much bigger problem that seems to be plaguing the IT systems onboard the vessel. It begs the question of why Carnival is not moving to Starlink Maritime a move that Royal Caribbean made a few weeks ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJuaXZhbC1uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLXVudmVpbHMtbmV3LWFydC1pbnN0YWxsYXRpb24tYXQtcG9ydC10YW1wYS1iYXktYnktbG9jYWwtMTUteWVhci1vbGQtYXJ0aXN0LWFuZC1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb25pc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Unveils New Art Installation at Port Tampa Bay by Local 15-Year-Old Artist and Conservationist,"Event Held on International Coastal Cleanup Day to Highlight the Importance of Protecting our Oceans Seas and Beaches

Carnival Cruise Line today revealed a new art installation created by 15-year-old Tampa artist and conservationist Ryan Moralevitz in honor of International Coastal Cleanup Day.

As part of the special ceremony Moralevitz shared the five sculptures he created from items collected through numerous cleanups in the Tampa Bay area. The sculptures depict a seahorse octopus shark sea turtle and dolphin all made of discarded items including bottle caps food cans and metal utensils. At four years old Moralevitz began conducting beach cleanups and today his project The Fishes Wishes sells his art to raise money and awareness for the Ocean Conservancy and Tampa Bay Watch. To further support Ryan‚Äôs mission Carnival made a surprise contribution of $5000 to The Fishes Wishes during the event.

‚ÄúI am extremely appreciative to Carnival and other likeminded companies that strive to make environmentally conscious decisions to keep the oceans clean and thriving‚Äù said Moralevitz.

Carnival Vice President of Environmental Operations Richard Pruitt Port Tampa Bay executives and board members and Moralevitz joined Tampa Bay Chamber of Commerce and Visit Tampa Bay leaders as well as representatives from Tampa Bay conservation groups for the celebratory event. Pruitt thanked Tampa Bay community leaders for their support in bringing the art exhibit to the cruise terminal and joining with Carnival to honor Ryan and highlight the importance of ocean preservation.

‚ÄúInternational Coastal Cleanup Day is a great opportunity to further our efforts towards a more sustainable future and we are grateful for Ryan‚Äôs commitment to conservation and for lending his talent to make these amazing sculptures possible‚Äù said Pruitt. ‚ÄúArt has the ability to cross barriers and unite us and by blending art and ocean sustainability these sculptures will inspire and promote our mission of advancing environmental stewardship while preserving the ocean for generations to come.‚Äù

Carnival Cruise Line team members both shipboard and shoreside also celebrated International Coastal Cleanup Day by participating in a fleetwide cleanup of waterways surrounding home and destination ports.

Fowler joined the Navy eight years ago. Today Fowler serves as an aviation electronics technician.

‚ÄúI joined the Navy to follow a family tradition‚Äù said Fowler. ‚ÄúMy great uncles were all in the Army Marine Corps and Airforce. My father was in the Navy for 20 years aboard submarines. When it came time for me to serve the Navy seemed like the right fit.‚Äù

Growing up in Fredericktown Fowler attended Highland High School and graduated in 2014. Today Fowler relies upon skills and values similar to those found in Fredericktown to succeed in the military.

‚ÄúI remember being at the county fair in Fredericktown‚Äù said Fowler. ‚ÄúA gentleman I‚Äôd never seen before or spoken to before knew who I was. That taught me that your legacy and character can go a long way. Someone could always be watching so carry yourself with that knowledge and you can always be proud of the life you lead.‚Äù

These lessons have helped Fowler while serving with the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Oceana.

Naval Air Station Oceana serves as the Navy‚Äôs East Coast Master Jet Base. The flight line Apollo Soucek Field is home to 17 aviation squadrons and hosts the F/A-18 Super Hornet.

The Super Hornet is one of the most advanced aircraft in the world according to Navy officials. The aircraft takes off from and lands on Navy aircraft carriers at sea and is capable of conducting air-to-air combat as well as striking targets on land.

Navy aircraft carriers are designed for a 50-year service life. When the air wing is embarked the ship carries more than 70 attack fighter jets helicopters and other aircraft all of which take off from and land aboard the carrier at sea. With more than 5000 sailors serving aboard the aircraft carrier is a self-contained mobile airport.

Aircraft carriers are often the first response to a global crisis because of their ability to operate freely in international waters anywhere on the world‚Äôs oceans.

Since USS Langley‚Äôs commissioning 100 years ago the nation‚Äôs aircraft carriers and embarked carrier air wings have projected power sustained sea control bolstered deterrence provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and maintained enduring commitments worldwide.

‚ÄúThe aircraft carrier is our U.S. Navy‚Äôs centerpiece our flagship and a constant reminder to the rest of the world of our enduring maritime presence and influence‚Äù said Rear Adm. James P. Downey USN Program Executive Officer (PEO) Aircraft Carriers. ‚ÄúThese ships touch every part of our Navy‚Äôs mission to project power ensure sea control and deter our adversaries.‚Äù

Serving in the Navy means Fowler is part of a team that is taking on new importance in America‚Äôs focus on strengthening alliances modernizing capabilities increasing capacities and maintaining military readiness in support of the National Defense Strategy.

‚ÄúThe Navy contributes to the National Defense Strategy in many ways‚Äù said Fowler. ‚ÄúThe Navy consistently provides services around the world. We provide maritime interception operations. If a country needs assistance we can always be there to help. We also provide freedom of navigation of the seas even in contested waters.‚Äù

With more than 90 percent of all trade traveling by sea and 95 percent of the world‚Äôs international phone and internet traffic carried through fiber optic cables lying on the ocean floor Navy officials continue to emphasize the importance of accelerating America‚Äôs advantage at sea.

‚ÄúMaintaining the world‚Äôs best Navy is an investment in the security and prosperity of the United States as well as the stability of our world‚Äù said Adm. Mike Gilday Chief of Naval Operations. ‚ÄúThe U.S. Navy‚Äîforward deployed and integrated with all elements of national power‚Äîdeters conflict strengthens our alliances and partnerships and guarantees free and open access to the world‚Äôs oceans. As the United States responds to the security environment through integrated deterrence our Navy must continue to deploy forward and campaign with a ready capable combat-credible fleet.‚Äù

Fowler and the sailors they serve with have many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during their military service.

‚ÄúMy proudest Navy accomplishment is my final checker afloat‚Äù said Fowler. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when you get to go up on the flight deck and launch jets. That was the qualification my grandma really wanted me to get before she passed so it‚Äôs very important to me.‚Äù

As Fowler and other sailors continue to train and perform missions they take pride in serving their country in the United States Navy.

‚ÄúAs a Navy sailor you can be an ambassador for America when overseas‚Äù added Fowler. ‚ÄúWhen other countries think of America they remember the good work done by the Navy. That‚Äôs why I feel a lot of pride when I put on my uniform and serve.‚Äù

Carrier Corporation is one of the largest and has a presence in over one hundred countries. You can also choose from Daikin Mitsubishi or York. Some of these brands also make unitary products. In addition to these major companies you can find locally-owned air conditioning companies.

Carrier Corporation

Carrier Corporation is a multinational corporation that manufactures heating and air conditioning equipment refrigeration systems and fire and security equipment. Founded in 1895 the company is known worldwide for its quality products. Its products are used in residential and commercial buildings. Its products are designed to improve comfort and efficiency in the home and office as well as in commercial spaces.

In 1990 the company was still privately owned but it became a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC). UTC is an aerospace giant known for its Pratt & Whitney jet engine division. UTC has a global footprint including Carrier. Its Building Systems division which includes the company‚Äôs sister company Otis Elevator Company accounted for 38 percent of UTC‚Äôs revenue in 1991. Today Carrier is a leading HVAC manufacturer with distribution channels in 118 countries.

York International Corp.

York International is an American conglomerate that makes luxury air-conditioning equipment. In 1981 the company was the second-largest air-conditioning maker in the United States. The company also acquired the air-conditioning division of Westinghouse Electric Corp. and in 1985 it considered selling it. In 1984 the company reported an operating profit of $6.5 million but it also had a debt of $60 million about 17 percent of Borg-Warner‚Äôs total. In 1985 York had a loss of $1.2 million and it owed Borg-Warner an additional $60 million.

The company also manufactures air-conditioning heating and refrigeration systems. Its products are used in residential commercial and industrial applications. The company currently has an office in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania but it will expand its business in the Northeast with the help of York International. In addition to its own sales and service operations the company has several joint ventures and alliances.

Daikin

Daikin is a leading Japanese air conditioning company with a history that dates back to 1897. As a manufacturer of luxury air conditioning and refrigeration equipment the company has developed a range of ancillary businesses. It has a successful chemical division that specializes in the manufacture of fluorocarbon gases the basic ingredient of air conditioning coolants. Daikin has also expanded into the manufacturing of oil hydraulic pumps. It has also taken on a broader role in the defense industry providing equipment and explosives to Japan‚Äôs Defense Ministry.

The company began an overseas expansion program in the early 1970s. It initially focused on Japan and its neighbors along the Pacific Rim. The continued success of the company encouraged it to expand into the European market where it set up Daikin Europe N.V. in 1971. This made Daikin the first Japanese air conditioning company to establish a base outside of Japan. It has remained a leader in the industry ever since.

Mitsubishi

Mitsubishi is an electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing company based in Japan. The company was founded in 1921 and is one of the core companies of Mitsubishi Electric. Since then it has grown to be one of the world‚Äôs most trusted brands in air conditioning systems. Listed below are some of the core companies of Mitsubishi.

Mitsubishi Electric offers a variety of residential and light commercial HVAC services. Its products are known for their exceptional quality and long life and can handle virtually any climate. Its HVAC systems can provide comfort in any home environment and are highly efficient which will help you save money in the long run.

Toshiba

When you want to be more comfortable in your home office or vehicle a Toshiba air conditioning company can help. The company has a global presence with facilities in 120 countries including the United States Japan Cine and Thajsk Taiwan and Zivotnem prostredi. The company has also been recognized with several awards for its environmental performance.

The company‚Äôs history dates back to 1899 when it was founded by the Tokyo Electric Company. In 1939 it became one of Japan‚Äôs largest electric companies and subsequently received its official name.

Sanyo

The Sanyo air conditioning company was founded in 1947 in Japan. They manufactured their first air conditioning unit in 1961. Later they purchased Fisher Electronics and began producing air conditioning systems under the brand name Sanyo-Fisher. In 2000 they consolidated all their air conditioning businesses and became Sanyo Electric Air Conditioning Company Ltd. In 2011 they were purchased by Panasonic. They continue to sell their air conditioning solutions worldwide.

The Sanyo air conditioning company has many products on the market. The company started in 1947 in Japan and then expanded into the United States in the 1970s. The company was run by Howard Ladd who was the COO and Executive Vice President of the Sanyo Corporation. After the company was founded it became a multinational corporation and acquired many other companies and products to grow its business. During this period the company suffered several losses but the company managed to recover and has been growing ever since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9pLXRyYXZlbGVkLXVzaW5nLWFuLWVzaW0tZm9yLW15LWlwaG9uZS1hbmQtaGVyZXMtd2h5LXlvdS1zaG91bGQtdG9v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I traveled using an eSIM for my iPhone ‚Äî and here's why you should too,"The freedom to be able to take your phone all over the world and not pop in another physical SIM card to stay tethered to the world is unparalleled. Thanks to eSIMs this reality has been around since 2017 on smartphones ‚Äî but I only just discovered the joy of getting an eSIM connection on my iPhone when I recently traveled to Europe from the US.

I have always faithfully relied on a good old physical SIM card for all my travels up until now. Enabling a physical SIM seemed easy enough and I always carry a little pouch to store my original SIM so I don‚Äôt lose it. Simple I thought.

But after my experience with eSIMs on my iPhone I don‚Äôt think I can ever go back to a regular SIM card while traveling.

For the uninitiated eSIM ‚Äî that's short for embedded subscriber identity module ‚Äî is basically a digital version of the SIM card which can be downloaded on a compatible phone and saves you the hassle of popping out the SIM card tray and popping in a tiny SIM card.

Most recent phones be they iPhone or Android device come with eSIM compatibility.

Traveling with an eSIM

Traveling with an eSIM was an easy-breezy affair. I was set to travel to France and Italy and I had my trusty iPhone XR with me.

There‚Äôs a nifty app that I discovered for downloading the eSIM on my iPhone XR. (More on the app later.) With a few swishes and taps I was all set for my summer travel. As soon as I switched off airplane mode on my iPhone the eSIM was enabled and I had a strong connection. Bonjour Paris!

eSIM will save you the hassle of popping tiny nano SIM cards in and out on your flight where you risk the possibility of losing the tiny things. It will also save you the stress of landing in a new country and buying one of those touristy SIM cards which can prove to be quite costly in certain countries.

It‚Äôs very easy to switch networks with an eSIM and you can have more than one network including having voice and data on different plans. You can usually have up to 5 virtual SIMs depending on the phone you use.

I didn‚Äôt need that many. I bought two connections ‚Äî one each for France and Italy.

eSIM on iPhone

iPhone XR was one of the first iPhones to come enabled with eSIM and using eSIM proved to be a delight. After purchasing my plan I just had to enable everything under Settings > Mobile Data; under ""Data Plans"" I could toggle the plan I wanted to be on or off.

You can also label your plans with different options like ""Business"" or ""Travel"" and then choose which number to use for calls or messages and data too. I custom-labeled mine to know which one to use in which country.

(Image credit: Future)

Now here‚Äôs the best part about getting an eSIM on your iPhone ‚Äî you can opt to make one connection a primary one while turning another connection into your secondary one. This means that you can make calls from one number which will be your default and use the secondary one just for cellular data. This is exactly what I did with texts coming through my primary US number while I used the data from the eSIM I bought.

Using iOS 13 and later you can choose either or both numbers. In fact with iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini you can use Dual SIM with two active eSIMs as well.

(Image credit: Apple)

Dual SIM is there on models before the iPhone 13 family as well but with one nano SIM and one eSIM.

You can also choose to ""Allow cellular data switching"" which will then use cellular data from both plans depending on coverage and availability.

Apple offers eSIM on all their models above iPhone XR and with iOS 12.1 or later. But you cannot use eSIM on an iPhone that is locked to a carrier. (Perhaps a reason to consider one of the best unlocked phones.)

Meet Airalo

Airalo is the app that sprung up the eSIM connection on my iPhone almost instantly. It's a free download on iOS or Android that presents a list of countries and eSIM plans to choose from.

Comparing a basic data plan I found on Airalo with some of the SIM card data plans in Paris I found I had saved around $5 by taking the eSIM 7-day data plan on Airalo (although the SIM card plans did include talk time as well).

Once I purchased the plan on Airalo the app led me step-by-step on how to activate the eSIM. It was through the same steps mentioned above and all I had to do to switch between my France and Italy plan was to tap on ""Turn on this line"" in the settings.

Other apps such as Holafly offer eSim plans too if you prefer to shop around.

Overall I feel this is an underrated technology that is not spoken about enough. The ease of use of eSIMs and travel especially on an iPhone made me a total convert.

In the future all phones might just move to having no physical SIM cards leaving more space for other components such as the battery. For now iOS 16 is all set to make transferring eSIMs very easy just through Bluetooth. Now that the iPhone 14 series is being sold in the US as eSIM-only models here's a detailed guide on how to activate eSIM on your iPhone 14.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mcm9udGllci1haXJsaW5lcy1zcGFjZXgtc3RhcmxpbmstaW5mbGlnaHQtd2lmaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frontier Airlines In Talks With SpaceX Over Starlink Inflight WiFi,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mcm9udGllci1haXJsaW5lcy1zcGFjZXgtc3RhcmxpbmstaW5mbGlnaHQtd2lmaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3N1Yi02Z2h6LXZzLW1td2F2ZS01Zy0zMDUxMjQ2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sub-6GHz 5G is more important than mmWave: What you should know,"Kris Carlon / Android Authority

Similar to previous cellular generations the 5G spectrum is divided into multiple frequency bands. Although this time around 5G aims to use vastly more spectrum than ever before. On the one extreme we have millimeter waves (often referred to as mmWave) and on the other frequencies that lie in the sub-6GHz spectrum. Both are key parts of 5G deployments yet offer vastly different benefits and drawbacks.

In the past you had little choice when picking out 4G capabilities besides gradually improving support for techniques like carrier aggregation. Today inexpensive smartphones offer comparative LTE speeds to more premium devices. Sure your flagship smartphone may boast higher theoretical speeds and newer technologies than a budget option but these seldom translate into more than a few Mbps difference in the real world. With 5G however we now have two distinct frequency ranges that work very differently from one another.

Not all devices support mmWave 5G frequencies and by extension they can‚Äôt all reach the same speeds either. Therefore you need to be a bit more thoughtful about all of this while shopping for a 5G-capable device. Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the difference between mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G technologies. We‚Äôll also discuss whether or not you should prioritize mmWave connectivity for your next smartphone. See also: The best 5G smartphones on sale right now

mmWave vs. sub-6GHz 5G: What‚Äôs the difference?

As the name suggests mmWave represents electromagnetic waves that have extremely short millimeter wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the higher the frequency. So in other words mmWave signals have high frequencies to the tune of 28 to 100GHz. Contrast that range to 4G LTE or even lower band 5G and you‚Äôll find that most existing frequency bands today barely exceed 5GHz.

There‚Äôs an important reason for all of this. Higher frequency signals are capable of carrying more data which directly translates to more bandwidth and faster network speeds. For some context mmWave 5G devices can offer maximum speeds of around 4-5Gbps although real-world consumer speeds are often lower. Still mmWave can be faster than most wired fiber broadband connections. By comparison the best sub-6GHz connections can hit a few hundred Mbps although tens of Mbps is often more realistic.

mmWave 5G promises impressive data speeds well in excess of most broadband connections.

However the downside of mmWave signals is that they‚Äôre significantly more susceptible to losses when passing through obstacles. In reality you might only see a few hundred megabits per second unless you have a direct line of sight with a mmWave cell tower. This is where lower frequency 5G bands come in. These lie in the range of 1 to 6GHz and are often referred to as sub-6GHz 5G

Sub-6GHz 5G bands occupy similar frequency ranges as previous generations so they‚Äôre not as much of a departure as mmWave 5G. While the frequencies themselves only offer a small improvement in terms of speed over LTE more spectrum with sub-6GHz means more bandwidth and faster user speeds. In addition these lower frequency signals retain the ability to better penetrate obstacles.

Given the proximity to existing LTE bands as well as some carriers repurposing bands for 5G sub-6GHz spectrum is the most commonly used as the backbone of global 5G deployments. The n78 band ‚Äî at 3.5GHz ‚Äî is one of the most popular 5G frequencies in use worldwide. Admittedly you won‚Äôt get chart-topping speeds because it falls in the sub-6GHz spectrum but it will help offer better coverage and a stronger signal. Similarly the n41 band is also pretty popular. It‚Äôs the same 2.5GHz frequency that carriers have used for 4G and 3G deployments in the past and T-Mobile has repurposed it from LTE to 5G Standalone use in the US.

What speeds can I expect from mmWave 5G?

Kris Carlon / Android Authority

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to live in the vicinity of a mmWave 5G tower you‚Äôll be happy to know that download speeds can top out and even exceed 1Gb/s. That‚Äôs much faster than most broadband connections! However this figure only represents a best-case scenario. As we alluded to earlier virtually any obstruction between you and the tower will have a negative impact on download and upload speeds. When using mmWave 5G on the go expect signal strength and network speeds to fluctuate heavily depending on your proximity to the nearest broadcasting tower.

If you live in a smaller city or town chances are that you‚Äôll only have sub-6GHz 5G service. In the US carriers have only deployed mmWave 5G in dense urban environments so far. You can check your carrier‚Äôs website for mmWave coverage check below for carrier-specific links. Low-band 5G tends to offer only marginally better speeds than the average LTE connection in the range of 100-200Mb/s. That said sub-6GHz 5G does still provide numerous other benefits over 4G like better network capacity and consistency.

Does my carrier use mmWave 5G? To find out if you have mmWave 5G service near you check out your carrier‚Äôs coverage map: Verizon : Verizon calls its mmWave implementation ‚Äú5G Ultra Wideband‚Äù and offers it in most US cities. ‚Äú5G Nationwide‚Äù meanwhile refers to the company‚Äôs sub-6GHz 5G service.

What‚Äôs the problem with mmWave 5G?

The race to reach higher frequencies has already been heating up in other wireless industries for several years now. Yet time and time again we‚Äôve found that higher frequencies aren‚Äôt universally better.

Take Wi-Fi for example. Most routers today are capable of broadcasting at both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. As you‚Äôd expect the former is great for range. 5GHz signals accomplish significantly higher transfer speeds but cannot penetrate walls as easily. Your devices typically switch between the two bands automatically depending on the signal strength and other factors. See also: The definitive guide to Wi-Fi standards

60GHz Wi-Fi already demonstrated that higher frequencies are not always practical in the real world.

While the Wi-Fi industry has experimented with higher frequencies like 60GHz it wasn‚Äôt found to be practical outside of niche use-cases. With the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard operating in the 6GHz band we‚Äôve realized that incremental increases are better than giant leaps at the cost of practicality.

All of this isn‚Äôt entirely unlike mmWave in the cellular industry which promises to deliver unprecedented speeds that we‚Äôve all subtly associated with 5G by now. However for anyone living a reasonable distance away from a mobile tower there‚Äôs little chance that mmWave signals will reach them due to the heightened probability of transmission loss.

Sub-6GHz 5G is essential for blanket coverage and bandwidth while mmWave offers higher speeds over shorter distances.

As such mmWave deployments are limited to short distances such as a few streets and areas that benefit most from extreme high bandwidth such as stadiums and city centers. mmWave requires multiple tower placements to cover a wider area which isn‚Äôt cheap. Sub-6GHz and low band by comparison offer far better blanket coverage and therefore form the essential backbone for improving 5G network speeds for most consumers.

When will mmWave 5G become more widely available?

Delivering mmWave signals far and wide will require operators to build out more extensive and denser infrastructure than ever before. As you probably already know by now that‚Äôs simply not a reality yet. Even setting aside the high costs we‚Äôre yet to see use cases that demand much faster 5G data transmission than public broadband connections either. At least not yet. Read more: Which US cities have 5G coverage today?

It may take years for such infrastructure to materialize outside of the largest cities in your country. Despite that telecom operators in some countries like the US have been trying to push mmWave for years now. As we mentioned sub-6GHz is a smaller step up from 4G LTE and offers broader coverage making it the faster and more affordable option for carriers starting their 5G deployments.

Only a handful of countries have active deployments of mmWave 5G. Most carriers outside the US have opted for sub-6GHz only.

There are only a handful of countries that have active mmWave deployments at the moment. While the US Japan South Korea Australia and Singapore all have 5G networks keep in mind that mmWave is usually only available in certain cities or neighborhoods. Sub-6GHz 5G on the other hand is much more widely available both locally and globally.

Which phones skip mmWave 5G?

If you consult spec sheets often you‚Äôll know that smartphone features regularly differ from one region to the next. This is true for 5G compatibility as well. The Pixel 6 Pro for example only includes mmWave 5G support in the US Australia and Japan. Other countries including Canada and most of Europe get a different model that is limited to sub-6GHz 5G.

The Google Pixel 6 on the other hand is sold in two configurations in the US ‚Äî an unlocked version with sub-6GHz 5G for $599 and the other with mmWave 5G for $699. The latter is offered through carriers such as Verizon and AT&T. This price bump can be attributed to mmWave implementations requiring specialized radio hardware and antennas.

Smartphone manufacturers usually include mmWave hardware and antennas in region and carrier-specific models.

In the US and other key mmWave markets premium devices like the Galaxy S22 series and iPhone 14 almost always include support for mmWave 5G. But other markets may only sell a sub-6GHz model. As for lower-end devices you may find carrier-specific models with mmWave support but be prepared to pay extra.

Should you buy a sub-6GHz or mmWave 5G smartphone?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Whether or not you should pay the price premium for mmWave depends on your use case and whether you live in a densely populated area that actually offers mmWave coverage. Concerts and sporting events for example are infamous for inducing network congestion in traditional cell phone networks. mmWave 5G could definitely help in these scenarios. Before you buy be sure to consult your carrier‚Äôs 5G coverage map to make sure you will receive a 5G mmWave connection in your area.

Beyond just faster speeds mmWave 5G has the potential to alleviate network congestion in densely packed areas like cities sporting events and concerts.

Outside of the aforementioned mmWave markets though most manufacturers have only adopted sub-6GHz bands for their 5G devices. Most of Europe for example has next to zero mmWave coverage at the moment. To that end most smartphones available in the region will not feature support for higher frequencies anyway. It‚Äôs certainly not worth importing a mmWave handset for futureproofing either as there‚Äôs no guarantee it will support future local mmWave carrier bands.

While many countries have held auctions for the mmWave spectrum of late the actual rollout will likely still take several years. Regardless though outside of a handful of applications sub-6GHz should serve most of us well enough for the foreseeable future. Now that you‚Äôre up to speed on the differences between the different types of 5G deployments worldwide consider checking out our comprehensive guide to 5G. It explores how the new standard differs from previous generations and discusses the technology‚Äôs real-world implications in the years to come.

Chris Chmiel founder of the festival and Athens county commissioner spends his whole year preparing for the weekend-long event.

‚ÄúFor me it's like climbing a mountain every year‚Äù said Chmiel. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like the biggest part of my life really. (It‚Äôs) kinda stressful but kinda worth the stress ultimately.‚Äù

One of the recent changes to the festival is a transition of fiscal agents. Chmiel said a new non-profit was created for the festival: the Native Foods Education Organization. The current goal of the organization is to keep the festival going; though Chmiel said it could take on new projects in the future.

‚ÄúLuckily we‚Äôre blessed with a really great team‚Äù Chmiel said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got people who have been with the festival for like fourteen years ‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôve got a really solid group.‚Äù

Over the years more educational tents have emerged. This year tents included subjects like heritage sustainable living Ohio County Fair holistic health pollinators and of course pawpaws.

The pollinator tent included Wild Ones a group with the aspiration to encourage environmentally-friendly landscaping a plant nursery called Natives in Harmony and Kevin ‚ÄúKC‚Äù Clark ‚Äúthe Caterpillar Guy‚Äù

Clark wearing a black ‚ÄúGot moths?‚Äù t-shirt held four green caterpillars dawdling in the palm of his hand. Clark said his interest in insects was born in 1969 when a neighbor showed him how to raise caterpillars.

‚ÄúYou have to have the right habitat you have to have the right other insects‚Äù said Clark. ‚ÄúThose caterpillars depend on ants it‚Äôs a mutualistic relationship.‚Äù

Now Clark brings caterpillars to different schools and groups to educate children about caterpillars moths and butterflies.

James Hunt from Akron Ohio came to the Pawpaw Festival for his second year. Hunt and his family were encouraged to attend last year‚Äôs festival by their neighbors.

‚ÄúClean facilities great for the kids slept well‚Äù said Hunt. ‚ÄúFresh air nice activities for the kids inside great music and we love the bubble guy.""

Though Hunt and his family had only attended one Pawpaw Festival previously and they were glad to return.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had a vacation in like four years because of COVID‚Äù said Hunt. ‚ÄúThis is our only time off and we chose to do this.‚Äù

ARTS/West a local Athens arts center often attends Pawpaw Festival but this year for the first time they have something to sell.

Carter Rice program specialist at ARTS/West and self-identified tie-dye aficionado united his love for tie-dye and his work at ARTS/West. With encouragement from his boss Rice started selling clothes he tie-dyed some with an ARTS/West print at the Nelsonville Music Festival.

A new reclaiming aspect of the tie-dye is incorporating acid mine drainage into the dye. The process is similar to normal tie-dye but with the addition of soda ash to brighten the colors.

‚ÄúAll of the things that we're doing are Appalachian-based‚Äù said Rice. ‚ÄúThe items we have received from UpCycle are all from the region the acid mine drainage is from Appalachia. And I would consider myself an Appalachian artist because I‚Äôm from West Virginia.‚Äù

This year was Rice‚Äôs first Pawpaw Festival. At the Nelsonville Music Festival Rice tried a pawpaw for the first time on a nature walk with TikTok‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlack Forger‚Äù Alexis Nikole Nelson.

‚ÄúNow that I‚Äôve seen it I probably will always return‚Äù said Rice.

He tellsabout wonders in the Himalayas I am a biologist and I can see the Himalayas like most mountains in the world witnessing unprecedented change now. This includes climate impacts and biodiversity decline driven by social and economic factors. Understanding these crises and engaging policy makers and the public to adopt mitigations forms the core of my research. This work is interdisciplinary and involves ATREE the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment which I founded 25 years ago located in the Himalayas and Bengaluru.Flowering pink rhododendrons frame icy Himalayan vistas. Photo courtesy: iStockI‚Äôve researched biodiversity in the Himalayas mapped deforestation and land use changes tracked climate change with satellite imagery studied local perceptions of climate events and initiated projects to diversify agricultural systems which can support biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods. The Himalayas are the highest mountains in the world ‚Äî and the youngest on Earth. They are 40 million years old compared to the Andes which are 60 million years and the even older Alps. The Himalayas were formed when a piece of a huge land mass called the Indian Plate broke away from the African Plate and began moving northwards colliding with the Asian Plate ‚Äî this collision resulted in the uplift of these mountains. With their altitudinal and climatic factors they hold a complex topography a vast amount of ice as glaciers and huge biodiversity.: A fire-tailed sunbird which is an important pollinator of rhododendrons sits amidst Rhododendron glaucophyllum. Photo Courtesy: ATREE via K. BawaIndeed about two-thirds of India‚Äôs biodiversity is found in the Himalayas. I‚Äôve seen flowering rhododendrons covering the whole mountainside in reds and pinks primulas in the valleys carpeting entire forest floors the efflorescent flowers of the six-foot-tall Sikkim rhubarb found at 15000 feet caterpillar fungus (which is half-fungus half-insect) that occurs above 4000 metres and plant pollination at 5000 metres. At heights where you can barely breathe there are incredible biotic interactions that inspired me to write ‚ÄòHimalaya: Mountains of Life‚Äô. The diversity of just its plants ‚Äî over 100 species of rhododendrons are found there ‚Äî is fascinating. But now we face the loss of this tremendous treasure.This biodiversity evolved over millions of years but is being devastated within a few decades. The Anthropocene is impacting the Himalayas severely in terms of water climate and the richness of life. The Himalayas with their huge ice resources are termed the ‚Äòwater tower‚Äô of Asia the source of its largest rivers which support over a billion people. These rivers also carry sediments which flow through the plains providing nutrients and minerals that sustain agriculture in the lowlands. Mountains for millennia a source of spiritual and sacred enrichment prove how we live in an interconnected world ‚Äî what happens in a faraway Himalayan watershed will affect us all. These ranges confront challenges from population expansion to unplanned construction infrastructure development deforestation new roads and unchecked tourism bearing the gifts of littering.The Himalayas hold over 15 species of the delicate Impatiens plant including the magenta Impatiens glandulifera (Top) and the golden Impatiens stenentha (below). Photos Courtesy: ATREE via K. BawaThese are all impacting natural habitats and exacerbating climate effects. We have to urgently recognise the need for sustainable development where growth conservation and equity are compatible and which can save millions of lives from impending disasters. I owe the Himalayas much as they changed my life. Over 60 years ago as a young graduate student I took a ride in the toy train from Siliguri to Darjeeling. Raised in Punjab with relatively little biodiversity I was amazed as the train began to rise from the foothills. I saw an abundance of life I‚Äôd never imagined existed on Earth ‚Äî almost every tree came from a different species. The slow-moving train would stop frequently and I could see glorious butterflies of many colours hear birds with wondrous diverse calls. I thought I was in a paradise. I would not want to see this paradise lost. The mountains have given us so much. We need to give the Himalayas our love and care now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcmFpbi1tYWcuY29tL2NvbGxpbmEtc3RyYWRhLXNwcmluZy1zdW1tZXItMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collina Strada spring summer 2023,"Rain Magazine stands at the forefront of fashion interweaving the dynamic worlds of music culture and art.

Real estate firm CBRE says Canadian hotels will return to pre-pandemic revenues next year two years ahead of its previous forecast.

The firm is projecting the Canadian hotels market will end this year at 92 per cent of the revenue per available room achieved in 2019 before the health crisis began.

It is forecasting moderate revenue growth will continue into 2023 as hotel operators push for higher room rates and projects revenue per available room will hit $107 next year.

Revenue per available room is a measure of a hotel‚Äôs performance calculated by multiplying its average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.

The $107 rate CBRE foresees will amount to a 70 per cent increase from the industry‚Äôs 2021 performance which was hampered by health and travel restrictions meant to quell COVID-19 cases.

CBRE is also projecting half of the major urban markets in Canada are expected to see a revenue per available room above $100 in 2023 with Vancouver reaching $182 Montreal at $135 and Toronto hitting $129.

‚ÄúStrong leisure travel and a rapid rebound in the average daily rate in many cities is producing a strong hotel performance. Overnight visits from the U.S. continue to recover along with visitation from other key international markets‚Äù said David Ferguson CBRE‚Äôs hotels director in a news release.

‚ÄúHowever travel from some key markets notably the Asia/Pacific region is still challenged. Cities and hotels that serve corporate travel meetings and group travel face a slower recovery.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiZXJkZWVubGl2ZS5uZXdzL25ld3MvYWJlcmRlZW4tbmV3cy9hYmVyZGVlbi1zZXJ2aWNlLXN0YXRpb24tcmV2YW1wLXN0YXJ0aW5nLTc1OTc4NDDSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmVyZGVlbmxpdmUubmV3cy9uZXdzL2FiZXJkZWVuLW5ld3MvYWJlcmRlZW4tc2VydmljZS1zdGF0aW9uLXJldmFtcC1zdGFydGluZy03NTk3ODQwLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aberdeen service station revamp 'starting to take shape' as grand opening around the corner,"An Aberdeen service station that is currently undergoing refurbishment is underway as progress is ""starting to take shape"".

The service station located on Springfield Road approximately two miles west of Aberdeen city centre has been taken over by leading real estate advisor CBRE on a 20-year lease.

It comprises 3186 sq ft of retail space and has over 30 parking spaces.

CBRE‚Äôs Aberdeen office worked in collaboration with the firm‚Äôs Roadside and Automotive team to secure Ascona and it will be the group‚Äôs first site in Scotland and their 63rd site in the UK.

Derren McRae Head of CBRE Aberdeen previously said: ""We are pleased to announce that Ascona Group has selected Springfield Road service station for its first operation in Scotland with plans to transform the site into a BP filling station and Nisa convenience store.

""The company picked a prime west end location in the city with it benefitting not only from the custom of drivers but also from ‚Äòwalk in‚Äô trade from the surrounding popular residential area. The transaction also provided a great opportunity to work together with our specialist colleagues in the Roadside and Automotive team.""

The new petrol station is set to include BP branded fuel a Nisa convenience store Greggs Starbucks Coffee a full range of eat now and take-home groceries chilled snacks and drinks alcohol and more.

Pictures published by Ascona show the station in its final stages of work as the exterior for Nisa and Greggs appear to be almost complete.

It is planned to open on Thursday September 22 but could potentially open the day before depending on the arrival of stock and facilities over the national mourning period.

Further updates on the new petrol station can be found on their Facebook here.

It has been so for many years but the 2022 X1 Carbon Gen10 pushes the limits. It comes with new display options and the Intel Gen12 processors that have a significantly higher core count than last year‚Äôs models. Let‚Äôs put it to the test!

Configurations

Our unit came with the following specifications: Intel i7-1260P 16GB of RAM 512GB SSD (Samsung MZVL2512HCJQ-00BL7) with a 1900√ó200 500 NITs touch display with a Windows Hello IR webcam and the ThinkPad Privacy Guard. It costs 2269 at CDW but check Lenovo.com for potential deals.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 configuration is highly flexible and comes in many different variants. The nine CPU options range from the Core i5-1235U (10+8 cores) to the Core i7-1280P (14+8 cores) Intel 12th generation mobile P-series processor. That said all of them are equipped with the Intel Iris Xe Graphics integrated into the CPU.

The primary processor is paired with 8/16/32 GB of LPDDR5-2000 RAM soldered to the motherboard. 16GB should work well for most people and if you need 32GB we‚Äôll trust that you know why. Storage options are 256/512/1024 and 2048GB of SSD over PCIe 4.0 (vs. 3.0 previously).

Fortunately the SSD drive is easily accessible by removing some screws that retain the bottom cover. Users can therefore change/upgrade it easily.

Design

Lenovo has kept the overall ThinkPad X1 Carbon design similar to last year‚Äôs. There are changes from the Gen 9 model but the overall theme and chassis are similar enough that you would have difficulty discerning the two from a distance.

The ratio between its weight of 2.48 Lbs (1.12Kh) and the system performance (more on that later) is one of the many reasons the Thinkpad X1 Carbon is so popular. This exceptionally light weight comes from its carbon fiber and magnesium construction.

Less glamorous but just as important Lenovo uses much more recycled materials (including plastic) than before. Even the packaging is made of 90% recycled or sustainable materials.

When paired with its durability (spill-resistant keyboard MIL-STD-810H certification) it has always been a tough act to beat and that‚Äôs still true for this 10th generation. And finally if you add the hardware + software security and the physical security (nano-Kensington port multi-layered BIOS security) it‚Äôs easy to see why it is a favorite choice for enterprises.

Keyboard / Trackpad

The keyboard has a typical ThinkPad layout (including the Fn key at the lower left) and while the key-travel depth is not as deep as on larger ThinkPads the general feel is familiar and comfortable. Lenovo has been highly consistent with this over the years and we‚Äôre tempted to have standalone ThinkPad keyboard reviews as references.

As we said the keyboard is spill-resistant and has two levels of backlighting to keep it readable in dim lighting conditions. This keyboard is also designed to utilize the keys as ‚Äúair intake‚Äù to cool the computer. It‚Äôs a great idea.

The glass trackpad is 56 x 110 mm (2.20 x 4.33 inches) large and ultra-smooth. Some surface is taken by the three physical buttons (Linux-friendly) and we think it‚Äôs well worth it. Alternatively it‚Äôs also a click pad so you can mouse-click directly by pressing the trackpad.

Ports

The laptop‚Äôs chassis is thick enough to have the essential full-size ports and therefore avoid the need for dongles in most cases. There are two USB-A (full-size) 3.2 Gen1 and two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 (40 Gbit/s Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4a) are the best way to connect to a dock and connect external displays to this computer.

The full-size HDMI (4K/60) port is tremendously helpful for frequent presenters who might need to connect to projectors without fear of forgetting/losing the dongle/adapter‚Äîwhat a great assortment of ports.

Given the theft these days the Kengsington nano-security port seems to be a must-have in some urban areas and thieves might move on to an easier target. It‚Äôs also a source of peace of mind when leaving the laptop at your temporary office desk during lunch hour.

Audio Quality

The sound quality is high. Watching movies or TV shows is enjoyable as voices are clear (also valid for video conferences). The sound is loud enough but getting more bass would have been nice. The bass level is expected for this type of ultralight computer so it‚Äôs hard to complain.

Heavy travelers are more likely to use headphones which would bring better spatialization while keeping things quiet for hotel room neighbors.

Display

Lenovo proposes up to seven different 14-inch display 16:10 configurations. Going from a standard WUXGA (1920√ó1200) resolution with 400 Nits brightness to a 4K WQUXGA (3840√ó2400) touch screen with superior color accuracy.

One of the most exciting display options is the 2.8K (2880√ó1800) OLED which is HDR-capable at 500 NITs of brightness. The maximum brightness level requires HDR content but we typically prefer OLED for multimedia applications. For professional creative work IPS LCD might have slightly more accurate colors.

Our unit has a 1920√ó1200 touchscreen display with excellent brightness (500 NITs) and color accuracy (100% sRGB 1.3 Delta-E). It works great for light creative work (Photo editing Web Dev) and we don‚Äôt feel like we need more for what we do. However Lenovo has many fancier options like 4K HDR400.

The display reclines at 180-degree so you can lay it completely flat on a table which could be convenient if you do something with the touchscreen or are presenting to someone sitting on the opposite side of a table. And yes you can open the lid with one finger.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon can handle four independent displays (native + 3 external) thanks to Thunderbolt (5K/60) and HDMI (4K/60).

Webcam

Our camera is the FHD 1080p with an IR (infrared) webcam and electronic privacy shutter but Lenovo also has more affordable 720p options.

The 1080p camera performs noticeably better than previous 720p Lenovo laptop webcams in terms of details and noise. We highly recommend getting the best camera specs if you frequently are on video calls.

Lenovo also has software camera features that will put the laptop in a low-power state if you go away from the computer. The IR camera makes logging in fast and easy despite using a very strong password.

System performance

As expected with Intel‚Äôs 12th generation processors the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon does really well in raw CPU performance with nearly 50% higher multicore performance (Geekbench Cinebench) compared to last year‚Äôs X1 Carbon. The performance jump comes even though this CPU is a low-wattage model optimized for power efficiency rather than pure speed.

Graphics applications run well too and popular games like Fortnite or Doom Eternal can still run at 30FPS (medium settings) and are playable. However you need realistic expectations as there‚Äôs no discrete graphics processor (GPU). Lenovo has other laptops if you need that kind of graphics power.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon doesn‚Äôt get crazy hot. Surfaces typically start getting uncomfortable at 44 degrees C and this computer‚Äôs hottest spots would be about ~48C hot when under stress which is not that much.

The system self-regulates performance to prevent excessive heat buildup. The fans aren‚Äôt noisy and looking at the exhaust system. It‚Äôs clear that the computer is optimized for quiet office productivity and light creative work.

From a networking point of view this new model has WiFi-6E (vs. WiFi-6 before) and optional 5G or 4G connectivity which ensures always-on connectivity and additional security as you‚Äôre avoiding WiFi hotspots.

Finally the SSD performance has significantly improved since last year with some of the highest numbers in this category ‚Äì see the chart below for year-to-year comparisons.

X1 Carbon Gen 10 Battery Life

The 57 Wh Li-Polymer battery has not changed since last year and this capacity is serious for this category. As expected the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen10 shows outstanding endurance and can play video for more than 11 hours. Local video playback is often a good battery life proxy for light productivity tasks.

Note that higher resolution displays will drain the battery faster and you can also opt for a U-Series Intel CPU which is even less power-hungry (down to the Core i5-1235U).

The charge speed is just as good as before (0.76Wh/mn) and we have not seen any changes. The charger remains a compact 65W model from Lenovo.

Conclusion

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 has a solid ultralight performance and it‚Äôs not surprising that it remains one of the most popular 14‚Ä≥ for Enterprises. We‚Äôve recently seen it being offered by default to employees along with the Macbook Pro. That‚Äôs a great place to be.

It comes in many different configurations that make it efficient for many usage models going from basic office productivity to light creative work and development.

Consumers might find the same type of performance characteristics for a smaller budget in the Yoga line of products but they don‚Äôt come with the security management and durability the ThinkPads enjoy so yes there‚Äôs a price gap but there‚Äôs a real value associated with it.

Why buy this laptop?

The performance/weight ratio security options and durability sets the ThinkPad X1 carbon apart from other ultralights. Your IT department will like its vPro remote management and security features. Perhaps accounting might look twice because of the price though.

Potential competitors

Data shows users considering this laptop also look at the following computers (in this order): The ThinkPad T14 Apple MacBook Pro Dell XPS 13 / 13 Plus ThinkPad P1 and Yoga 9i. In our opinion the ThinkPad T14 isn‚Äôt an ultralight competitor but offers the same security and durability.

The XPS 13 is more compact because it has a 13.5‚Äù display but is heavier with a slightly smaller battery. The Yoga 9i is a powerful consumer product and won‚Äôt have the same level of security and durability.

Finally the MacBook Pro is an excellent enterprise computer but that choice is driven by the Max/Windows choice and the hardware is secondary. If you‚Äôre a Windows user we recommend the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10.

In 2015 Minneapolis resident DeCourcy Squire shut off the gas to her Stevens Square condo stopped paying the Houston based gas conglomerate CenterPoint Energy (CPE) and began using alternative energy to power her home. She had been a tax resister ever since the Vietnam War and after becoming involved with the grassroots group MN350 working to oppose the Line 3 Dakota Access Pipeline she could not in good conscience contribute to the gas company any longer.

Squire told Unicorn Riot that she first learned about Michels Corporation while protesting Line 3 but didn‚Äôt realize they had an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy until recently.

‚ÄúPushing for corporate divestment is very important but I think personal divestment is also a small step towards an alternative future‚Äù Squire said not just referring to alternative energy but also alternative politics free of corporate influence.

The Michels Corporation including its subsidiaries Michels Pipeline Inc Michels Power Inc. Michels Construction Inc. Michels Utility Services Inc. Michels Trenchless Inc. Michels Road and Stone Inc. and Michels Pacific Energy Inc. has become one of the largest utility contractors in North America. Many Twin Cities activists first became aware of them through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction as reported by Unicorn Riot.

Michels currently has three offices in Minnesota their newest being the Brooklyn Park office which opened in 2017 adding to its Lakeville and Rogers sites. According to Michels website their goal is to expand service capabilities in the Midwest.

CenterPoint Energy‚Äôs website lists 27 active projects within Minneapolis alone including Minnehaha Hiawatha Fulton Kenwood and Jordan neighborhoods all using Michels Corporation.

Michels Corp. and Michels Pipeline Construction have involvement in several special interest groups especially three main lobby associations ‚Äî Wisconsin Transportation Building Association Transportation Development Association and Construction Business Group all with the primary aim to increase state transportation funds allowing for more public contract money to flow directly to the Michels Corporation.

In the 2022 election cycle individual employees and immediate family members of Michels Corporation have donated an accumulated $46142 to campaigns with the Republican National Convention (RNC) being the largest recipient of $20000 according to the research group OpenSecrets a national organization that tracks money in elections and its effects on public policy. This amount is far lower than the $134905 the RNC received from Michels affiliates in the 2020 election cycle. Recent campaign donations to Republican congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden and U.S. Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin has also been tracked to individuals from the Michels Corporation in the amounts of $17399 and $4650 respectively.

Wisconsin Right Now a conservative news outlet found that Michels‚Äô involvement in special interest groups with Michels executives serving in lieu of himself has helped the company acquire nearly 1.2 billion dollars in contracts with the state of Wisconsin implying public-private profiteering. The Minneapolis based news site Southwest Voices reported that Michels Corp. has $12.7 million in contracts with the City of Minneapolis since the start of 2020 alone.

While there is no official tie to Michels personally lobbying for increased gas taxes higher registration fees and blocking tax exemptions on gas and diesel fuel sold to school districts it is clear that special interest groups Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association which Michels served as Board President and the Transportation Development Association where Michels served on the executive board have contributed financially to groups fighting to increase the gas tax.

Both the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that if Tim Michels wins the Wisconsin governorship he said he will divest from the Michels Corporation leaving his two brothers in charge. Regardless if Michels becomes Wisconsin‚Äôs next governor his family company and special interest groups will have one of their own at the helm of decisionmaking on government contracts and public utilities spending.

Michels admittedly said that he wants his family to continue seeking state-wide contracts despite obvious political conflicts of interest. The company‚Äôs contracts in just the last five years from the state of Wisconsin exceed $660 million in payments.

Tim Michels‚Äô Right-Wing Gubernatorial Campaign

In 2021 Michels announced his candidacy for governor of Wisconsin. But Wisconsin residents have challenged Michels‚Äô residency pointing to his East Coast homes where he lives much of the year including his seventeen-million-dollar mansion in Connecticut and luxury penthouse on New York City‚Äôs Upper East Side.

Screenshot of Tim Michels from his gubernatorial campaign ad called Tear Down.

In June 2022 former President Trump endorsed Michels who has supported the ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù that Trump won the 2020 election and has suggested he will work to overturn the state‚Äôs 2020 election results if he wins in November. He vowed to abolish the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission which administers and enforces state election laws. Additionally Michels has doubled down in recent cultural wars committing to fight so-called ‚Äòcritical race theory‚Äô (CRT) being taught in public schools abortion and more.

Michels has been outspoken about his anti-abortion stance and says he‚Äôd ban abortion and emergency contraceptives if elected Wisconsin governor. ‚ÄúI believe God is unhappy with the country that allows for the killing of babies‚Äù he said at an event in Calumet County WI.

Polls throughout 2022 consistently had former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch ahead as the favorite in the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial primary by a comfortable margin. Kleefisch is supported by her former boss the past GOP rising star former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. However Michels won the Republican primary on August 9 the day after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago with 47% of the vote beating Kleefisch by five points.

Residents React to the Minneapolis ‚Äì Michels Connection

Residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin are concerned about Michels Corp.‚Äôs ongoing government contracts and its exclusive partnership with CenterPoint Energy which holds a monopoly on natural gas in the Twin Cities. These concerns are becoming intensified now as they become aware of their unwitting contribution to Michels‚Äô campaign.

‚ÄúI wonder if I‚Äôm paying for this unnecessary MPD protection & supporting Tim Michels for governor through my CenterPoint bill or directly to MPD with my property taxes?‚Äù Nikki Carlson who uses the handle @M_Nikki_dUrso tweeted.

Carlson who is a North Minneapolis resident took to Twitter on July 13 to share her encounter with a Michels worker. She observed what she believed was an ineffective use of Minneapolis law enforcement.

‚ÄúI asked the Michels guy why there are so many police squads there. He said to guard their employees while working in ‚Äòthe ghetto.‚Äô‚Äù

He explained MPD protection was a condition of their contract. He said ‚Äúghetto‚Äù to my face.



FYI the contractor replacing the gas lines Michels Construction is based in Wisconsin. Their owner Tim Michels is a right-wing candidate for governor of WI.



/2 ‚Äî Domestic Infant Supply ‚Äô65 (@M_Nikki_dUrso) July 13 2022

North Minneapolis is the historic Black section of the city that has been over-policed and under-resourced for generations activists say.

The Michels‚Äô worker told Carlson that police protection was a condition of their contract. However Michels has been seen working in other parts of the city by residents without police protection.

One person tweeted that Michels‚Äô staff vehicles have far-right bumper stickers on them that make residents feel ‚Äúvery uneasy.‚Äù

Minneapolis residents have also raised concerns about Michels‚Äô hiring practices and worry that the company apparently doesn‚Äôt hire Black people. ‚ÄúWHY is this co. laying pipe in N. Mpls & putting their workers from Wright County in hotels when we have qualified people right here?‚Äù Carlson tweeted.

Minneapolis City Council President Andrea Jenkins has expressed these same concerns in emails. ‚ÄúI share many of the concerns you‚Äôve identified and have brought these issues up with CenterPoint Energy many times‚Ä¶While it is true that our utilities payments support the Michels company no taxpayer dollars support this in fact the utility companies have to pay for permits to the city to do the work.‚Äù

However Michels Corp. has several contracts with the city‚Äôs Public Works Department paid by Minneapolis taxpayers which was reported last month by Southwest Voices.

Although Minneapolis police (MPD) are providing security for Michels while they do work in North Minneapolis cops are being privately paid through its contract with CPE Council Member Jenkins said.

MPD is allowed to wear their city uniforms and drive taxpayer-funded squad cars while working off-duty security jobs for private companies.

However Fox 9 recently found MPD protecting Target and Michels construction crews during their regular shift. ‚ÄúDuring those day shifts Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites.‚Äù

Yup. Not hard to find‚Ä¶ https://t.co/X7SwWAY5XQ pic.twitter.com/VZyoEi2vKC ‚Äî Dimitri Drekonja (@Ddrekonja) September 15 2022

Carlson tweeted that a drunk cop working security for Michels aggressively confronted her and implied that they are indeed being paid by taxpayers. ‚ÄúAngry intoxicated MPD officer just told me it isn‚Äôt about preserving police resources to focus on violent crime it‚Äôs about OVERTIME pay for light duty & I need to STFU. (& everyone but me knows this).‚Äù She reacted ‚ÄúI was naive thinking the objective was public safety.‚Äù

MPD is said to inform contractors in construction when and if they need protection according to a source.

Jenkins added ‚ÄúTo be clear I find the response of the Michels employee to the Northside resident‚Äôs question to be despicable Michels needs to create a more diverse workforce that reflects the communities they serve.‚Äù However the city council president made no commitment to take any action.

One resident who uses the handle @JenAntila tweeted that when their sewer line failed over a decade ago a city public works employee gave them a list of city approved sewer line contractors and said ‚Äú‚ÄòI can‚Äôt recommend anyone but my pen slipped‚Äô Michels was circled. I hired them.‚Äù

Screenshot from Twitter

@JenAntila told Unicorn Riot that it was mid January when her sewer line failed and that Michels did a good job repairing it. But she also regrets her decision after discovering the politics of the company. ‚ÄúI just hate knowing what an a-hole [Tim] Michels is and knowing how much the city and & constituents (like me) bankroll him and have for decades.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese are the same a$$holes that last summer were tearing up forests wet lands & waters in Northern MN to put in another Enbridge pipeline‚Äù tweeted another.

Residents noted the irony of Minneapolis cops calling the city dangerous while the same officers are being used to protect private companies rather than protecting the public.

‚ÄúThese police officers care more about protecting out-of-towners from imaginary danger than protecting their own citizens from real danger‚Äù one user tweeted.

Also residents claim that police have intentionally made the city more dangerous by slowing down their work and threatening not to exit their squad cars while patrolling.

‚ÄúAnd they say they don‚Äôt have staff to patrol/have a constant presence in Dinkytown at night‚Äù tweeted another.

As Trump-endorsed Republican Tim Michels solidifies his conservative ideologies in Wisconsin‚Äôs gubernatorial race it remains unclear to Minneapolis residents just how much they are funding his right-wing campaign steeped in anti-democracy rhetoric simply by paying taxes and their monthly gas bill.

‚ÄúMinnesota‚Äôs energy dollars are supporting a candidate for governor of Wisconsin that wants to ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. He opposes same-sex marriage and all LGBQT rights. Is that what we want? I know I don‚Äôt‚Äù Carlson told Unicorn Riot.

While the exact dollar amount coming from Minneapolis residents into Michels‚Äô campaign cannot be estimated it is apparent that Tim Michels is profiteering from his company‚Äôs contracts with the City of Minneapolis Public Works Department and its exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy helping fund his race ‚Äî with Michels being the largest donor to his campaign at $11940882.25 of the $12 million raised.

Nathaniel Guthrie who goes by the Twitter handle @WoodGhuthriempls suggested boycotting CPE. ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúImagine that Centerpoint energy supports racists. We can‚Äôt be shocked that the cops do but this open cowardice and racism from Michels corporation should be stressed to center point.‚Äù Adding ‚ÄúBe a shame if we all here in ‚Äòthe ghetto‚Äô stopped paying them en masse.‚Äù

Screenshot from Twitter

Unicorn Riot called and emailed several people at CenterPoint Energy for this story. When we asked CenterPoint Energy‚Äôs Director of Communications in Minneapolis Hannah Gullickson if CPE will respond to the numerous residents who object to funding Michels‚Äô right-wing campaign through their gas bills she said she doesn‚Äôt speak to the press and forwarded the message to Ross Corson Senior Communications Specialist. We have not received an immediate response from Corson.

Opening an investment account can be a daunting task. Researching fee structures account types and product features take time and can be perplexing. Plus with so many companies offering investment services it can be tough to know if you‚Äôre making a wise decision. Fortunately this guide breaks down two major investment companies: Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab. If you‚Äôre hoping for help in automating your investments you may want to work with a financial advisor instead.

Overview of Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab

Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab are giant financial companies offering clients investment services. Each has different features and advantages so your financial circumstances will determine which one‚Äôs services are best for you.

Schwab also known as Charles Schwab unites a range of financial services under one roof. It has no trade or account minimums for its investment funds. Plus Schwab clients can invest in actively and passively managed funds. In addition investors can use a hi-tech robo-advisor tool to automate their investments.

Schwab recently acquired TD Ameritrade enhancing its services for clients wanting to trade international currencies. By 2023 it will fully assimilate TD Ameritrade‚Äôs functions into its platform. Schwab currently manages about $8 trillion in customer assets.

Merrill Lynch is an investing service operating under Bank of America‚Äôs ownership. It offers three investment services: Merrill Edge¬Æ Self-Directed Merrill Guided Investing and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Each service has incrementally higher fees and investment minimums and more sophisticated investing tools. It currently manages about $2.75 trillion in assets.

Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab: Fees

One of the ways major brokerage platforms compete is by lowering fees. Merrill Lynch and Schwab are no exception. Here is a breakdown of the major fees for both investment platforms so that you can compare the aspect of the tool you want to use the most.

Charles Schwab Fees

Schwab takes no commissions for online stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and option transactions. Plus it charges nothing for trading mutual funds or bonds. However it charges $0.65 per options contract and $2.25 per futures contract. Broker-assisted trades cost $25 and contacting customer service is free.

In addition investors with less cash can purchase partial shares of stock indexes for $5 apiece. Investors transferring assets out of their accounts will pay $15 to $25. Schwab‚Äôs robo-advisor accounts have a $5000 minimum with no fees. Investors with $25000 can open an Intelligent Portfolio Premium account for $300 plus a $30 monthly advisory fee. This account blends robo-advising and certified financial planner services.

Story continues

Schwab‚Äôs margin rates range from 10.575% for loans under $25000 to 8.825% for loans of $250000 to $499999. Merrill Lynch does not publicize specific margin rates requiring customers to inquire about current rates. They base your margin rate on your debt load the base lending rate and your assets with Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.

Merrill Lynch Fees

Merrill Edge¬Æ Self-Directed is Merrill Lynch‚Äôs basic investing account. It charges no commissions for online stock ETFs and options trades. No minimum is necessary to get started. Options trades have a $0.65 contract fee and asset sales incur fees of $0.01 to $0.03 per $1000 of assets. Typically broker-assisted trades cost $19.95 to $39.95 depending on the asset type. Various fees apply to clients holding ETFs. Contacting customer service is free.

Merrill Guided Investing is for investors able to meet a higher minimum requirement. Guided Investing clients can open an account if they have $1000 to invest. They will experience annual fees of 0.45% of assets managed plus the fees mentioned above. Investors with $20000 can access a Guided Investing account with personal financial advisory services and will pay fees of 0.85% of assets managed plus the fees mentioned above.

Lastly Merrill Lynch offers their Wealth Management account for clients with $250000 or more. Wealth Management customers can access a group of advisors to create a thorough financial plan. Because the assets managed are so substantial fees vary based on client needs.

Merrill Lynch vs. Charles Schwab: Services and Features

merrill lynch vs charles schwab

Both companies offer a range of services including individual and joint brokerage accounts 401(k)s individual retirement accounts (IRAs) 529 college saving plans and custodial accounts. Additionally both companies offer banking services as Bank of America owns and operates Merrill Lynch while Schwab banking in its suite of products.

Charles Schwab Services and Features

Clients looking for a robo-advisor can use Schwab‚Äôs Intelligent Portfolios¬Æ which provide automated investing services and tax-loss harvesting. Also if you have at least $25000 to invest you can access the Intelligent Portfolio Premium service to receive help from a certified financial planner.

For client education Schwab has a daily Q&A stream Monday through Friday for all investing topics. The company aims to present first-rate research to its customers. It has a library of free financial education resources as well. Plus clients can speak with an investment professional 24 hours a day every day of the year via phone.

Merrill Lynch Services and Features

Merrill Lynch has human financial advisors that directly interact with clients for a fee. While they don‚Äôt offer robo-advised investment accounts they offer hybrid accounts that blend automated investing tools and oversight from investment professionals. However these features don‚Äôt apply to the Merrill Edge¬Æ Self-Directed account a no-frills investment tool that places control in the client‚Äôs hands.

Merrill Guided Investing clients may receive fee reductions for Bank of America Preferred Rewards bank accounts. In addition they‚Äôll receive guidance for financial planning and investment strategy.

Merrill Lynch customers cannot trade cryptocurrency or access the foreign currencies marketplace. Additionally its customers can‚Äôt access fractional shares.

All Merrill Lynch customers can access investment education videos and resources for free. Their resources cater to all knowledge levels and cover expansive topics. Finally Merrill Lynch‚Äôs customer service is available Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Merrill Lynch vs. Schwab: Online and Mobile Experience

Both companies‚Äô apps have favorable ratings but customer feedback contains numerous complaints. Schwab sometimes can overwhelm the average user with data. However it offers an intuitive interface on mobile and desktop. That said active traders will probably like the Schwab Street Smart desktop version because the mobile version lacks certain features. Schwab Mobile has a 4.8-star rating on the Apple store and 3.7 stars on Google Play. On the other hand Schwab‚Äôs Street Smart mobile app has 1.5 stars on the Apple store and 2.2 stars on Google Play.

Merrill Lynch has two mobile apps as well: the Merrill Edge app for Edge clients and MyMerrill for Guided Investing and Wealth Management members. Edge app users praise its ease of use and availability of investment research. It holds a 4.6-star rating on the Apple store and 4 stars on Google Play.

MyMerrill users give similar feedback and emphasize its streamlined nature especially for Bank of America customers. The app has a 4.7-star rating on the Apple Store and 4 stars on Google Play.

Who Should Use Which Investment Platform?

Merrill Lynch and Schwab both offer low-fee accessible investment options for investors. As a result novice investors prioritizing inexpensive investing could be satisfied opening an account with either company.

However the companies diverge from that point. Investors who want to use a robo-advisor are more likely to go with Schwab as Merrill Lynch does not offer a pure robo-advisor option. Additionally investors who want to dive deep into the data may prefer Schwab which provides additional investing tools and analysis through its Street Smart platform.

On the other hand wealthier investors who prefer white-glove treatment may be drawn to Merrill Lynch‚Äôs services. Its Guided Investing and Wealth Management products provide a dedicated financial advisor who can help you create a financial plan and invest accordingly.

The Bottom Line

merrill lynch vs charles schwab

Merrill Lynch and Schwab are significant players in the individual investing market. Both firms offer robust services from bank accounts and IRAs to college funds and charge minimal fees. In addition their mobile apps are generally easy to use. Investing with either company will help you make gains without suffering large fees. That said investors with more money may receive more individualized services from Merrill Lynch while investors who want to use market research or robo-advisors might prefer Schwab.

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year ‚Äî her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website ‚Äî the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page ‚Äî so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being na√Øve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

What to do if you've been scammed",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjIxNDMzNC9lcmlrYS1qYW1lcy1seW5uLXBlcnJ5LXdvb3Rlbi1pbnRlcnZpZXctcHJlcGFyZWQtbGVhZGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Leaders Should Be Thinking About the Next Crisis,"(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world‚Äôs top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

Erika H. James dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Lynn Perry Wooten president of Simmons University are leaders in their field who are also experts in leadership. The pair have spent two decades researching and writing about the topic and previously wrote the 2010 book Leading Under Pressure. Their new book The Prepared Leader was written during the COVID-19 pandemic and draws on years of research and interviews with leaders about their experiences leading during the tumult of 2020.

James and Wooten did all this while themselves transitioning into their current jobs at the height of the pandemic in 2020. James became the first woman and person of color to lead the Wharton School while Wooten became Simmons‚Äô first Black president.

‚ÄúWe were living out what we were writing in this book as leaders of the Wharton School or of Simmons University‚Äù says James. ‚ÄúThat duality of experiencing it trying to be effective leaders while also writing about it and leveraging our research at the same time is a really powerful part of our professional history.‚Äù

James and Wooten spoke with TIME about why they believe preparedness should be the ‚Äúfourth P‚Äù in a company‚Äôs bottom line along with people profit and the planet. They also discussed the importance of establishing‚Äîand maintaining‚Äîdiversity in crisis management teams and the role of what they call ‚Äúmega communities‚Äù like the #MeToo or Black Lives Matter movements‚Äîbroad and diverse collectives of stakeholders that can span organizations sectors and sometimes societies.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Why do you think that leaders were so woefully unprepared for the pandemic and other crises before it?

James: We don‚Äôt generally like thinking about or anticipating bad news and the notion of a pandemic of this scale we‚Äôve seen signals or smaller versions of this in the past 20 years or so. But we‚Äôve always been able to navigate them. They didn‚Äôt have hardly at all the effects that the pandemic of COVID-19 had on a country or certainly around the world. And so I think we are easy to dismiss the notion that something as catastrophic as a crisis would actually materialize and that we would be affected by them. So because our brain doesn‚Äôt like to think about negative news we tend not to prepare for bad things.

Wooten: It‚Äôs not only that our brains don‚Äôt need to think about it we don‚Äôt educate leaders for it. So people have to study accounting and HR and strategic planning and finance and marketing. But when you talk to leaders about their on-the-job training their formal training their college training very little time gets them to think about the skill sets the competencies you need for leading in a crisis situation. And how you take those skill sets that we talked about in a book and become this prepared leader means that you also think about it in the context of the people who work in your organization whatever your profit model is or your effective model‚Äîand the planet.

Some might argue that if you‚Äôre as a leader constantly focused on what crisis might be ahead perhaps you‚Äôre not as focused on the day-to-day running of the business. How should leaders be balancing those two priorities?

James: We have to do both quite frankly. And I think the most effective leaders are constantly thinking about what we need to do to achieve our strategic objectives while also being mindful that we rarely ever perfectly achieve the goals and objectives that [we] set out to achieve. Things are always happening and the best leaders are those who think about where their vulnerabilities‚Äîeither internal to their organization or where there might be external threats that prohibit their organization from achieving the results in the timeframe that they had desired. So we‚Äôre unprepared because we don‚Äôt like to think about them we‚Äôre not taught to think about them‚Äîthe best leaders understand that being effective means doing both strategic leadership and crisis preparedness.

You write in the book about ‚Äúsudden‚Äù and ‚Äúsmoldering‚Äù crises. Could you explain how leaders‚Äô responses to those should differ?

Wooten: The smoldering crises are the ones hopefully that you have time to prepare for‚Äîyou‚Äôre constantly scanning the environment you‚Äôre looking for signals. You‚Äôre saying ‚Äúwhat could happen possibly.‚Äù Even the pandemic when you started to see it happening in other countries leaders had to ask themselves ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going to happen if it comes to the United States?‚Äù So those smoldering crises have been gradual. Sudden crises: you don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre going to happen‚Äîthey take you off guard. But if you have the skill set [to think] ‚ÄúOK how are we going to communicate? How are we going to build trust? How are we resourceful? How do we mobilize all of our stakeholders?‚Äù then you may not know the crisis [is coming]‚Äîa national disaster or a lawsuit or something‚Äîbut at least you have the skill set to activate your leadership team.

James: I‚Äôll add that typically we spend our time thinking about those external sudden crises. Most organizations have an active shooter plan most organizations have a weather events strategy if a hurricane or something happens. So we plan for the things that are generally least likely to happen‚Äîthose sudden events. What we don‚Äôt tend to plan for are the smoldering events which generally are things that are happening inside the organization that are oftentimes a function of bad decision-making ineffective behavior a poor culture‚Äîthose kinds of things that sort of simmer under the radar until they erupt because nobody has paid attention to them.

Not paying attention to these sorts of issues can have a very serious financial impact. How important is preparedness to a company‚Äôs bottom line?

Wooten: Crises can cost money‚Äîit‚Äôs how much money do we leave [behind] because we have to stop business: money that we lose from lawsuits money that we lose from reputational effects. And this is where we talk about the intersection of being a prepared leader with your profit. The better that you can be a prepared leader you can prevent crisis so you‚Äôre saving money. You can preserve your reputation. You can make sure that your operations can go on.

How have you both drawn on your own experiences of fighting fires as leaders for the learnings that you present in the book?

James: I‚Äôll share a quick story. Lynn and I wrote an initial book several years ago called Leading Under Pressure. And when I was sharing that book with some neighbors they said ‚ÄúOh is that a parenting book?‚Äù That was such an unusual response to a book titled Leading Under Pressure but in hindsight you realize that as parents we‚Äôre constantly doing the work of crisis leadership. We‚Äôre constantly scanning to see what could go wrong with our kids. We‚Äôre constantly trying to prepare them for the next step in their life. We‚Äôre constantly trying to put out fires when something bad happens to our children. So I think as parents we‚Äôre very well attuned to naturally thinking about things going wrong. We don‚Äôt oftentimes make that shift to the workplace. That‚Äôs not to say that employees are like children but it‚Äôs the same level of responsibility that a leader has and understanding what we need to be mindful of is the active part of preparation.

Wooten: For me I‚Äôm constantly scanning my environment and trying to make sense of what‚Äôs going to happen what could be the next crisis on the horizon. I lead a small university and in the United States. We talk about the demographic cliff especially for small universities as fewer students are going to college as people are moving from different sides of the country. And so I‚Äôm thinking about ‚ÄúOK how is this demographic cliff going to require me to innovate to rethink the business model of my university?‚Äù So the sense-making creativity the innovation‚Ä¶ We have a tool where we talk about how you take a crisis and look at it as an opportunity to do something different. In the book we talk about the National Basketball Association and how they used the pandemic. There are many examples where we‚Äôve seen organizations reinvent themselves and the crisis has become an opportunity to do something better‚Äîeither the way you organize people or how you do technology or how you change your business model. So I‚Äôm constantly thinking about opportunities too.

What are the biggest lessons for businesses from the pandemic?

Wooten: We can be agile. Never before have we seen industries and businesses and communities reinvent themselves. You take healthcare and telemed you take universities and K-12 systems going online so we can be agile. And so how do we do things quicker? The other big lesson is looking for examples of effective communication. We know that in crisis situations leaders have to communicate communicate communicate. We talk about that in the book. It‚Äôs important because you want to build trust. And so being competent having a psychological contract as you communicate with people are so important‚Äîand having compassion.

James: I would add that one of the key lessons is recognizing that our tendency generally when we experience threat is to retreat and become very limited in how or where we seek information. And because a crisis means it‚Äôs something that we‚Äôve not experienced before whatever is in our history our past is not going to inform us in terms of how to respond to this crisis. So the need for creativity‚Äîthe need for intentionally seeking out information and ideas and new perspectives to help us solve a problem that we‚Äôve never experienced before‚Äîthat sort of goes against our psyche. But the leaders who have been most effective are those who are actually able to expand the sources from which they draw information and problem-solving.

What should leaders today be thinking about when it comes to leading through the next crisis big or small?

James: To me it‚Äôs thinking about understanding the lessons that they‚Äôve learned or what they‚Äôve experienced going through the pandemic and evaluating honestly ‚Äúwhat did we do well in responding to that what didn‚Äôt really do well and responding to that? What structures or policies or procedures do we have in place that can help us mitigate the next crisis?‚Äù Guaranteed the next crisis probably will not be another pandemic but it will be something else. And there‚Äôs muscle memory. If we are intentional about learning from what we just went through we can leverage that muscle memory to help inform us the next time something else happens‚Äîbut only if we are intentional about reflecting and learning the lessons having just gone through the previous crisis.

Wooten: We talk about mega communities [in the book.] It‚Äôs not only looking inside your organization to say what did you do well or what did you need to improve but ‚Äúwho do I need to partner with? How do I expand my network so I‚Äôm a better organization?‚Äù Mega communities say a lot of tough problems need the three sectors: you need government you need the nonprofit sector and you need the corporate sector. We saw that in the pandemic. Who else managed that last crisis well? What can I learn from them?

What are the key skills you‚Äôve identified that leaders need to be able to handle a crisis?

James: Generally effective crisis leaders will engage in signal detection to understand what are the vulnerabilities and what do we need to be on the lookout for? The next phase is around crisis planning and prevention. When a crisis does hit there‚Äôs the notion of damage control or containment‚Äîhow do we limit its impact? And the fourth stage is business recovery. And then lastly there‚Äôs the learning phase.

Within each of those phases Lynn and I have identified several key leadership traits or competencies that are necessary so in the signal detection phase for example one trait is sense-making. How do I make sense of all of the information that‚Äôs coming at me how do I put it together in a way that allows me to communicate to the broader organization? Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre learning and here‚Äôs what we can start to prepare for it.

Wooten: I [also] want to talk about our risk taking. Sometimes during a crisis when you‚Äôre reinventing yourself and adapting to the world you have to think about what risks we‚Äôre going to take. [For example] we‚Äôre going to take all the basketball players and create a bubble in Orlando. Some of that was risk taking. But it‚Äôs assessing the risks and understanding what the pros and cons are. Erica and I talk a lot about how one of the leader‚Äôs roles in the crisis is to ensure resiliency. Yeah you‚Äôre going into this panic you‚Äôre going to become paralyzed but at some point you‚Äôre going to have to bounce back. Resiliency is ‚Äúhow am I going to bounce back and what is it going to take for me to be better? What are the investments I have to make‚Äîthe team I need the financial investments the infrastructure‚Äîso that I can be resilient in that recovery mode?‚Äù

And with that kind of risk-taking when it is something like the pandemic you are having to make those decisions very quickly as well.

Wooten: Yep. Part of being quick is you‚Äôve got to have the data and you have to have the theory of change‚Äî‚Äùwhy am I doing this? What does the data show me?‚Äù And being ethical. All the stakeholders are going to be involved in your risky decision. What are you doing to ensure their well being in a crisis situation?

James: I think it‚Äôs important to highlight that not all stakeholders are equal. You have people who are advocates for your organization and want to support everything that you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll have people who are sort of ambivalent they may know your company but they don‚Äôt feel one way or another about it. And then you have people who are potentially very aggressively antagonistic to your company. And in times of crisis it might be [that] the people who might be most vocal might not be the ones who need the most attention. So those who are antagonistic to you might be very much all over social media. They might be very much present and vocal and you might feel like you need to devote your attention to that group. But they‚Äôre less likely to want to support you no matter what your efforts are because they are naturally antagonistic to what it is you do. The real key especially in a time of crisis is to pay attention to those who are ambivalent so that you avoid those from becoming antagonistic and you potentially are able to influence them to become your advocates. And I don‚Äôt think leaders oftentimes recognize [that]‚Äîthey‚Äôll go to the loudest voices but the loudest voices are not always the stakeholders that need and deserve the leaders‚Äô attention.

Diversity is something that you identify as an important element when building a team that‚Äôs equipped for a crisis. There was a recent study from Imperial College Business School which found that diversity on boards is something that‚Äôs often sacrificed when companies are struggling. How can organizations prevent that from happening?

James: I think it really is a matter of the intention of the leader. If the leader understands the value that comes from having diverse perspectives on the board and the management team‚Äîwherever‚Äîthen he or she will facilitate creating a diverse and inclusive environment in both of those settings. And then it becomes making sure that the board is aligned with the values of diversity. It becomes the board‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that the leader and the managers are in fact engaging in practices that create an inclusive communities such that the value of diversity the voices‚Äîthe perspectives that allow a leader to make the most effective decisions‚Äîare in fact being heard.

Wooten: I believe most leaders want to have diverse inclusive organizations but haven‚Äôt thought about the roadmap. And so it‚Äôs asking yourself ‚ÄúWhen I look around the table especially the boardroom who‚Äôs missing especially relevant to this organization?‚Äù And then ‚Äúwhat is my plan to make sure that the people who are missing can be in the room to make it happen?‚Äù And part of that once you get them in the room is that they have to feel like they belong. We talk about in the book going to all different types of experts to resolve the crisis and hearing various voices from outside the organization at the top of the organization and at the bottom.

And crisis always calls for you to really think about diversity and equity and inclusion. We definitely saw it in the pandemic as we saw for example women exiting the workplace as we saw how people were dealing with the social reckoning. So sometimes crises‚Äîa natural disaster or something like a medical crisis‚Äîwill have a parallel to diversity issues.

James: Oftentimes when we now use the phrase diversity we immediately turn to demographic diversity and think we need more women we need more people of color. And while that continues to be true for most organizations we‚Äôre also inclusive in our approach to diversity especially in a time of crisis because our tendency as leaders is to go to the content experts. So in a crisis we‚Äôre gonna go to the legal counsel and we might go to public relations or head of communications. And those folks are important contributors to understanding how best to navigate the crisis. But if those are the only two perspectives and we‚Äôre not going to people who are interfacing with customers on a daily basis if we‚Äôre not going to our customers if we‚Äôre not going to shareholders to understand the perspective that they bring then we‚Äôre not going to have the most fulsome set of information and data upon which to make a decision. So for us demographic diversity is important but it‚Äôs not the only kind of diversity that matters in a time of crisis.

Do you have any tips for people who have that perspective and are struggling to have their voices heard within an organization?

Wooten: When I‚Äôm coaching people like that I [say] ‚Äúthink about where are opportunities to showcase your knowledge in multiple communications. Maybe you don‚Äôt feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting but it could be an email it could be a water cooler conversation it could be a text message but think about various communication pathways that you can showcase your expertise.‚Äù The other thing is I always say partner with someone‚Äîthe CFO partnering with the chief marketing officer. Spend some time with a person from a different background to share what you‚Äôre working on and how you can manage through the crisis and get their perspective.

James: I would add aligning your work‚Äîor the communication that you want to get upward into the organization‚Äîwith the strategic priority of the organization. That way it‚Äôs more likely to get the attention of top management because it‚Äôs already an area or a topic or an issue that they‚Äôre focused on. So if you can align whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to get communicated in the context of that strategic priority is much more likely to get attention.

What role does technology play in both creating and combating crises?

Wooten: We all have seen crises be birthed from social media or cybersecurity so the chief information officer the chief technology officer is an important member of any organization‚Äôs crisis leadership team. They always have to be on the lookout. But technology is an efficient solution to a lot of crises. I gave the example of technology being the solution for how we get medical appointments during the pandemic‚Äîthe telemed. Likewise we‚Äôve seen that a lot of organizations were successful communicating on social media for example using technology to find out where there were outbreaks of COVID or using technology to find out where you can get vaccinated.",,,,,,,,,

The communications were unveiled as part of a congressional hearing held in Washington DC where an investigation into the role of fossil fuels in driving the climate crisis produced documents obtained from the oil giants ExxonMobil Chevron Shell and BP.

‚ÄúFirst they ignore you then they laugh at you then they wish bedbugs on you then you win‚Äù said Varshini Prakash executive director of Sunrise. The organization accused Shell of a ‚Äúlegacy of violence and of ignoring the wellbeing of communities across the globe‚Äù.

The revelations are part of the third hearing held by the House committee on oversight and reform on how the fossil-fuel industry sought to hamper the effort to address the climate crisis. Democrats who lead the committee called top executives from the oil companies to testify last year in which they denied they had misled the public.

The new documents are ‚Äúthe latest evidence that oil giants keep lying about their commitments to help solve the climate crisis and should never be trusted by policymakers‚Äù said Richard Wiles president of the Center for Climate Integrity.

‚ÄúIf there is one thing consistent about the oil and gas majors‚Äô position on climate it‚Äôs their utter inability to tell the truth‚Äù Wiles added.

Ro Khanna co-chair of the committee said the new documents are ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù and show a ‚Äúculture of intense disrespect‚Äù to climate activists. The oil giants‚Äô ‚Äúclimate pledges rely on unproven technology accounting gimmicks and misleading language to hide the reality‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBig oil executives are laughing at the people trying to protect our planet while they knowingly work to destroy it.‚Äù

Several of the emails and memos within the released trove of documents appear to show executives staffers and lobbyists internally contradicting public pronouncements by their companies to act on lowering planet-heating emissions.

Exxon which recently announced profits of $17.9bn for the three months until June more than three times what it earned in the same quarter a year ago has publicly said it is ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to the Paris climate agreement to curb global heating.

However the documents released by the Democratic-led House committee include an August 2019 memo by an executive to Darren Woods Exxon‚Äôs chief executive on the need to ‚Äúremove reference to Paris agreement‚Äù from an announcement by an industry lobby group that Exxon is a member of.

Such a statement ‚Äúcould create a potential commitment to advocate on the Paris agreement goals‚Äù the executive warned. A separate note on a 2018 Exxon presentation also admitted that biofuels derived from algae was still ‚Äúdecades away from the scale we need‚Äù despite the company long promoting it as a way to lower emissions.

Shell meanwhile has committed to becoming a ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù emissions business by 2050 and yet the documents show a private 2020 communication in which employees are urged to never ‚Äúimply suggest or leave it open for possible misinterpretation that (net zero) is a Shell goal or target‚Äù. Shell has ‚Äúno immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio‚Äù over the next 10 to 20 years it added.

A Shell tweet posted in 2020 asking others what they could do to reduce emissions resulted in a torrent of ridicule from Twitter users. A communications executive for the company wrote privately that criticism that the tweet was ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù the public was ‚Äúnot totally without merit‚Äù and that the tweet was ‚Äúpretty tone deaf‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúWe are after all in a tweet like this implying others need to sacrifice without focusing on ourselves.‚Äù

The UK-headquartered oil company which in July announced a record $11.5bn quarterly profit also poured scorn on climate activists with a communications specialist at the company emailing in 2019 that he wished ‚Äúbedbugs‚Äù upon the Sunrise Movement a youth-led US climate group.

Previous releases of internal documents have shown that the oil industry knew of the devastating impact of climate change but chose instead to downplay and even deny these findings publicly in order to maintain their business model.

The hearings have been attacked by Republicans as a method to ‚Äúwage war on America‚Äôs energy producers‚Äù and the oil companies involved have complained that the documents don‚Äôt show the full picture of their stance on the climate crisis.

Exxon supports the 2015 Paris climate deal a spokesman said claiming that the ‚Äúselective publication of dated emails without context is a deliberate attempt to generate a narrative that does not reflect the commitment of ExxonMobil and its employees to address climate change and play a leading role in the transition to a net-zero future.‚Äù

A Shell spokesman meanwhile said the committee chose to highlight only a small handful of the nearly half a million pages it provided to the body on its ‚Äúextensive efforts‚Äù to take part in the energy transition.

‚ÄúWithin that pursuit are challenging internal and external discussions that signal Shell‚Äôs intent to form partnerships and share pathways we deem critical to becoming a net-zero energy business‚Äù he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As Jennifer Rodriguez of WKBN reports the USDA‚Äôs cost-of-living adjustments for SNAP benefits will go into effect on Oct. 1 2022 giving a much-needed increase in food aid to even more Ohio families.

The program‚Äôs maximum monthly food allotments will increase from $250 $459 and $835 for a single individual a couple and a four-person household to $281 $516 and $939 respectively. The minimum monthly allotment is being increased from $20 to $23 according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

The gross and net monthly income limits for households also are increasing Oct. 1. For example a single-person household will now have a gross monthly income limit of $1473 (up from $1396) and a net monthly income limit of $1133 (from $1074). For a family of four the maximum gross monthly income is $3007 (from $2871 in 2021) and the net monthly income is now $2313 (from $2209).

As GOBankingRates previously reported in 2022 Ohio is home to about 1.38 million recipients who receive SNAP benefits or 12% of the state‚Äôs population. The average benefit ‚Äî per household member per month ‚Äî is $132.

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero ‚Äî Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift ‚Äî who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour ‚Äî was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian ‚Äî and political ‚Äî messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services ‚Äî two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended ‚Äî the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann ‚Äî a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg ‚Äî and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

Tine Weichmann and her band moved churchgoers to tears and had them dancing in their pews during the service Image: Uwe Anspach/dpa/picture aliance

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine ‚Äî and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces ‚Äî and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

The church was contacted in April and told that it was under ‚Äúformal inquiry‚Äù and that a motion would be made on the floor of the Convention in June this year to ‚Äúunseat our messengers.‚Äù

The church said on website that it plans to stay its original course and will send 12 representatives to the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis in June.

According to the church website:

In 2022 First Baptist Church of Alexandria was reported to the Credentials Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) for being ‚Äúout of step‚Äù with the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.‚Äù At the time there were two women serving as pastors in staff. Then in 2023 the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) overwhelmingly voted to disfellowship (or vote out) two Southern Baptist churches for the same reasons: Saddleback Church in California and Fern Creek Baptist Church in Kentucky. Further the SBC voted to adopt a constitutional amendment specifying that SBC churches can only employ men as pastors or elders. This action was in stark contrast to the longstanding ideal that SBC churches were autonomous and that ‚Äúthe Convention does not claim and would never attempt to exercise any authority over any other Baptist body whether church auxiliary organizations associations or convention.‚Äù As a church that employed two female pastors at the time First Baptist Church of Alexandria (FBCA) was engaged in this debate and grieved by this result. We remain resolute in recognizing God‚Äôs calling to ministry for both men and women. For nearly 100 years women have had a prominent role in ministry and positions of authority at FBCA. In the coming year the SBC will continue to debate this question. A second vote to ratify the amendment will take place and potentially other action will be taken against our church specifically. At that time FBCA members will have to respond graciously and make difficult decisions about the future of our church‚Äôs participation in the SBC.

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church‚Äôs Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

‚ÄúUtah‚Äôs really still the breadbasket of the church‚Äù he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You‚Äôve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You‚Äôve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there‚Äôs a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I‚Äôm working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah‚Äôs really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They‚Äôve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‚ÄòThis has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth‚Äô but it‚Äôs just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it‚Äôs like ‚ÄòOK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it‚Äôs it‚Äôs changing.‚Äô So Utah‚Äôs very dynamic is the point I‚Äôm trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It‚Äôs not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it‚Äôs just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ‚Äôs teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built ‚Äî there seems to be one open house after another in Utah ‚Äî I just hope that the members of the church don‚Äôt get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‚ÄòBoy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple‚Äô and a lot more focused on ‚ÄòWhat promises am I making what are those covenants?‚Äô ‚Äî the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We‚Äôre hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we‚Äôre hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they‚Äôll think about the Savior and they‚Äôll think about the sacred promises they‚Äôve made and they‚Äôll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that‚Äôs the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We‚Äôre going to teach that. We‚Äôre going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson‚Äôs behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they‚Äôll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one‚Äôs life?

Elder Pearson: My wife‚Äôs parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it‚Äôs to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we‚Äôre in it for the long term. We don‚Äôt let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they‚Äôve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that‚Äôs different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you‚Äôre facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you‚Äôre listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they‚Äôre also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That‚Äôs something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

What I‚Äôm reading

Former BYU athlete Courtney Wayment focuses on ‚Äòfaith over fear‚Äô in preparation for U.S. Olympic trials

The road to the top is often long and winding. Just read about this journey to the top of professional baseball.

When I saw this headline ‚Äî ‚ÄúHow a forgotten basketball icon revolutionized the NBA and blazed a trail for Nikola Jokic‚Äù ‚Äî I immediately thought of the late BYU star Kresimir Cosic. And sure enough he was in the story.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt3Y2guY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTIvcGFyaXNoaW9uZXJzLXN0b3AtdGVlbi1hcm1lZC13aXRoLXJpZmxlLWVudGVyaW5nLWNodXJjaC1kdXJpbmctbWFzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parishioners stop teen armed with rifle from entering church during Mass,"ABBEVILLE La. (KADN) - A tragedy may have narrowly been avoided at a Louisiana church where police say a teen armed with a rifle was stopped by parishioners from getting inside as dozens of children were making their First Communion.

The chaos and panic Saturday at Saint Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Abbeville was captured on a livestream of the service during which 60 children were making their First Holy Communion.

The video shows that 48 minutes into the service a man approached Nicholas Dupre the church‚Äôs associate pastor who was leading the service and whispered something in his ear. Dupre stopped what he was doing then told everyone to sit and started praying the Hail Mary.

Attention soon turned to the back of the church. Witnesses say a teenager dressed in black and armed with a rifle opened the building‚Äôs back door. He was confronted by parishioners and escorted outside where police later arrested him.

Police descended on the building around 10:35 a.m. even on the altar where altar servers ran to safety and clergy crouched behind the altar. Witnesses say police made the sweep because they were concerned there could have been another person with guns inside the church.

As parishioners panicked police tried to restore calm while the church was evacuated.

‚ÄúSo guys just get a hold of your child. Go slowly. We did apprehend a young man. He is in police custody. Calm down and just get next to your child‚Äù one officer said.

Abbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy says the 16-year-old suspect was interviewed by officers then taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation. He is charged with terrorizing and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile.

Authorities say the parishioners who stopped the teen from entering the church likely saved lives.

Lafayette Diocese Bishop J. Douglas Deshotel released a statement praising the police and alert parishioners for avoiding a tragedy. He says it‚Äôs a great example of caring for children ‚Äúthe most vulnerable in our community.‚Äù

The FBI are investigating the incident alongside Abbeville Police and the Vermilion Parish Sheriff‚Äôs Office. There will be added security at the church for all upcoming Masses.

We lost a little bit about four weeks due to rain in the spring‚Äù he said.

The goal is to fill 400 full-time jobs next year and they‚Äôre hiring some leadership positions now in advance of the plant‚Äôs February opening.

This project will make Koch Foods Fairfield‚Äôs second-largest business behind Cincinnati Financial. After the new positions are filled the chicken processing company could have close to 2000 employees.

Reisen doesn‚Äôt believe it would take long to fill the jobs given its diversity.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still marching along‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBusiness has been going very well. We‚Äôre an eight-language facility and a lot of our employees come by way of mouth referrals.‚Äù

Koch Foods is constructing the 402140-square-foot building on 18 acres behind its 45-acre main campus at 4100 Port Union Road. In all it will be a $220 million investment with $140 million being spent on the building and the remainder on new machinery and equipment.

In exchange the city provided a 10-year 75% tax abatement on the project.

Resien said they‚Äôll add three production lines in 2023 but they‚Äôll start with one on Feb. 27. The second line will be added around the start of June and the third line around the start of December.

‚ÄúWe still have room for two more lines in this facility so this is going to be a very very large facility when this is all said and done‚Äù he said. Those fourth and fifth lines won‚Äôt likely be needed for a few more years.

Adding the three production lines would provide the manufacturer of poultry products with a total of 10.

The project had also already received regional recognition from the economic development organization REDI Cincinnati. In March REDI awarded the Koch Foods project with the James A. Wuenker Growth Award because of the jobs being added to the region.

Hamilton‚Äôs 80 Acres Farms and Saica have earned this growth award in recent years.

Reisen said while there‚Äôs no timeline for a fourth and fifth production line as it‚Äôs based on customer demands and needs it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll be needed in a few years.

They‚Äôre also sitting on a 277000-square-foot building on Seward Road the former Liberty Mutual insurance office building. The building was acquired by Ambrose Property Group in December 2019 as part of a land acquisition on Seward Road to construct Fairfield Commerce Park.

Ambrose sold the former insurance office building earlier this month to Koch Foods for $8.4 million according to the Butler County Auditor‚Äôs Office.

‚ÄúThe building and the land have been acquired by Koch with the expectation for a future frozen and dry warehouse‚Äù Resien said.

No date has been scheduled to utilize the building so until it‚Äôs needed Reisen said it would be white-boxed.

Koch Foods is headquartered in Chicago and has manufacturing facilities in Alabama Illinois Georgia Mississippi and Tennessee. Its Fairfield operation opened in 1999 and is the city‚Äôs largest industrial employer and largest water and sewer customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Investing.com-- Onewo Inc the property management unit of real estate giant China Vanke Co Ltd (SZ:000002) plans to raise as much as HK$6.2 billion ($784 million) through a long-awaited initial public offering in Hong Kong.

The firm will offer 116.7 million shares priced between HK$47.1 to HK$52.7 each. In case an over-allotment option is exercised by investors it will offer 134.2 million shares to raise about HK$7.1 billion.

The figure which was released by China Vanke in a filing to the Hong Kong exchange is smaller than earlier reports that said the firm planned to raise as much as $1.5 billion. But it is still among the largest IPOs in Hong Kong this year.

On completion of the offering Onewo‚Äôs market capitalization will be between HK$54.97 billion to HK$61.51 billion. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Citic Securities are joint sponsors of the offering.

Onewo offers property management services that incorporate artificial intelligence and business process outsourcing models. Vanke holds roughly 60% of the firm.

The offering comes amid a severe downturn in China‚Äôs property market which was exacerbated this year by a series of COVID lockdowns. New home sales are waning while several major developers are facing a cash crunch due to mortgage boycotts and increased regulatory scrutiny.

China Vanke has so far defied the slowdown logging steady profit and revenue growth in its interim results released last month. But both the firm and Onewo have warned of a potential slowdown from more headwinds in the property market.

Hong Kong‚Äôs IPO market has also dried up this year marred by COVID lockdowns and increasing regulatory scrutiny in China.

The Hang Seng Hong Kong's benchmark stock index is trading down nearly 25% over the past year with local equity valuations also under pressure.

With global equities having already lost US$23 trillion this year the US currency‚Äôs inverse relationship with risk assets makes it the only game in town for at least the rest of 2022 according to Citigroup Inc.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce says the dollar is set to keep rising while Brown Brothers Harriman & Co says the global backdrop continues to favour the US currency.

‚ÄúThe only place to hide is in US dollar cash‚Äù Citi strategists including Jamie Fahy and Adam Pickett wrote in a research note on Thursday.

It would take a ‚Äúdeep recession‚Äù to push US inflation significantly lower implying a prolonged drop in corporate profits and equities before the Federal Reserve pivots they said.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index which tracks the US currency against 10 global peers has surged more than 11 percent this year set for a record annual performance in data compiled by Bloomberg starting in 2004.

Evidence of the havoc caused by the appreciating dollar had been spelled out across currency markets last week.

The greenback powered ahead after quicker-than-expected US inflation data on Tuesday saw traders boost Fed rate-hike bets once again dragging down global risk sentiment.

The yen already languishing at a 24-year low tumbled to within a whisker of the closely watched 145 per dollar level while China‚Äôs yuan slid beyond 7 and the Canadian currency dropped to the weakest in almost two years. The Australian dollar is on the brink of a new multi-year low.

Strategists say there is unlikely to be any relief from the dollar‚Äôs dominance just yet.

‚ÄúThe repricing of Fed tightening risks is likely to keep the dollar bid across the board near-term‚Äù Win Thin head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York wrote in a note.

‚ÄúAs we said during this most recent dollar correction lower nothing has really changed fundamentally and the global backdrop continues to favour the dollar and US assets in general.‚Äù

CIBC agrees it is too soon to write off dollar strength.

‚ÄúThe real policy rate is still deeply negative and financial conditions are too loose‚Äù said Bipan Rai head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC in Toronto.

‚ÄúThe market has priced some of this in but there is enough of a question mark with respect to where the terminal rests that should keep the USD well supported.‚Äù

Citi forecasts the Intercontinental Exchange Inc.‚Äô s US dollar index which is already at a two-decade high will climb about another 2 percent in the next three months.

‚ÄúWe have outlined ad nauseam that the end of the USD bull-run will require either a Fed pivot evidenced via bull-steepening in the US rates curve or a bottoming in global growth expectations‚Äù the Citi strategists wrote. ‚ÄúThese could be themes for 2023 but not today.‚Äù ‚Äì Bloomberg"

When factoring in Delaware TD had long had more deposits than Wells Fargo. But Delaware data is skewed by the fact that several banks including TD have a large amount of corporate deposits in bank-centric Wilmington.

Cherry Hill-based TD a subsidiary of Toronto-based TD Bank Group (NYSE: TD) led the pack this year with $35.4 billion in local deposits good enough for a 16.7% market share and an increase from $32.3 billion and 15.2% in 2021. TD‚Äôs branch count held at 117.

As Lebanon‚Äôs financial crisis continues to deteriorate some depositors have attempted to take back their savings by force.

Several people across Lebanon have attempted to rob banks in order to get hold of their own savings as the country's economy continues to nosedive.

On Friday there were at least five bank robberies. One person entered the building armed with a hunting rifle spurred on by restrictions on the amount customers are able to withdraw from banks since 2019.

In the past 48 hours at least seven other banks were robbed.

One customer carrying what appeared to be a weapon managed to take $19000 from his own account.

After the robbery he gave the money to this accomplice who the local press claimed was his son before turning himself into the police.

In the southern part of the country‚Äôs capital Beirut a man armed with a dummy pistol managed to withdraw $20000 from a bank.

Another man identified as Abed Soubra entered a bank armed demanding access to his $300000 in savings.

He eventually left the bank after sundown without his money and authorities did not take him into custody.

In another part of Beirut a man with a hunting rifle demanded his deposit. The man Jawad Sleem is a father of seven who has been jobless for months.

In response the Lebanese Banks Association has decided to close all branches from 19 to 21 September.

Lebanon is experiencing what the World Bank has described as one of the world‚Äôs worst economic crises with nearly three-quarters of the country‚Äôs population having been pushed into absolute poverty.

The country‚Äôs currency the Lebanese lira has lost 95% of its value since 2019.

The economic crisis has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 ammonium nitrate explosion at Beirut‚Äôs port which was considered one of the worst non-nuclear blasts in history.

The 1.1 kilotonne blast which is still being investigated caused at least 218 deaths and 7000 injuries and left at least 300000 people homeless.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvcmVzaWRlbnRzLXNwZWFrLW91dC1vbi1jcmF6eS1pZGVhLW9mLW1vcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50cy1vbi1yb2xsaW5nLWFjcmVzLXJvYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residents speak out on 'crazy' idea of more apartments on Rolling Acres Road,"Residents are speaking out on the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù idea of adding nearly 300 apartments on Rolling Acres Road in Lady Lake.

The Lady Lake Commission will learn on Monday night about a plan for a 288-apartment complex to be built across from The Villages Woodshop on Rolling Acres Road.

‚ÄúAre you kidding? Building 300 apartments on this road would be an accident waiting to happen. As it is right now you can‚Äôt travel this road‚Äù said Rose Bowersox of Fruitland Park.

David Woodcock of the Village of Polo Ridge has plenty of experience in navigating Rolling Acres Road.

‚ÄúI used to work on this road for Citizens First Bank (next to proposed site) and you could never get out on the road across traffic. Especially with the elementary school down the road. All this is going to do is put more traffic on Morse Road and other roads in The Villages. This is a crazy idea to build anything on that road until it is made into a four lane road with turn lanes. Where are our government officials going to make a stand on this road?‚Äù he asked.

Wayne Bentley of the Village of Silver Lake said he can‚Äôt see how Rolling Acres Road can handle any more traffic unless it is widened. He said the nearly 300 apartments will bring more automobiles to the already-overburdened thoroughfare.

‚ÄúDo they think the residents will stay home all the time? To go anywhere be it to the store or work it must be by car as golf carts aren‚Äôt allowed on the roadways and no cart paths exist so cars are their only choice for transportation‚Äù Bentley said.

Cindy Henry of Lady Lake said The Villages Elementary of Lady Lake‚Äôs twice-daily car line and Romac Lumber‚Äôs trucks constantly hauling large trusses are a fact of life on Rolling Acres Road.

‚ÄúSomething needs to be done with the roads before more building goes on. Lady Lake is growing so fast that our roads are deteriorating‚Äù she said.

Villager Allison Addington said builders should have to pay for improvements to the roadway.

‚ÄúThe 300 apartments will increase traffic on Rolling Acres Road. People over 50 drive too.

Thousands in Haiti faced water shortages after days of protest virtually halted distribution eyewitnesses said on Saturday as an approaching storm caused more worry in the reeling country.

Many residents of Haiti‚Äôs capital Port-au-Prince have been forced to shelter at home this week as gunfire broke out and burning tires blocked streets during protests offuel price hikes and crime.

That slowed or halted companies that typically deliver water in the city where daily highs have been hitting 34 degrees centigrade (93 degrees Fahrenheit).

Many took advantage of an expected half day truce to rush to distribution centers to stockpile a few days supply of water and cooking gas which has also run short in many places.

Fears about the approach of tropical storm Fiona also fueled the rush to get water. Forecasters said the storm‚Äôs heaviest rains were more likely to hit the Dominican Republic on the east of Hispaniola island.

Jean-Denis S√©v√®re a resident of Fort National said many had to travel miles to fill buckets and bottles then lug them back home.

‚ÄúI live in Fort National since there are blockades in the country we came here to buy water. If it was not for these places we would die from thirst‚Äù he said.

The country‚Äôs latest unrest came as inflation surged to its highest in a decade and gang violence has left hundreds dead and thousands displaced with much of Haiti‚Äôs territory beyond government reach.

Richardson Adrien a Port-au-Prince resident told Reuters the lack of potable water was just the latest headache. Residents in recent months have also struggled to find fuel leaving some unable to work.

Finding clear water ‚Äúis a problem. We look for it everywhere and we can‚Äôt find it. We put Clorox in the water to be able to drink it you can‚Äôt find water‚Äù he said.

The Haitian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PORTLAND Ore. (AP) ‚Äî In a year of having to bounce back Andrea Lee recovered from two early bogeys and pulled away with five birdies on the back nine Sunday to close with a 6-under 66 and win the AmazingCre Portland Classic for her first LPGA Tour title.

Lee took the lead for good with an 18-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole and then hit a superb bunker shot from left of the 17th green to save par and keep a two-shot lead.

She was in the middle of the 18th fairway when she watched Daniela Darquea of Ecuador finish with a third straight birdie for a 66 to pull within one shot. Lee drilled her approach to 15 feet and lagged her putt to within inches to tap in for the win.

It was quite a turnaround for Lee a former No. 1 amateur from Stanford whose game got off track to the point her LPGA status suffered and she started the year on the developmental Epson Tour.

And then she climbed her way out of it winning on the Epson Tour taking advantage of sponsor exemptions with solid play and finally cashing in at Columbia Edgewater Country Club for her first win.

Her face was awash in a mixture of champagne and tears especially when she paid tribute to her grandfather who died late last year.

‚ÄúHe always believed I was a champion and today I am one‚Äù Lee said.

This took a great deal of patience and resilience with eight players having a chance to win throughout the final round and every mistake seemingly magnified.

Lee started in a three-way tie with Lilia Vu another former No. 1 amateur at UCLA and Ayaka Furue of Japan. Lee immediately fell off the pace with bogeys on the second and third holes.

‚ÄúI told myself to stay patient because I still had a lot of golf left‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúI managed to get three birdies back and then I kept going.‚Äù

She finished at 19-under 269 and moved to No. 18 in the Race to CME Globe

Darquea's runner-up finish moved her to No. 59 a big week because the top 60 advance to the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in November. Darquea had been ranked No. 108 going into Portland.

The real threat to Lee came from Esther Henseleit of Germany who took the lead with an 18-foot birdie putt on the par-3 13th. She had a 6-foot birdie try on the next hole that caught the lip but didn't drop and she traded birdies with Lee along the back nine.

Henseleit was one shot behind when she came up short of the 17th green pitched about 12 feet long and missed her par putt to fall two back.

She finished with a par for a 66 and tied for third with Narin An (64) Hannah Green (67) Furue (68) and Vu (68).

Maja Stark of Sweden who earned her LPGA card by winning the ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland ran off five straight birdies on the front nine and was among the leaders until she ran out of steam. She shot 66 and finished eighth.

Lee becomes the ninth first-time winner on the LPGA Tour this year.

‚ÄúIt's more than anything I could have imagined‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can't believe it actually. I can't believe I'm standing here after what I went through last year.‚Äù

Lee won eight times at Stanford and won the Mark H. McCormack medal in 2019 as the leading amateur in women's golf. But her confidence took a hit during first her two years on the LPGA Tour which included the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.

It felt like starting over at the start of the year leading her to where she thought she always thought she would be.

PORTLAND Ore. ‚Äî Esther Henseleit feels as though she has been spinning her wheels the last six months on the LPGA Tour. That made Friday at the AmazingCre Portland Classic feel as though she were absolutely soaring.

Henseleit rolled in 10 birdie putts on her way to an 8-under 64 giving the 23-year-old German a share of the lead with Lilia Vu going into the weekend.

Columbia Edgewater is tight and tree-lined with firm greens that roll true. Henseleit kept the ball in play and let her putter do the rest of the work.

‚ÄúI had some easy putts and hit the line and they went in so that went well today"" Henseleit said. ‚ÄúI had many chances but they were not gimmes. I didn't have a tap-in birdie at all.‚Äù

Vu a former No. 1 amateur player when she was at UCLA had four birdies and an eagle on her opening seven holes and then played steadily on the back nine for a 66.

Vu and Henseleit were at 10-under 134.

They were one shot ahead of Carlota Ciganda of Spain who had a 66. The large group at 8-under 136 included another former No. 1 amateur Andrea Lee and one of the hottest players on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in Maja Stark of Sweden.

Stark who played at Oklahoma State has won four times on the Ladies European Tour including the ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland which was co-sanctioned by the LPGA Tour.

She is up to No. 47 in the women's world ranking and at No. 54 in the Race to CME Globe is trying to secure of the 60 spots in the season finale in Florida in November.

Lee started her season on the developmental Epson Tour and then started to break out of a slump with a good finish in Hawaii.

She reached the semifinals of the Bank of Hope LPGA Match Play in Las Vegas had a tie for 15th in the U.S. Women's Open (she replaced Inbee Park as an alternate) and now she is set for the top 60 to get to the CME Group Tour Championship.

Nelly Korda who needs a victory to return to No. 1 in the world never got much going and dropped shots on her final two holes for a 73 that left her six shots behind.

Henseleit opened with a 63 in Thailand in March and wound up in a tie for 12th. That was the highlight of her year. She began missing cuts and spending too much time on Friday wondering if she would be going home early.

‚ÄúI had some pretty rough bumps since Thailand and it‚Äôs great to see something coming your way. I just will try to enjoy it and make the best of it and just give myself chances‚Äù Henseleit said.

‚ÄúIt just felt like nothing really came together‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working really hard and felt like every part of my game has been improving but couldn‚Äôt really get the scores together. So yeah just good that today kind of happened and I didn‚Äôt have to fight too hard for it.‚Äù

Sat 17 Sep 2022

Yasmin Ingham and Banzai Du Loir have completed the cross country phase of the FEI World Eventing Championships with a clear round just 3 seconds over the time leaving them on a total score of 23.4. They are guaranteed a podium position over night going into the final day of show jumping tomorrow.

The duo set off in determined fashion and were glad to get the 'Slide' at fence 7 out of the way. Banzai leaned a little to the right between the two skinny arrow heads at elements B & C but Yasmin kept her line and pushed him inside the red flag on the right.

""All the combinations I rode to my plan A apart from the last water where he jumped quite steep in (a large log drop into water) he just didn't land quite as far out as i'd have liked so we just picked up the five strides instead of the four .... he just grew in confidence all the way and was just looking for the flags""

""It was hard work very intense i think it was the terrain than anything constantly up and down I'm just so glad i am sat on Banzai he felt like he was really at home in the hills""

Commenting about the time Ingham said she was down on the first 3 at least but was able to make up the time on the single fences in the middle of the course and ""as we got down onto the flatter ground it was easier to keep in a rhythm when your up and down the hills you have to prepare for the combinations but when your on the flat its a lot easier""

Going into the final day of her first Senior Championship event in at least bronze medal position Yasmin said ""I could never have even dreamed of being in this position and I know the horse is more than capable I think so much of him he deserves it so much as he is such an incredible all round event horse.""

For now ""It's about Banzai"" said Ingham ""and touch wood tomorrow he will show everyone that he really is the ultimate event horse"".

Photographs taken in stores in Russia show Iranian Coke produced under licence in Iran has made its way into Russian stores. Described by bne‚Äôs Iran correspondent as ‚Äúvery sweet‚Äù the Iranian version of the beverage is taking up shelf space vacated by Russian-made Coca-Cola since The Coca-Cola Company suspended its business in Russia in March in response to Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

The arrival of the Persian Coca-Cola brand came as a shock to Russians looking to quench their thirst with ‚ÄúThe Real Thing‚Äù.

One Russian social media account dubbed the drink ‚ÄúAya-kola‚Äù while another quipped that after two sips of the Iranian Coke ‚Äúyou will be defending the Islamic Revolution and with three sips you‚Äôll be off to fight in Yemen.‚Äù

Soft drinks from several countries have turned up on the Russian market since sanctions and market boycotts disrupted Russia‚Äôs economy according to social media posts. Products from countries including China and Montenegro have been spotted while a Dr Pepper from Poland is also now seen in Russian shopping baskets.

The Russian introduction of Iranian Coke‚Äîwith the product retailing at around Russian ruble (RUB) 60 ($0.99) per can‚Äîsignifies that suppliers in the Islamic Republic are making real headway in sending their products to Russia‚Äôs disrupted consumer markets.

Russian media reports in recent months have described trade entrepreneurs trying to plug dozens of market gaps with Iranian alternatives. The US even fears Moscow is addressing a lack of manufacturing potential for the making of armed drones by acquiring hundreds of Iranian drones.

Iran‚Äôs decades of international isolation since its 1979 Islamic Revolution have forced the country to perfect the emulation of a huge number of products unobtainable in sufficient volumes from abroad or to evade sanctions in sourcing products. Russia is now on the same road and is turning to Iran for advice.

The WBC model is essentially a cooperation driven business model where entrepreneurs like Unnanti will team up with other female entrepreneurs who have also received the necessary training and the members contribute to the business depending on their ability by providing capital or products and then sharing the profits with everyone. The Coca Cola Foundation provides equipment's like freezers laptops pH test kits and other essential things needed to conduct businesses.

To attain financial empowerment a community-based model initiative has more chances of success.

Topoti Rani Majumder is an entrepreneur from Sontoshpur WBC and has been farming organic vegetables and fish along with maintaining a grocery store. With the help of her fellow entrepreneurs she provides services like selling grocery goods vegetables children's food etc.

Topoti Rani Majumder is a successful entrepreneur now but like most rural women she had faced various social obstacles.

""In the beginning it was very tough people would laugh at us make fun of us for trying to operate a business like men do. These same people not only changed their views after they saw our hard work but are also supporting us by becoming our customers. This has helped us have more confidence and ultimately made us realise what we are capable of"" said Topoti.

The unity between entrepreneurs is one of the unique aspects of this Women Business Centre as the emphasis is having financial independence by working together. This goes to show how rural women can not only have a keen sense of entrepreneurship but also solidarity among them.

""My fellow entrepreneurs contribute to the business according to their capabilities when it's time for profit sharing we take as much as we need and focus on developing the business. In addition to the grocery store we are planning to open a computer centre to assist people and students in giving essential training on computer literacy"" said Monika Baroi an entrepreneur from another Pipradanga WBC.

By proposing a compelling love story between hearing and deaf characters McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary have been selected as finalists for the Coca-Cola Refreshing Films contest.

‚ÄúWe had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that.

Refreshing Films

According to the Coca-Cola website ‚ÄúThe Coca-Cola Refreshing Films program is a platform to provide students from partnered schools the opportunity to create content for the big screen.‚Äù

For over 20 years 17 colleges have competed in this program. This year marks the first time RIT students have been given the opportunity to compete.

Not only is this the first year that RIT students will beincluded in the competition but also the first time the Refreshing Films Program included in the competition but also the first time the Refreshing Films Program will include the deaf community as well.

The application process is an undertaking but The application process is an undertaking but that didn‚Äôt stop McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary from taking it head-on.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a script and we work together to develop a first draft‚Äù Ponte-Fleary explained. ‚ÄúWe got help from two [School Of Film and An] faculty members Jack Beck and Frank Deese and went through the whole drafting iteration process.‚Äù

The students also had to create a budget sheet with a hypothetical had to create a budget sheet with a hypothetical limit of $18000 and submit all application materials along with a physical application. McClanahan of $18000 and submit all application materials along with a physical application. McClanahan discussed having to partner up with another student where one student would act as the producer and the other student could fill any other role typically the director.

‚ÄúWe got selected for semi-finals which was 15 scripts out of 500‚Äù McClanahan explained. ‚ÄúFrom there you add things like a storyboard update your script update your budget have lots of meetings with [Coca-Cola] then you submit it; from there there is one winner.‚Äù

Needless to say there was a substantial amount of work put into this project. a substantial amount of work put into this project.

Balancing a Budget

Once selected as finalists the students actually received the $18000 budget to professionally produce their short film.

Does $18000 sound like a lot of money? In the world of professional commercials that budget is stretched thin. The cost of renting equipment providing food attire hair/makeup paying the actors crew and interpreters adds up. As the producer of the film Ponte-Fleary was in charge of the budget and distribution as well as re-distribution as necessary

‚ÄúIt was a challenge‚Äù Ponte-Fleary said ‚Äú$18000 doesn‚Äôt go a long way and we had to re-analyze lots of times.‚Äù

Although the students were not able to receive financial help other people were allowed to offer assistance.

Dr. Gerard Buckley president of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf generously covered the interpreting costs. Shanti Thakur director of the School of Film and Animation (SOFA) helped make sure all of the project's pieces ran smoothly.

Other contributors were the College of Art and Design (CAD) who helped cover insurance for the equipment and Sew-n-City who helped with hair and makeup.

With all of this assistance McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary were able to create the look and feel they had imagined.

‚ÄúWe had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that‚ÄúWe had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that‚ÄúWe had a very warm aesthetic we wanted to go for something wholesome nostalgic and magical and hair and makeup really helped with that "" McClanahan said.

Deaf Representation

A large part of the film was the inclusion of the hard of hearing and deaf communities both on-screen and off. This was one of McClanahan‚Äôs main goals when starting this project.

McClanahan explained the inspiration for the film coming from representing the type of community at RIT the inspiration for the film coming from representing the type of community at RIT since this is the first year RIT is able to participate. The team made sure to incorporate this in all aspects of the film. Originally the plot was centered around two characters: one hearing and one deaf which could originally be interpreted as hanging out as friends. After meeting with the Coca-Cola company they decided to make it a love story.

‚ÄúI wanted to make sure I had deaf crew members because as a hearing person it would be inauthentic not to have anyone on the set if I don‚Äôt understand that community‚Äù McClanahan said. ‚ÄúAlso working with Gabe and being able to add those elements to the character being accurate with the language mannerisms and culture.‚Äù

Although there have been more deaf characters on the big screen in recent times ‚Äì Echo in Hawkeye and Makari in Eternals to name a few ‚Äì this is the first time Coca-Cola would represent the deaf community providing a monumental step towards the representation of more diversity within the film industry.

‚ÄúReally it‚Äôs amazing‚Äù Ponte-Fleary said. ‚ÄúI am very proud that we are able to do this because it is huge. [Coca-Cola] has never had the deaf community involved in anything on the big screen‚Ä¶ I mean really we‚Äôre making history with it.‚Äù

Amazing Perspectives

This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is just the start for McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary. The experience they have had so far is unmatched. From finding out they were chosen as semi-finalists to watching their script come to life the process has been unimaginable.

‚ÄúIt was an amazing feeling‚Äù Ponte-Fleary ‚ÄúIt was an amazing feeling‚Äù Ponte-Fleary said. ‚ÄúYou never know how far you are going to go.‚Äù

One thing McClanahan would like others to take away from the project is thatyou shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to branch out into other communities and cultures.

‚ÄúWhen you bring different perspectives together it creates really great films. It‚Äôs a great time to explore and learn about different people‚Äù McClanahan said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre only creating things from your perspective there are so many other communities that don‚Äôt get represented.‚Äù

McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary wanted to thank everyone that helped make their film possible. There was so much support inside and out and they could never be more thankful.

The Coca-Cola Refreshing Films challenge is all about empowering the filmmakers of the next generation. By being the first students to not only represent RIT but also the deaf community in their film McClanahan and Ponte-Fleary are undoubtedly empowering generations to come.

""The vision was to make sure it was all of our dreams not just the two of us.

In the first of four events Simon Weigang and teammate Manuel Biancolilla raced around the Bahrain International Circuit Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari and Silverstone Circuit.

Race One: Bahrain

Starting strong in qualifying Simon flew all the way to Q3 securing his seventh-place starting position on the grid whilst Manuel endured some PC issues and therefore started in 20th.

Pushing from the back Manuel fought all the way to 16th by lap four. Making the Hard tyres last he was able to jump another position to 15th as he emerged from the pits on lap 21.

For the last seven laps he was able to push on the Soft tyres climbing to 12th place but battled continuously with Nicolas Longuet for 11th. He crossed the line in 12th but dropped to 16th after penalties were applied for causing avoidable contact.

Simon maintained his position for the first half of the race unable to move up as he was stuck in the DRS train. Jumping Dani Moreno in the pits he came out in sixth and pushed on his fresh Medium tyres.

He crossed the finish line in fifth after Thomas Roonhar picked up some damage and dropped down the pack. After Frederik Rasmussen‚Äôs penalty for dangerous re-entry was applied Simon finished in fourth place.

Race Two: Imola

As they lined up for the second race of the year Simon sat in 11th after just missing out on Q3 in qualifying whilst Manuel had troubles getting out of Q1 starting 20th on the grid.

A lap-one crash saw Simon forced to go wide to avoid colliding with any cars picking up an in-game penalty for doing so. After having to slow down to give the position back he fell down the ranks and sat in 14th at the end of the first lap.

By the end of lap seven Simon had climbed to 11th while Manuel sat in 18th place.

Pitting on lap 16 and swapping the Hard tyres for a set of Mediums Simon emerged 13th and was able to rise into the top ten undercutting several drivers.

He crossed the line in ninth and had his penalty rescinded meaning more points for the team. Manuel crossed the line in 16th.

Race Three: Silverstone

Struggling for pace at the British circuit Manuel qualified in 19th whilst Simon had his lap time deleted due to track limits so started in 20thÔªø.

There was a scrap for positions on the opening lap and Simon made the most of this pushing up to 17th before getting stuck in a DRS trainÔªø which hampered his ability to overtake.

Manuel was involved in a lap one incident ending with him off the track and forcing him to retire early in the race.

Going longer on the Hard tyres Simon swapped to the Medium compound and emerged in 18th with seven laps to go. Crossing the line in P18 the team unfortunately took no points home from Silverstone.

Simon Weigang Driver Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team: ""I have mixed emotions after the end of event one. Although I started strong in Bahrain I didn't finish where I wanted for Imola or Silverstone.

""The pace of the car is competitive but it is a shame we had problems in qualifying that we couldn't make up for in the race. Overall we have seen what we can do as a team and know where to improve ready for the next event.""

Manuel Biancolilla Driver Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team: ""Event one definitely didn't go as I had planned. The practice routine I had used up to event one is something we'll need to review.

""Hardware issues have influenced my consistency and hopefully next event they won't be there. The pace is definitely there but there's a lot to improve in one-shot laps race craft and set-ups.

""I'll get a weekend break from all of it and then head straight into practice for event two to come back way stronger.""

Miguel Faisca Team Manager Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Esports Team: ""Having a new driver line-up for this year comes with some challenges and this first event was important to understand our drivers and to know we can help them performs in future races.

""Event one is that time where teams can see how good their preparation was. We went in with no big expectations but came out with an idea of what we need to improve on to become stronger for event two.""Ôªø

The company asked workers to return three days a week in the office. Read more

Comcast employees trooped back to Center City this past week as part of the company‚Äôs national ‚Äúreturn to office‚Äù policy.

On Thursday at lunchtime the food court underneath Comcast headquarters buzzed with a back-to-school vibe with workers waiting in line at restaurant counters and Cafe Click restaurant‚Äôs outdoor tables full. Sunseekers snagged the public chairs on the plaza between 1700 and 1800 JFK Boulevard and the Vernick cafe in Comcast Technology Center seated lunchgoers who hadn‚Äôt seen each other in person in months or even years.

The return of Comcast employees to the office signals a noteworthy moment in Philadelphia‚Äôs pandemic recovery bringing thousands of people back into Center City after more than two years of working from home.

‚ÄòLoosey-goosey vibes‚Äô

A corporate memo sent to Comcast employees in August said all staffers ‚Äî including the 8000 who work in Comcast‚Äôs two Philadelphia towers ‚Äî were expected to work in person on Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays.

In practice it‚Äôs more flexible.

¬ª READ MORE: Comcast workers told to come back to office in-person 3 days a week

One Comcast user experience engineer who works in the Comcast Technology Center described the return-to-office policy as ‚Äúfairly relaxed.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy boss told us that we‚Äôre flexible. Our team is flexible. We‚Äôre not going to be here all the time‚Äù said the engineer who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The engineer said the team is expected to be in the office for larger meetings or to collaborate with other teams but ‚Äúthe vibe I got was loosey-goosey. We‚Äôre supposed to show face a few times a week or a month but no one‚Äôs getting fired‚Äù for not coming in.

Reviews on Glassdoor the first week of return-to-office showed not every Comcast employee is happy about in-person work. At least one person who said they were a senior manager based in Philadelphia wrote that one downside of working at the media giant included ‚Äúmaking everyone return to office for no reason.‚Äù

The campus is starting to return to a post-pandemic normal and a spokesperson said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being very flexible. We want to work with employees to understand their situation to get back into the office.‚Äù Comcast wouldn‚Äôt say how many employees returned this past week.

Packed parking garages more SEPTA riders

In recent weeks more employees have been commuting back into Center City.

Placer.ai found a steady increase in workers returning to Philadelphia throughout 2022: August nonresident workers increased to 56% of the 2019 level up from 53% in July. The highest numbers occur on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday when some have designated days to work in offices. Placer.ai estimates the daily population in core Center City based on anonymized mobile phone location data with separate estimates for the number of residents workers shoppers and tourists who are physically present.

Concessions giant Aramark said all employees are now ‚Äúfully back‚Äù in the office at its new 2400 Market St. headquarters. The company said its approximately 900 employees are working ‚Äúhere in our headquarters. And no mandated days we‚Äôre a full work-from-office company‚Äù according to a spokeswoman.

FMC Tower across the river has approximately 500 employees working at the chemical company and finished bringing everyone back to the office in mid-July 2021. ‚ÄúWe have a two-day-a-week flex allowance that many of our employees use to work from home so our actual in-office population varies day to day‚Äù said a company spokesperson in an email.

But Comcast‚Äôs return had an immediate impact.

Robert Zuritsky head of Parkway Corp. which owns thousands of parking spots downtown said commuter garages in Center City were packed this past week ‚Äúand people who work from home in the suburbs are also coming in Fridays to go to dinner or a show or meet friends.‚Äù

SEPTA‚Äôs ridership also increased by approximately 5% to over 476000 one-way trips the week ending Sept. 14 said spokesman Andrew Busch. That‚Äôs still about half of pre-COVID levels.

‚ÄúAs far as going back to work in person we‚Äôre seeing customers in the multifamily apartment buildings especially developers retrofitting buildings so people can work-play-live at home‚Äù said 215Secure head Dave Pearson citing 1001 South Broad and Washington Avenue a Post Brothers development as one example. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the model for the two days that people work from home while working in office three days.‚Äù

Looking ahead

On Wednesday representatives from Center City District a membership organization and lobbying group for downtown employers were in Comcast‚Äôs lobby to hand out information about Restaurant Week discounts to theaters and museums and other perks to employees ‚Äî some of whom had not been downtown in over two years.

Early data from Center City District show an increase in people walking around downtown likely thanks to Comcast‚Äôs return. Foot traffic on the 1700 block of John F. Kennedy Boulevard on Sept. 13 totaled just over 8000 people according to the Center City District pedestrian counters. That‚Äôs up 24% from August and nearly double that of January.

Comcast employees‚Äô return ‚Äúis a significant impact‚Äù said Paul Levy president of the Center City District. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great they‚Äôve come back. It‚Äôs important to set the standard‚Äù for other employers.

Levy said others will take their cue from Comcast.

‚ÄúOnce one major employer starts to come back those who haven‚Äôt can see what‚Äôs worked and hasn‚Äôt worked‚Äù he added.

Still whether more employees will return to offices or not will be clearer in the coming weeks and months said one recruiter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a mixed bag‚Äù said Sulaiman Rahman president of DiverseForce a recruiting firm. ‚ÄúWe are seeing more companies ask employees to return to office for certain days of the week but we are hearing from more and more candidates that they cannot see themselves going back to a traditional commute to the office‚Äù Rahman said. ‚ÄúIt will be interesting to see if companies can pull this off without paying a price through turnover.‚Äù

Among smaller companies the family-owned investment firm Prudent Management Associates recently moved office space for their 12 employees. Their new address at Two Commerce Square 2001 Market Street has a smaller footprint than at their 1735 Market Street offices. ‚ÄúSmaller offices less money‚Äù said Fred Snitzer managing director at the 40-year-old company.

‚ÄúWe think we have made some significant improvements such as signing a new 10 year lease in center city and moving offices for the first time in 30 years‚Äù he said. The investment firm has about $1 billion dollars under management.

Other employers including tech companies have chosen to remain hybrid by design such as tech companies.

SageFrog Marketing transitioned to a hybrid work model in 2021 allowing employees to work remotely from home or in its Doylestown office. To help alleviate expenses chief executive Mark Schmukler said the marketing firm offers a monthly stipend to all employees for gas or any work-from-home expenses such as cell phone bills WiFi and office supplies.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt plan on changing our current policies due to the gas inflation because it‚Äôs our employees‚Äô discretion if they would like to work in the office‚Äù said Schmukler.

Hybrid work offers an edge when hiring he added. ‚ÄúOur hybrid work model is here to stay as it will allow us to expand our radius for top talent.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwOS85MTQzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Would Universal Buying Warner Bros. Affect Theme Parks?,"How Would Universal Buying Warner Bros. Affect Theme Parks?

The rumor mill is cranking up in Hollywood as chatter gets louder that NBCUniversal might try to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. [See The Hollywood Reporter's Warner Bros. Discovery Has Bigger Problems Than Its DC Search.]

That acquisition could be a dream come true for theme park fans as it would give Universal's theme parks new access to many Warner Bros. franchises including a wide variety of horror IP for Halloween Horror Nights. But a takeover would not allow Universal to create attractions themed to what might be Warner Bros. crown jewels - DC and Looney Tunes.

Six Flags owns the theme park rights to DC and Looney Tunes and that deal would not change with NBCUniversal buying Warner Bros. Discovery just as Universal Orlando's deal with Marvel did not change when Disney bought Marvel. The only way for Universal to get access to DC and Looney Tunes would be to buy those rights from Six Flags or to buy Six Flags in its entirety. But NBCUniversal would have to have bought Warner Bros. Discovery already to make that second option work. Six Flags' contract for the DC and Looney Tunes rights states that if an entertainment company buys Six Flags the theme park rights to those characters revert to Warner Bros. [Who Really Owns the Theme Park Rights to the DC and Marvel Comic Characters?]

But what's the incentive for Universal's theme parks to go after DC? Universal Orlando already has the rights to Marvel and can keep them as long as the company wants. Disney has reached out to NBCUniversal multiple times to offer to acquire those rights for the Walt Disney World Resort and NBCUniversal in so many words has told Disney to go jump into the Toon Lagoon.

Now if Universal had access to the DC rights that might make the company willing to entertain an offer from Disney for the east coast Marvel rights. But unless Disney comes forward with something that Universal really needs the Mouse House is going to have to offer to write a very very large check to get NBCUniversal's attention.

And no the soon-to-expire theme park rights to The Simpsons are not compelling enough to get Universal to give up Marvel especially if NBCUniversal gets Warner Bros. Discovery and can swap in whatever Hanna-Barbera franchise it wants into those spaces. It's not difficult to imagine Hollywood's Springfield becoming Bedrock with the vehicles in The Simpsons Ride becoming the Flintstones' car. Or maybe a Willy Wonka land if Universal does not wish to return to its Hanna-Barbera days.

So what could Universal's theme parks get if NBCUniversal acquires Warner Bros. Discovery? In addition to Hanna-Barbera and Willy Wonka WBD controls Cartoon Network which could deepen Universal's lineup of characters to populate future kids' lands.

Warner Bros. Discovery also controls New Line Cinema which produced Austin Powers Dumb and Dumber Friday The Mask and Elf as well as Friday the 13th A Nightmare on Elm Street Final Destination IT and The Conjuring on the horror side.

A Warner Bros. deal probably does not give Universal the theme park rights to Middle-earth which are now controlled by Embracer Group. ['The Lord of the Rings' Gets a New Owner - Theme Park Deals Next?] Warner Bros. Discovery owns HBO however which brings Game of Thrones into play for the fantasy space.

Other Warner Bros. franchises with potential theme park value include Mad Max The Matrix Blade Runner and Beetlejuice which has appeared recently under license at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights. Warner Bros. also owns the rights to the Wizarding World which it has licensed to Universal but NBCUniversal parent Comcast would save a bundle on those licensing fees if they were just going from one division of the company to another.

But the biggest opportunity for Universal's theme parks might be on the capital side. A Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition would give NBCUniversal ownership of the Warner Bros. studio lot - and Warner Bros. Studio Tour - next door to Universal Studios Hollywood. That immediately gives Universal a second gate in California for its theme park visitors. Eventually Universal Parks leadership would need to make some hard decisions about how the Warner Bros. attraction would fit with its Universal Studios Hollywood neighbor next door while NBCUniversal leadership considers how access to the Warner Bros. studio lot and its soundstages might allow Universal Studios to reallocate more of its current USH studio space for theme park operations.

Ultimately if Comcast decides that NBCUniversal should bid for Warner Bros. Discovery once that opportunity opens in 2024 that decision will rest on the value of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets to NBCUniversal's studios streaming and linear networks with theme parks an afterthought. But this deal would create immense opportunities - and potential challenges - for Universal Parks & Resorts.

You better believe that Universal Parks management is thinking about them right now. So it's understandable that forward-thinking theme park fans might want to consider them too.

Here's how to fix it,"DETROIT (WXYZ) ‚Äî As football season begins and temperatures begin to drop many are eager to kick back and watch their favorite sports teams on game days but many have experienced game broadcasts in other languages.

Many networks now offer Spanish-language broadcasts for many events including sporting events.

In recent weeks 7 Action News has been contacted by many viewers dealing with this issue.

But fret not! There‚Äôs an easy fix.

The issue stems from a setting on your television.

Here are a few tips to change your television setting to your preferred language.

On your remote find the button labeled ""SAP"" ""MST"" or ""AUDIO."" Once located press the button until you find the language you want to hear when watching the game.

If this step doesn't work press the ""MENU"" button on your remote and go to audio settings. In audio settings you will find a list of languages. Simply select the one you prefer.

If these steps are unsuccessful while watching via cable with your cable remote go to the menu then to audio settings where you can choose your preferred language option.

If none of these steps work it may be time to pull out your television manual or contact your cable provider.

Superb and convenient cocktails to satisfy the most discerning palates are now the crack of a pull tab away. Jeffrey Westbrook

It‚Äôs the ultimate question. And it has remained unanswered for 42 years.

‚ÄúHow ‚Äôbout a Fresca?‚Äù Judge Elihu Smails maniacally asked Danny Noonan in Caddyshack. Before the caddie could respond however Smails vigorously tousled Noonan‚Äôs hair to cement their ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù and the scene was over. So I ask you now Mr. Scholarship Winner: Do you want a Fresca?

Of course you do! And you won‚Äôt have to wait much longer to get it the way you truly want it. Constellation Brands ‚Äî a beer wine and spirits heavyweight ‚Äî is partnering with Coca-Cola (owner of Fresca) to deliver a grown-up version of what Smails proffered so long ago. In the fall canned cocktails featuring Fresca will hit the market beginning with separate vodka and tequila versions.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt ignore the fact that we have a passionate fan base within the golf world‚Äù says Alex Schultz who is part of the Constellation team rolling out the Fresca canned cocktails. ‚ÄúIt makes sense because people at golf clubs have been using Fresca as a mixer for years. Now they‚Äôll just be able to grab a cocktail that‚Äôs already perfectly mixed.‚Äù

It‚Äôs fair to say that pre-made cocktails with genuine spirits are tailgating on the road forged by hard seltzers which themselves are all about a convenient low-alcohol alternative to beer. White Claw and its ilk scratched out nearly $9 billion globally in 2021 and that growth is expected to continue.

For those who savor a well-made full-strength cocktail however a golden age of grab-and-go excellence is just underway ‚Äî and the people behind the drinks are very aware their approach to mixology has a natural home on the golf course.

That‚Äôs certainly the case with Jill Burns and Kelly Gasink sisters who cofounded Austin Cocktails. When they were kids the Dallas-born sisters spent summers at their grandparents‚Äô farm in Minnesota. Grandpop Fred was not a country club fella nor a stereotypical farmer. He enjoyed making divots at the local public course where he played in shorts and Birkenstocks grandkids in tow. At least as important to our tale he also had a tradition on the farm. When the hard work was done the family gathered at 1700 hours for ‚ÄúCocktail Time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe used ingredients from the gardens and farm in handmade cocktails‚Äù says Jill Burns who played on the golf team at Santa Clara University. ‚ÄúWhen we were kids we joined in with Shirley Temples but when we were old enough to take part in the cocktails we eventually thought ‚ÄòWe should start batching these.‚Äô ‚Äù

Fred‚Äôs granddaughters are passionate about the taste of their drinks. Kelly is what‚Äôs known as a super taster (that‚Äôs a real thing you can test for) whereas Jill says she likes an ‚Äúalcohol-forward cocktail.‚Äù Together they opt for quality over ease. Rather than using a single supplier for the flavors in their drinks they search yon and hither for complementary tastes. The result is legit cocktails that don‚Äôt taste like they‚Äôre poured from a can.

This summer Austin Cocktails will debut two new tequila drinks. In the meantime try their Fred‚Äôs Ruby Red and savor the vodka grapefruit mint and lime mix. And next time you swing through Austin check to see if the tasting room at their spanking new production facility in The Yard is open.

The good news isn‚Äôt only emanating from Austin fellow professionals. Longtime readers of Rounds know the Transfusion is a favorite and in Virginia there is a new disciple of the Church of Vodka Grape and Ginger Ale. Turner Lewis is a full-time radiologist but during the pandemic he wasn‚Äôt going to the office and his entrepreneurial itch got itchier. Fore Craft Cocktails ‚Äúis a boot-strap effort at this point‚Äù says Turner ‚Äî but our man is making serious inroads with his Transfusion. New drinks are in the works but as for the mother-ship Transfusion Turner says he had an epiphany during its creation.

‚ÄúI wanted real flavors‚Äù says he. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want a 100-calorie drink masquerading as a Transfusion. No moonshine no malt alcohol. I wanted real vodka. I wanted it to taste like a real Transfusion.‚Äù

Can I get an Amen brothers and sisters!

Michael Corcoran hasn‚Äôt emptied enough cans to reach the moon and back ‚Ä¶ yet. But he‚Äôs no quitter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L2dvdi1ob2NodWwtZ2F2ZS1lbGl0ZS1hY2Nlc3MtYW5kLXJlc3VsdHMtdG8tY2FtcGFpZ24tZG9ub3JzLWVtYWlscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Hochul gave elite access ‚Äîand results ‚Äî to campaign donors: emails,"Top aides to Gov. Hochul offered boutique access and customer service to elite deep-pocketed donors keen on furthering their business interests in the state a review of emails shows.

The 161 pages of emails show a vibrant buyer‚Äôs market for those willing to pony up for the governor‚Äôs reelection campaign. So far Hochul has hauled in $34 million for her campaign and is on pace to snag tens of millions more by election day.

In December 2021 Robert Trobe a former deputy commissioner for the city‚Äôs Department of Family and Adult Services was in deep discussions with Team Hochul about a campaign fundraiser he was organizing among non-profit organizations. Trobe now serves as vice president at Alliant Insurance Services.

‚ÄúIf we fix the minimum contribution at $250 and get an average per participant contribution of $300 I think we should be able to raise $30000 to $50000‚Äù Trobe emailed Mackenzie Wasilick finance chief of staff for Hochul‚Äôs campaign committee.

3 Vice President at Alliant Insurance Services Robert Trobe spoke with Hochul about a campaign fundraiser he was organizing among non-profit organizations. Human Services Council

The trove of emails whose content was first reported by the Albany Times Union was obtained by The Post.

But Trobe wanted something in return: Hochul to come out in favor of a cost-of-living increase for state-contracted human services workers who assist New Yorkers combating various forms of addiction.

‚ÄúWhat is critical in the run-up to the primary is the Governor‚Äôs support for inclusion of COLA in the next budget. ‚Ä¶ We had a productive initial meeting with [Director of State Operations] Kathryn Garcia‚Äù Trobe wrote. ‚ÄúIf the COLA commitment from the Governor can be secured it will be extremely helpful in promoting this [fundraiser].‚Äù

In her $216 billion budget released in January Hochul made good pledging $500 million for human services cost-of-living adjustments ‚Äî something Gov. Cuomo had refused to do for every year of his tenure The Albany Times Union reported.

Both Trobe and Garcia did not respond to requests for comment.

In February Trobe personally donated $1000 to Hochul‚Äôs campaign. A virtual fundraiser with non-profit community leaders took place on April 18.

‚ÄúThe governor came for a few minutes and spoke to us. It was a 10-15 minutes thing. Took a couple of questions and left‚Äù Lilliam Barrios-Paoli a former deputy mayor for health and human services who attended the fundraiser told The Post.

The revelations come as Hochul faces controversy for allegedly helping a contributor tied to $300000 in campaign donations get a $637 million contract from the state for rapid coronavirus tests ‚Äî charging New Yorkers twice the price other vendors charged.

3 Wayne Chaplin wanted legislation that would require alcohol to be imported to ‚Äúa licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a premises or warehouse operated by a wholesaler for a period of 24 hours.‚Äù John Parra

‚ÄúIn New York State bribery is basically legal. Donors make big contributions to candidates because they want something in return. And these emails show donors are getting special access special treatment and special help from the governor‚Äôs staff‚Äù said John Kaehny executive director of Reinvent Albany a watchdog group. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably legal and how Albany works but it‚Äôs definitely unethical and wrong. The governor is supposed to serve the public interest not the donor‚Äôs interests.‚Äù

Wayne Chaplin who attended a different Hochul fundraiser near Rochester in October 2021 was similarly blunt about his needs.

The event was hosted by Rob Sands chief executive officer of Constellation Brands an alcoholic beverages producer and marketer and the largest beer importer in the United States.

The Brooklyn-born CEO of Southern Glazer‚Äôs Wine & Spirit was angling to find support for a bill that would ‚Äúrequire alcoholic beverages imported into New York be first delivered to a licensed New York State wholesaler and maintained at a premises or warehouse operated by a wholesaler for a period of 24 hours.‚Äù

Southern Glazer the nation‚Äôs largest wine and spirits distributor would stand to make a killing while critics say the law would make it more prohibitive for smaller distributors and raise costs on consumers.

‚ÄúSee below information that was discussed with the Governor in Rochester‚Äù Chaplin wrote to Micah Lasher Hochul‚Äôs director of policy in a Dec. 7 2021 email. ‚ÄúI wanted to direct the attached to you as a follow up to that discussion as the Governor asked us to follow up with staff.‚Äù He sent along a two page explainer pumping the proposed law.

On the day of the fundraiser five different LLCs ‚Äî all of which shared the same address with Southern Glazer‚Äôs corporate offices in Miami ‚Äî donated a total of $25000. Campaign laws forbid any single company from donating more than $5000 total in a year.

So far Hochul has not taken a public position on the booze issue. But in the background is her husband William J. Hochul who serves as general counsel and senior vice president to Delaware North a Buffalo-based gambling and hospitality giant with wide interests in the alcohol trade as well.

Southern Glazer‚Äôs bill is currently bottled up in the Investigations and Government Operations Committee by its chairman State Sen. James Skoufis (D-Orange County).

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible bill. It‚Äôs bad public policy. What other product that consumers enjoy has to first make a pit stop before it gets to retail? The answer is none‚Äù Skoufis told The Post. ‚ÄúSouthern Glazer they like to cajole they like to try and bribe they like to try and bully ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a very self-interested bill.‚Äù

Both Sands and Chaplin did not respond to requests for comment.

People close to former Gov. Cuomo said they were surprised by the blatant pay-to-play.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs certainly not how we did fundraising or raised money‚Äù said a former top aide. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt appropriate to talk state business and that was strongly strongly discouraged.‚Äù

Reps for Gov. Hochul denied any implication of impropriety.

‚ÄúAs public servants government staff receive communications from a wide range of New Yorkers on a daily basis. We welcome the views of different advocacy groups on policy issues but every decision is made by the Governor and her team based on what is best for New Yorkers. No donation has any influence on any government decisions and we strongly reject any implication otherwise‚Äù said spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays.",,,,,,,,,

Power outages and ""brownouts"" can be both frustrating and inconvenient to wait out. In 2019 Americans nationwide were without power for a cumulative average of 4.7 hours; this according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's annual survey and report (via Cummins). During those outages exactly how many of us went and unplugged our electronics while waiting for the power to return? You may have heard some guidance somewhere at some time advising you to do so during a power outage but the question is is this really necessary and if so why?

It might feel bothersome to run around the house or office disconnecting and unplugging all the devices but it's actually a smart thing to do says Constellation Energy because wavering voltages and surges can damage electronics and appliances rendering them useless even upon full restoration of electricity. Power outages brownouts and surges occur for several reasons including storms grid failure and electromagnetic pulses (EMTs) according to Penny Electric.

With any electric issue always check whether the problem is exclusive to your home or is widespread. As for unplugging your electronics and appliances here's more on that and why doing so is recommended ‚Äî even if you've been fortunate enough not to experience any damage from past power outages yourself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JpbmdzLXBvd2VyLXNjZW5lLW1hbi1tZXRlb3ItZ2FuZGFsZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LOTR: This Rings of Power Scene Has People Convinced The Man In The Meteor Is Gandalf,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JpbmdzLXBvd2VyLXNjZW5lLW1hbi1tZXRlb3ItZ2FuZGFsZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NjaWVuY2UtYW5kLWZ1dHVyZS9uZXctaW1hZ2Utc2hvd3MtbG9ic3Rlci1uZWJ1bGEtZGF6emxpbmctaW4tcmVkLTgwMDAtbGlnaHQteWVhcnMtYXdheS01Nzk3MzUuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zY2llbmNlLWFuZC1mdXR1cmUvbmV3LWltYWdlLXNob3dzLWxvYnN0ZXItbmVidWxhLWRhenpsaW5nLWluLXJlZC04MDAwLWxpZ2h0LXllYXJzLWF3YXktNTc5NzM1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Image Shows 'Lobster Nebula' Dazzling In Red 8000 Light-Years Away,"A new stunning image has revealed the ""Lobster Nebula"" in a fiery red. The image was taken by the Dark Energy Camera an instrument designed to read secrets of dark energy.

Nebulae are star forming regions made of dust and gas. A nebula is usually found in spaces among stars acting as a nursey for new stars.

CTIO/NOIRLab/DOE/NSF/AURA

Studying dark matter

The Dark Energy Camera is an instrument mounted atop the V√≠ctor M. Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. It is part of the Dark Energy Survey project to find evidence for dark energy. Scientists believe that this invisible force is responsible for the expansion of universe.

While the instrument looks for proof of this dark energy the telescope is able to take some mind-boggling images of the universe - like this one released on September 12.

The Lobster Nebula is pictured in the recent image. It is a star-forming region about 8000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. The image shows a region spread across 400 light-years in which bright young stars are spread over the giant cloud of dust and gas.

NASA

The Dark Energy Camera is aimed for high-performance and NOIRLab claims that it can capture even the faintest sources of light. It can deliver 400 to 500 images every night. Recently it reached the milestone of 1 million individual exposures.

An eyewitness tells TMZ ... Tyler and Alex hit up SOTA Wednesday night in Corona Del Mar for some sushi with friends -- including castmate Polly Brindle.

We're told Tyler and Alex weren't overly intimate but seemed more than friendly -- touching each other as they walked out the bar. Tyler can also be seen sniffing Alex.

Our witness says the two ended the night by strolling down the street side-by-side.

The timing is worth noting -- Tyler was havin' a good time with Alex and co. the day we learned about his split from the ""Pitch Perfect"" star. According to sources close to them the breakup had more to do with distance than the cheating rumors.

Sources close to Tyler a former pro surfer tell us there's nothing going on between him and Alex -- claiming it was just a group of 6 out to dinner. But the eyewitnesses say something's fishy about that and it wasn't the sushi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2NlbGVicml0eS1uZXdzL25ld3Mvc2VsbGluZy10aGUtb2NzLXR5bGVyLXN0YW5hbGFuZC1hbGV4LWhhbGwtc3BvdHRlZC1hbWlkLWRpdm9yY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Selling the OC's Tyler Stanaland Alex Hall Spotted Amid Divorce,"More noseys in the future? Hours after Brittany Snow and Tyler Stanaland confirmed their separation he bonded with Selling the OC costar Alex Hall.

Related: Brittany Snow ‚ÄòSelling the OC‚Äô Star Tyler Stanaland‚Äôs Romance Timeline Brittany Snow and Tyler Stanaland have kept their relationship relatively private prior to their 2022 split. ‚ÄúI love being married‚Äù the Pitch Perfect star exclusively gushed to Us Weekly in December 2021. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not any different but being married in a pandemic is really like the test of everything if we can get through that we‚Äôre good to go. [‚Ä¶]

Stanaland and Hall both 33 were spotted enjoying a sushi dinner together at SOTA in Corona Del Mar California on Wednesday September 13. In photos obtained by TMZ the former pro surfer even bent down to listen closely as Hall spoke to him.

While neither Oppenheim Group employee have further addressed the nature of their outing the outlet reported that fellow realtor Polly Brindle joined the Wednesday dinner.

Hours earlier Stanaland announced that he and the Pitch Perfect star 36 had split after two years of marriage.

Related: Selling the OC's Tyler Stanaland's Relationship With Kayla Cardona Explained Brittany Snow didn‚Äôt appear on Selling the OC but her marriage was front and center on season 1 amid questions about husband Tyler Stanaland‚Äòs relationships with his female costars. The first season of the Selling Sunset spinoff started streaming on Netflix on August 24. One of the main story lines follows the backlash Kayla Cardona [‚Ä¶]

‚ÄúAfter time and consideration Britt and I have made the difficult decision to separate. This decision was made with love and mutual respect for one another‚Äù the California native wrote via Instagram on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe have realized we need to take some time and make sure we are each living our most fulfilling and authentic lives. We started this journey as best friends and our relationship will continue to be a priority not only for us but for our dog Charlie. We sincerely appreciate your support and ask for privacy as we navigate this new chapter.‚Äù

Snow for her part shared an identical statement via her Instagram page.

The estranged couple who began dating 2018 sparked split speculation following his seemingly flirtatious appearance on season 1 of Selling the OC.

‚ÄúOne night Kayla [Cardona] did try and kiss me. And then it happened another night as well‚Äù Stanaland alleged on the ‚ÄúReality Life with Kate Casey‚Äù podcast in August ahead of the show‚Äôs Netflix premiere later that month. ‚ÄúOn the show out of respect for her I am just kind of trying to minimize it and brush past it so that ‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt drama. We can all focus on what we should be doing.‚Äù

Cardona 33 for part continually asserted that she would have only made a move if feelings were reciprocated noting that they have since moved on.

‚ÄúMe and Tyler squashed it so long ago and I‚Äôm not the one that [Brittany] should be worrying about‚Äù Cardona alleged to Us Weekly last month referring to Hall. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs clear on who she should be worried about.‚Äù

She continued: ‚Äú[Alex and Tyler‚Äôs friendship is] very inappropriate. I mean very hypocritical ‚Ä¶. [because] I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious I never even touched the guy. You know what I mean? Let alone sit on his lap suck on his nose or get naked [like Brindle‚Äôs skinny-dipping dare]. No one has ever seen me naked. Like I better see a direct deposit before you get all this. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre giving that out like free candy. Like no thank you. Sorry.‚Äù

Stanaland for his part told Us that Snow ‚Äî whom he wed in March 2020 ‚Äî had watched his episodes of Selling the OC and found it to be an ‚Äúentertaining‚Äù program despite him ranking his love for surfing higher than their relationship.

‚ÄúThis is a funny thing. This is such a foot-in-mouth situation and it was meant to be a joke‚Äù he told Us in August. ‚ÄúBut no she knows how much I love surfing but she knows how much I care about her my family. She wasn‚Äôt mad but she was like ‚ÄòYou would say that.‚Äô‚Äù

While Stanaland and the Almost Family alum kept their romance private through the years a source exclusively told Us earlier this month that the twosome had ‚Äúissues prior‚Äù to their breakup statement.

‚Äú[The Selling the OC cast] were aware of there being issues it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs more to the story than they know‚Äù the insider noted on Friday September 16. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always been appropriate with everyone. ‚ÄúNo one ‚Ä¶ knows about him cheating on Brittany with another girl.

But with being ‚Äúred‚Äù (i.e. popular) right now comes the requisite netizen interest and gossip column attention. Recently a well known entertainment gossip site was asked about whether Zhao Lu Si was dating her LLTG costar Wu Lei and the answer was an emphatic no followed by the claim that she had a boyfriend who was a very very good looking top liuliang star. That led to netizens thinking it‚Äôs her WRTW costar Yang Yang (with them being spotted in couple‚Äôs attire) or Xiao Zhan her costar from Oh!

The gossip bloggers also claimed Zhao Lu Si and Wu Lei is all onscreen and have zero interaction offscreen aside from promoting together. Zhao Lu Si‚Äôs agency emphatically called this melon ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and denied it. Another recent negative feedback is Zhao Lu Si giving an interview about how hard she worked to make it and went months at a stretch without any work booked. C-netizens are calling it ‚Äúcrocodile tears‚Äù for playing up the hard ships of making it as a rookie in C-ent when going months without a drama/movie is standard because stars make a ton of money per project plus she‚Äôs had 14 dramas in 5 years which is a super high newbie hit rate.,,,,,,

Here's How,"Costco is a warehouse club that offers discounts on bulk purchases. This can help you cut grocery costs so you can put more money into savings or use it for other financial goals. Costco also has its own brand of products the Kirkland Signature brand which is very popular.

If you want to shop at Costco though you generally must pay an annual membership fee to be eligible to buy items at the warehouse club. But this is actually not the case in every situation. In fact there's one way you can shop at Costco without becoming a member. Here's how.

Could this loophole open the door to Costco shopping without a membership?

If you want to shop at Costco without buying a membership there's an easy way to do it -- if you have a member who is willing to help you.

See if you have a Costco Shop Card you are allowed to come into any Costco location in the U.S. Canada or Puerto Rico and purchase items. And you are also allowed to purchase items online at Costco.com and Costco.ca. You do not have to be a member in order to make purchases at Costco with your Costco Shop Card.

What is a Costco Shop Card exactly? It's just a fancy way of saying a Costco gift card. So basically if you have a gift card to Costco you don't have to be a member to use it and you can take advantage of Costco's low prices and get access to its beloved Kirkland brand items.

Now there is a catch though. Only Costco members are allowed to buy Costco Shop Cards. So you would need someone who is a current Costco member to buy a gift card for you. And once you had spent the balance on your gift card you would need them to get you another card or to reload your existing one.

Obviously this is likely not a long-term solution since you probably don't want to hassle your friends and family with Costco memberships by asking them to buy you gift cards to the warehouse club all the time (even if you do pay them back). But if you're hoping to just try out Costco to see if a membership is worth it or if you only shop there a few times a year for special purchases then this could be a great option for you.

Should you become a Costco member?

Whether paying for a Costco membership is worth it will depend on many factors including how often you plan to shop at the store and whether Costco's prices on the items you regularly buy are discounted enough to cover the membership fee.

If you're struggling to decide and you know a Costco member who is willing to buy a Shop Card for you this can be a great way to test out whether membership is worth paying. You can get a chance to shop at the warehouse club with this approach in order to see if becoming a long-term customer is the right choice for you.

Across the nation the cost of food is on the rise; in fact we haven't seen these kinds of markups since the late 1970s. Although inflation appears to be slowing down it's not as though groceries will just magically get cheaper than they are at present.

Find Out: This Credit Score Mistake Could Be Costing Millions of Americans

A great way to save on food (and avoid waste) is to buy it frozen. Most every supermarket and big-box store has an ample array of frozen foods but the best place to buy such items is at the retail giant that needs no introduction: Costco.

GOBankingRates talked with Julie Ramhold consumer analyst at DealNews.com to find out the eight best frozen items to buy at Costco.

Sam's Club

Eggo Waffles

""At Costco a box of 72 will cost around $12 which works out to about 17 cents each"" Ramhold said. ""Shopping elsewhere you could pay as much as $7.75 for a box of 24 which comes out to 32 cents each. That means Costco is almost half the cost of other stores.""

Costco

Petite Cuisine Mozzarella Sticks

""These are a great thing to keep on hand for late-night snacks or quick game-day foods and Costco has a 5-pound box of them for $17.48"" Ramhold said. ""Other stores charge around $14 for 3.25 pounds -- that works out to $3.50 per pound at Costco vs. $4.40 per pound elsewhere.""

Costco

Kirkland Signature Three Berry Blend

""If you like smoothies this bag of mixed berries is an excellent thing to keep in your freezer"" Ramhold said. ""Costco has 4-pound bags for $16.39 while other grocery stores will have 3-pound bags for $15.49. That breaks down to $4.10 per pound at Costco vs. $5.16 per pound elsewhere.""

Shutterstock.com

Kirkland Signature Organic Strawberries

""If you prefer just strawberries Costco has you covered there too"" Ramhold said. ""A 4-pound bag will set you back $12.78 while elsewhere you can expect to pay around $4.77 for just 10 ounces. That breaks down to 20 cents per ounce at Costco vs. 48 cents per ounce at other stores.""

Costco

Kirkland Signature Italian Style Beef Meatballs

""Get 6 pounds of these for $21.85 at Costco -- they're good to keep on hand and can be added to things like pasta for a quick dinner whenever"" Ramhold said. ""Other grocery stores charge around $11 for about 2 pounds which means you'd pay 34 cents per ounce compared to 23 cents per ounce at Costco.""

Costco

Beyond Burger Patties

""If you're looking for plant-based beef alternatives Costco is a great place to look"" Ramhold said. ""A 10-count package of Beyond Burger patties will cost around $16 at the warehouse club; elsewhere you'll pay closer to $6.53 for just two patties. Costco's deal works out to $1.60 each while other stores are $3.27 each making Costco an easy winner here.""

Story continues

Walmart

Impossible Burger Patties

""If you prefer Impossible over Beyond Costco has those too"" Ramhold said. ""Pick up an 8-count pack of Impossible patties for around $12.67 at Costco or $1.58 each. Elsewhere you'll pay $6.63 or more for just two patties which works out to $3.32 each. Again Costco is a clear winner for meat alternatives.""

Costco

Dr. Praeger's Organic Veggie Burgers

Now he's mad he didn't go to Costco,"Not the best? Ken Wolter/Shutterstock

What would you do if you were famous and loved?

Would you use your power for good? Or would it all go to your head? Or perhaps a little of both?

Also: Sony TV deal: Get the 75-inch X80J series TV for $549 at Best Buy

I only ask because of a fascinating diatribe just offered by very famous actor Diego Tinoco.

I say he's very famous even though I've never heard of him. He's appeared on Teen Wolf On My Block and many other TV shows I've never watched. He also has 4.7 million followers on TikTok. That's famous enough isn't it?

On TikTok he decided use his outsize influence to spend 3 minutes and 18 seconds raging against LG and Best Buy. But more against Best Buy.

He began: ""Do not ever in your life buy anything from LG Best Buy and more than anything don't ever buy that stupid little Geek Squad warranty that they offer you.""

This he followed with: ""Not only do they have absolute terrible customer service but their agents are literal trash at their jobs.""

Also: I went to Best Buy 4 weeks ago. They still won't let me go

Getting punchy?



What could have possibly tormented him so? Well he claims that he spent $3000 on an LG TV from Best Buy. He says his TV had some ""minor damage horizontal lines across the screen and it was glitching out.""

Is that minor damage or a considerable annoyance? You must decide. Tinoco however insists the Geek Squad ""agent"" told him this was fixable but accused him of having damaged it. That damage couldn't be fixed under the policy Tinoco says he was told.

This tale became quite strained. Tinoco says the Geek Squad agent accused him of ""punching and mishandling my television.""

Perhaps many have wanted to punch their televisions -- or even throw things at them when their team is losing -- but how many really go through with it?

Next says Tinoco the agent left and another agent arrived. ""It was hard to mislike the guy"" says Tinoco.

Until that is ""The man literally grabs my television on the bottom left corner of the screen squeezes it as hard as he possibly can and my TV blacks out completely. Glitches broken done.""

Was it still hard to mislike him? I don't know. I do know that Tinoco claims this agent told him the TV would turn on in 10 minutes. It didn't he claims.

Also: Which LG TV is right for you and how do the top OLED models compare?

Tinoco says he was forced to call LG Best Buy and the Geek Squad. ""And they all tell me the same damn thing: There's nothing we can do for you.""

Now says Tinoco he'll go to Costco or Sam's Club and ""buy anything other than an LG TV.""

Best not to react?



Tinoco says he's been buying from Best Buy for 10 years and has always bought the Geek Squad warranty. He's never needed to use it until now. So he thought he'd spend these minutes advising his millions not to buy LG TVs or shop at Best Buy.

This may be a story that's familiar to some. It may well be that somewhere along the way you feel as if you've been shortchanged by one of these brands.

But here's the part I found most fascinating. I contacted Best Buy and LG and didn't receive a response. I looked through the TikTok comments and couldn't find anything. It seems that both companies have chosen not to react at all to these allegations and provocations.

Also: I asked a Best Buy salesman for the best Windows laptop. He had no doubts

Which is odd. Most companies would likely try to smooth things over -- hey it's a famous person -- and even turn it in their own direction. They might apologize for at the very least a misunderstanding that may have led to a misliking.

In this case though -- at least as far as I can see -- nothing. The video now has more than 2 million views. It's had more than 12500 comments most thanking Tinoco and saying they've had similar experiences. (Disclosure: I've had plenty of encounters with Best Buy -- I also have an LG TV -- and I have always encountered quite good service).

Also: A Microsoft user raged against Outlook. Microsoft lovers fought back

You might conclude then that both LG and Best Buy feel there's more to this story and they're just going to try and let it slowly disappear.

It's an interesting approach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYyNDYwODgvbW9uZXktZXhwZXJ0LWNvc3Rjby1wcmljZS10YWdzLWRlYWwv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbW9uZXkvNjI0NjA4OC9tb25leS1leHBlcnQtY29zdGNvLXByaWNlLXRhZ3MtZGVhbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I‚Äôm a money expert ‚Äì the last digit of Costco price tags lets you know if you‚Äôre getting the best deal...,"HUGE savings is just one of the reasons why customers love shopping at Costco and a money expert has yet another hack.

In a recent Instagram post Queenie shared a price tag trick so shoppers can save even more at Costco.

The price tag hack

Price tags hold more information than you may realize.

For example Queenie said that if a price ends in .99 that means the amount is usually full price.

However if the price ends in .97 then it's a clearance item and was most likely marked down from its regular price

Lastly if the price ends in .00 or .88 this means that a manager marked it down.

This typically indicates that an item has been heavily discounted and Costco is trying to get rid of the product.

More Costco hacks

Another important trick to consider while shopping at the large chain is to look for asterisks.

If you see an asterisk on the price tag make sure to grab it.

That's because asterisks indicate that your Costco location will not be restocking that particular product.

As a result the item in question is probably marked at the cheapest price.

Another great way to save on products specifically wine is to shop the Kirkland brand as they're usually half-off or more.

Plus many times the brand name you want is just slapped with a Kirkland label so you're in fact getting a high-quality wine made by top wineries exclusively for Costco.

Another way to save is to take advantage of its cheaper gas prices.

Prices could be anywhere from $0.10 to $0.40 per gallon cheaper at the retailer.

The wholesaler is also known for saving shoppers at least 15% on different restaurants or movie tickets when you buy gift cards at its store.

It offers gift cards for steakhouses and other fine dining BBQ burger joints coffee shops ice cream parlors streaming subscriptions and even gift cards for the spa.

This discount hunter reveals how you can score $50 in gift cards at Costco this month when you buy certain products.

Why it Won't Happen Soon According to a British Scholar,"How soon can Prince William assume the throne and become King of England? It's not likely to happen while King Charles III is still alive.

There was no power struggle or leadership void atop the royal family when Queen Elizabeth II died. King Charles III immediately assumed the throne and one of his first acts was to issue a statement about his mother‚Äôs death. Charles‚Äô coronation celebration ‚Äî complete with a traditional pie made from an American parasitic fish ‚Äî will be the first time he wears the crown. But how soon can Prince William assume the throne and become king of the United Kingdom? Will he wear the crown while Charles is still alive?

(l-r) King Charles III and Prince William | Max Mumby/Getty Images

King Charles III is in the spotlight following Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs death

Queen Elizabeth II was England‚Äôs longest-reigning monarch. She was nearly universally adored and her steady leadership helped guide England into the 21st century. She never seemed to crack under pressure but some royal watchers aren‚Äôt saying the same about King Charles.

Two videos that made the rounds within a week of the queen dying have some royal watchers comparing his behavior negatively to the queen‚Äôs. In one situation he urgently motioned to aides to clear his desk for him. In another video Charles showed frustration and lost his temper when a fountain pen leaked on him. Losing her temper was something the queen rarely did (if ever).

He‚Äôll have to wait several months to actually wear the crown but Charles is the U.K.‚Äôs king and his first son is next in line. But when will Prince William become king of the United Kingdom? Could he ascend to the throne while Charles is still alive?

Prince William is unlikely to take the throne from Charles while the king is living

King Charles III sits on the throne but some British would prefer to see Prince William become king sooner rather than later. As recently as May 2022 most respondents to a YouGov poll in the U.K. preferred to see William leapfrog Charles to take the throne.

William might be more popular but that doesn‚Äôt make him a king. Charles‚Äô comments at his accession ceremony indicated he intends to rule for the rest of his life. ‚Äú[He] indicated very clearly that he expects to be king for the rest of his life‚Äù Robert Hazell a professor of government and constitution told the Washington Post. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòI am not planning to abdicate any more than my mother was‚Äô but that‚Äôs what I understood him to be saying.‚Äù

Charles‚Äô biographer once said the king felt as if his reign was being erased preemptively because of William‚Äôs public popularity. However William isn‚Äôt eager to assume the throne ahead of his father. the prince knows it‚Äôs his father‚Äôs birthright to be king.

English monarchs don‚Äôt abdicate and there are laws that dictate the order of succession

In addition to Charles‚Äô apparent desire to wear the crown for the rest of his life and William‚Äôs desire to let him there are other reasons William won‚Äôt take Charles‚Äô place on the throne.

For one English monarchs don‚Äôt abdicate. According to the official royal website Edward VIII was the last person to relinquish the throne. He chose love over power as he stepped aside so he could marry divorced American Wallis Simpson. And technically he only abdicated his right to become king since he was never crowned. Charles won‚Äôt go against that longstanding precedent simply because the public wants it to happen.

Additionally as WaPo writes English laws factor into accession. The Act of Settlement states that the monarch‚Äôs heir must be the monarch‚Äôs direct successor. A 2013 law adjusted the accession rules and ended the law that males come ahead of females in the line of succession.

As much as some British want Prince William to take over for King Charles III as soon as possible tradition and laws will prevent it from happening.

Think train!',"Florida Times-Union

Next week (Sept. 19-25) is Rail Safety Week which aims to help the public make safe decisions around trains and tracks. Although most Americans today know the dangers associated with drunk driving distracted driving or texting while crossing the street not enough attention is given to the dangerous and illegal risks people take around railroad tracks.

According to preliminary statistics from the Federal Railroad Administration 614 pedestrians were killed and 526 injured in trespassing incidents on railroad tracks in 2021 with an additional 236 fatalities and 668 injuries resulting from vehicle-train collisions at rail crossings. In fact every three hours in the United States a vehicle or person is struck by a train.

In Florida last year there were 36 trespasser deaths and 21 injuries along with 22 grade crossing fatalities and 46 crossing injuries (as of Aug. 2022).

So why is this happening and what can we do about it?

In our distracted society people may become complacent or might not understand the need for caution near railroad tracks and trains. Pedestrians and drivers often simply do not realize that it is dangerous and illegal to walk on railroad tracks or how long it takes the average train to stop.

Everyone can save a life in their community by sharing the rail safety message and remembering this simple phrase: ‚ÄúSee Tracks? Think Train!‚Äù Visit oli.org to learn more take our Rail Safety Pledge and find safety tips to share with your friends and family. Together we can stop track tragedies ‚Äî during Rail Safety Week and all year round.

Learn suicide warning signs before it‚Äôs too late

When I look at how society deals with mental illness a very insightful quote by Daniel J. Boorstin comes to mind. Boorstin said ""The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance ‚Äî it is the illusion of knowledge.‚Äù

With the misconceptions of mental health that continue to prevail this quote truly resonates. Prejudice and ignorance should not be the answer to this crisis.

Rather it should be education and understanding.

Sadly since citing our first-hand experiences with suicide two years ago the suicide rate has gone up. Families of loved ones are left to deal with the aftermath of such a tragedy forever asking themselves if it could have been prevented. I have personally known eight people who chose this ending and it was a God-awful experience every time.

These warning signs of suicide are indicators that a person may be in acute danger and may urgently need help:

Talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself;

Looking for a way to kill oneself;

Talking about feeling hopeless or having no purpose;

Talking about feeling trapped or being in unbearable pain;

Talking about being a burden to others;

Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs;

Acting anxious agitated or reckless;

Sleeping too little or too much;

Withdrawing or feeling isolated;

Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge; and

Displaying extreme mood swings.

Don't be fooled by medical ‚Äòexperts‚Äô

The Sept. 10 letter from Marie Schaefer (‚ÄúExperts clear on when life begins‚Äù) is false and misleading.

It is false because there is no scientific consensus as to the beginning of human life and the citations of her ‚Äúexperts‚Äù are misleading. As a pediatric subspecialist I had never heard of the American College of Pediatricians (ACP) and for good reason.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a professional organization that was founded in 1930 and has 67000 members. The ACP is an advocacy group with roughly 500 members was founded in 2002 and is focused on opposing abortion rejecting adoption by gay parents and supporting discredited conversion therapy. The Southern Poverty Law Center actually has the ACP listed as a hate group.

The other source in her letter Michael Egnor MD is noted for his opposition to abortion and rejection of evolution. His views on these topics are widely debunked.

The fertilized zygote and embryo clearly represent a potential human being not an actual human being. At a very real level the ethical issues around abortion represent the relative autonomy of a potential human (the zygote embryo or fetus) and that of a human mother. There is nothing in science to answer that question.

It's too bad such a misleading letter was published without context.

What goes around comes around

The writings of late German philosopher and Holocaust survivor Hannah Arendt have garnered new attention and discussion with Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency (and his quest to regain it). Her views are called to mind with recent proclamations warning of the impending demise of American democracy and replacement with an authoritarian totalitarian or semi-fascist state.

Her central theme is ‚Äúthe violation of truth‚Äù and ‚Äútruth and politics don‚Äôt stand on common ground.‚Äù

We should be mindful of election conspiracies along with malicious intent to control the electoral and voting process. Destruction of vital institutions ‚Äî the media elections judiciary Department of Justice and national security ‚Äî historically portend a worrisome future.

Governor DeSantis through his various education initiatives could be included in her warning: ‚ÄúThe aim of totalitarian education has never been to instill convictions but to destroy the capacity to form any.‚Äù George Orwell in his dystopian novel ‚Äú1984‚Äù voiced a similar warning related to education: ‚ÄúWho controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.‚Äù

Finally as philosopher George Santayana stated more than 100 years ago (and history consistently proves) ‚ÄúThose who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.‚Äù

Questionable penalty for city attorney

Former city attorney for Jacksonville Beach Christopher Ambrosio was convicted last week of third-degree felony child abuse. This was reduced from lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim 12- to 16-years-old and contributing to the delinquency of a child.

Under the initial arrest charges he could have received a sentence of up to five years in prison. His sentence at the lesser charge netted no contact with the victim or other minors therapy and submitting his DNA sample to law enforcement. However he will not be placed on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's child sex offender list.

After reading the details in the Sept. 12 Times-Union article I have to ask myself: Why does a city attorney only get a slap on the wrist? Will the Florida Bar revoke his license?

Is this justice that a 51-year-old man basically gets away with harming a young girl who may be emotionally scarred for life? Where were her parents in all of this to allow an unsupervised ""sleepover"" visit?

Who am I to judge? I am a father of two daughters and grandfather to three girls and I am very frustrated at this sad situation.

Vote for economy or basic rights?

I hear many people list ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù as their most important consideration in determining how they will vote in the November elections. I would remind these folks that the economy has historically been cyclical. It always has been and probably always will be. It is already trending up and will come roaring back in a few months or a year or so no matter who is president and it will remain vibrant until the next inevitable downturn. We have been through this cycle for generations.

In stark contrast many of our precious civil liberties including ‚Äî but not limited to ‚Äî the right to vote and a woman‚Äôs right to control her own body may be lost forever if the tyranny of the radical right is allowed to prevail.

Something to think about very seriously when entering the voting booth on Nov. 8: Would you rather put up with an (admittedly) uncomfortable but temporary economic squeeze or are you willing to sacrifice some of your most basic rights in a democracy?

New law will penalize homeless

The City of Jacksonville is about to criminalize panhandling under the pretext of preventing traffic fatalities. Unfortunately this is a mean-spirited trend that's catching on across the nation ‚Äî virtually criminalizing people for the misfortune of having fallen into homelessness. Just over the summer a city in Tennessee became the very first in the nation to make it a felony to remain on public property. Yet the city government will not make any provisions for homeless people to relocate.

Perhaps the most repugnant and therefore abundantly hypocritical aspect (of at least some of these scenarios) is that the same governmental officials who are criminalizing homelessness use the exact same process to adopt laws and loosen regulations to allow the wealthy to receive corporate welfare. Formally called ""economic incentives‚Äù it allows executives to further enrich themselves while simultaneously refusing to require that a small percentage of said funds be used to ameliorate the odious problem of homelessness.

Glaring history omission

On page A2 of last Sunday‚Äôs edition was the ‚ÄòToday in History‚Äô section for Sept. 11.

9/11 forgotten?

Last Sunday Sept. 11 I noticed the glaring omission of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the section titled ""Today in History."" The only mention in the whole paper was a reprinted article on an airline executive's remembrance of that day.

The terrorist attacks of 9/11 still should've been included and listed there. What does ""Never Forget"" mean to you?

For all of their unique attractions none of them has been without irritation. So none of them have been big sellers. Which makes you wonder how thirsty Britain will be for this one the C5 X. Which is a pity because it's actually quite good and ploughs a unique furrow compared with the relentlessly sport-obsessed German opposition. In technical terms it might not be as revolutionary as some of those forebears but the non-conformist body more than makes up for it. Look carefully and you might even spot some cheeky nods to Citroen's quirky Eighties heyday.

But what actually is it? There isn't really an answer to that question. In some ways it's a big hatchback except the tail end is longer and there's no loading sill so you could use it as an estate. The body is raised up slightly like a crossover's and there's a bit of lower body cladding. But the roof isn't as high as a crossover's and the drag and weight are lower. It's also quite hulking in the metal. So it's a bit of many things but not wholly anything except Citroen thinks a new thing. So does it look a bit of a mongrel? It's a confidently handsome thing. For sure it doesn't look like anything else. You wouldn't say 'there's an estate' or 'there's a crossover'. The face allows it to be recognisable as a modern Citroen while the interestingly shaped arches and floating roof give some intrigue to the side profile. The rear end gets more LED lights and no fewer than two spoilers. For those interested the drag coefficient is an impressive 0.29.

Is it a boat to drive? Despite the height and softness the C5 X doesn't go all Marie Rose at the first corner. Not at all. The steering's really well done and roll is well checked. It manages to feel both substantial yet light ‚Äì especially the three-cylinder petrol one. Whatever you look for in your car Citroen is to be applauded for offering something a bit different and we like how the C5 X quite overtly focuses on comfort and does it well. It encourages you to be smooth and progressive with your driving to get the best out of the set-up.

And of course the powertrains are pretty critical to the experience here. There are two petrol engines ‚Äì one with 128bhp and one with 178bhp ‚Äì both exclusively available with eight-speed auto gearboxes. They're straightforward and pleasant enough and they let you bowl down a B-road pleasantly enough. There's also a plug-in hybrid which does miracles for fuel economy on short trips and BIK tax and gives you lovely silent urban electric running. But on curvy roads it casts a miserable shadow on throttle response gearchange strategy and braking progression. Don't say we didn't warn you. Click through to the driving tab for more. How much will it cost me? In the UK prices start at ¬£27790 for the base spec petrol-powered C5 X. That puts it in the ballpark of a fair number of estate and crossover rivals although it is a lot of car for the money. Top-end is the fully-loaded PHEV at ¬£39960. If you‚Äôre worried about depreciation (it‚Äôs a big Citroen so of course you are) then Citroen points to its much improved residual values. It claims that from January 2021 to June 2022 it improved its residual values across its range by 17.3 per cent. That was apparently compared to an industry standard of 11 per cent in the same period so whatever Citroen you‚Äôre running it should hold its value better than before. Will the C5 X be the same? Only time will tell. What are its rivals? Good question. Citroen does quote a few ‚Äì things like the Mazda 6 Tourer the Skoda Superb Estate the Volkswagen Arteon Shooting Brake and the Genesis G70 Shooting Brake. And that‚Äôs before you enter the world of many crossover options in the same price bracket.

What's the verdict? ‚Äú When you look at what people might own ‚Äì a big estate or crossover most likely ‚Äì the C5 X is fine value ‚Äù"

Andre wants to know if he should change the oil early on our brand new Ram Cummins diesel ‚Äî it‚Äôs an intense debate.

There is quite a debate out there among truck folk about whether or not you should change the oil early. I mean diesel pickup trucks ain‚Äôt cheap. Nowadays people are easily dropping over $60000 on a work truck. With that kind of investment it makes sense to me that some owners are premature to service their rigs.

Obviously it all depends on the truck‚Äôs work-cycle. Under-worked daily commuter heavy-duty trucks are not uncommon. There are trucks that are often underused and rarely display their full potential. Then there are heavy-duty trucks that are constantly towing and/or hauling. They are pushed hard in some cases ‚Äì harder than they were built for. These over-worked trucks belong in their own category.

Andre went to Blackstone Labs to test the current oil in our 2022 Ram 2500 Cummins just to see how the engine is doing after about 8000 miles of use. Although we have loaded and towed with the Ram sometimes with heavy items we‚Äôve never even approached its overall capabilities. Overall we‚Äôre nearly in the ‚Äúunder-worked‚Äù category.

The results from Blackstone Labs was very positive and they seemed to echo what both the automaker and experts have said in the past: change it every 15000 miles. Our man Alex who also owns a Cummins 2500 sated that he does his oil changes often eschewing the manufacturers‚Äô recommendations.

[I] Go early to change the oil. If I have to pay over $60000 on a truck I have no problem dropping about $100 on an oil change. Alex

Andre feels like the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendation is the right one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDIyLzA5L2N1bW1pbnMtamFtZXN0b3duLWJhci1hc3NvY2lhdGlvbi1sZWFkLWJhdHRsZS1vZi1idXNpbmVzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cummins Jamestown Bar Association Lead Battle Of Businesses,"Cummins (890) and Jamestown Bar Association/City Court (730) led the competition in the 34th annual YMCA Battle of the Businesses in the Large and Small Divisions after the women‚Äôs miniature golf and axe throwing events Thursday.

Singapore-born Tim David is likely to make debut in Australian colours during the three-match series in India. T20 specialist David who was raised in Western Australia burst into the spotlight in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) last season and has become hot property as a hard-hitting finisher in global leagues. His strike-rate was 194.41 in the previous edition at PSL where he accumulated a staggering 278 runs from 11 encounters.

He also played some powerful knocks representing Mumbai Indians in the previous edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). In India his strike-rate was even better. He accumulated 186 runs from 8 matches at a strike-rate of 216.27.

David 26 played 14 T20Is for Singapore. With the team missing the services of all-rounders Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis through injuries David is expected to fill in the absence.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O -0.16%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

With its 4.4% dividend yield and monthly dividend payouts investors in search of passive income can't go wrong with Realty Income stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9raWRzLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXZhY2NpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Parents hesitate to give kids under 5 covid vaccine worrying health officials,In June when the Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of coronavirus vaccines for children younger than 5 physicians expected apprehension among parents ‚Äî after all 4 in 10 parents with young children said they would definitely not get their youngsters vaccinated according to a July Kaiser Family Foundation survey.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53d2Vlay5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3d5ZGVuLWJsdW1lbmF1ZXItYW5kLXRoZWlyLXdpdmVzLW1hZGUtc3RvY2stdHJhZGVzLXRoYXQtcmFpc2UtY29uZmxpY3Qtb2YtaW50ZXJlc3QtcXVlc3Rpb25zLW55dC1zYXlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wyden Blumenauer and Their Wives Made Stock Trades That Raise Conflict-of-Interest Questions NYT Says,"Conventional wisdom in personal finance is that working stiffs with a 401k plan should stay away from individual stocks and just buy mutual funds that track broad market indexes like the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500.

Unless you‚Äôre a hedge fund manager or you have money to burn that‚Äôs your best bet most financial planners say. Individual companies can crater just as often as they soar and the risk is just too great for nonprofessionals.

Many members of Congress ignore that advice even if they handle legislation that affects companies‚Äô fortunes. That causes both conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflict. Neither is good.

After a few high-profile cases of legislators making well-timed trades based on government information about COVID-19 (we‚Äôre looking at you Richard Burr) The New York Times this week gave congressional trading the full data-dive treatment examining trades for every member between 2019 to 2021.

They found 97 legislators out of 535 with dicey deals done by themselves or by family members including two of Oregon‚Äôs longest-serving Democratic leaders: U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer.

Wyden made the list because his wife bought and sold shares of Exxon Mobil and Shell while he sat on committees that handled energy issues the Times said. Wyden also made trades in companies run by executives who testified before the Senate Finance Committee while Wyden was the top Democrat on the committee the Times said.

A spokesman for Wyden told the Times that he and his wife keep their finances separate.

Blumenauer made the list because of trades by his wife too the Times said. She traded shares of CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group both of which offer Medicare Advantage plans. Blumenauer sits on the House Ways and Means Committee which has authority over Medicare the Times reported.

Blumenauer himself purchased stock in defense company Raytheon on Feb. 24 the day Russia invaded Ukraine the Times said. He sold the shares on March 14 the Times said. Among other weaponry Raytheon makes the Tomahawk cruise missile.

The trade was the result of a ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù Blumenauer‚Äôs office said.

‚ÄùThe congressman has long believed that members of Congress should not trade individual stocks‚Äù a Blumenauer spokesperson told the Times. ‚ÄúDue to a miscommunication his financial advisers purchased some stock on his behalf. When this was reported to him he immediately ordered it sold (at a loss) and gave unequivocal direction that he should not hold any individual stock.‚Äù

Trigger warning: this piece contains jokes about mental illness. If you have a problem with that I‚Äôm happy to show you my medical records and a trunk of CVS receipts. I write for The Ankler under a pseudonym for obvious reasons.

Recently I talked to a younger writer who had just finished her first week on a new show. On the first day the showrunner made a point of making health a priority. Covid testing was mandatory and people were encouraged to take the day off if they felt sick. This was encouraging a far cry from the old days when ‚Äúcome to work unless you‚Äôre dead or you‚Äôre dead‚Äù was the rule. Still when she told me she was a few minutes late that Friday because of a therapy appointment I got worried. ‚ÄúOkay but you didn‚Äôt actually say it was a therapy appointment. You made up another reason. Right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äù she said. Her boss had literally just told everyone that health was a priority. And mental health was just as important as physical health. Descartes was full of shit: the mind and body are one. A depressed person needing Celexa was no different than a diabetic needing insulin. I nodded. Then I said ‚ÄúFOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON‚ÄôT EVER DO THAT AGAIN. Tell him your mom died. Tell him a tree fell on your garage. Tell him you had a ‚Äògirl problem‚Äô he won‚Äôt want to know any more. Anything but ‚ÄòI was at therapy.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he said‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs full of shit! This is the most hypocritical business on Earth. Always assume they‚Äôre full of shit until proven otherwise.‚Äù

I know it sounds harsh but I was trying to help. I knew who her boss was. He was older. A Boomer. Or maybe not technically a Boomer. A Boomer-Gen X cusp. Either way I knew instinctively that he was the kind of person who despite saying all the right things he‚Äôd been ordered to say in whatever HR-mandated struggle session they‚Äôd wrangled him into attending would ultimately balk at a writer coming in late because of a therapy appointment. He and his cohort had been programmed to see missing work as laziness and asking for help as weakness. Older Gen X liberals may talk the talk and tweet the tweet when it comes to politics but when it comes to their own career success it‚Äôs Ayn Rand time! This guy probably had a Wellbutrin prescription and a few therapy anecdotes of his own but an employee‚Äôs mental health wasn‚Äôt going to get in the way of making CBS‚Äô 14th most popular show. Not on his watch. He and I were both in our own ways the exemplars of Hollywood‚Äôs new Mental Health Generation Gap.

DRI,Darden Restaurants,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYmFsZHdpbjJrLmNvbS9nL21pbGxlZGdldmlsbGUtZ2Evbi8xMjI2MDMvYXNkZmFzZGZh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Here's an updated Milledgeville chain restaurant ""Wish List""","Baldwin2k News recently asked its Facebook followers to rank the chain restaurants they'd most like to see come to Milledgeville one through three.

Most people didn't follow the rules and just named one restaurant while other people named closer to 10 restaurants. Nevertheless it's the thought that counts and the 100-plus comments offered some insight into the chain restaurant ""Wish List"" for Milledgeville.

Here are the five restaurants that were named at least five times:

1) Red Lobster ‚Äì 21

2) Panera Bread ‚Äì 19

3) Olive Garden ‚Äì 16

4) Cracker Barrel ‚Äì 9

5) Golden Corral ‚Äì 6

Milledgeville-Baldwin County currently has just one sit-down seafood restaurant ‚Äì Down South Seafood. Although really tasty Down South Seafood is only open on Friday and Saturday evenings and plus it's pretty far out in the boonies. This would probably explain much of the clamoring for Red Lobster.

There's always been the theory that Red Lobster ""only opens in towns with an interstate."" Dublin for example has a Red Lobster located off of Interstate 16 and Laurens County only has a few thousand more people than Baldwin. Plus Laurens doesn't have the legions of college students from suburban Atlanta with seemingly endless disposable income.

CLICK HERE to meet the Williams ""family""

So is it true that Red Lobster only open in ""interstate towns?"" Is it company policy? Well based on the map of Red Lobster locations in Georgia there's no hard-and-fast rule about opening solely in interstate towns although the overwhelming number of Red Lobster locations in Georgia are located along an interstate (see screen grab below). All totaled out of the 20 Red Lobsters in Georgia only two are not in interstate towns ‚Äì the one in Albany and the one in Athens. Albany has the 10th largest population of Georgia cities and Athens the fifth.

The same generally is true for Olive Garden which received the third-most votes in the Baldwin2k poll. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were part of the same corporation up until 2014 ‚Äì Darden Restaurants. Although the two restaurant chains are no longer in the same family Olive Garden follows the same pattern. Out of the seven Olive Gardens in Georgia two are not interstate towns ‚Äì Albany and Waycross. The population of Waycross/Ware County actually is smaller than the population of Milledgeville/Baldwin County.

So for anyone holding their breath for a Red Lobster or Olive Garden in Milledgeville Olive Garden likely is more likely to happen based on the fact that there's a location in Ware County which is smaller than Baldwin County and likewise not located along an interstate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the models the 1500 Laramie G/T and 1500 Rebel G/T were added just this year.

Enriching the Ram 1500 features are color options with 15 exterior shades from which to choose.

While the Ram 1500 line offers a wealth of creature comforts with these trucks it's all about work. For example Ram brags of having the most powerful half-ton diesel pickup on the market (480 foot-pounds of torque). The line also features a maximum 12750 pounds of towing capacity and 2300 pounds of payload.

Historically the Ram half-ton diesel rivals the power output of early 1970s diesel versions of three-quarter-ton trucks.

The riding and handling of the 2022 is also enhanced with an industry segment exclusive link-coil rear suspension system with optional four-corner air suspension.

Chief among the truck's innovative features is the Uconnect 5 system that employs a 12-inch touch screen offering split-screen capability 360¬∞ camera views and content from SiriusXM. Active safety and security systems include adaptive cruise control forward collision warning blind-spot monitoring and Ready Alert Braking.

The 2022 configurations both for two- and four-wheel-drive trucks include a Quad Cab (6.4-foot bed) or Crew Cab (5.7- or 6.4- foot bed).

Class-exclusive features include the RamBox cargo management system relocatable anchor points in the bed and a new multifunction tailgate that includes a center bed step.

Videos by American Songwriter

The homage saw his friends colleagues and family play tribute to his cherished discography as well as a career retrospective that put his enormous legacy in perspective. The trip down memory lane for Gill prompted us here at American Songwriter to do the same. Below we‚Äôre going through just 8 of a book‚Äôs worth of iconic Gill tracks that are loved by the country community and the world over.

1. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Our Love Start Slippin‚Äô Away‚Äù (from I Still Believe in You)

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Our Love Start Slippin‚Äô Away‚Äù is a particularly catchy gem from Gill‚Äôs catalog. Released in 1992 the track is a waltzing appeal to his lover to keep their relationship intact. Despite being a little beat down in the lyrics the rest of the song is infectiously upbeat. With Gill‚Äôs soaring vocals and that incredible melody it is hard to shake this one once you‚Äôve gotten a taste.

2. ‚ÄúOne More Last Chance‚Äù (from I Still Believe In You)

Taken from the same album as ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Our Love Start Slippin‚Äô Away‚Äù comes this bluegrass-infused track about a wife who has had just about enough of him coming home drunk. In an effort to get a little TLC she hides his glasses and his car keys but she made the fateful mistake of forgetting his ‚Äúold John Deere.‚Äù Playfully disparaging and a foot-stomper to boot there is a good reason ‚ÄúOne More Last Chance‚Äù has endured as one of Gill‚Äôs top tracks.

3. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Hard To Kiss The Lips At Night That Chew Your Ass Out All Day‚Ä¶‚Äù (from The Notorious Cherry Bombs)

Country supergroup The Cherry Bombs reunited in 2003 and deemed themselves a bit more ‚Äúnotorious‚Äù than their previous iteration. In the group Gill joined forces with his long-time friend and colleague Rodney Crowell among others to record their first official album as a band. Though their one album didn‚Äôt see the same success he was enjoying as a solo artist the Cherry Bombs are still a notable stop along our journey through Gill‚Äôs career.

As for which song to highlight we‚Äôre choosing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Hard To Kiss The Lips At Night That Chew Your Ass Out All Day‚Ä¶‚Äù If there is one thing we love it‚Äôs a bit of a sly number that appeals to our most unabashed natures and this track is surely that and then some. The video is something to behold as well.

4. ‚ÄúPretty Little Adriana‚Äù (from High Lonesome Sound)

Slowing things down ‚ÄúPretty Little Adriana‚Äù was inspired by a murder of a 12-year-old girl named Adriane Dickerson who was shot outside of a Nashville supermarket in 1995. Gill writes with a deep tact from the parent‚Äôs perspective while his warm vocals shoulder the emotional weight. As evident by the first three songs on this list it‚Äôs certain that Gill knows how to write a track that gets the blood pumping but he has his fair share of somber notes as well.

5. ‚ÄúWhen I Call Your Name‚Äù (from When I Call Your Name)

Keeping things the same tempo ‚ÄúWhen I Call Your Name‚Äù sees Gill in a similarly dejected state. The song is a certified crooner. It doesn‚Äôt get more classic country than this. Singing A note on the table that told me goodbye / It said you‚Äôd grown weary of living a lie / Oh your love has ended but mine still remains / But nobody answers when I call your name Gill paints a lonesome picture that is perfect for those quiet nights when you need a little reassurance that someone out there is alone with you.

6. ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Tell You Why‚Äù (from Common Thread: The Songs of The Eagles)

To represent Gill‚Äôs time with that little underground band he likes to hang out with from time to time you know ‚Äì The Eagles ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking at his cover of ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Tell You Why‚Äù from the 1993 tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of The Eagles. Gill‚Äôs version of the ballad is a standout from the record and sees the vocalist infusing a good amount of R&B into the track via a Hammond B-3 organ and a saxophone solo. Gill makes the track his own while hanging on to what made it a classic in the first place.

7. ‚ÄúWhenever You Come Around‚Äù (from When Love Finds You)

Another slow-burning chart-topper ‚ÄúWhenever You Come Around‚Äù is an unrequited love tale of the highest caliber. Beautifully written and impeccably delivered this track has made its way around the country circuit since its release notably with a cover by Willie Nelson for his Band of Brothers album.

8. ‚ÄúGo Rest High On That Mountain‚Äù (from When Love Finds You)

Few songs cut right to the heart quite in the way that ‚ÄúGo Rest High On That Mountain‚Äù does. This heartbreaking ode to a departed loved one was started by Gill after the passing of his friend and fellow country singer Keith Whitley. He finished up the song after his brother passed away four years later. With harmonies by Ricky Skaggs and Patty Loveless this song is truly an unparalleled tearjerker.

33-year-old Kaylee Hampton and 13-year-old Cail Dyal died in a crash on County Road 660 in Desoto county.

‚ÄúI have to go to work just to not look at the four walls and cry‚Äù Kathy Griffin said.

Kathy Griffin says it hasn‚Äôt been easy since the crash that killed her daughter and grandson on September 2 2022.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol a driver of a sedan collided with the rear of a John Deere utility vehicle that Kaylee's husband was driving.

Kaylee's husband James and younger son survived the crash.

James is still in the hospital and is expected to be home soon but Griffin said it‚Äôs still a long road to recovery.

She said thanks to the workers at Desoto Memorial Hospital her son-in-law and grandson survived.

‚ÄúThey lined up the firemen they lined up the EMT they lined up the nurses while that doctor tried to save my grandson and they all took turns doing CPR on my grandson.‚Äù

Now the entire community is chipping in to help.

Local businesses and community members donated food and items for a silent auction to raise money.

Ashley Beck is one of Kaylee‚Äôs childhood friends. She also helped organize the event.

She says Kaylee will be remembered as a caring person.

‚ÄúShe was a loving person there for you at any drop of a dime‚Äù Beck said.

DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9iYWdnYWdlLWNsYWltLWRlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1jaGllZi1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLW9mZmljZXItYWxsaXNvbi1hdXNiYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Delta's chief customer experience officer always packs on business trips,"Allison Ausband started her career at Delta Air Lines in 1985 as a flight attendant. Over the last 37 years she has consistently risen in the ranks at the Atlanta-based carrier including leading more than 20000 Delta flight attendants as senior vice president of in-flight service as well as serving as vice president of reservation sales and customer care where she was responsible for more than 37 million customer contacts across 10 engagement centers in four countries.

Now Ausband is executive vice president and chief customer experience officer at Delta. Needless to say she‚Äôs one of the most experienced executives in the travel industry‚Äîand an expert at preparing for business travel too.

Ausband recently shared more with Fortune about the must-have items she never leaves home without.

Reliable technology

I started my career at Delta as a flight attendant and picked up some packing habits that are hard to break. One lesson that‚Äôs stuck with me all this time is reliability ‚Äì while I‚Äôm not a deep sleeper I didn‚Äôt ever want to be late for a trip as a flight attendant. An extra alarm clock was mandatory for me as a backup to my hotel-room alarm clock and a wake-up call. Obviously technology has come a long way since then so I‚Äôve gone from packing a physical alarm clock to ensuring I have my power cords. Now I organize all of my chargers and adaptors in our Someone Somewhere amenity kit; I have one in every bag. And I never leave home without my iPad.

Minimalist packing style

I‚Äôm a minimalist when it comes to most of my travel; that‚Äôs another habit that has stuck with me from my flight attendant days. I‚Äôm usually flying for business so I pack only what I need‚Äîwhatever I‚Äôm flying in gets worn into the evening. There‚Äôs no need for extra weight in the suitcase. And hey less weight means more fuel conservation on the airplane too. A set of packing cubes always comes in handy so I can separate out what I need and see it all clearly in my suitcase.

Transitional power suit and sneakers

I truly believe a good pantsuit can function as a suit of armor and it‚Äôs one of my favorite pieces to style. But the key here is that it‚Äôs transitional. I always pack a suit that can be worn with the same shoes I leave home wearing. Sneakers are my new best friend with suits. I‚Äôm definitely getting my steps in during my airport visits and these platform sneakers are typically what you can find me in. They‚Äôre functional and comfortable and they dress the suit down enough so that I‚Äôm able to wear it meeting customers and colleagues during the day and then grabbing dinner at night.

Breathable workout clothes

I‚Äôm sure other road warriors can relate to the struggle of finding time to fit in a workout. I know my own Apple Watch constantly reminds me to close those pesky rings! So now Lululemon running leggings are a staple when packing for any trip business or pleasure. It‚Äôs the only item I don‚Äôt contemplate. Having comfortable clothes that make me feel good makes the workout that much easier to complete. And thankfully when I don‚Äôt get to the workout on the ground I can still get some stretching in onboard with one of our Peloton classes on Delta Studio.

Plane-friendly skin care

Frequent fliers know hydration is key at 30000 feet so another must for me is plane-friendly skin care. We recently brought clean beauty brand Grown Alchemist onboard. They‚Äôre helping us stock our Delta One amenity kits with 100% natural cruelty-free plant-based skincare and body products. I‚Äôve become addicted to their Vanilla Watermelon lip balm to keep my lips moisturized throughout travel‚Äîit has a permanent place in my carry-on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWNoZWNrZWQtYmFnLWZlZXMtc2t5bWlsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta will soon let you redeem miles for bag fees on many more flights,"Want to check a bag on your upcoming Delta Air Lines flight? That'll cost you $30. Or if you go with a new option it'll cost 3000 SkyMiles.

While the $30 fee for a checked bag has long been a staple in the industry Delta this month is rolling out the ability to pay luggage fees with SkyMiles.

Delta first trialed this offering back in late 2019 for flights departing from Columbus Ohio and Greensboro North Carolina; however it put the program on pause for much of the pandemic. Now the airline is ready to expand the trial.

""SkyMiles members with flights originating from most domestic airports can pay for standard checked bags fees with miles instead of paying in cash during check-in on Delta.com the Fly Delta app and at a kiosk at the airport"" according to the carrier's newly updated website.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

This option will soon be available on bookings with up to nine passengers. It's set to roll out in the coming days and weeks for flights departing from most domestic airports according to carrier spokesperson Drake Castaneda.

Earlier this month Delta launched this alternative payment method for flights departing from seven key airports though the airline declined to specify which airports.

That said if you don't see the option to pay with SkyMiles during check-in you're likely not alone. It'll take some time for the carrier to deploy the technology nationwide and Delta expects to communicate more information about this option early next month.

The last domestic airports that'll receive this functionality will be hubs such as John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) due to the complex nature of the bag operations there.

At the outset SkyMiles can only be used to cover standard checked bag fees. Flyers can't use miles to pay excess and overweight baggage fees.

Expect to pay 3000 SkyMiles for the first bag. Compared to the cash cost of $30 it's likely not worth redeeming your miles well below the 1.41 cent per point TPG valuation. It wasn't immediately clear how much Delta would charge for a second checked bag which usually retails for $40.

Of course if you have just a few miles in your account with no particular use in mind then it might make sense to redeem them for bags.

Delta Medallions SkyTeam elite members and premium-cabin customers who are entitled to complimentary checked bags will continue to receive those benefits without any interruption.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Alternatively if you hold a Delta co-branded credit card you can get the first checked bag free for you and up to eight additional traveling companions.

Of all the U.S. airlines Delta has been perhaps the most aggressive about blurring the lines between cash and miles. The airline has rolled out the ability to purchase upgrades and many other ancillaries with miles.

In fact you can even purchase a bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne in the Sky Club using miles. At 13000 miles for a $195 bottle it's actually one of the best deals out there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdXBncmFkZWRwb2ludHMuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsdGEtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtaG90LWZvb2QtcmV0dXJucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta is Bringing Back Hot Food to First Class [New Entr√©es Desserts],"Beginning in March 2022 Delta will be returning hot food to its first class cabins on domestic flights ‚Äî a sign of a return to normalcy following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Up to this point most flights both over and under this length have received prepackaged snacks or boxed meals but soon we will see a return to plated meals and some additional revisions to the meal service.

What Will My Flight Offer?

Each flight will offer a different service depending on the destination routing and length. In short meal service levels return to mostly pre-2020 offerings.

Delta One

Delta One seats on Delta‚Äôs most premium transcontinental routes (New York (JFK) to both Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) among others) has had a return of hot food since June of 2021. This onboard service will continue and there will be little changes in the way it will be presented going forward.

Flights Over 900 Miles Plus Flights to and From Mexico Central America and the Caribbean

This is where the biggest changes will come. Beginning March 1 2022 and continuing out over that week hot food will return to first class.

Some new entr√©es will be added:

Ginger beer-braised osso bucco

Wild mushroom ravioli

Chicken cacciatore

French bread pizza

Barbecue beef short ribs from Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q (on select flights departing Atlanta)

Some new desserts include:

Ricotta cheesecake

Frozen Greek yogurt with cherry syrup

Strawberry rhubarb and pretzel tart

You can expect an entr√©e appetizer and dessert on most flights where a meal is offered. Delta tends to serve most meals on 1 tray on normal domestic or local international routes without a Delta One product to allow for easy service and cleanup.

On all meal service flights there was always be a full bar service in first class so you can have your choice of beverage with unlimited refills.

Flights Under 900 Miles

For now flights under 900 miles will contain a full drink service and packaged snacks.

These snacks include:

Biscoff cookies

Almonds

Rold Gold pretzels

USDA-certified organic bars from Kate‚Äôs Real Food (the dark chocolate cherry and almond bar is on offer at the moment)

Hot Tip: Learn how to upgrade to first class on Delta Air Lines flights in our helpful guide!

Final Thoughts

The return of hot food to premium cabins signifies the return to somewhat normal standards of flying and is an exciting improvement to premium cabin passengers and elite customers. Over time we hope more service standards become improved and meals get even better but it‚Äôs nice to see some meals return for now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kb3VnbGFzLWRjLTgtaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,63 Years Ago Today The Douglas DC-8 Entered Service,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kb3VnbGFzLWRjLTgtaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2l0YS1haXJ3YXlzLWhlYWRpbmctdG93YXJkcy1wcml2YXRpemF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ITA Airways Heading Towards Privatization | AirlineGeeks.com,"[ News ] By Vincenzo Claudio Piscopo

In recent days consultants from the Italian government‚Äôs ministry have been sorting out draft contracts for the final sale of Italy‚Äôs national airline ITA Airways. As already known it had been announced on Aug. 31 that it had been chosen by the Italian government to go ahead with an exclusive negotiation with the consortium formed by Certares a U.S. private capital company Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM.

For this reason ITA Airways reopened on September 16 its Data Room which holds the Italian airline‚Äôs most confidential documents. Entering was Certares the U.S. fund that is exclusively negotiating and also a group of experts in international shipping routes from the U.S. company Delta Airlines.

According to the Italian newspaper ‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù the two counterparts have already exchanged drafts of the two final divestment contracts namely the Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) and the Shareholders‚Äô agreement (Sha) which regulates relations between shareholders.

However despite these very concrete demonstrations of interest the general elections on September 25 and the formation of a new government in October are imminent deadlines that should not be underestimated. Certares Delta and Air France-KLM have allowed the Italian state to have 45 percent of ITA‚Äôs shares (as opposed to MSC-Lufthansa which would leave no more than 20 percent) meaning the Italian state would retain two of the five board members with broad veto powers over strategic decisions and the ability to appoint the airline‚Äôs president. The shareholding structure would then consist of Certares with 40.1 percent Air France-KLM with 9.9 percent and Delta with 5 percent and 45 percent the Italian government as the majority shareholder.

The election of the new Italian government in October represents the deadline for the sale of ITA Airways since if it is passed it would mean having to start over or even blow up the privatization.

Another factor forcing an accelerated timetable is rising fuel prices. ITA Airways about a week ago announced that there may be cash flow problems in November which if not resolved in time will make it impossible to face the coming season.

This week Kingsbridge-based venue Twenty Seven announced on its Facebook page that next Monday September 19 it will be offering special takeaway menus in celebration of the Queen.

While orders have poured in the business has also received a backlash from some people accusing it of profiting from the Queen's death. It has prompted the restaurant to explain that is simply coming up with 'new ideas' to keep the business afloat and to make the day of the funeral even more of a special and memorable occasion for its customers.

Next Monday has been declared an extra national bank holiday so that individuals businesses and other organisations can watch the state funeral which is due to start at 11am at Westminster Abbey in London. Schools will also be closed for the day.

Government guidance states it is up to individual businesses whether they remain open or not and if they give staff the day off. A long list of stores have announced they will be closing ranging from Greggs to McDonald's.

However independent businesses like Twenty Seven which have already publicly shared how it is struggling due to soaring energy bills say it is 'constantly' fighting to financially keep the restaurant's doors open. Twenty Seven is owned by award-winning chef Jamie Rodgers.

It's name comes from the age Jamie was when the restaurant opened five years ago. Since Covid Jamie has publicly shared how the business has had to contend with recruitment issues and having its electricity bills soar almost three times higher than pior to the coronavirus pandemic.

Next Monday Twenty Seven it is offering its customers a Queen's brunch/ luxury afternoon tea priced ¬£25 which is available to collect between 9am to 3pm. In the evening it is offering a lobster or beef wellington banquet to collect from 5pm to 8pm priced ¬£50 per person.

Within 24 hours of announcing the menu on Facebook it had received orders for nearly 100 boxes but it was not all good news.

Jamie posted on the restaurant's Facebook page yesterday: ""We also had a few emails from people being rather unkind saying we were trying to profiteer off such a sad day and we should close to pay our respects to the Queen. Anyone who actually knows 27 will realise we are here for the customer not just for profit.

""In lockdown we regularly dropped off a ¬£10 roast dinner to East Prawle to a lovely elderly lady who now comes in every week for lunch. When KFC/ McDonald‚Äôs closed we fought right through diversity to bring people food that they craved but couldn't readily get hold of.

""I'm now constantly trying to come up with ways to give people affordable access to a fine dining experience through this financial crisis. It will only be me and Claire working that day anyway.

""We‚Äôve just got back from a short break away and the idea came to us around the pool when Claire said 'let‚Äôs make afternoon tea and watch the Queen's state funeral'. I said 'if I‚Äôm making it for us I may as well make it for everyone.'

""We truly meant no harm or offence. Thank you to everyone who purchased the boxes; we can all raise a glass together with a luxury picnic.

""We were just trying to offer a service as it seems everyone else is shut which we completely understand but with nine bank holidays already this year we do have bills to pay and I need to keep my business afloat in these troubled times. That's why I'm constantly trying to think of new ideas to keep my doors open.""

""One email said 'shame on you for taking commercial advantage on this sad occasion'. When I first got the emails I thought a lot of people would be negative but everyone on Facebook has backed us up and some have even ordered on the back of it.""

Identifying PII data and other sensitive information in flight the new SNS feature leverages pattern matching machine learning models and data protection policies to simplify data protection and compliance in applications that exchange high volumes of data.

One of the first managed services on AWS SNS uses the publish/subscribe model for delivery of messages supporting both standard and FIFO topics. For standard topics only owners can now enable message data protection to scan messages in real-time for sensitive data and provide detailed audit reports or block the message delivery. Otavio Ferreira senior software development manager at AWS and his team explain:

With message data protection for SNS you can scan messages in real time for PII/PHI data and receive audit reports containing scan results. You can also prevent applications from receiving sensitive data by blocking inbound messages to an SNS topic or outbound messages to an SNS subscription. Message data protection for SNS supports a repository of over 25 unique PII/PHI data identifiers. These include people‚Äôs names addresses social security numbers credit card numbers and prescription drug codes These capabilities can help you adhere to a variety of compliance regulations including HIPAA FedRAMP GDPR and PCI.

Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-data-protection-policies.html

Customers can define an audit policy to determine whether any of the systems are inadvertently sending or receiving sensitive data or use a block policy to prevent the delivery. Other supported data identifiers include credentials such as AWS secret access keys and device identifiers such as IP address and MAC address. David Boyne senior developer advocate at AWS tweets:

This is pretty neat. Using policies to detect PII information and audit or block messages in flight is awesome. Great for EDA applications as you scale them in orgs it's so easy to add PII information into messages/events be interesting to see this being used

Discussing possible use cases Ferreira and his team write:

Consider an application that processes a variety of transactions for a set of health clinics an organization that operates in a regulated environment. Compliance frameworks require that the organization take measures to protect both sensitive health records and financial information.

The new CloudWatch metrics MessageWithFindings and MessageWithNoFindings track how frequently PII/PHI data is published to an SNS topic and the amount of sensitive data published to a topic.

Source: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/09/amazon-sns-preview-message-data-protection-sensitive-data-in-motion/

Amazon SNS message data protection is currently available in a subset of AWS regions. The pricing of the new feature is based on the amount of payload data scanned with a minimum of 1KB of message scanning and the amount of audit report data generated: with prices depending on the region message scanning starts at 0.08 USD per GB and audit reporting starts at 0.19 USD per GB.

Yes Hong Kong will lose its status because of its travel restrictions

Hong Kong‚Äôs strict Covid-19 prevention strategies have driven foreign businesses away. According to a survey by the city‚Äôs European Chamber of Commerce nearly 50 per cent of European companies are planning to move out of Hong Kong.

What‚Äôs more many people are debating whether Hong Kong will lose its status as an international financial hub. I think it will unless the government drops its travel restrictions soon.

Most countries have decided to ‚Äúlive with the virus‚Äù with people not needing to wear masks even when they go out. But Hong Kong thinks differently and that is hurting us. Under the city‚Äôs ‚Äú3+4‚Äù model travellers must undergo three days of compulsory quarantine at a designated hotel followed by four days of ‚Äúmedical surveillance‚Äù at home. Besides they will be tested for Covid-19 daily during that period. This is very troublesome so most tourists avoid Hong Kong. Also many major international events in the city have been cancelled.

Some people may think Hong Kong‚Äôs Covid-19 curbs are not a problem because of the development of technology. However face-to-face gatherings are different from online meetings. We are not robots. Humans need interaction with their fellow professionals and business partners. A majority of students prefer having physical lessons instead of online classes. I believe it is the same in the adult world.

Hong Kong‚Äôs quarantine restrictions have led to a lull in investments in the city and an exodus of talent across financial and many other industries.

With countries such as Canada Britain and Australia opening up new immigration pathways for Hongkongers many young skilled professionals as well as wealthy families are planning to leave their hometown.

Education Bureau rejects survival plans by 2 under-enrolled secondary schools

A total of 140500 Hongkongers had applied for Britain‚Äôs BN(O) programme up to June this year and 95 per cent ‚Äì 133124 people ‚Äì had been approved. This allows successful applicants and their dependents to live work and study in Britain for up to five years after which they can apply for citizenship.

Also thousands of students have left Hong Kong to study abroad. Teachers are leaving too. I fear for the city‚Äôs future.

Hong Kong needs a concrete plan for ending its quarantine requirements if it is to reconnect with the rest of the world retain key talent and maintain its competitive edge as an international financial centre.

No the Hong Kong market is stable and can withstand shocks

Some believe that China‚Äôs overhaul of Hong Kong‚Äôs political system coupled with the strict Covid-19 restrictions means the end of the city‚Äôs status as an international financial hub. Yet more than two years after the introduction of the national security law and with the ongoing pandemic Hong Kong is still a regional hub for international business attracting people from all corners of the globe.

Hong Kong remained third in the Global Financial Centres Index after New York and London even as a series of measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus weighed on the city‚Äôs economy.

A Hong Kong government spokesman noted the city‚Äôs financial markets have continued to function ‚Äúin an orderly manner‚Äù despite uncertainties from the Covid-19 pandemic. Major global banks and financial institutions including BlackRock and Citigroup remain dominant players in the city. These are signs that the city continues to make progress amid turbulent times.

Face Off: Will a vaccine pass be effective in containing Covid-19?

Hong Kong‚Äôs status as a global financial centre has been enhanced since the handover because it is now acting as a bridge between mainland China and the rest of the world.

Beijing‚Äôs support is also providing Hong Kong with fresh opportunities to further boost its reputation. Hong Kong can take advantage of the development of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) where new foreign enterprises and talent will be based. The GBA comprises Hong Kong Macau and nine municipalities on the mainland.

While Hong Kong has made good progress it has not always been plain sailing. The city was rocked by the 2019 anti-government protests and now the pandemic.

Hong Kong students head back to school as Covid-19 cases surge

But the Hong Kong market is stable because global investors are confident about its ability to withstand shocks. Hong Kong offers many advantages ‚Äì it has no capital controls while a fully convertible currency and solid infrastructure make it a top attraction.

Even though Hong Kong is now a part of China the city will still be a top destination for foreign businesses. Being an international financial hub is less about politics and more about efficient management so there is no doubt that Hong Kong is still No 1 in the region.

From what I have seen Hong Kong will remain one of the world‚Äôs leading financial centres for years to come.",,,,,,

Inflation has made it hard to buy much with a buck these days.

$1 pizza has disappeared. Dollar stores aren‚Äôt dollar stores anymore.

So wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to start paying with $2 bills instead?

‚ÄúIf you had a $2 bill perfect‚Äù said Heather McCabe a writer and $2 bill evangelist who runs the blog Two Buckaroo chronicling her spending with twos and other people‚Äôs reactions. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very useful thing to pay for a small amount.‚Äù

Yet the $2 note is the unloved child of paper currency.

It‚Äôs considered a curiosity to some and scorned by others in the United States. The myths around the $2 bill ‚Äî nicknamed ‚ÄúTom‚Äù by fans because it features Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs portrait on the front ‚Äî are endless. Many Americans think $2 bills are rare are not printed anymore or have gone out of circulation.

Wrong.

$2 bills are lighter to carry around in our wallets than ones cleaner and more efficient. MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle/Getty Images

The Treasury Department‚Äôs Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) will print up to 204 million $2 bills this year based on an annual order from the Federal Reserve System. There were 1.4 billion $2 bills in circulation in 2020 according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve.

But $2 bills account for just 0.001% of the value of the $2 trillion worth of currency in circulation.

BEP doesn‚Äôt have to request new $2 bills each year like it does for other bills. That‚Äôs because $2 bills are used so infrequently and last longer in circulation. The Fed orders them every few years and works down the inventory.

‚ÄúMany Americans have pretty dubious assumptions about the $2 bill. Nothing happened to the $2 bill. It‚Äôs still being made. It‚Äôs being circulated‚Äù McCabe said. ‚ÄúAmericans misunderstand their own currency to the extent they don‚Äôt use it.‚Äù

Bad luck

The United States first issued $2 bills beginning in 1862 around the time the federal government first started printing paper money. Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs portrait was on the two until a new series was printed in 1869 with Jefferson.

But the deuce was unpopular and never gained a foothold with the public.

A major reason: The the $2 bill was considered bad luck. Superstitious people would rip off the corners of the bill to ‚Äúreverse the curse‚Äù making the bills unfit to use.

‚ÄúHe who sits in a game of chance with a two-dollar bill in his pocket is thought to be saddled with a jinx‚Äù the New York Times said in a 1925 article. ‚ÄúThey have been avoided as ill-starred.‚Äù

The two was also known for keeping controversial company. It was associated with gambling where it was the standard bet at racetracks and prostitution.

And during the nineteenth century crony candidates frequently used $2 bills to bribe voters. Someone holding a $2 bill was thought to have sold a vote to a crooked politician.

The Treasury Department during the 1900s tried unsuccessfully several times to popularize the use of the $2 bill. In 1966 it gave up and discontinued printing the bills ‚Äúbecause a lack of public demand.‚Äù

But a decade later as the United States approached the bicentennial the Treasury designed a new $2 bill series with a portrait of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back.

The aim was to cut the number of $1 bills in circulation and save the Treasury money on production costs.

But the relaunch in 1976 failed. People viewed the new version as a collector‚Äôs item and hoarded them instead of going out and spending them.

The Postal Service offered to stamp them only on April 13 the first day they were issued in honor of Jefferson‚Äôs birthday unintentionally adding to the idea that they were commemorative bills -‚Äî a misconception that continues to this day.

‚ÄúThe press and public now tend to link the $2 bill with the Susan B. Anthony dollar under the general heading of ‚Äòfiascos‚Äô‚Äù the New York Times said in 1981.

There‚Äôs no rational reason why $2 bills aren‚Äôt as popular as other bills said Paolo Pasquariello a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. But people exhibit a preference for multiples of 1 and 5 he said.

Another reason $2 bills never took off: Cash registers invented in the late 1800s were never designed with a place to hold them so cashiers didn‚Äôt know where to stash them.

‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt an alteration of cash registers for $2 bills‚Äù said Heather McCabe. ‚ÄúThe infrastructure of paying for things didn‚Äôt change. There was not an adjustment of how people work with that bill.‚Äù

If cash registers had a familiar slot for $2 bills the bill would be more popular she argued.

$2 subculture

But there are people who swear by $2 bills. In fact communities and subcultures have developed around them.

US Air Force pilots who fly U-2 spy planes always keep a $2 bill in their flight suits.

Since the 1970s fans of Clemson University‚Äôs Tigers football team have paid and tipped with $2 bills -‚Äî ‚ÄúTiger Twos‚Äù ‚Äî in other cities‚Äô restaurants bars shops and hotels. The tradition started as a way to prove to Georgia Tech in Atlanta that it would benefit the city to schedule games against Clemson.

‚ÄúThere is a degree of popularity to them. There is a sense of excitement‚Äù said Jesse Kraft a curator at the American Numismatic Society. ‚ÄúBut as far as putting them back into circulation that‚Äôs the key that‚Äôs missing.‚Äù

Kraft is a proponent of adopting $2 bills more widely.

He notes that it‚Äôs about half as expensive for the Treasury to print a $2 bill than higher denominations which come with costlier security features on the paper. It‚Äôs also more efficient to print $2 bills than $1 bills because the Treasury can print twice as much for the same amount of money and requires less storage.

John Bennardo who made a 2015 film about $2 bills called ‚ÄúThe Two Dollar Bill Documentary‚Äù has made it his mission to ‚Äúeducate people and enlighten them and start using $2 bills in their life.‚Äù

In short he concludes $2 bills are underappreciated in the United States and a way for strangers to meet and engage.

‚ÄúYou will get remembered if you use a $2 bill‚Äù Bennardo said. ‚ÄúIt has this ability to connect people in way that other bills don‚Äôt. It opens up a dialogue between you and the cashier.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a practical bill with inflation. But it‚Äôs social currency as well.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9waWN0dXJlLXJvY2tzLXRvLWdldC1wdWJsaWMtYnVzLXNlcnZpY2UtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMTEzMDFmMC0zNWY5LTExZWQtOGZlYS02N2ZjNTYyMGY2NTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Picture Rocks to get public bus service for first time,"For the first time Sun Shuttle will expand its services and provide public transportation to the Picture Rocks area.

Driver Killed in Multi-Vehicle Crash in Jefferson Davis Parish

Jefferson Davis Parish ‚Äì On September 17 2022 shortly after 12:00 p.m. Louisiana State Police Troop D was notified of a three-vehicle fatal crash on LA Hwy 26 about a half mile south of LA Hwy 102 in Jefferson Davis Parish.

The crash claimed the life of 75-year-old Larry Andrew Doucett of Hathaway.

The preliminary investigation revealed a 2005 International DuraStar (Forestry Bucket Truck) driven by 40-year-old Alfredo Guilamo of Katy Texas was traveling south on LA 26.

At the same time the driver of a 2017 Hyundai Accent stopped for traffic that had stopped in front of him.

Guilamo failed to stop and traveled into the northbound lane of travel in an attempt to avoid striking the Hyundai.

As Guilamo steered to the left the right side fender of a portable wood chipper being towed struck the rear of the Hyundai.

After the initial impact with the Hyundai the bucket truck traveled into the driveway of Dollar General and struck the left side of a 1999 Chrysler Town and Country van being driven by Doucett.

Both vehicles entered a roadside ditch which caused the bucket truck to overturn and come to rest on top of the Chrysler.

Despite being properly restrained Doucett sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The front seat passenger in the Chrysler who was properly restrained sustained serious injuries and was transported to area hospital for treatment.

The driver of the Hyundai and his passenger were both properly restrained and not injured. Guilamo was properly restrained and not injured.

Toxicology samples were obtained and will be submitted for analysis. This crash remains under investigation.

While this crash remains under investigation inattentive/distracted driving continues to be a leading factor in fatal crashes in our state.

Turnpike tolls are surging. 3 ways to force deadbeats to pay ‚Äî including keeping their tax refunds,"The problem of unpaid Turnpike tolls is getting worse. Much worse.

Yet state lawmakers aren‚Äôt in a hurry to do anything about it. They don‚Äôt care that many honest drivers are being gouged with higher tolls to cover the tolls deadbeats don‚Äôt pay. Think about that when you go to the polls in November.

From April 2021 to March 2022 the Turnpike anticipated being stiffed for $155 million according to a recent report. That‚Äôs up from $104 million during the previous year.

The Turnpike Commission says the amount of uncollected tolls is rising because more people are using the toll road and because toll prices are rising. All the more reason to get tougher as toll increases are planned to occur annually for another 28 years.

Higher tolls are needed to pay off debt the Turnpike unfairly had to incur under a state law that diverts some Turnpike funds to PennDOT for road construction and transit.

Current toll collection efforts clearly are insufficient. Sure it‚Äôs a difficult problem to solve. But with a little creativity and a Draconian attitude progress can be made.

The Turnpike broke ground a few years ago by becoming the first toll agency in the nation to pursue criminal charges for theft. It needs to get even more aggressive on that front.

Legislation that could help in another way is halfway to the finish line. In May the state House unanimously passed a bill that would require PennDOT to suspend registrations of vehicles with at least four unpaid tolls or unpaid tolls totaling $250 or more in the last five years.

Current law sets a higher bar for suspensions: at least six unpaid tolls or unpaid tolls totaling at least $500 in the last three years.

If the legislation were in effect today nearly 24000 vehicles in Pennsylvania would become eligible to have their registrations suspended.

The state Senate fled Harrisburg for its insultingly long summer break without voting on the bill though. Senators return to session next week and must prioritize this.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission anticipates a substantial increase in uncollected tolls from $104 million to $155 million.

Unfortunately even a registration suspension isn‚Äôt enough to motivate many deadbeats into paying.

An audit released a few weeks ago by the state auditor general said that as of April motorists with suspended registrations still owed more than $26 million in tolls and fees.

‚ÄúThe significant amount of uncollected tolls and fees reflects that the current legal mechanism of registration suspension may not have had the desired impact on collections‚Äù the audit said.

In other words many deadbeats don‚Äôt give a damn.

If they have no problem driving through a toll booth without paying and then ignoring bills and collections notices they likely don‚Äôt have a problem driving an unregistered vehicle either.

So let‚Äôs up the ante.

The auditor general offered several recommendations. Two have the most promise.

* Enact legislation to prohibit the transfer of a vehicle title if there are unpaid tolls associated with the vehicle. Ohio enacted a law to do that earlier this year.

That means deadbeats can‚Äôt sell their vehicle which means they probably can‚Äôt buy a new one.

* Enact legislation to allow lottery winnings and state tax refunds to be garnished to collect unpaid tolls. Many people look forward to their refund every year. The state should starting looking forward to it too.

Here‚Äôs a third option that I would add ‚Äî deduct unpaid tolls from unemployment compensation.

Harsh? Yep. Someone claiming unemployment probably is struggling. But they had their chance to pay what they owed when they were working. That‚Äôs the kind of tough attitude necessary to lick this problem and send a message that unpaid tolls will not be tolerated.

Uncollected tolls were expected to rise after the Turnpike Commission did away with toll collectors who accepted cash payments in 2020.

It can be particularly difficult to get out-of-state scofflaws to pay. Pennsylvania doesn‚Äôt have any power over them. Negotiations are occurring with neighboring states on reciprocity agreements where their home states would punish them. But so far only one agreement has been reached with Delaware. And it hasn‚Äôt been implemented.

The recent Turnpike report says 93.5% of tolls are collected with 86.7% paid automatically with E-ZPass. Those who don‚Äôt use E-ZPass are billed through the mail based on their license plate.

About 14% of all non-E-ZPass tolls cannot be collected because the license plate was not readable (faded not captured by cameras or blocked such as by a trailer or bike rack); or because an address could not be found or bills were returned undeliverable.

About another 35% of bills simply are ignored by the recipient for at least 150 days.

The Turnpike has been expanding options for people to pay their bills.

Earlier this year it signed an agreement with KUBRA Cash Payment Network so customers can pay in cash at stores including 7-Eleven CVS Dollar General Family Dollar Royal Farms Rutter‚Äôs Sheetz Speedway and Walgreens.

The commission said it plans to soon accept payment via QR Codes Apple Pay Google Pay Zelle Venmo and other digital platforms.

More options will be a convenience for some motorists. But more options won‚Äôt shake the payment out of the worst scofflaws because they don‚Äôt ever intend to pay. That‚Äôs why harsher collection efforts are necessary.

(WJHG/WECP) - One person was reported to have minor injuries after a multi-car crash caused delays on Front Beach Road in Panama City Beach Saturday afternoon.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers said the incident happened around 2:45 p.m. They say a car was leaving the Everything A Dollar store parking lot near the intersection of Front Beach Road and Hinson Avenue.

FHP said a car was turning onto Front Beach Road but failed to yield to another car that had the right of way on the roadway. Troopers report the cars crashed and drifted over into the opposite lanes where they then crashed into another car.

One of the cars did catch on fire but troopers said only one of the drivers was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. They said no other injuries were reported.

Bay County Sheriff‚Äôs deputies closed sections of Front Beach Road for safety precautions. We‚Äôre told firefighters arrived on the scene and were able to extinguish the fire.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O -0.16%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

With its 4.4% dividend yield and monthly dividend payouts investors in search of passive income can't go wrong with Realty Income stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy93aG8tYXJlLWNob3VpbmFyZC1jaGlsZHJlbi1wYXRhZ29uaWEtaGVpcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the children of Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard,"In the TV show Succession adult children duke it out to be the heir of their father‚Äôs media empire. But what if no one wanted to head the business to begin with? You‚Äôd likely have a less dramatic (or funny) show but you might be closer to the reality of the Chouinard family.

In a move that subverts the traditional ideas of how companies are run and how wealth is often distributed among the 1% in the U.S. 83-year-old Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard announced this week that he and his family were redirecting their personal profits to the task of combating climate change. He has a reported net worth of $1.2 billion.

The Chouinards are transferring their gains and voting stock to a newly established non-profit organization Holdfast Collective and a new trust the Patagonia Purpose Trust which both aim to tackle climate change. The family isn‚Äôt stepping away from the $3 billion company altogether as they‚Äôre still making key decisions while overseeing the Patagonia Purpose Trust.

The Chouinard children‚ÄîFletcher and Claire‚Äîaren‚Äôt clamoring for the title of CEO instead shirking away from billionaire status. ‚ÄúIt was important to them that they were not seen as the financial beneficiaries‚Äù Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert told The New York Times of Chouinard‚Äôs children. ‚ÄúThey felt very strongly about it. I know it can sound flippant but they really embody this notion that every billionaire is a policy failure.‚Äù

If Earth is the only shareholder of Patagonia these days and the beneficiaries are the children of the world instead of Chouinard‚Äôs own kids who are these would-be heirs giving up the reins? Much like their father Fletcher and Claire seem to have a tendency to not play by the stereotypical rulebook of the wealthy.

They tend to stay out of the limelight keeping a low profile and barely speaking to the press. Both work for Patagonia but have their own pursuits within the company. Here‚Äôs what we do know about them.

Fletcher Chouinard

A lack of interest in being a billionaire wasn‚Äôt the only thing that Chouinard passed on to his kids. While Fletcher didn‚Äôt inherit Patagonia he‚Äôs inherited his father‚Äôs passion for being an outdoorsman. He loves to surf and kiteboard‚Äîhe even has a surfing trip diary from a decade ago to prove it. In an interview with The Kiteboarder he talks about how his dad helped him get into kitesurfing adding that he was inspired by Yvon‚Äôs interest in expedition sea kayaking. Fletcher himself became a dad in 2018.

Fletcher heads up the more than 20-year-old company FCD Surfboards backed by Patagonia with the tagline: ‚ÄúWe build each surfboard like it‚Äôs our own.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just owners or board members‚Äù Fletcher told The New Yorker in 2016 of he and his sister working for Patagonia. He was 41 at the time ‚ÄúWe have normal salaries‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt brought up to give a shit about money. Actually I think we were raised to be slightly embarrassed about it.‚Äù

When Fletcher does talk to the press it‚Äôs mostly about surfing. He‚Äôs said his passion for designing boards started in high school. ‚ÄúIt was addicting for me‚Äù he said of his surfing design experience. ‚ÄúEventually I lost interest in my major at college and jumped ship to shape full time.‚Äù

As a surfboard designer Fletcher has been ‚Äúinstrumental in bringing environmental awareness to the surfing industry‚Äù according to a 2007 profile from Business 2.0 Magazine. When asked about how to make surfboards green he told The Kiteboarder in 2018 that he was a little jaded about alternative material being the solution and that unless there‚Äôs a big breakthrough in the area the most environmentally-conscious thing to do is invest in a durable board.

‚ÄúEveryone has a footprint‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven if I carve a natural deadfall tree into a surfboard it‚Äôs still releasing CO 2 out of the wood‚Äîwe do our best to make a product that lasts a long time.‚Äù

Claire Chouinard

Claire proves to be even more elusive than her older brother with a minimal digital footprint. A glimmer of her personality shone at age 12 when she dyed her orange with Kool-Aid before a dinner with the Clinton family in 1992 a tale her father once told The New Yorker.

She took her artsy side to Otis College of Art and Design which she graduated from in 2006. Today she channels her creativity by working in the fashion side of Patagonia responsible for some of the brand‚Äôs designs. True to both the company and her family Claire is focused on the environment.

‚ÄúOur current creative director Claire Chouinard really sets the tone for inspiring us to whole-heartedly embrace our company‚Äôs statement of purpose: We are in business to save our home planet‚Äù Patagonia design director Carrie Childs said in an interview last year. ‚ÄúEvery creative decision every design choice is filtered through that overarching purpose.‚Äù

Claire was the co-designer for Patagonia‚Äôs Truth to Materials collection in 2014 a line that focused on ‚Äúresponsible manufacturing‚Äù and using the ‚Äúpurest materials.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet the materials shine in their own light. Don‚Äôt fight them; let them do what they naturally want to do‚Äù Claire said during the ad campaign.

Much like her brother Claire has expressed a vested interest in making sure Patagonia aligns with her morals. As she told The New Yorker in 2016 when she was 38 ‚ÄúIf the company became something I didn‚Äôt believe in or approve of I wouldn‚Äôt want to be here.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYyNDkxNzMvaG9zdGVzcy1oYWxsb3dlZW4tbGluZXVwLXNwb29reS10d2lua2llcy1yZWxlYXNlL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzYyNDkxNzMvaG9zdGVzcy1oYWxsb3dlZW4tbGluZXVwLXNwb29reS10d2lua2llcy1yZWxlYXNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hostess Halloween lineup: When will the spooky twinkies come out?...,"scary sweets Hostess Halloween lineup: When will the spooky twinkies come out?

A small creature caused a blackout in Virginia Beach last week: a wandering squirrel that made its way into the substation.

It happened around 8:45 a.m. on September 7 according to a tweet from Bonita Harris spokesperson for Dominion Energy which provides electricity in Virginia and other states.

The power outage affected over 10000 Virginians Harris said. Power was restored by around 10 a.m.

Harris told CNN that animals occasionally get stuck in the company‚Äôs substations despite efforts to keep them out.

‚ÄúDominion Energy has standard equipment in place to keep squirrels and other animals safe when near our equipment‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúThis equipment reduces the number of incidents greatly but sometimes determined little critters will still get in there.‚Äù

The squirrel did not survive the incident Harris said although sometimes animals receive a brief shock and go mostly unharmed.

Jericho battled the GCW star as one of the ‚ÄúLabors of Jericho‚Äù during his feud with MJF and Gage‚Äôs use of a pizza cutter at an inopportune moment caused some controversy when the Dominos ad aired right after it.

Jericho talked about working with Gage during the latest episode of Talk is Jericho recounting how he learned a lot about the psychology of deathmatch wrestling from Gage. He also weighed in on the Dominos incident as well and you can see the highlights below:

On working with Nick Gage in AEW: ‚ÄúNick Gage again like ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know who this guy is but he‚Äôs f**king insane.‚Äô And then I asked Mox about him [and Moxley said] ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a teddy bear‚Äô or something whatever he said. And I spoke to him a couple of times and he was super super-respectful. And that goes a long way with me. Like I meet a lot of guys in the business and as long as you have respect for the business I‚Äôm cool with you. I don‚Äôt care what you do. And when I met him he was so so respectful and really was happy to be there and was kind of ‚ÄòHey man I just wanna tell you like I‚Äôm a really big fan of yours and it‚Äôs really cool for me to be here. And it was like he just loves wrestling.‚Äô This is the path his wrestling took doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs any less of a wrestler.‚Äù

On learning more about deathmatch wrestling at that time: ‚ÄúI really started learning the psychology of deathmatch wrestling. What possesses these guys to do this? I‚Äôm not one of these guys to be like [imitates Jim Cornette] ‚ÄòWell that‚Äôs f**king bulls**t. That bulls**t stupid mudshow wrestling!‚Äô I don‚Äôt look at it that way. I look at it ‚ÄòOkay there‚Äôs a market for this and these guys are really good at what they‚Äôre doing; how are they doing it?‚Äô

‚ÄúSo I really watched what he was doing. And I thought like ‚ÄòS**t man I‚Äôll do it! I‚Äôll do it.‚Äô There was a time there was a Chris Jericho time period where I would have went ‚ÄòI would never get hit with a light tube. That‚Äôs stupid! That‚Äôs not wrestling that‚Äôs bulls**t.‚Äô And once again take head out of ass Jericho. Does it fit the story? Yes. Does it fit the story of the match? Yes. Let‚Äôs do it.‚Äù

On the Dominos controversy: ‚ÄúThat was hilarious. So Nick wanted to do a pizza cutter that‚Äôs one of his gimmicks. So right out the gate he slices my arm with the pizza cutter I still have a scar there. And that gets people like ‚ÄòHoly s**t! This is real!‚Äô And then during the commercial break he starts slicing my forehead with the pizza cutter in picture-in-picture‚Ä¶ So right when Nick is carving my forehead with the pizza cutter there is a Dominos Pizza commercial where the guy is cutting the pizza with what? A pizza cutter! And apparently Dominos was furious.

Whether it‚Äôs a favorite stuffed teddy bear or a plastic action figure there will be no peace at home until your child is reunited with their favorite toy!

A Domino‚Äôs Pizza branch in New Zealand recently received a call about a dinosaur toy for this exact reason. When staff members realized they did indeed have ‚ÄúBitey‚Äù the T-Rex in their possession they decided to put him to work!

‚ÄúLast week one of our stores received a worried call asking to check if ‚ÄòBitey‚Äô the T-Rex had been left in the foyer after his family had picked up pizzas that evening‚Äù Domino‚Äôs New Zealand wrote on Facebook. ‚ÄúSure enough Bitey was there!‚Äù

They went on to say that it was almost closing time so they told Bitey‚Äôs family to pick him up tomorrow. That‚Äôs when Bitey rolled up his tiny sleeves and got to work! After getting his very own name tag he learned how to make some tasty pizza.

After getting saucy in the kitchen Bitey got a lesson on phone etiquette and taking orders from hungry customers. He wasn‚Äôt very good at dialing the phone on account of his short arms but he turned out to be terrific at making witty banter.

Like any good restaurant worker Bitey took on dishwashing duty that night. We love the cute little cardboard hat they crafted for him too!

After washing up it was back to making pizzas. It‚Äôs a good thing Bitey is made of plastic and doesn‚Äôt actually eat food or else those pizzas wouldn‚Äôt have lasted two minutes. As it is Bitey didn‚Äôt eat a bite!

The restaurant reported ‚Äú‚Ä¶ he was sent home with plenty of stories to tell about his first shift at Domino‚Äôs the next day.‚Äù

We love that this Domino‚Äôs crew took some time out of their night to have fun with this child‚Äôs toy. Bitey has our vote for employee of the month!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vcmV2aWV3cy90cmllZC1kb21pbm9zLTE2OTktYmlnLWJyZWtraWUtMjUwMTY0NDnSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlcnBvb2xlY2hvLmNvLnVrL3doYXRzLW9uL3Jldmlld3MvdHJpZWQtZG9taW5vcy0xNjk5LWJpZy1icmVra2llLTI1MDE2NDQ5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I tried Domino's ¬£16.99 'Big Brekkie' pizza and it was not what I expected - review,"I've always joked with my friends about how a breakfast pizza should be a thing so you can imagine my reaction when Domino's actually launched one.

The 'Big Brekkie' pizza launched this September and includes toppings such as sausage smoked bacon mushroom and tomatoes with a choice of either brown or tomato sauce depending on what you fancy. It seems like this particular pizza has divided Domino's fans so I wanted to see what it really tasted like.

I'm a huge fan of Domino's pizza so I had really high hopes for the new brekkie addition. I did have a few concerns though was it going to be greasy? Heavy? Would someone even want to eat this in the morning? Let's find out.

The pizza

My local Domino's didn't open until 11am so I skipped breakfast and found myself very hungry by 12pm. I opted for a small pizza since I was on my own and didn't want to be left with loads of pizza if I didn't like it.

My 'Big Brekkie' pizza arrived fresh and smelt absolutely unreal. After toying between tomato or brown sauce I went for the classic tomato and I'm so glad I did.

In terms of aesthetics this pizza looked surprisingly good! It didn't appear out of the ordinary or weird and even the tomato sauce was applied on top in quite a neat fashion.

It included big thick slices of Cumberland sausage and smooth crispy bacon with just the right amount of sauce. The mushrooms were a little slimy but I wasn't expecting them to be perfect because mushrooms can be a hit and miss anyway.

As I took a bite I was surprised at how utterly light this pizza was. When you think of a breakfast pizza you think huge greasy and stodgy but this pizza did everything right.

There was no grease on the toppings and the tomato sauce didn't overpower the pizza which was what I was worried about. The dough was light and fluffy and honestly I can see why people would choose to have this for a weekend brekkie treat.

Don't get me wrong this definitely isn't something you could eat on a daily basis but on a hungover weekend or if you fancy something different it's a great option. The cheese also worked really well with the breakfast ingredients which I was also a little dubious so that's another tick from me.

One thing I will say is the price of this pizza was a little steep at ¬£16.99 for the small and ¬£21.99 for a large. In total with delivery I paid ¬£18.49 for a small pizza which seems rather expensive to me considering you can get a cooked breakfast at my local caf√© for just over a fiver.

I do know that with places like Domino's it's all about the convenience of the delivery and the brand itself though. Since the pizza was actually really good I can let that slide.

The verdict

The toppings were top quality the tomato sauce really complemented the ingredients and the dough was beautifully fresh. I was very impressed.

I'm still so surprised at how light this pizza was which is why I'd definitely order it again. There were so many delicious flavours on the pizza that weren't ruined by the sauce and I'm so glad about that.

One thing I will say though is that if you don't like mushrooms you might have to take them off because they were a tad slimy on my pizza - but personally that didn't bother me.

All I can say is well done for Domino's Pizza for creating this absolute gem of a pizza something that I've actually been wanting for a while and now I've got it. It lived up to my expectations and it's a winner for me.

It is expected to be operational by 2025 and would deliver approximately 120 kilotons per annum (KTA) of advanced recycling capacity.

This and other planned units expected to be constructed in Europe and the United States would collectively add as much as 600 KTA of advanced recycling capacity by 2030. The facility in B√∂hlen would be the first in Germany.

The project also would make Dow the largest global consumer of circular feedstock for polyethylene production. This is the first facility to be located at a Dow site. The project is targeted for a final investment decision by the end of 2023.

‚ÄúThe project has a series of investments all the way along so by the end of 2023 all contracts are expected to be in place‚Äù Marc van den Biggelaar Advanced Recycling Director Dow EMEA & APAC told PlasticsToday.

While the companies did not release financial details Mura announced on June 1 that its partner KBR a science technology and engineering firm made a $100 million investment in Mura to develop multiple new projects worldwide to remove more than one million tons of plastic from global waste streams.

Process uses supercritical steam to convert plastics

As shown in the video Mura's Hydrothermal Plastic Recycling Solution (HydroPRS) advanced recycling process uses supercritical steam to convert most forms of plastics including historically non-recyclable flexible and multi-layer materials back into the original oils and chemicals from which they were made. These can be used to create new ‚Äúvirgin-equivalent‚Äù polyethylene-based products that can be used in multiple medical and automotive applications and even for food-contact packaging the company said.

With Mura's process the same material can be recycled repeatedly so it has the potential to eliminate single-use plastics and prevent them from going to landfills or being incinerated. Advanced recycling processes are expected to save approximately 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of plastic recycled compared with incineration the company said. The technology also reduces reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.

Advanced recycling is different from mechanical recycling which shreds only certain types of plastic for recycling.

First plant in UK expected to be operational in 2023

The planned facility in Germany builds on Dow's ongoing collaboration with Mura first announced in 2021 with an initial project to construct the world's first plant using Mura's HydroPRS process located in Teesside UK which is expected be operational in 2023 with an initial 20 KTA production line. The facility that will be co-located at Dow‚Äôs plant in Germany would enable a significantly larger capacity for plastic waste and increase the supply of fully circular feedstock to the industry.

Oliver Borek Chief Commercial Officer of Mura Technology said during a video press conference on Sept. 12 that the facility in Germany will have five times the capacity of the Teesside facility. ‚ÄúTeeside is 20000 KTA but that is liquid output which translates to 25000 tons of input. B√∂hlen is 120000 KTA of output‚Äù Borek said.

Dow said there are several advantages of co-locating the advanced recycling plant at its facility. It is expected to significantly reduce scaling costs. In addition it is expected to reduce carbon emissions by minimizing transportation of the product. Plus the gas output from the advanced recycling process can be converted back to plastics so no by-products go to waste.

Dow committed to securing circular feedstocks

""The continuation and growth of Dow and Mura's collaboration is another example of how Dow is working strategically to expand and build momentum around securing circular feedstocks and supporting breakthrough advanced recycling technologies"" said Isam Shomaly Dow Business Vice President for Feedstocks and Commodities.

""We continue to increase Dow's capacity to use recycled content as feedstock and continue to invest in the most effective technology available to enable our circular business model for plastics"" said Diego Donoso President of Dow Packaging & Specialty Plastics. ""The diversification of our feedstock slate and decarbonization of our assets will enable the achievement of Dow's goal of a sustainable low-carbon future and meet strong and growing customer demand for circular polymers. This will be a significant step forward to decrease our dependency on virgin fossil-based feedstocks.""

Mura Technology CEO Steve Mahon added ""Combating the global plastics crisis requires innovative solutions that can drive a circular economy. Mura's collaboration with Dow has led to the largest commitment across the industry to date showcasing the urgency from industry leaders to adopt scalable solutions such as HydroPRS that will transform the plastics industry worldwide. Dow's continued support for Mura Technology has led to a highly financeable commercial arrangement and the deepening collaboration will allow both companies to achieve their stated ambitions in the advanced recycling space.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTMvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8xMy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasdaq closes higher on Wednesday as stocks stabilize following massive sell-off,"The Nasdaq Composite ground higher in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors tried to find their footing after the biggest one-day drop in more than two years.

The Nasdaq rose 0.74% to 11719.68. The S&P 500 added 0.34% to close at 3946.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 30.12 points or 0.10% to 31135.09 after being down more than 200 points at session lows.

Moderna was one of the top performers in the Nasdaq jumping more than 6%. Tesla rose 3.6% and Apple tacked on 1%.

The modest gains followed a massive sell-off for stocks on Tuesday. The Dow sank more than 1200 points or nearly 4% while the S&P 500 lost 4.3%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.2%. It was the biggest one-day slide for all three averages since June 2020.

The drop was sparked by August's consumer price index report which showed headline inflation rising 0.1% on a monthly basis despite a drop in gas prices.

The hot inflation report left questions over whether stocks could go back to their June lows or fall even further. It also spurred some fears that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates even higher than the 75 basis points markets are pricing in.

""Tuesday's selloff is a reminder that a sustained rally is likely to require clear evidence that inflation is on a downward trend. With macroeconomic and policy uncertainty elevated we expect markets to remain volatile in the months ahead"" Mark Haefele CIO of UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note to clients.

Market breadth was mixed on Wednesday with declining stocks slightly outnumbering gainers in the S&P 500. Materials stocks slid led to the downside by an 11% drop for Nucor.

For anyone prone to typos sending messages to the wrong person or firing off thoughts they may later regret there‚Äôs now some hope. Apple has delivered on two of its most requested features: the ability to edit and unsend iMessages.

This week Apple released its latest operating system iOS 16 which lets users edit an iMessage up to five times within 15 minutes after sending it and unsend any message up to 2 minutes after it‚Äôs sent. Users just need to tap and hold the sent message then select ‚Äúedit‚Äù or ‚Äúundo send.‚Äù

But there are some caveats. For starters it‚Äôs not exactly a stealthy effort: recipients receive an alert that the message was unsent or edited but don‚Äôt see the specific change.

Both users also need to be messaging on Apple devices so it won‚Äôt work for Android exchanges. It works best when the recipient is also using iOS 16 ‚Äî otherwise they‚Äôll receive an awkward timeline of the changes made. SMS messages can‚Äôt be unsent or edited either.

And the sender must hope the recipient didn‚Äôt see a preview of the original message on the lock screen before it was edited or unsent.

Apple (AAPL) is playing catchup to platforms such as Facebook Messenger WhatsApp and Gmail which also offer options to edit or delete messages after they‚Äôre sent. Twitter recently announced it‚Äôs testing the ability for users to edit tweets.

‚ÄúWith Twitter and Apple now also enabling this feature it is clear that this is a trend that many mobile users demand from these platforms‚Äù said Lian Jye Su research director at market research firm ABI Research. ‚ÄúSince the barrier to switching messaging platforms is near zero rich and user-friendly features have become a critical competitive advantage.‚Äù

While they‚Äôre popular requests editing and unsending messages could have an unintended impact on transparency and accountability especially on public platforms by removing or altering the written record. By making it clear the message was edited Apple could help maintain some transparency according to Ramon Llamas an analyst at IDC.

Even with these new options however Lllamas recommends people read over what they send ‚Äúbecause it can come back to haunt you ‚Ä¶ even if you edit it.‚Äù

iOS 16 is now available for any iPhone model dating back to the iPhone 8 which was released in 2017. Other new noteworthy iMessage features include the ability to mark messages as unread so they‚Äôre easier to respond to later and the option to recover recently deleted messages for up to 30 days."

Our free email updates are the best way to get headlines direct to your inbox

Plans to regenerate a popular waterfront area and 'well used' park is exactly what an East Midlands town needs residents say. The plans for Long Eaton's West Park and along the Erewash Canal form part of an award of ¬£24.8m from the Government for the town's Investment Plan

The project is one of seven projects within the town's transformation with the plans are currently under consideration. The waterfront development would include a seating area to enjoy the park as well as facilities for refreshments and to launch small watercraft.

The events space will allow for a wider variety of events along with more car parking spaces. Park goers in the town say the plans for the ‚Äòwell used‚Äô West Park are needed and will ‚Äòbrighten‚Äô the space up.

Joseph Blake who usually walks his dog in the park told Nottinghamshire Live that residents would appreciate an additional space to the park. The 48 year old said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs needed. This park is well used and I think many would appreciate something new. I think with the water it will be good especially during the summer. It‚Äôs something the town needs we have lost a lot.‚Äù

The Erewash Borough Council has said the plans for the project on the park should benefit residents by providing an abundance of new employment opportunities.

Sheila Statham 84 who has lived in Long Eaton her whole life said that it would brighten the park up. She added: ‚ÄúI think anything to make it feel more comfortable for people. Myself I quite like the look of it it‚Äôs rough and ready. We are very lucky to have this.

‚ÄúI think so to brighten it up. People will come if they can shelter and watch the wildlife. There‚Äôs a lot of wildlife on here swans and squirrels. People like to come and look at the birds people want somewhere to sit and watch.

The 84-year-old added: It‚Äôs somewhere nice. And it‚Äôs being used more now than it‚Äôs ever been used. We are really lucky to have this facility.‚Äù

The town's funding also involves the redevelopment of the former Galaxy cinema on Derby Road. The proposals for the redevelopment includes commercial units fronting Derby Road 16 flats and four new town houses.

The town houses are proposed to front on Oxford Street behind the cinema. Vehicle access will also be from Oxford Street which will lead to a courtyard and 27 parking spaces.

Another resident who visits the park Natalie Bowley told Nottinghamshire Live that it‚Äôs a positive bringing more into the town. The 34-year-old said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good if it brings business and people to the area. There‚Äôs not much in Long Eaton. It needs something that brings in more people.‚Äù

Kerrie Walters 32 who was walking her two dogs said that it‚Äôs welcomed due to the lack of things going off in Long Eaton. She said: ‚ÄúI think it will be good. But what I think would be nice is the splash thing for the kids I think it would be good to have one for dogs. They‚Äôd love it.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot going off in Long Eaton really so anything to make the days less boring.‚Äù

Richard Ledger chairman of the Long Eaton Town Board says: ""These projects may still be in the early stages but when they come to fruition they will provide improved leisure and recreation facilities for residents.

""The leisure hub would also attract more visitors to the park and the town as a whole.""

The council says the plans for the park which is on the edge of the town centre off Wilsthorpe Road will be delivered in two parts. The first would involve the development of ""a stunning waterfront alongside the Erewash Canal including an area for seating to enjoy the park as well as facilities for refreshments and to launch small watercraft.""

The second part of the project includes an improved events space which will allow for a wider variety of events with more car parking space to help encourage more people to visit the park more often. ""This is just one part of the exciting proposals for the Long Eaton Town Deal"" Mr Ledger adds ""and we look forward to making improvements to the town that can be enjoyed by everyone.‚Äù

The former industrial site off Nottingham Road Long Eaton has been left derelict since 2014 amid negotiations.

Plans were originally put forward by Lidl and Clowes Developments in 2018 but refused by Erewash Borough Council on the grounds that other preferable sites had not yet been considered and it could have an adverse impact on the vitality of the town centre. There were also concerns Nottinghamshire Live reports that the new shops could harm the appearance of that stretch of road which was once home to Stadium Industrial Park and Long Eaton Trade Centre.

Shortly after the plans were rejected Lidl said 298 local residents had written to them saying they wanted the development to go ahead. The rejection was overturned on appeal in 2020 with the planning inspector saying the two stores would only divert a small proportion of trade from Long Eaton town centre and that the town‚Äôs retail was ‚Äúrobust enough‚Äù to withstand the impact.

Since then the proposals for the 1.68 hectare site have been revised and will go before the Erewash planning committee on October 12. The proposals include a change in the shape of the Wickes building from square to rectangle with the addition of a mezzanine floor for displaying kitchens and bathrooms with customer seating interview areas for the design team and toilets.

The new design has prompted amendments to the layout of the development service yard and car park. There would be 165 parking spaces - 55 fewer than originally approved - and additional landscaping.

The plans state: ""In the context of the buildings already approved the increase in the width of the Wickes store would not materially alter the impact on visual or residential amenity arising from the development. The proposed changes ensure the plans are more responsive to the requirements of the retailers which are driven by customer demand. The development will create a viable attractive and welcoming commercial environment which is well designed and laid out within the context and constraints of the site.""

The new supermarket would create 40 new full and part-time jobs and approximately 26 new full and part-time jobs at Wickes. Clowes has been working closely with the council's senior planning officer in a bid to make the amended proposals successful.

Marc Freeman the development director at Clowes responsible for delivering the scheme said: ""We have also received support from local residents who are excited to benefit from the proposed retail offering.""

Workers are currently on site constructing access from Nottingham Road under the original consent which will help to expedite the delivery of the proposed scheme if approved. If given the green light the stores should be ready to open in 2024.

""It would regenerate a prominent site in Long Eaton that has been redundant for a number of years which will benefit the local community"" added Mr Freeman.

It's almost 90 miles away from the coast but a new amusements arcade is aiming to bring a slice of the seaside to a town just over the border from Notts. Jones Retro Amusements opened in Long Eaton's High Street on September 3.

The building was previously a cafe named Fill Ya Face however owners Michelle Jones and husband Terry Jones decided they wanted to bring something different to the High Street. Having owned arcades in the past the married couple changed their cafe to a family amusement.

Mrs Jones said it felt like an end of an era closing the cafe. The 39 year old said: ‚ÄúEverybody that we‚Äôve spoken to has been positive it‚Äôs something different.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen all ages come in the weekend is a lot busier with the kids they especially like the glitter and face painting we‚Äôve done a lot of them.

Mrs Jones added: ‚ÄúThe high street just needs an injection a bit of life. There‚Äôs something for all ages sand pits outside a variety of machines cheap tea and coffee. When there‚Äôs quite a few people in it‚Äôs a nice feel a good atmosphere.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just nice to have brought something a bit different a bit of fun. If people ever want to come for a cup of tea and let the kids play.

""It‚Äôs been weird we‚Äôve had an arcade before so to be back it‚Äôs been very strange. I think the day we swapped it all over felt like the end of an era. We have been open for three years.‚Äù

The ‚ÄòSkeg Vegas‚Äô amusements is open from 8.30am until 6pm every day of the week. Mrs Jones also spoke of the struggles of running the cafe in the aftermath of Covid and the current cost of living crisis. She said: ‚ÄúYou come in and have a bit of fun without spending. The cost of living is what it is you‚Äôve got to do the best you can. For small businesses they feel it more than the rest with such tight profit margins.

‚ÄúWe were watching the shopping going up the electricity then started looking at staffing costing reduced opening hours. After covid and the living costs it just wasn‚Äôt feasible for us to stay open. It‚Äôs crazy everybody that you speak to is all in the boat.‚Äù

The former cafe has everything from sand pits to 2p machines and teddy bear grabbers face painting and hot drinks. The owners want to give locals something different and something fun.

Mr Jones 43 added: ‚ÄúI had a couple of customers come in and said it‚Äôs absolutely unbelievable for Long Eaton it‚Äôs something fun.

He adds that they‚Äôre almost there with completing the ‚ÄòSkeg Vegas‚Äô look. Mr Jones said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre halfway there at the minute not fully there. People have said they love it. We‚Äôve got a few more bits planned‚Äù.

That made me wonder why someone bid on the item so quickly so I started to do a little research.

I am selling the console along with 37 games two joystick controllers the TV/Game A/B switch and the cable to bridge the gap between the console and the television.

Staff Photo Staff Photo loading...

The first person to bid has an eBay username of atarisandmore so it sounds like that user is someone who is expert at all things Atari.

As I started to browse through atarisandmore's offerings I realized that there were NO Atari game cartridges for sale on the profile for less than around $9.

Staff Photo Staff Photo loading...

That means that if atarisandmore wins the bid (it opened at $44.10) after shipping he (or she) will have spent around $60 for the console the two controllers and 37 games.

On atarisandmore's profile on eBay he lists an Atari 2600 (4-switch) with 20 games as a package for $199.

Staff Photo Staff Photo loading...

And if he is able to sell the remaining 17 cartridges he buys from me (if he wins the auction) he'll sell each of those for at least $8.99. All-in-all he stands to make almost $200 by reselling what he just bought from me.

So what does that tell you?

It tells you this: I am not good at eBay-ing.

Staff Photo Staff Photo loading...

I only looked up a few consoles that were up for sale and they were selling for between $35 and $55 dollars so I thought that I would list mine for around $45. A happy medium right?

Staff Photo Staff Photo loading...

What I didn't do was price each of the games individually before including them with the console. Had I done that I would have realized that they were each worth at least $5.

So I shorted myself by at least $200 if this thing sells with the current bid.

And this ladies and gentlemen is why I don't own a business.

Oh there is also one ""mystery"" game cartridge included in my listing. There is no label on the game cartridge so I have no idea what game it is. With my luck it's a super rare game that he'll be able to sell for a nice profit!

Staff Photo Staff Photo loading...

It is one of the Parker Brothers games which include titles such as Star Wars Frogger Q*Bert Popeye Super Cobra and even McDonald's. Some of these titles are going for as much as $20!

Well here's to hoping that I'll get some more bids on my Atari 2600 console and the games. They have provided me with lots of great fun over the years but it's time to declutter!

If you have an old Atari laying around with some game cartridges it might be worth it to check the values.

For instance the Atari 2600 Beam Rider game is selling online right now for around $65. There's an Asteroids cartridge (Silver Label) for sale for around $60. Night Driver: $50. Tax Avoiders: $40. Tanks But No Tanks Donkey Kong Junior Jawbreaker Rubik's Cube Pitfall - all above $30.

But if you have a factory-sealed Legend of Zelda game it could bring you a LOT of money! There's one listed on eBay right now for $100000. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS? How crazy is that??

How about this Atari 2600 factory-sealed E.T. (Extra Terrestrial) game? Would you believe that it's for sale for almost $20000?

eBay has removed dozens of listings for wristbands from the queue to see Queen Elizabeth II's coffin at Westminster Hall The Guardian reports.

According to the outlet some wristbands drew bids of up to ¬£70000 which equates to about $80755.

‚ÄúWe have literally started with a picture and scoured different manufacturers and eBay looking for an oddball part‚Äù said John Allen a mechanic who specializes in breathing new life into broken down BART trains. When Car 372 caught fire in Orinda in 2013 his team created an entirely new system and built their own tools to replace the floor. ‚ÄúSometimes we don‚Äôt even know what the name of the part is.‚Äù

To understand why BART upkeep is so complicated take a look back to the founders. They shunned heavy steel trains and old-school signaling technology and instead hired an aerospace company to build a train fleet that would serve as a new model for public transit. The result? All-electric trains with sleek aluminum bodies and wide windows underpinned by nearly autonomous operations. The price tag for BART‚Äôs original 450 cars: $160 million.

‚ÄúBART was envisioned as a renaissance system‚Äù said Mike Healy the agency‚Äôs longtime spokesperson and BART historian. In 1972 it ‚Äúwas sort of the new kid on the block.‚Äù

But much of the hardware quickly went out of date. Even as Silicon Valley sprouted next door the trains remained tethered to a safe but arcane automated train control system that depended on DOS ‚Äî a computer operating system now relegated to the dustbin of history ‚Äî for vital operations. BART inspired train networks in Washington D.C. and Atlanta yet its specific mechanics were never widely replicated.

Today the transit system is an outlier with everything from wheels to windows crying out for custom-built attention.

‚ÄúThe biggest stumbling block is coming up with parts that they don‚Äôt make anymore‚Äù said Mark Wing a mechanic who oversees maintenance on the entire train spanning electrical propulsion equipment to busted seats.

Which parts are not made any more? ‚ÄúPretty much everything‚Äù he said.

When a BART car runs into trouble Shawn Stange steps back in time. He pops open a circa-2000 IBM Thinkpad running Windows 98 and opens a portal into the train‚Äôs brain ‚Äî the Automated Train Control system ‚Äî through the DOS computer language.

Much as if he were conducting a vehicle diagnostic test Stange uses the software as a mechanic‚Äôs roadmap. ‚ÄúThis stuff was written so long ago. So you have to take Windows 10 and open up a virtual Windows 98 box and then run the (DOS) program to download the log files‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs primitive.‚Äù

Stacks of vintage laptop carcasses are common at BART warehouses. The train software is so old it won‚Äôt work on modern computers.

‚ÄúI was in an engineering office and I bet he had 40 of them sitting on the floor stacked up‚Äù said Allen. ‚ÄúRob this part and rob that part to keep one laptop going. You see that here all the time.‚Äù

Perhaps the most illustrative symbol of BART‚Äôs go-it-alone approach is its iconic 1970s lead cars which have a dedicated fan base among transit design aficionados. The sloped nose was built for a futuristic effect but had little practical purpose and even prevented the trains from switching interchangeably with flat-faced vehicles. Irrespective of functionality the shape became BART‚Äôs ‚Äúidentity‚Äù said Healy.

Today 56 of the original lead cars known as A cars are still in operation BART spokesperson Jim Allison said. Their mechanical innards were replaced during a mid-life rebuilding of the legacy fleet starting in the late 1990s but the same pointed nose greets tens of thousands of passengers every day. Another 341 of the trailing ‚ÄúB Cars‚Äù from the 1970s are still in use along with 60 ‚ÄúC cars‚Äù which were built in the 1980s.

In June the family of legacy lead cars became just a little smaller. Car 1204 derailed and it now lives at the Concord maintenance yard scorching under the most recent heat wave. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go to Schnitzer Steel in Oakland and get crushed‚Äù said Allison.

But before Car 1204 meets the trash compactor mechanics picked through the train‚Äôs bones in recent weeks. They pulled headlight sockets and popped out its hard-to-replicate conductor windows to preserve parts.

‚ÄúThe window is kind of bowed out like a bubble‚Äù said Scott Fitzgerald a manager at the Concord yard adding that they have just one spare left. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many attempts the glassmaker has tried to get that arc correctly.‚Äù

One of the first people to see BART‚Äôs space-age trains running through the Bay Area was Mekela Edwards. On Sept. 11 1972 she was a toddler slung over her mother Theresa‚Äôs shoulder when the pair became the system‚Äôs first paying customers. ‚ÄúSometimes I introduce myself as BART‚Äôs first baby‚Äù said Edwards who is now a teacher in Palo Alto.

For her the trains always had an air of discovery on trips from Oakland to San Francisco. But Edward‚Äôs connection to BART also parallels many passengers‚Äô love-hate relationship with the system as the dated trains struggle with cleanliness delays and notoriously failing air conditioners.

And as she grew older her frustration with BART sometimes bubbled over into angry social media posts when the crowded old cars morphed into saunas. ‚ÄúI just could not believe it was so hot on the train‚Äù she said recounting a trip in 2016. ‚ÄúAnd so I was tweeting ‚Äòdo something about this.'‚Äù

Its old trains are being slowly phased out. Most will be sent to the junkyards in the next two years and a handful will be repurposed for among other things a local beer garden video-game arcade and firefighter training. The Western Railway Museum in Solano County is also fundraising to save historic BART cars for a new exhibit.

Taking their place will be the $2.6 billion ‚ÄúFleet of the Future‚Äù which already makes up nearly a third of the trains. The cars have cooler cabins LCD map screens and yellow and blue seats. Along with a revamped train control system the new fleet is meant to finally push BART into the 21st century even as its initial rollout is hampered by software glitches.

Finding replacement parts won‚Äôt be a problem and DOS is no longer necessary for Allen and his crew but it will still be bittersweet to say goodbye to trains that they have lovingly kept alive.

‚ÄúThere is a part of me that definitely has a little tear in my eye‚Äù said Allen who has dedicated the past 16 years to BART repairs. ‚ÄúI think we could probably rebuild the fleet again and keep it going . . . but you know out with the old and in with the new.‚Äù

BOSTON MA‚Äî(UPDATED) Patients with severe symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) ineligible for surgery fare just as well when treated with the Pascal device (Edwards Lifesciences) as those treated with MitraClip (Abbott) according to the CLASP IID study.

The results which were presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at TCT 2022 and published simultaneously in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions come just 2 days after the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Pascal transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) system for the treatment of degenerative MR making it just the second device available in the US.

‚ÄúThe CLASP IID trial is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the two TEER therapies and further establishes the safety and effectiveness of mitral valve TEER for degenerative mitral regurgitation patients with prohibitive surgical risk‚Äù said study investigator Konstantinos Koulogiannis MD (Atlantic Health System Morristown Medical Center NJ) during a press conference. ‚ÄúIt met its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints with the Pascal system demonstrating low composite major adverse events and a significant sustained MR reduction.‚Äù

Lead investigator D. Scott Lim MD (University of Virginia Health System Hospital Charlottesville VA) said the introduction of a second device is important as it provides physicians and patients with options.

‚ÄúThe two devices have different design features that I think may be beneficial in different anatomies‚Äù said Lim.

For example Pascal‚Äôs hollow nitinol-frame construction allows it to close passively and flex during systole and diastole. The device also elongates allowing it to be maneuvered into anatomies with denser mitral chords said Lim. The clasps for grasping the mitral leaflets can be operated in tandem or independently allowing for staged leaflet capture and adjustment and a central spacer helps to bridge the coaptation gap so the leaflets aren‚Äôt pulled as tightly together.

Federico Asch MD (MedStar Health/Georgetown University Washington DC) who wasn‚Äôt involved in CLASP IID congratulated the researchers saying the field has now entered a new era. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been building a lot of data with MitraClip as a device but as a composite it‚Äôs important to now show that TEER works. There are going to be patients who are better candidates for one [device] or another. I don‚Äôt think we have that answer right now‚Äù he said.

Speaking with TCTMD Janarthanan Sathananthan MBChB (University of British Columbia/Vancouver General Hospital/St. Paul‚Äôs Hospital Vancouver Canada) who wasn‚Äôt involved in the study echoed Asch‚Äôs comments.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs beneficial to have another device to offer TEER as an option‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen the struggles that we‚Äôve had with screening for transcatheter mitral valve replacement. We have high exclusion rates so having another device that offers a therapeutic option for edge-to-edge repair is beneficial. CLASP IID also reinforces the benefits of edge-to-edge repair‚Äù

Interim Analysis of 180 Patients

The CLASP IID study included 180 patients enrolled at 43 sites in the United States Canada and Europe between 2018 and 2021. Up to 300 patients are planned for enrollment. However interim analyses were planned for 180 210 and 240 patients provided the sample size was deemed sufficient for analyzing the primary endpoint. At 180 patients the interim analysis proceeded because the predictive probability for study success exceeded 96.5% say investigators.

The current analysis included 117 patients treated with Pascal and 63 treated with MitraClip with frailty the most common reason that patients in both treatment groups were ineligible for surgery. Both were well matched but those who received the Pascal device were more likely to have undergone prior aortic valve surgery or TAVI. Two-thirds of patients received the Pascal implant;24.1% received the newer Pascal Ace device which is narrower has a shorter profile and longer clasps; and 8.6% received a combination. In the MitraClip arm 39.3% were treated with an NT/NTR/XTR device while 60.7% received the newer-generation G4 device which has independent clasps for gripping the mitral leaflets.

With respect to major adverse events‚Äîa composite safety endpoint that included cardiovascular death stroke MI need for renal replacement therapy severe bleeding and nonelective mitral valve reintervention‚Äîthe Pascal system met the margin for noninferiority when compared with MitraClip (3.4% with Pascal vs 4.8% with MitraClip). At 30 days the 1.3% difference in major adverse events had a one-sided upper confidence boundary of 5.1% which fell within the prespecified 15% noninferiority margin.

With Pascal there was one cardiovascular death three severe bleeds and one mitral-valve reintervention. In the MitraClip group there was one cardiovascular death and two severe bleeds.

In terms of effectiveness the proportion of patients with MR ‚â§ 2+ at 6 months 96.5% with Pascal and 96.8% with MitraClip. The absolute difference of 0.3% had a one-sided lower confidence boundary of 6.2% which fell within the prespecified noninferiority margin of 18%. Regardless of device all patients achieved MR ‚â§ 2+ at discharge while 87.2% and 88.5% of the Pascal- and MitraClip-treated patients had MR ‚â§ 1+ at discharge. At 6 months 83.7% of the Pascal-treated patients and 71.2% of the MitraClip-treated patients had sustained MR ‚â§ 1+ suggesting there was ‚Äúsome loss of efficacy over the same course of follow-up‚Äù with MitraClip according to investigators. Mean valve gradients were stable over time in both groups.

There are going to be patients who are better candidates for one [device] or another. I don‚Äôt think we have that answer right now. Federico Asch

Commenting on this signal Lim told TCTMD: ‚ÄúObviously this is only 6 months only 180 patients . . . We have to see if this bears out over the entire cohort over much longer follow-up. If it does then I think it is something operators will consider. It is mirrored in at least two other publications out of Europe that when they compared [Pascal] to MitraClip [they] seemed to find a decrease in efficacy with the MitraClip patients. It may bear out but right now it‚Äôs a little early to say.‚Äù

Sathananthan pointed out that CLASP IID does have limitations most notably the low patient numbers. However a second device one that appears to have less residual MR than that seen with MitraClip is a valuable addition. To TCTMD Sathananthan said one of the conundrums faced by operators who‚Äôve performed edge-to-edge repair is that the severity of MR can be underestimated immediately after the procedure. Then at follow-up it‚Äôs not uncommon for MR to be a little bit higher than expected.

‚ÄúSo that sustained benefit [with Pascal] is promising‚Äù he said calling it a signal that is worth watching in the larger cohort and over long-term follow-up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to try to get surgical-like repair results at the end. All of this is positive for the field.‚Äù

Anita Asgar MD MSc (Montreal Heart Institute Canada) one of the panelists during the late-breaking science presentation called CLASP IID an important study for TEER as it highlights the safety of the procedure but also cautioned against making much of the direct comparison given the small number of patients especially since just 37 patients in the MitraClip arm received the new-generation G4 device.

Another panelist David Cohen MD (St. Francis Hospital Roslyn NY) pointed out there is observational data suggesting that achieving MR ‚â§ 1+ is better for patients with degenerative MR. If a difference between MitraClip and Pascal emerges with respect to these sustained MR reductions he said it could be a factor when choosing devices.

Quality of Life and Functional Outcomes

Patients in both treatment arms had significant improvements in functional capacity and quality of life when compared with baseline but there was no difference between devices. Procedure times were longer with the Pascal device (88 vs 79 minutes) but declined over time suggesting there is a small learning curve with the device. Most of the participating sites did not have prior experience with the Pascal device prior to CLASP IID the researchers point out.

Lim said that one advantage of MitraClip is the extent of operator experience noting that operators may lean towards it because they are comfortable implanting it. In terms of anatomy more complicated or thicker mitral leaflets requiring mechanical closure might also be suitable for MitraClip he said.

The full trial has completed enrollment and patients are currently being followed. They hope to present data from the full 300-patient cohort early next year said Lim.

The Pascal system has CE Mark approval in Europe for both MR and tricuspid regurgitation.

There are ongoing studies comparing TEER with MitraClip versus surgical mitral valve repair in patients with degenerative MR. One of those studies PRIMARY is a superiority trial funded by the National Institutes of Health with a planned enrollment of 450 patients at all levels of surgical risk. The other study is REPAIR MR a noninferiority study testing MitraClip versus valve repair surgery in degenerative MR patients at intermediate risk. Results from both trials aren‚Äôt expected for several years.

The CLASP IIF study is also ongoing. In that study investigators are comparing Pascal to MitraClip in patients with functional MR and prohibitive surgical risk.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI3NzI5MzAzMjIwMDQ0NzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First-in-Human Experience With the ModulHeart Device for Mechanical Circulatory Support and Renal Perfusion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772930322004471 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzI3NzI5MzAzMjIwMDQ0NzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRjdG1kLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NpemluZy1taXNtYXRjaC1wcm9ibGVtLWJhbGxvb24tZXhwYW5kYWJsZS12YWx2ZXMtc21hbGwtYW5udWxpLXRhdmnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sizing Mismatch a Problem for Balloon-Expandable Valves in Small Annuli TAVI,"Worryingly mismatch at 1 year also predicted 3-year all-cause death spurring calls for RCTs in this setting.

BOSTON MA‚ÄîCompared with balloon-expandable bioprosthetic aortic valves self-expanding devices show superior hemodynamic performance at 1 year in patients with small annuli undergoing TAVI according to new registry data. Moreover use of a balloon-expandable valve was associated with moderate or severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) at 1 year which also was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at 3 years.

The observational results should be interpreted with caution said Walid Ben-Ali MD PhD (Montreal Heart Institute Canada) who presented the data today at TCT 2022 but ‚Äúbasically when you have severe PPM at 1 year you have a twofold relative hazard for all-cause mortality at 3 years.‚Äù

The findings aren‚Äôt yet enough to suggest that all patients with small annuli should be treated with self-expanding valves though several experts said.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs very difficult when you have these propensity-matched analyses to really make definitive decisions on that basis‚Äù said Alexandra Lansky MD (Yale University School of Medicine New Haven CT) during a discussion in the late-breaking clinical trial session. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important. I do think it needs to be validated. You need long-term follow-up. You need matched populations et cetera. So I think validating this in a prospective trial is important.‚Äù

Likewise Susheel Kodali MD (NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center NY) cautioned the audience that it‚Äôs easy to be seduced by large observational data sets and the signals they can suggest ‚Äúespecially when you are dealing with devices that are so different.‚Äù He emphasized that valve types are chosen for a variety of reasons including lifetime management need for pacemaker and coronary access.

‚ÄúWe all agree we want the largest valve area and we struggle with how to assess it what the valve area truly is and we make decisions based on a lot of factors‚Äù Kodali continued. ‚ÄúThis is really enticing but we have to wait for the data to answer the question that was asked: will it impact . . . device choice?‚Äù

The panelists agreed that the ongoing SMART trial will hopefully give more definitive answers in this space.

FRANCE-TAVI Results

For the study Ben-Ali and colleagues included data on 1195 patients from the FRANCE-TAVI registry with small aortic annuli‚Äîdefined as a diameter ‚â§ 23 mm or an indexed diameter ‚â§ 12 mm/m2 measured on CT‚Äîwho underwent TAVI with either a supra-annular self-expanding valve (Evolut R/Pro; Medtronic) or a balloon-expandable device (Sapien 3; Edwards Lifesciences).

The researchers conducted propensity matching through two methods. The first (n = 928) used 10 anatomical and clinical variables to create a propensity score and patients were matched in a 1:3 fashion depending on whether they were treated with a self-expanding or balloon-expandable device. The second (n = 1195) used the propensity score to generate an inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) as a sensitivity analysis.

After matching both cohorts were comparable in terms of demographics and basic echocardiographic and CT data as well as procedural and postprocedural results. However the hemodynamic performance was significantly better with the supra-annular self-expanding valves compared with balloon-expandable devices in terms of lower mean gradient and larger index effective orifice area at discharge 30 days and 1 year (P < 0.001 for all).

The rates of moderate or severe PPM at 1 year were significantly higher in the balloon expandable versus self-expanding valve groups before and after matching (P < 0.001 for all). Female sex (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.14-2.17) small annuli (HR 2.38 per 1-mm decrease; 95% CI 1.27-4.55) postprocedural mean gradient (HR 1.04 per 1-mm Hg increase; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) and valve type (HR 2.94; 95% CI 1.79-4.76) were all found to be independent predictors of moderate to severe PPM at 1 year in both matching strategies.

‚ÄúPatients treated with balloon expandable valves have threefold relative hazard to develop a moderate to severe PPM at 1 year‚Äù Ben-Ali said.

Additionally severe PPM at 1 year (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.02-3.95) length of index hospitalization (HR 1.05 per 1-day increase; 95% CI 1.01-1.09) major bleeding (HR 2.86; 95% CI 1.07-7.66) and atrial fibrillation (HR 3.46; 95% CI 2.08-5.74) were all found to be independent predictors of 3-year mortality in the first matching strategy. Using the IPTW strategy valve type (HR 1.93; 95% CI 1.2-3.11) and annulus size (HR 1.23 per 1-mm decrease; 95% CI 1.06-1.41) also were predictors of 3-year all-cause mortality.

‚ÄòPower of Large Registries‚Äô

During the discussion Bernard Prendergast MD (St Thomas' Hospital London England) said that the assessment of PPM is well known to be complicated ‚Äúand achieving those measurements in the context of a national registry without a core lab is a very difficult call. That said‚Äù he continued ‚ÄúI think this study and [the TEER SHOCK registry presented in the same session] have shown the power of large registries to yield data which guide the field. And while patient-prosthesis mismatch may not be so important in very elderly patients many of whom are in this registry we know from the surgical data that PPM is important in younger patients.‚Äù

Prendergast added that ‚Äúthese data are a call to our colleagues in industry and the engineers who design new valves to think about the needs of patients with small annuli as we move into the fourth and fifth generations of TAVR devices.‚Äù

These data are a call to our colleagues in industry and the engineers who design new valves to think about the needs of patients with small annuli as we move into the fourth and fifth generations of TAVR devices. Bernard Prendergast

In a press conference Michael Young MD (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Lebanon NH) said he is ‚Äúcautiously reassured about the findings from this because in our practice I do think that we're thinking about this very carefully.‚Äù He added that some of the surgeons at his institutions are ‚Äúaggressive about doing root enlargements in the hopes for these small annuli getting a larger surgical prosthetic valve.‚Äù

In his practice Young added ‚Äúwe've swayed toward a supra-annular design‚Äù for patients with small annuli. Many end up with a ‚Äúgradient of 17-20 mm Hg when they start with a gradient of 40 mm Hg. They feel better they generally feel well but you just don't know number one durability and then number two what their clinical outcomes are going to be.‚Äù

Another issue that comes into play when choosing a bioprosthesis relates to lifetime management of the patient Young said. ‚ÄúThat has actually come into discourse in terms of choosing SAVR vs TAVR at this point. Usually when the annulus is small we‚Äôre also looking at the sinuses and sometimes the sinuses can be very small. So you worry about sinus sequestration and boxing the patient in so to speak in the next 5-10 years who knows what their coronary options will be.‚Äù

Also during the press conference Robert Cubeddu MD (NCH Heart Institute Naples FL) said that while the data support ‚Äúwhat we already kind of know and think we have to remind ourselves this is a retrospective view with a nonadjudicated core lab definitions of PPM et cetera which are incredibly important.‚Äù

Awaiting SMART Results

The data place added pressure on the SMART trial data said David J. Cohen MD (St. Francis Hospital Roslyn NY) during the TCT session. ‚ÄúAnd not of the 1-year results which are going to be presented first from that trial but the 5-year results which will give us a sense of whether this really makes a difference for patients especially patients who are not in the extreme elderly group who may expect to live for 5-10 years‚Äù he clarified. ‚ÄúWe need that desperately to really know what is best for that challenging group because the PPM rates here are not trivial.‚Äù

In agreement panelist Anita Asgar MD (Montreal Heart Institute Canada) said all of these data will become increasingly important as TAVI moves into lower-risk patients. ‚ÄúHemodynamics we maybe didn't ignore but it wasn't perhaps as much of an issue in the elderly population‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd now with younger patients we need to take all these things into consideration.‚Äù

What will also be important is ‚Äúunderstanding how these hemodynamics vary under exercise and stress‚Äù she added.

Session co-moderator Jane Leopold MD (Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital Boston MA) reiterated this point saying: ‚ÄúExercise hemodynamics [are] incredibly important because the hemodynamics at rest just don't predict what the patient does when the patient gets up and walks out from the hospital.‚Äù",,,,,,

Running the Math for F2P Players

As per our calculations the following sums up the chances for F2P Players. This time it is going to be a little different for the League-specific Points-wise breakdown as you can‚Äôt get the same amount of League-Specific points across all leagues like TOTS.

Resource Management

Rivalries Tickets Transfer Tokens EPL League-Specific Points Rivalries Tokens Main Skill Games 39900 2100 11900 1050 Free Star Pass 8150 725 425 Free League Pass 7500 900 2200 Daily Ads 6300 1050 630 Daily Claim 1800 1200 Exchanges 7500 3000 1000 Reward Path Milestones 30000 Kickoff Rivalries Matchups 14000 Kickoff Rivalries Offers 126000 Transfer Path Milestones 1900 100 Kickoff Rivalries Quests 3000 300 3500 300 Premium Star Pass 40750 2250 6600 1275 Premium Paid Pass 22500 2700 Total 106050~169300 9275~14225 157600~164200 3505~4780 Credits: FIFA Mobile Forum Twitter

Additionally you can get more Rivalries Tickets from the Kickoff Rivalries League Rewards chapter that varies on how much you progress in your respective league-specific paths. Keeping that in mind we have not factored in that amount which is definitely not less for our calculation of total Rivalries Tickets.

You can get at least a minimum of 106050 Rivalries Tickets and 9275 Rivalries Tokens from the event.

Once again your Points solely depend on how much you choose to spend on the exchanges. Additionally note that since the League-Specific Points rotate across the skill games the Kickoff Rivalries Offer Exchanges remain for the League even after they complete their weekly rotation. Yes you do get your Rivalries Offer Exchanges daily for every league once they start in their skill games rotation. This brings the total points across all leagues being free-to-play to:

Leagues Kickoff Rivalries Exchange Offers Total League-Specific Points Premier League 126000 157600~164200 Bundesliga 105000 136600~143200 Ligue 1 84000 115600~122200 La Liga 63000 94600~101200 Serie A 42000 73600~80200 Rest of the World 21000 52600~59200 Credits: Luixen Twitter

So as soon as a new league opens up it gets its own Kickoff Rivalries Exchange Offers that refresh daily and stays till the end of the event. Additionally the above points tally is just the total without factoring the additional League-Specific Points you can get from the various Trade-Ins for trading Rivalries Tickets on a 1:1 Ratio.

You can get the maximum number of League-Specific Points for the Premier League (EPL)

Remember at the end of the day all your gains and losses from this event come down to how much you focus on the Exchanges be it for the League-Specific Points or the Pinnacle Points. So if you have earned a lot of coins from past events and have a stockpile of players should have it easy in the Kickoff Rivalries.

We usually never suggest buying the Star Pass but if you were able to spend your $10 on the game even once this is the time when it is definitely worth it. The Pass does appear to be worth it and will make the difference between what you can claim and what you can‚Äôt from the final Pinnacle Players.

If you follow the above path you will need to vary how you spend the Rivalries Tickets across the six leagues. There is another alternative track on how to obtain the 98 OVR Players across the various leagues and in the end it comes down to you on how you want to choose your path:

2x 98 OVR  2x 95 OVR and 2x 92 OVR Players from the Premier League ( 17400 Tickets Trade-In )

If you follow the above path you will need to vary how you spend the Rivalries Tickets across the six leagues with the additional caveat of having the extra Rivalries Tickets from Star Pass in your inventory.

Focusing on the 102 OVR Players (with Star Pass and all the 6 League Passes)

There is another alternative track on how to obtain both the 102 OVR Players from the Premier League but involves all the six individual League Passes as well and in the end it comes down to you on how you want to choose your path:

2x 102 OVR Player s from the Premier League ( 139750 Tickets Trade-In )

( ) 2x 98 OVR and 2x 95 OVR Players from the Bundesliga ( 13750 Tickets Trade-In )

Please remember we are not encouraging anyone to spend their hard-earned cash on the game and buy the Star Pass. It is completely one‚Äôs choice whether they want to spend on the game or not. But still if you were saving to buy the Star Pass for once this is the time. This is seriously the one time buying and completing the Star Pass can give you an additional boost that might be worth it. The Star Pass also rewards you with 103 OVR Event Icons LB Roberto Carlos.

Maximizing Pinnacle Points

Pinnacle Points is this event‚Äôs Ultimate and going after maximizing the Pinnacle Points might just be the best way to go. But for that remember there are lots and lots of Exchanges so if you want to maximize Pinnacle Points don‚Äôt rule out going for any Exchanges.

Now in order to complete the maximum Kickoff Rivalries Offer Exchanges you need a stockpile of 89 OVRs on your team. If you have been watching the market and buying cards using your coins then this should be a smooth transition.

FIFA Mobile League-Specific Exchanges (Image via Electronic Arts)

To be precise you are looking at a grand total of 294x 89 OVRs to complete all of the exchanges. And if you want to stay free-to-play without buying any of the League Passes or the Star Pass then just go for all the Exchanges!

On completing all the exchanges your numbers bump up drastically you can actually get both the 92 OVRS from all the six leagues both the 95 OVRs from all the six leagues and both the 98 OVRs from 3-4 leagues given how you proceed with your Tickets and Star Pass. Additionally with the Milestone Rewards rewarding extra Rivalries Tickets as you claim the players you won‚Äôt even need all the 294x 89 OVRs to gather the points! Therefore you can claim:

12x 92 OVR Players across six leagues

across 12x 95 OVR Players across six leagues

across 6x 98 OVR Players across the first three leagues

You can get a total of 6x 98 OVR Players and a massive 1350 Pinnacle Points being free-to-play if you complete all the Exchanges and Trade-Ins

Additionally you can obtain more Pinnacle Points from the weekly Kickoff Rivalries Offer Exchanges. You need a total of 4x 92+ OVR Players from the Reward Path per week you can get them from the market to obtain 200 Pinnacle Points per week from the exchanges. They grow exponentially as new leagues unlock with the previous exchanges remaining throughout the leagues.

Therefore if you complete all the Pinnacle Points exchanges every week you will stack up a total of 4200 Pinnacle Points just from the exchanges alone!

In fact that is not all on the Kickoff Transfer Wheel we are guaranteed 50 Pinnacle Points on every 10th pull along with a Kickoff Transfer Player. With free-to-players having guaranteed 30 pulls a further 150 Pinnacle Points is also up for grabs taking the total to:

1350 Pinnacle Points from Player Rewards

from 4200 Pinnacle Points from the Pinnacle Points Exchanges

from the 150 Pinnacle Points from the Kickoff Transfer Wheel

You can get a maximum total of 5700 Pinnacle Points being free-to-play if you complete all the exchanges

Keep in mind that you might need to do the Unlimited League-Specific Points exchanges at least 10-15 times to obtain the above goal.

Maximizing Pinnacle Points (with Star Pass)

Combining the Star Pass with the above calculations you can only slightly improve your gains from the Pinnacle Points. Here the advantage is since you obtain a lot of Rivalries Tickets you can relax from completing the Rivalries Offer Exchanges for League-Specific Points. This can lead you to a total Pinnacle Points of:

12x 92 OVR Players across six leagues

across 12x 95 OVR Players across six leagues

across 7x 98 OVR Players across the first four leagues

You can get a total of 7x 98 OVR Players and a massive 1425 Pinnacle Points being free-to-play if you complete all the Exchanges and Trade-Ins

Your Exchanges for the Pinnacle Points remain the same rewarding with 4200 Pinnacle Points despite the Star Pass while you gain an additional 10 pulls from the Kickoff Transfer Wheel guaranteeing a further 200 Pinnacle Points taking the total to:

1425 Pinnacle Points from Player Rewards

from 4200 Pinnacle Points from the Pinnacle Points Exchanges

from the 200 Pinnacle Points from the Kickoff Transfer Wheel

You can get a maximum total of 5825 Pinnacle Points being free-to-play if you complete all the exchanges

Keep in mind that you might need to do the Unlimited League-Specific Points exchanges at least 20-22 times to obtain the above goal.

Maximizing Pinnacle Points (with Star Pass and all the 6 League Passes)

Combining the Star Pass and all the six different League Passes with the above calculations you can only slightly improve your gains from the Pinnacle Points. Here the advantage is since you obtain extra League-Specific Points you can relax from completing the Unlimited Exchanges for League-Specific Points. This can lead you to a total Pinnacle Points of:

12x 92 OVR Players across six leagues

across 12x 95 OVR Players across six leagues

across 8x 98 OVR Players across the first four leagues

You can get a total of 8x 98 OVR Players and a massive 1500 Pinnacle Points being free-to-play if you complete all the Exchanges and Trade-Ins

Your Exchanges for the Pinnacle Points remain the same rewarding with 4200 Pinnacle Points despite the Star Pass while you gain an additional 10 pulls from the Kickoff Transfer Wheel guaranteeing a further 250 Pinnacle Points taking the total to:

1500 Pinnacle Points from Player Rewards

from 4200 Pinnacle Points from the Pinnacle Points Exchanges

from the 250 Pinnacle Points from the Kickoff Transfer Wheel

You can get a maximum total of 5950 Pinnacle Points being free-to-play if you complete all the exchanges

Keep in mind that you might need to do the Unlimited League-Specific Points exchanges at least 10 times to obtain the above goal.

Thus you can see buying the Star Pass and all the League-Specific Passes only increases your Pinnacle Points by a small number. Although if you choose to focus on getting both the 102 OVRs and quite a few 98s then Star Pass can be a viable option for you. Keep it in mind that all the players from this event are available in the market so avoiding the Star Pass embracing this event as a completely free-to-play player and performing all the Exchanges to maximize the Pinnacle Points should be your way to go.

The company is now leading the way in developing Malta‚Äôs digital infrastructure and the provision of best-in-class communication services.

Three years on Ulrich K√∂llensperger partner at EQT Infrastructure and Melita advisory board member reflects on the motivations behind the acquisition developments at Melita since and the company‚Äôs plans for the future.

‚ÄùEQT is very clear about its approach to investing in companies around the world. We have a track record of nearly three decades of acquiring good companies and actively helping them to become great and sustainable. This is exactly the approach we are taking with Melita and the results have been impressive‚Äù K√∂llensperger said.

Speaking about EQT‚Äôs decision to buy Melita back in 2019 K√∂llensperger said: ‚ÄúIn the 1990s Melita was a pioneer in delivering cable TV to Malta establishing itself as a leading domestic brand in what has become one of the most digitally connected countries in Europe. 2016 saw the arrival of Harald R√∂sch who has been CEO since.

‚ÄúUnder Harald‚Äôs leadership Melita has transformed itself focusing on customer service and upgrading its network. By 2019 significant progress had been made and we at EQT decided to invest in Melita as it had proved itself to be a good company with significant further development potential. We were also drawn to Malta as a country with its impressive track record of economic growth and development low unemployment rate significant tourism industry and a highly advanced communications and digital environment.‚Äù

When asked to highlight how EQT has helped Melita‚Äôs achievements over the past three years R√∂sch said: ‚ÄúA key area of growth has been the business segment where Melita Business is now serving many large and small enterprises backed by the services offered at Malta‚Äôs largest and only purpose-built data centre. Melita has also joined forces with a number of companies that provide complimentary services transforming it into an ideal one-stop-shop for all business connectivity requirements.

Under Harald‚Äôs [R√∂sch] leadership Melita has transformed itself focusing on customer service and upgrading its network

‚ÄúFrom a customer service perspective Melita has continued to improve. Independent customer research shows that Melita‚Äôs customers have a very high level of satisfaction when measured against international benchmarks. The fixed and mobile network is also world class. Melita continues to be one of the very few operators worldwide and the only one in Europe able to offer a 5G mobile network and a gigabit fibre-powered broadband service nationwide. This focus on combining top class customer service with strong infrastructure has served Melita well enabling it to add both retail and business customers.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúMelita has not only improved its performance over the past three years. It has also become increasingly focused on sustainability catering to EQT‚Äôs strategic target of making a positive impact through every investment. This year Melita became the first EQT portfolio company to have its science-based targets validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative.

‚ÄúThis collaboration between the United Nations Global Compact CDP World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is designed to drive ambitious climate action in the private sector.

‚ÄúOur efforts to become sustainable are also having a direct impact on our financial position. In fact we have recently been able to convert an existing ‚Ç¨20 million revolving credit facility into a sustainability-linked credit facility. This means that the interest rate charged by lenders on this facility will be reduced subject to Melita reaching specific sustainability targets.

‚ÄúThis commitment to sustainability is matched by efforts to support the community; the Melita Foundation has invested ‚Ç¨500000 into the development of digital skills the environment and Malta‚Äôs heritage.‚Äù

Looking ahead EQT will continue supporting Melita in its ambitious plans for growth. K√∂llensperger provided further insight on the roadmap ahead.

‚ÄúMelita‚Äôs digital infrastructure is a cornerstone of its competitive advantage and one which will be strengthened by continuously investing to drive fibre deeper into the fixed network. The 5G mobile and gigabit fibre- powered internet networks will remain vital in attracting foreign investment to Malta while creating the opportunity to develop new services he said.

‚ÄúA clear example is melita.io which offers nationwide 5G Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) and LoRaWAN networks. Thanks to its broad set of roaming agreements international partners and experience melita.io has taken its IoT connectivity offering internationally. Building on the company‚Äôs strong IoT and fibre offerings is a key focus of Melita‚Äôs innovation and growth for EQT in the coming years.

‚ÄúAt Melita we have a great team which has embraced our ambition to make Melita a great company; both in the products and services it delivers to customers and its impact on the wider community. While there‚Äôs always more to do everyone at Melita can be proud of how far they have come and excited about what the future holds.‚Äù

CNN ‚Äî

Home owners renters and potential buyers look at housing and the real estate market from different often conflicting perspectives.

There are alarming headlines for all three in recent weeks:

This convergence speaks to the larger problem of a shortage of affordable housing in the US as well as the broad issue of affordability and leads to stories like this: Majority of Americans say they‚Äôre worried about being able to pay for housing.

I went to Anna Bahney the CNN Business writer focused on real estate to understand why there‚Äôs a housing shortage and what if anything anyone is doing about it.

Our conversation conducted by email is below.

A housing shortage an affordability crisis

WHAT MATTERS: I have read both that there‚Äôs a housing shortage and that there‚Äôs a housing crisis. Is there a difference between those ideas ‚Äì a shortage and a crisis? And is the problem that there literally aren‚Äôt enough houses for the number of people in the US?

BAHNEY: The ‚Äúhousing crisis‚Äù is actually an ‚Äúaffordability crisis.‚Äù Part of the reason housing has become so expensive for Americans is because there is a national shortage of homes. Record low interest rates during the pandemic coupled with more than a decade of under building created a supply and demand mismatch that has pushed home prices higher.

The US has fallen behind by about 5.5 million housing units over the past 20 years as builders failed to keep up with historical building trends. If you add in property destruction due to demolition or natural disasters among other things the total shortfall could be 6.8 million during that time according to the National Association of Realtors.

This is a gap so deep that it would take more than a decade to catch up. But even if more homes and apartments are built it won‚Äôt matter unless people can afford them.

Mortgage rates are the highest they have been since 2008 and home prices remain near record highs pricing many prospective homebuyers out of the market. Those people then remain in the already tight rental market pushing rents up even further.

As tenants reach the limits of what they can afford to pay each month homeownership gets further out of reach as they struggle to save for a down payment. This widens the wealth gap and locks in place inequities between those who benefit financially from homeownership and those who don‚Äôt. It also widens the racial home ownership gap in which 72% of White Americans are homeowners while only 43% of Black Americans own a home.

The cost of housing is driving inflation

WHAT MATTERS: The cost of housing has been cited as a cause of inflation. To what extent is that true and what is the market force that could lower the cost of housing?

BAHNEY: The soaring cost of housing has been a key driver of inflation. For most people housing is their biggest expense. About one-third of the Consumer Price Index a basket of goods and services the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to track inflation is the ‚Äúshelter‚Äù component.

Last month the index showed that inflation was worse than expected and the housing component had risen 6.2% from a year ago the biggest increase since 1991. Stubbornly high inflation means that the Federal Reserve will likely take aggressive action at its meeting next week with either a 75 basis-point hike in interest rates or potentially a 100 basis-point hike.

But there are some early signs of cooling in the housing market. Home sales have been dropping for six months in a row as the rising cost to buy and finance a home pushes more people out of the housing market. As demand dries up prices will come down and eventually mortgage rates will settle.

Where is the housing shortage felt the worst?

WHAT MATTERS: Which parts of the country are most affected by this problem?

BAHNEY: Cities in the Sun Belt like Phoenix and Austin saw some of the biggest increases in housing costs during the pandemic. In Miami the price of a home is up 33% from a year ago and rents are up 26% from last year. But the affordability crisis is happening nationally in all regions of the country.

The median-priced house now costs $749 more per month

WHAT MATTERS: The Fed‚Äôs medicine for inflation is to raise interest rates which has driven up mortgage rates. That might control sales prices but won‚Äôt it make the cost of housing more expensive?

BAHNEY: The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates in order to stem inflation which may reduce demand but also makes the cost of buying a home even more expensive.

But the Fed doesn‚Äôt set the rate borrowers pay on mortgages directly. Instead mortgage rates tend to track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury. As investors anticipate the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes they often sell government bonds which sends yields higher and with it mortgage rates.

The rate on a typical 30-year-fixed mortgage has more than doubled from a year ago making a home purchase that was possible then out of reach for some today.

A year ago a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $359900 home and financed the rest with a mortgage rate of 2.86% ‚Äì which was the average at the time ‚Äì had a monthly payment of $1192.

Today a homeowner buying the median priced home which is now $403800 with a mortgage at the current average of 6.02% would pay $1941 a month in principal and interest. That‚Äôs $749 more every month.

Americans are now spending more than 35% of their median income on monthly principal and interest payments on that median-priced home. Historically Americans spent closer to 25% of their median income on payments.

To get back to that level some combination of these things would need to happen according to mortgage data company Black Knight: a person‚Äôs income would need to grow by 40% mortgage rates would have to be cut in half or there would need to be a 30% drop in the median price of a house.

None of those are likely to happen any time soon.

Homeownership is getting out of reach

WHAT MATTERS: If housing prices go down it will mean millions of people lose value in their main asset. If housing prices don‚Äôt go down it means millions of Americans will never own a home. It seems like an impossible situation.

BAHNEY: Some housing economists have been saying lately that the housing industry is in a recession but homeowners aren‚Äôt feeling that way. Sure there are plenty of examples of cooling in the housing industry (mortgage firm layoffs home builders pulling back home sales falling). But homeowners still have tremendous equity in their homes which has risen by an average of $60000 in the past year.

Still millions of people are being shut out of homebuying as the affordability challenges prove insurmountable.

In April 2021 a household had to earn about $80000 a year to afford payments on the median-priced home with a modest down payment of 3.5%. A year later the income requirement was $108000. This cost increase means that about 4 million renter households that could have bought the median-priced home last year could no longer do so 12 months later.

How can this problem be fixed?

WHAT MATTERS: What are some of the ideas to fix this problem? Is there an effective way the government can act?

BAHNEY: Most housing policy experts say that building a steady supply of new moderately priced homes is job number one. But because those homes are not as profitable for builders as larger higher-priced homes it will take a concerted effort by both public and private sectors.

In May the Biden administration announced a Housing Supply Action Plan to close the affordability gap and ease housing costs. The plan aims to boost the supply of affordable housing by enhancing existing federal financing and incentivizing areas to reform zoning and land use policies to build more lower-cost housing. It also calls for homebuilders to adopt more efficient construction methods.

But none of this is a quick fix and some of it requires congressional action.

Separately the Federal Housing Finance Administration which oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has announced plans this summer to expand home financing options for buyers particularly those of color to close the racial homeownership gap. These programs include down payment assistance lower mortgage insurance premiums and a credit reporting system that factors in rent payment history.

Some of these ideas including new zero down payment loans with no closing costs for buyers in specific Black or Hispanic neighborhoods are already in place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL2JsYWNrLXNlYXR0bGUtaG9tZW93bmVyc2hpcC1yZW1haW5zLWxvdy1hLXByb2dyYW0tdG8tZml4LWl0LXN0cnVnZ2xlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black Seattle homeownership remains low.

Cash Only‚Äôs 420 Recs is an ongoing series where interesting folks offer recommendations for all things 420 ‚Äî what strains they like what weed products are blowing their minds and what they like to do once stoned.

Mira Gonzalez rolls the best most aerodynamic blunts west of the Mississippi. On the east the award goes to Janice Griffith‚ÄîCash Only fam and unsurprisingly one of Mira‚Äôs BFFs. Her skills are so good that she could easily land one of those gigs being the personal roller for a rapper‚Äîmaybe Waka Flocka Flame is still hiring?

Yes Mira is a legendary toker and she‚Äôll tell you she has the tolerance of at least five grown men though the number could be higher. Outside of huffing Dutchies Mira is an accomplished writer poet and illustrator‚Äîwith an always-funny Twitter to boot. She‚Äôs also published a poetry collection an NSFW coloring book and temporarily co-hosted a really good podcast called ‚ÄúReally Good Financial Advice.‚Äù

Mira and I go back to our days as editors at Merry Jane Snoop Dogg‚Äôs cannabis media brand. One of the best parts of that gig entailed me catching a ride to work with Gonzalez and us chain smoking blunts while brainstorming articles or talking shit for the whole damn cruise. We also did some great work like breaking a story on black market vape carts and how they were causing a mysterious lung illness amongst consumers as well as partnering with Pornhub on a series of videos including one in which Mira and Janice turned a fleshlight into a bong.

Mira always makes me laugh and her 420 Recommendations for Cash Only definitely scratched that itch. Below the weed lord explains how strain names are mostly fake her love of getting high and ‚Äúfreaking the fuck out‚Äù to weird movies and shopping for very expensive hyper-realistic babies on Etsy. Thanks Mira we love ya!

What‚Äôs your current favorite strain and how do you like to consume it?

Mira Gonzalez: Honestly one of the first things I learned when I started working in the weed space is that strains are mostly fake and so is the divide between indica and sativa lol.

For example my first job involving weed was as a budtender for a weed dispensary in Los Angeles when I was 19. When we got new weed me the one other employee and the owner would smoke a blunt together. Then the three of us would collectively decide if the weed would be labeled as indica or sativa and what that strain would be called. (Anything we gave the name ‚ÄúGirl Scout Cookies‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlue Dream‚Äù would sell extremely fast.)

All of that is just to say I don‚Äôt really have a favorite strain. I find it‚Äôs more reliable to choose my weed based on scent THC content and vibes.

My favorite way to get stoned kinda changes depending on my mood. I go through phases but lately I‚Äôve been dabbing a lot.

When it comes to flower though my favorite way to smoke will always be blunts. Dutches are my preferred brand but tbh I‚Äôm not picky. I‚Äôll never be too proud to smoke a Swisher if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs available.

Do you have any favorite weed products right now?

Like I said I‚Äôve been dabbing a lot. Raw Garden is probably my favorite brand for concentrates.

I also love edibles but I have the weed tolerance of like five grown men so I always want the really strong shit. In California that mainly comes in the form of pills and tinctures. Some of my favorite brands are Protab (tablets) and Proof (tinctures). For flower I love Pure Beauty.

What activity do you like to do after you‚Äôve gotten really stoned?

I love getting really high and braiding my hair. I also like finding weird or niche Etsy shops. The other day I found a shop that just sells hyper-realistic fake babies for thousands of dollars each. The shop had a ton of five star reviews from really happy customers.

Can you recommend something to watch while really high?

Well personally I love to get high and freak the fuck out; just absolutely lose my shit. So if that sounds appealing to you here are some of my recommendations:

Eraserhead (1977)

Angst (1983)

House (1977)

Natural Born Killers (1994)

SexWorld (1978)

Can you recommend something to listen to while smoking?

Taylor Swift.

Can you recommend something to read once stoned?

Wikipedia.

Who‚Äôs in your dream blunt rotation?

Cornel West and Dolly Parton.

Lex Pott is a Dutch artist known for his unique take on candles. One of his most popular items is the Twist candle one piece of wax shaped to form both the base and the candle itself which burns at both ends according to its listing on Mociun where it sells for $45. The candle weighs in at 270 grams (just over 9 ounces) and has a burn time of approximately 10 hours per end (via Lex Pott). This is significantly less than your average 8 ounce candle that can burn for as long as 55 hours says Malibu Apothecary.

The Twist candle is unique; it's not something you'd typically find in most homes. This is in part due to its hefty price tag which often deters homeowners from purchasing a Lex Pott creation. Luxury candles aren't a new concept but the average person may have trouble justifying buying a pricier candle when there are often very similar styles at a more affordable price.

You're probably familiar with the challenges of climbing Mount Everest the world's tallest mountain at 29032 feet above sea level. But mountaineering experts agree that K2 (or Mount Godwin-Austen) the world's second highest peak at 28251 feet is a lot harder to climb (via World Data). According to The New York Times one in 34 people die trying to reach the summit of Everest; in K2 the death toll goes up to a very scary 1 in 4 people. That's a 4% versus a 29% fatality rate (per Insider).

K2 is a tricky mountain to climb for many reasons. Even getting to Base Camp is no walk in the park. On Everest Base Camp can be reached via a long but relatively easy hike while K2's Base Camp requires a climb/trek over a glacier from difficult-to-access Pakistan (via Insider). Things only get harder from there. K2's weather is more unpredictable the climbing is more technical and there are fewer groups going up the mountain so help is less likely to be available if you run into trouble. Overall Insider points out there's a 40% chance nobody will reach the summit of K2 in any given year but there are climbers who summit almost every year on Everest.

And while Everest has a higher fatality count that's only because more people attempt the climb. National Geographic reports that as of 2018 more than 4000 have reached the summit of Everest but fewer than 400 can say the same about K2.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pittsfield Council OKs Honorary Street Name for Theater Leaders



Maggie LaMee general manager of Barrington Stage speaks at the council meeting in support of the honorary designation.

PITTSFIELD Mass. ‚Äî Union Street will now honor Julianne Boyd and Mary Ann Quinson of Barrington Stage Company as ""Boyd Quinson Way.""

The City Council on Tuesday approved the city's first honorary street naming after Ward 6 Councilor Dina Guiel Lampiasi petitioned for such a process.

Lampiasi wanted to give Pittsfield an opportunity to highlight its strengths.



""We like so many New England towns have an incredible history we are the sum of the people that have lived here and come from here and often times dedicated their life's work to bettering this community"" she said during last month's council meeting where the petition was approved.



""So by adopting a mechanism to commemorate these people with commemorative street signs we are really telling our history and making sure we don't forget it but also educating not only the people that live here but visitors that come through town.""



The councilor explained that these two women have contributed ""enormously"" to the downtown revitalization of North Street and bringing people into the arts.



Underneath the original street sign will be an brown and white honorary sign at the corners of Union and North Street and Union and Northrop Street.



Boyd founded the theater company in 1995 on a ""shoestring budget"" and BSC purchased the historic Berkshire Music Hall at 30 Union St. 10 years later.



The facility underwent a multi-million dollar renovation and was welcomed by the city in 2006 with a parade. It was named the Boyd Quinson Stage after the two stage company leaders.



Since then BSC has purchased and renovated four additional buildings throughout Pittsfield and has become a staple for both tourists and locals attracting around 60000 patrons annually.



Its 2022 budget has grown to $5.5 million with 24 year-round staff members and 180 jobs for seasonal employees and artists.



Boyd also has directed in the stage company's 10x10 New Play Festival and many other productions. She retired at the end of this season.



Quinson who is referred to as ""Minkie"" is a founding board member and president for 19 years.



She is described as being ""pivotal"" in BSC's relocation from its original location in Sheffield to Pittsfield and her advocacy is credited with many positive aspects of the theatre.



Quinson has a master's degree in social work and has done a great deal in that field working with multiple related entities and opening a private practice in 1993 before becoming the board president in 1995.



She is currently the chairman and is said to provide financial leadership passion and vision to BSC.



The street designation was unanimously approved and multiple community members attended the meeting to speak in support of it during an open microphone.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That's the outlook from airlines and the tourism industry going into the fall travel season and looking forward to the winter holidays.

Hopper a travel agency that analyzes data for airfare price predictions is seeing strong booking demand for holiday travel after an ""extraordinary"" summer.

The pent-up demand after two pandemic years is in part because for some travelers this will be the first time they visit family for the holidays since COVID-19 erupted said Hopper spokeswoman Lindsay Schwimer.

""Last year omicron was surging around the holiday season so people will be eager to take holiday trips this year and see family and friends"" she said.

Airlines are hiring more workers

This summer was a challenge for flying: Many flights were delayed or canceled. Staffing shortages were a big contributor to that.

About 2.3 million fewer aviation jobs existed worldwide in September 2021 down 21% from pre-pandemic levels according to Oxford Economics. That included about 340000 fewer jobs in the airline industry.

Airlines are taking steps to improve their operations.

U.S. airline employment in June 2022 increased by 6775 workers to a total of 767263 including 458136 full-time passenger airline workers according to the most recent data from the Department of Transportation. That's an increase from the same month in 2019 before the pandemic.

Three airlines drove the increase: Delta Air Lines hired 2981 people that month United Airlines added 1322 and Southwest Airlines added 1007.

Airlines for America a trade group representing U.S. airlines said its seven-member passenger carriers ‚Äì Alaska American Delta Hawaiian JetBlue Southwest and United ‚Äì were staffed with 10% more pilots per block hour compared with before the pandemic.

(In the airline industry block hours measure the time from when an aircraft's door closes at departure to when it opens at arrival.)

American Airlines hired about 12000 people across a variety of job categories last year Isom said during the conference. He also said the company is ""making good progress"" as American continued hiring through the summer to prepare for the coming months.

But there will be fewer flights this fall

Despite the staffing growth airlines still don't have enough workers to meet the demand.

Many responded by removing flights from their schedules.

""Flight schedules for September and October are down by 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels and carriers are reducing September flights by 5% compared to what was planned at the start of the summer"" Airlines for America spokeswoman Marli Collier said.

""Airlines set their schedules months in advance and are constantly evaluating to optimize performance and prioritize smooth operations.""

Mother-daughter pilot duo:Pair makes history at Hawaiian Airlines

American Airlines which operates the majority of flights out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport recently published its final schedule for November that showed 30000 fewer flights.

A spokesman for American Airlines Brian Metham said the airline works off what it calls a ""placeholder schedule"" which is published about a year in advance and adjusts it closer to the time the flights are scheduled.

Its final schedule is published about 100 days in advance he said. On average American operates nearly 5300 departures daily nationwide.

American's full-year flight capacity for 2022 is forecast to end about 7.5% to 9.5% lower than before the pandemic Metham said.

How to book your holiday 2022 flights

‚ñ∫ Don't delay: Industry experts suggest travelers book their flights as soon as possible.

Now through Oct. 20 is when consumers will find the best airfares for Thanksgiving and the December holidays Schwimer said. Higher prices and limited options are likely after mid-October.

""There are still deals available now for the holidays which is why we recommend booking as soon as you see a price you‚Äôre comfortable with"" she said.

‚ñ∫ Save money by flying off-peak: Avoiding peak travel days can result in savings.

Expedia found in its flight data for Thanksgiving that travelers could save an average 5% on airfare by flying on the Sunday Monday or Tuesday before the holiday instead of Wednesday.

""For some destinations the savings are even bigger ‚Äì average ticket prices for Las Vegas for example drop from around $550 to $380 (round trip) just by changing the departure date to earlier in the week"" said Francheska Taveras spokeswoman for the Expedia Group.

‚ñ∫ The two best days to fly: For travelers flexible on their dates or waiting until the last minute Schwimer said the best deals for the holidays are when the fewest travelers are expected: Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve.

The housewife and her family will be visiting Malaysia for three days in November. Earlier this year the expected waiting time for new passports was six weeks.

In May ICA received more than 7000 passport applications per day and long queues formed outside the ICA Building in Kallang Road.

Ms Zalina was surprised she could collect the passports so quickly.

Singaporeans who apply for a new passport can now expect a shorter processing time of one to two weeks ICA told The Sunday Times on Sept 13.

But those with year-end travel plans should apply for a passport now said ICA.

It added: ""Based on pre-Covid-19 trends passport applications typically peak between October and December.

""Singaporeans who submit their passport (application) late will risk not being able to collect their passport in time for their travel.""

ICA reminded Singaporeans that the processing time depends greatly on the volume of applications it receives. Applicants should also factor in additional waiting time for an appointment to collect the passport when it is ready.

To tackle the surge in May nearly 300 officers from other work units across ICA were deployed to process and produce passports.

ICA noted how it has worked with SingPost to increase the passport issuance capacity and that the combined efforts have greatly improved the situation.

Travel experts urged those who require a passport to apply now ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays.

In a survey commissioned by The Straits Times and conducted by market research firm Milieu Insight in September 32 per cent of the 1000 respondents said they will be travelling overseas in the last four months of the year and have already booked tickets or accommodation.

Ms Lavinia Rajaram Asia head of public relations for Expedia Group said that based on Expedia flight search data Bangkok Seoul and Kuala Lumpur remain the top travel destinations for Singaporeans.

Reminding Singaporeans who intend to travel to plan ahead Dr Michael Chiam a senior tourism lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic said: ""There might be a delay in the renewal of passports if there is another surge towards the end of the year.""",,,,,,

Before Domino‚Äôs deputy commerce editor Samantha Weiss-Hills and her husband Alex closed on their Bloomington Indiana home in 2017 they already had an email chain going with their architect. In exchange for $5000 Andrew Heathfield helped the couple mock up plans for their long-awaited renovation (they had been living in the untouched rental for more than a year at that point) which included a near-complete overhaul of the kitchen. Then Sam called up her contractor father to take the lead on the transformation. He built a range hood out of 2-by-4s installed their Bosch dishwasher and even bloodied a finger while hanging the sliding door leading to the new dining area but never without a smile on his face. ‚ÄúMy dad has been doing this forever so it was fun to watch him‚Äù she says.

The kitchen before.

Storage was paramount for the couple: they love to entertain plus Sam was working for Food52 at the time so she was constantly testing new recipes and gadgets. Not having to stress over labor costs freed up the budget for most of their must-have items. Ahead she takes us behind the scenes of her clever kitchen renovation.

A Clean Slate

At first Sam questioned whether shiny white cupboards from IKEA were the correct fit aesthetically for her circa-1900s bungalow but she was convinced it was the right move after she heard artist and designer Maya Schindler rave about how easy it is to wipe down hers. Plus the inner workings of the Swedish brand‚Äôs units are easily modified‚Äîthe one closest to the breakfast bar serves as the pantry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a massive fan of drawers‚Äù Sam says. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre not digging through everything constantly.‚Äù The cabinets in the dining room hold so much more than extra cookware: They‚Äôre a place to store records rarely used china and dog food. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a catchall‚Äù she notes. Refreshing the storage in both rooms came to a cool $10000.

Appliance (and Sink) Tetris

Dropping a proper island in the center of the kitchen offered an opportunity to play appliance Tetris. First off it provided a more sensible location for their new stainless steel dishwasher and $500 Ruvati sink (complete with cutting board garbage disposal drying rack and strainer). With those bits and bobs out of the way Sam and Alex could shift the refrigerator and the oven to the main wall resulting in the ever-sought-after work triangle.

It‚Äôs Groovy to Glide

The only demolition that took place involved widening the doorframe to what was previously the guest bedroom (now the dining room). ‚ÄúIt was a really hard pinch point‚Äù recalls Sam. Heathfield tasked custom fabricator Central Scenic with creating a sliding door made from polycarbonate and powder-coated steel that when Sam and Alex desired could separate the area from the kitchen. When guests come to stay the room acts as the ultimate flex space. ‚ÄúWe opted for soft close so it never slams‚Äù adds Sam.

Big Deal

The engineered hardwood flooring came in at‚Äîwait for it!‚Äî$200. It was luck really that their local shop was having a sidewalk sale: They were able to scoop up hundreds of square feet of flooring for practically nothing. A save like this left room in the budget for the splurge-worthy Heath backsplash tile (20 square feet cost $525). ‚ÄúWe wanted to bring a little bit of warmth in given it‚Äôs a bungalow‚Äù shares Sam.

Test Kitchen

Sam and Alex did some experimenting before ultimately landing on Caesarstone‚Äôs Frozen Tundra ($4700) for their countertops. To see which material could handle the ingredients they like to cook with they ordered four samples and splattered them with turmeric coffee and tomato paste then washed the surfaces. Still in need of some bonus counter space the couple topped a $300 wire cubby unit with a slab of butcher block. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so heavy now that it doesn‚Äôt even move‚Äù says Sam. ‚ÄúAnd it made it feel really cohesive [with the shelves].‚Äù

Tooth and Nail

The pegboard also fabricated by Central Scenic is chicer than your typical hardware store find: It‚Äôs stained an almost golden hue and features a streamlined miter edge. The catch the couple discovered too late? The bespoke design didn‚Äôt account for traditional peg-hook dimensions. ‚ÄúThey were too thick; they wouldn‚Äôt go all the way on‚Äù Sam recalls. Her fix was to buy the screw-in kind but she still had to hammer each individual one‚Äôs back so they would adhere properly.

Power Move

It‚Äôs the little details like outlet placement that make a kitchen reno go round. Having plugs on each side of the stove proved to be a game changer for Sam and Alex want to quickly use a stand mixer or blender. She also strategically placed one on the island and another at the coffee bar‚Äîbecause whether you need to get through the workday or construction caffeine is crucial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBob2Jsb2dyYXBoZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvd2hlbi15b3UtbmVlZC1hLWxpdHRsZS1leHRyYS10ZW5iYS1heGlzLXYyLXRvcC1sb2FkZXItcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When You Need A Little Extra: Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader Review,"Spread the love

Last Updated on 09/19/2022 by Feroz Khan

Tenba makes some marvelous camera bags that look good and work great. I fell in love with their BYOB series when I tested a handful of them last year. They just revamped their Axis lineup of tactical bags with some innovative features additional sizes and new models. I spent some time with the new Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader holster-style bag. With a unique extendable feature that allows the bag to hold a camera with an attached 70-200 f2.8 lens it‚Äôs an excellent camera bag for daily walkabout photography.

The Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader looks and sounds a lot like the Top Loader Pro AW series of bags from Lowepro. But Lowepro has just two bags in this range to accommodate lenses of different sizes. This bag has a feature where the bottom of the Axis Top Loader can be unzipped for more space. This allows you to take a DSLR (ungripped) or a mirrorless camera (gripped or ungripped) with even a 70-200 f2.8 lens attached (hood reversed). I‚Äôll enjoy this flexibility going forward; now I often have to take my backpack just to be able to carry my 70-200 on a photo walk. There were times when the only case that could safely hold my 70-200 lens was a backpack.

I may have just found my favorite walkabout camera bag for quick photowalks around the city. Tenba extended most of the new features of their Axis V2 range to the Top Loader bags which are available in two colors.

The Big Picture

Pros

Compact but expandable to accommodate a camera with up to a 70-200 f2.8 lens attached

Padded insert allows the inner space to be divided to keep slim accessories like a filter inside its case.

Can carry it with the padded shoulder strap or it can be hung on your waist belt.

Reflective MOLLE Webbing on the sides and front

You can add a Tenba Lens Capsule to almost double the space capacity of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader.

Neoprene sleeve inside allows you to conceal a tracking device such as an Apple AirTag.

Elastic side mesh pockets provide extra space for accessories like filters notebooks small speedlights and more.

Generously sized handle on the top allows you to easily grab and go.

Reversible silver and black rain cover included which collapses into an inbuilt cover in itself

CONS

No waist strap means the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader could swing a lot as you walk at a brisk pace.

Tracking device pocket could have been slightly larger. My Tile Sport Pro tracker didn‚Äôt fit easily.

MultiCam Black‚Ñ¢ model is USD 10 more than the regular black option.

Upper inner portion of the bag could have had an elastic sleeve or at least tiny pockets for storing filters and/or memory cards.

This bag does the job of accommodating a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a large lens like a 70-200 well. The versatility of the expandable bottom means you don‚Äôt have to look for a separate bag to use for your daily photowalks to fit a longer lens. Tenba users will be pleased with the bag‚Äôs ability to easily add on items from their accessory range. The 3D airmesh side allows you to loop your waist belt through. I wish Tenba provided a waist strap as well. It‚Äôs a great bag to throw a single camera and lens into. But if you‚Äôre creative enough with your organization you can easily add a pancake-sized (or slightly larger) lens as well. And the dedicated tracker compartment provides peace of mind about the bag‚Äôs whereabouts.

I‚Äôm giving the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag four out of five stars for its adaptable size feature and durability. It misses a star for the lack of an included waist strap and the inability to store slightly larger trackers in the provided pocket. That pocket really should have been expandable.

Want one? Check them out on Amazon if you‚Äôre interested.

Gear Used

I tested the Black version of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag with my Nikon D810 and my AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f2.8G ED VR II. I also tried it with my Nikon Z6II which had a Smallrig L Plate and my Nikon Z 24-120mm. The tracker pocket was tested with an Apple Airtag Tile Sport Pro and Airbolt Smart Lock. We got to keep the Top Loader bag from Tenba.

Innovations

Tenba has included a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù neoprene pocket inside the front compartment to store a Bluetooth or GPS tracker. While this is a nice addition to a camera bag this pocket could have been slightly bigger. Or it could have had a zipper on one side to add different-sized trackers.

It easily fits an Apple AirTag but it wasn‚Äôt so easy to get my Tile Tracker Pro in there. The product page for the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader says it can hold a ‚ÄúTile Bluetooth Tracker.‚Äù This is possibly in reference to one of their smaller newer models. Tenba says this is the first camera bag to include a hidden pocket for such trackers.

Ergonomics

Top loading bags aren‚Äôt new so while Tenba has some competition in this field they‚Äôve built a compact shoulder bag with most of the usual features in there. But they‚Äôve also added some new features and improved upon some existing ones compared to other brands. The first of note is the top handle. This isn‚Äôt just a thin belt strap attached as an afterthought like some top-loading bags have. It‚Äôs a decently-sized ribbed grip handle that you can use to lift the bag off surfaces to sling across your shoulder. Your fingers will find it comfortable to hold on to when taking the bag‚Äôs weight off your shoulders or waist.

Two metal hooks are on either side of the bag. Thankfully these aren‚Äôt painted. They won‚Äôt look scratched up when the strap hooks move across them over time

The side of the bag meant to be closest to your body is padded with a 3D airmesh. This is usually the kind of material that backpacks have on the inner side against your back. There‚Äôs space behind this airmesh to loop your waist belt or hip belt on the Axis 20/24/32L Backpacks. It could have been used as a way to stop the bag from swinging too much as you walk. For this Tenba should have included a slim waist strap with a buckle. The gap is probably not big enough to slip over the trolley handle of your roller bag.

I‚Äôm always weary of elastic side pockets as it remains to be seen how long the elastic lasts. That said it‚Äôs not something really tight and it seems to stretch comfortably. It easily accommodates water bottles and speedlights.

Missed Potential

Here‚Äôs a missed potential. The inner side of the upper cover of the bag has nothing besides Tenba branding and the model of the bag. It could easily have used an elastic sleeve or a few pockets for memory cards and accessories. It‚Äôs thick and padded well to protect your camera gear but I think it‚Äôs an area wasted in terms of storage capability.

I‚Äôm very pleased the shoulder strap has the 3D air-mesh on the underside. This also ensures that the bag doesn‚Äôt slip off your shoulders as you walk. It‚Äôs an adjustable length strap of course.

Tenba has added MOLLE (Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) webbing on the sides and front of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag. This allows limitless expandability with Tenba accessories and military-standard pouches and accessories. The webbing is reflective so if you‚Äôre cycling or walking at night with this bag it helps you stay visible to traffic.

Use the front pocket (which has a sleeve to make a partition) to store filters notebooks smartphones or any number of accessories that can fit inside it.

The upper side of the front compartment is also where the neoprene pocket for the tracker is located. Again I think this should have been bigger. Hopefully V3 will correct this.

The inside is spacious and Tenba has included a padded partition too. But this is only attachable to the two velcro strips placed off center. Larger strips could have made for a more customizable interior. Not a complaint but it does limit the internal partition size to just one option. I guess you could just take it off the velcro and stick it between the camera/lens and whatever else you want.

Build Quality

Tenba doesn‚Äôt list any waterproof or weather-resistant capabilities for this bag. The upper part of the bag (without any protective cover) was able to keep water out of the bag.

The rain cover doesn‚Äôt completely cover the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag. The 3D airmesh at the back is completely uncovered by this. Keep this portion close to your chest in the rain even with the rain cover over the bag.

You can tuck away the rain cover into a small pocket built into itself. You can then toss it into the bag or just store it elsewhere. The bag has no dedicated pocket for the rain cover like some other top-loading bags do.

The generously long strap has a shoulder pad. The upper side is made of the same material used for the top of the bag. Its air mesh padding keeps your shoulders comfy though I occasionally found myself switching shoulders.

The lack of a waist strap aside this is a comfortable bag to walk around with. It occasionally swings a bit but it‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt be fixed if you get a waist strap from elsewhere. I‚Äôd buy one of these straps if Tenba sold them.

I didn‚Äôt have any compatible accessories that could be used with the MOLLE webbing. But I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôll perform as advertised.

Ease of Use

Expanding the depth of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader bag is as simple as unzipping the base of the bag and pulling it out. There‚Äôs a small tab you can grip on to while pulling out the base.

with the extension collapsed

As long as the lens hood is retracted it should be reasonably easy to fit your camera and lens inside.

with the base extended out with a Nikon D810 and 70-200 f2.8 VRII

There‚Äôs a lot of space inside. If the inside was lined with more padding options I‚Äôd probably be able to partition it to store additional stuff inside even without expanding the base. You could fit in a power bank memory cards pen notebook filter water bottle phone Swiss Army knife and a face mask without much effort.

Collapsing the expanded portion is just as easy. You can either just push it back inside or pull on it from the inside and zip it up

Who Should Buy The Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader Bag?

Anyone who wants a daily carry camera bag for quick photo walks will find the spatial expansion capabilities of the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader useful. Keeping in line with the other bags in the Tenba Axis V2 series it‚Äôs rugged and durable: understandable as Tenba has a history of making bags for the military. Do you like using a 70-200 f2.8 for street photography (like I do)? Then this is the perfect bag for you. Are you a photographer who only carries one lens while out on assignment? Take the Tenba Axis V2 Top Loader on one of your photo jobs to see how it performs. I think with a bit of engineering you could fit more than one lens inside if your primary lens isn‚Äôt too long. In fact just about every kind of photographer could find some use for this bag on short photo assignments.

9 Organization Tips To Prep Your Home for Fall

1. Start by organizing the space that‚Äôs most impacting your day-to-day

Are you not motivated to exercise because it‚Äôs a hassle to untangle your leggings? Is getting your kids out the door in the morning a stressfest? The positive impact of organizing those spaces will motivate you to keep going on the rest of your home. However do not start with the space that requires editing your beloved graphic tee collection! That‚Äôs best saved for after you have a few rooms under your belt and you‚Äôre already reveling in the benefits of living in an organized home.

2. Think small

You need enough time to completely finish the project or else unwanted items will slowly creep back in. It‚Äôs not just editing and organizing you may also need to run out and purchase an organizational product or make a donation drop for the items you no longer want.

3. Utilize negative (or white) space properly

This is one of our favorite organization tips. It‚Äôs very important in all homes but especially in small spaces. Creating white space gives your eyes a rest creates a sense of calm and ensures easy access to items. So resist the urge to fill a closet or shelving to capacity and aim for ruthless editing. If there‚Äôs plenty of space to grab an item and easily put it away you‚Äôll be more likely to put it back in the correct spot and not just shove it where it fits.

4. Re-organize your space anytime you experience a major life change

If you‚Äôve recently moved gotten a new roommate or are welcoming a baby then it‚Äôs time for an overhaul. Otherwise periodic ‚Äútouch-ups‚Äù should be enough to maintain organizational systems especially after a busy work week or the holidays.

People are surprised to learn that being organized is not ‚Äúone and done.‚Äù It‚Äôs an ongoing process. But touch-ups will go quickly when done on a weekly or daily basis. For example when you put away your grocery shopping take five minutes to put things back into their place. More frequent touch-ups will go faster and help maintain the organization.

5. Involve everyone who lives in the home from the beginning and ask for their input

The more invested they are in the project the more likely they will maintain the organization. Also realize that being organized means something different to everyone. Just like life it‚Äôs about compromise so everyone feels comfortable at home. But there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt go full Martha Stewart on your underwear or personal bathroom drawer!

6. Utilize out-of-the-way shelving and storage spots to store seasonal decorations and items

Transparent bins with lids are the perfect option so you can quickly see what‚Äôs inside and stack a few to take advantage of vertical storage. One of the most important organizational tips we can give is to always recommend labeling long-term storage bins.

7. Prioritize organizing certain spaces during certain seasons

As seasons change it makes sense to take stock of items that are in current rotation. In the transition to fall take a look at your outdoor items plastic glassware pool towels bathing suits etc. Are they still sparking joy at the end of the season? If so clean them up and store them away. If not donate them to someone else who will love them.

8. Prep your home for fall

For many fall is an opportunity to get cozy at home and entertain. That means that spaces like kitchens pantries bar carts and guest rooms are seeing a lot of love. Schedule some time to touch up these spaces. Maybe move the margarita glasses and pool towels to the back of the shelf or long-term storage to give the red wine glasses and throw blankets some extra room.

9. Everyone should have a bin or bag within easy reach for no longer needed items

Once it‚Äôs full make a donation drop-off. Often an unwanted item is put back because in the rush of the moment there‚Äôs no time to track down a bag to put it in and then a place for the bag to sit. Carve out a small space in your home for the bin to live in. you‚Äôll thank us later."

The communications were unveiled as part of a congressional hearing held in Washington DC where an investigation into the role of fossil fuels in driving the climate crisis produced documents obtained from the oil giants ExxonMobil Chevron Shell and BP.

‚ÄúFirst they ignore you then they laugh at you then they wish bedbugs on you then you win‚Äù said Varshini Prakash executive director of Sunrise. The organization accused Shell of a ‚Äúlegacy of violence and of ignoring the wellbeing of communities across the globe‚Äù.

The revelations are part of the third hearing held by the House committee on oversight and reform on how the fossil-fuel industry sought to hamper the effort to address the climate crisis. Democrats who lead the committee called top executives from the oil companies to testify last year in which they denied they had misled the public.

The new documents are ‚Äúthe latest evidence that oil giants keep lying about their commitments to help solve the climate crisis and should never be trusted by policymakers‚Äù said Richard Wiles president of the Center for Climate Integrity.

‚ÄúIf there is one thing consistent about the oil and gas majors‚Äô position on climate it‚Äôs their utter inability to tell the truth‚Äù Wiles added.

Ro Khanna co-chair of the committee said the new documents are ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù and show a ‚Äúculture of intense disrespect‚Äù to climate activists. The oil giants‚Äô ‚Äúclimate pledges rely on unproven technology accounting gimmicks and misleading language to hide the reality‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBig oil executives are laughing at the people trying to protect our planet while they knowingly work to destroy it.‚Äù

Several of the emails and memos within the released trove of documents appear to show executives staffers and lobbyists internally contradicting public pronouncements by their companies to act on lowering planet-heating emissions.

Exxon which recently announced profits of $17.9bn for the three months until June more than three times what it earned in the same quarter a year ago has publicly said it is ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to the Paris climate agreement to curb global heating.

However the documents released by the Democratic-led House committee include an August 2019 memo by an executive to Darren Woods Exxon‚Äôs chief executive on the need to ‚Äúremove reference to Paris agreement‚Äù from an announcement by an industry lobby group that Exxon is a member of.

Such a statement ‚Äúcould create a potential commitment to advocate on the Paris agreement goals‚Äù the executive warned. A separate note on a 2018 Exxon presentation also admitted that biofuels derived from algae was still ‚Äúdecades away from the scale we need‚Äù despite the company long promoting it as a way to lower emissions.

Shell meanwhile has committed to becoming a ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù emissions business by 2050 and yet the documents show a private 2020 communication in which employees are urged to never ‚Äúimply suggest or leave it open for possible misinterpretation that (net zero) is a Shell goal or target‚Äù. Shell has ‚Äúno immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio‚Äù over the next 10 to 20 years it added.

A Shell tweet posted in 2020 asking others what they could do to reduce emissions resulted in a torrent of ridicule from Twitter users. A communications executive for the company wrote privately that criticism that the tweet was ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù the public was ‚Äúnot totally without merit‚Äù and that the tweet was ‚Äúpretty tone deaf‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúWe are after all in a tweet like this implying others need to sacrifice without focusing on ourselves.‚Äù

The UK-headquartered oil company which in July announced a record $11.5bn quarterly profit also poured scorn on climate activists with a communications specialist at the company emailing in 2019 that he wished ‚Äúbedbugs‚Äù upon the Sunrise Movement a youth-led US climate group.

Previous releases of internal documents have shown that the oil industry knew of the devastating impact of climate change but chose instead to downplay and even deny these findings publicly in order to maintain their business model.

The hearings have been attacked by Republicans as a method to ‚Äúwage war on America‚Äôs energy producers‚Äù and the oil companies involved have complained that the documents don‚Äôt show the full picture of their stance on the climate crisis.

Exxon supports the 2015 Paris climate deal a spokesman said claiming that the ‚Äúselective publication of dated emails without context is a deliberate attempt to generate a narrative that does not reflect the commitment of ExxonMobil and its employees to address climate change and play a leading role in the transition to a net-zero future.‚Äù

A Shell spokesman meanwhile said the committee chose to highlight only a small handful of the nearly half a million pages it provided to the body on its ‚Äúextensive efforts‚Äù to take part in the energy transition.

‚ÄúWithin that pursuit are challenging internal and external discussions that signal Shell‚Äôs intent to form partnerships and share pathways we deem critical to becoming a net-zero energy business‚Äù he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2RlbWVyYXJhd2F2ZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvZ3V5YW5hLXNheXMtYW1lbmRlZC1vaWwtYWdyZWVtZW50LWNhbnQtYmUtYmFzaXMtZm9yLWZ1bGwtcmVuZWdvdGlhdGlvbi1vZi1kZWFsLXdpdGgtZXh4b25tb2JpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana says amended oil agreement can't be basis for full renegotiation of deal with ExxonMobil,"Guyana says amended oil agreement can‚Äôt be basis for full renegotiation of deal with ExxonMobil

Last Updated on Sunday 18 September 2022 23:37 by Denis Chabrol

The Guyana government on Sunday sought to debunk claims that an amendment to the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) with the ExxonMobil-controlled consortium sets the stage for wide-ranging changes so that Guyana can draw down more money from the deal on the prolific Stabroek Block.

The Irfaan Ali-led administration aimed to allay likely fears that it could take on board Chartered Accountant Christopher Ram‚Äôs assertion that the PSA could undergo major changes through renegotiation. ‚ÄúThe government reiterates that the contract will remain fiscally unchanged for the country and investors‚Äô benefits‚Äù the Ministry of Natural Resources said in a statement.

Neither the then David Granger-led coalition government nor the People‚Äôs Progressive Party Civic (PPPC) administration had mentioned that the PSA had been amended under Mr Granger‚Äôs signature that the ExxonMobil majority-owned Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) could reclaim the 2 percent royalty. The privately-owned independent Stabroek News newspaper on Sunday reported that A Partnership for National Unity+Alliance For Change (APNU+AFC) coalition administration had amended the 2016 PSA on April 26 2019 to prohibit the recovery of royalty.

According to the Guyana government on Sunday that modification has been implemented and enforced through the mechanisms on the payments for royalties and cost recovery conditions and the monitoring features which set out for the governance of the cost bank regarding the projects subject to petroleum operations.

The Ministry of Natural Resources admitted that it was ‚Äúfully aware‚Äù of the 2016 amendment but seemed at pains to insist that there would be no renegotiation of ‚Äúspecific fiscal considerations‚Äù in existing PSA as that ‚Äúcould impose unfavourable effects on current and future investments in Guyana given the current world petroleum economy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Government of Guyana respects the investments made by the petroleum consortium in the Stabroek Block and will continue to work assiduously through various agencies on every additional license and environmental permit as has been done for Payara and Yellowtail developments‚Äù the Ministry added.

That Ministry also seized the opportunity to rule out the existing PSA on the Stabroek Block being applied to other blocks for production or exploration. ‚ÄúThis includes the upcoming competitive bidding round that the government intends to host in the last quarter of this year and other commercially viable discoveries that will be made in other oil blocks. The 2016 model or any previous PSA will not be applied to any other oil block where a discovery has been made‚Äù according to the Natural Resources Ministry.

ExxonMobil is the major operator in the Stabroek Block alongside Hess and the China National Overseas Oil Company (CNOOC).

‚ÄúThe actions of the APNU+AFC government clearly demonstrates that if the parties to the contract are willing a review and renegotiation of the existing contract can be undertaken. This of course requires the necessary political will‚Äù Patterson told a press conference as he made reference to the amendment uncovered by chartered accountant and attorney Christopher Ram.

Ram on Thursday secured a copy of an addendum to the PSA which was amended in April 2019 to make clear that ExxonMobil Guyana and its partners could not reclaim the 2% royalty due to Guyana as costs. As a result Ram said that the amendment sets a precedent that the contract can be renegotiated.

‚ÄúThe question inevitably arises why the current Administration keeps repeating the mantra of sanctity of contract driving fear into Guyanese of the consequence of any attempt at renegotiation. Interestingly the APNU+AFC‚Äôs renegotiation was conducted without a change in circumstances while the incumbent Administration is adamant that it is powerless to even broach the question with the oil companies‚Äù Ram noted in his column ‚ÄòThe Road to First Oil‚Äô published in Friday‚Äôs Stabroek News.

Patterson said that Ram‚Äôs column confirmed what his party had been saying all along‚Äîthat the royalty payments were not cost recoverable and that the 2016 contract was in fact based on the 2012 model PSA as prepared by the PPP/C.

The addendum to the agreement was signed by then President Granger proscribing the reclaiming of the 2% royalty. Both the former APNU+AFC administration and the current government have cited the sanctity of the 2016 PSA in response to public calls for its renegotiation.

Ram however argued that the 2019 amendment paves the way for a fundamental reshaping of the 2016 PSA to right the injustices done to the country and the poor terms which had been imposed on Guyana.

While Granger and former Head of the Department of Energy Dr. Mark Bynoe who were signatories to the addendum could not be reached for comment main opposition coalition partner the Alliance for Change (AFC) on Friday agreed that the amendment was demonstrative that a renegotiation can be done.

However the party was quick to point out that it would only happen if both parties are willing and there is political will.

In light of the addendum being made public questions have been raised as to why the document had not been made public before given that the past administration had promised to be forthright about the petroleum sector following the disgrace surrounding the silence of signing the controversial 2016 PSA.

This newspaper tried contacting former Minister of State Joseph Harmon and Bynoe to no avail. Calls and messages to their mobile numbers went unanswered.

It is still unclear how contact can be made with former President Granger who has maintained a low profile since his loss at the 2020 elections was stained by allegations of attempts at rigging by the then governing coalition.

The timing of the addendum is also notable as it occurred during a period when the former APNU+AFC government had fallen to a No-Confidence Motion and was operating as a caretaker administration raising questions about the appropriateness of such an engagement.

Stabroek News contacted ExxonMobil Guyana about the circumstances surrounding its decision to be party to the amendment and was told to send an email. The email was sent but up to press time there had been no response.

Defending the decision Patterson said that at the time of the signing President Granger was in a substantive position and also continued to hold responsibility for the sector.

‚ÄúIt should be noted that between May 2015 and January 2016 the Minister responsible for petroleum was former president Granger. Between January 2016 and July 2018 the responsible minister was Raphael Trotman. From August 2018 this portfolio reverted back to former president Granger‚Äù he noted.

‚ÄúThis amendment was penned under former president Granger‚Äôs stewardship. While being previously unaware of this amendment it is assumed that despite it being always known accepted that any royalty payment was not cost recoverable the parties may have wanted to make this more pellucid before oil production commenced‚Äù he added.

For his part Ram has said that the coalition must be given some credit ‚Äúfor at least effecting the renegotiation of one element of the Agreement albeit not a particularly major one‚Äù.

Ram said that the nation which is facing price increases in every area including the energy sector should pressure all stakeholders to ensure that the contract is renegotiated as he faulted both sides for the current situation the country is in.

‚ÄúIt is both the PPP/C and the APNU+AFC that have given Guyana this abominable contract. Contrary to what Vice President Jagdeo said a few nights ago on the Glenn Lall Show the 2016 Production Sharing Agreement was based on the Robert Persaud‚ÄìDonald Ramotar 2012 Model. How can we better manage a contract when we know not its origin its content or its implications?‚Äù he questioned.

‚ÄúIndeed it is still my strongly held view that Esso was not entitled to a second Agreement. We may not be able to reverse the 2016 Agreement but that should not mean that we have to prostrate ourselves at the feet of Esso Hess and CNOOC as our leaders are doing. Let us take the example of the APNU+AFC and demand renegotiation‚Äù he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFhLmNvbS50ci9lbi9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9hc3NhZC1yZWdpbWUtc2F5cy1kYW1hc2N1cy1haXJwb3J0LWhpdC1ieS1pc3JhZWwtYWlyc3RyaWtlcy8yNjg3MzY40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Assad regime says Damascus airport hit by Israel airstrikes,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.aa.com.tr', port=443): Read timed out.

A Waihi wedding photographer is accused of breaking the hearts of newlyweds by failing for many months to hand over some or all of several couples' wedding pictures.

When Grace thinks back to her wedding in April this year it isn't her vows dress or seeing her husband at the altar that initially comes to mind.

She thinks of the photographer she hired Sharni Dysart.

Earlier this month Grace told the Herald on Sunday she and her husband were yet to receive any images from Dysart who also goes by the last name Measures online.

""It's affected me in quite a big way. I know it's just wedding photos but I've had sleepless nights I've been so stressed about it. Whenever people ask me when are we gonna see your wedding photos I usually break down in tears.""

Even on her wedding day Grace said things did not run smoothly. She said Dysart failed to turn up claiming she was a close contact of someone with Covid and hired a freelancer to cover their wedding instead.

Although she wasn't shooting the wedding Grace said Dysart was still in charge of editing the images and sending them to the couple.

Grace who lives in Auckland and only wants to share her middle name told the Herald on Sunday the freelance photographer who shot the wedding informed her it shouldn't take more than three or four weeks for Dysart to finish the photos.

But as the months ticked by the pictures didn't eventuate.

""It feels awful to be honest. I just really want my wedding photos. You only get married one time and I'm just really scared I'm never going to get them back.

""It's our special day and she's kind of taken that from us and it's not really about the money for me. I just want the memories.""

Grace is now one of the dozens of members or former members of a Facebook group of spurned newlyweds left in the lurch by Dysart.

Nearly two weeks after the Herald first approached Dysart for comment Grace received her images.

Although she is relieved and happy Grace still feels like their special day was taken away from them.

""I really don't think it's kind of acceptable. It was really unfair on myself and others because well for myself I went through six months of stress thinking I might not get them. Pretty much every unanswered message made me so so anxious and I think I don't know if I hadn't gone to the media if I would have got them.""

Dysart said issues raised by the Herald were being addressed through the ""proper channels"" if they had not been already.

She said her legal and health advice was not to engage in sources of stress so she would not comment further.

Georgia Smith and her partner Isaac Smith married in September last year and while she has the images now she said they're still waiting for prints from Dysart.

In their contract Smith said it stated they would start getting access to some photos to look over within a few days of the wedding and would get to see the photos no later than 12 weeks after the wedding.

But as the weeks passed she said the pictures did not arrive.

""It got to about week eight and she had posted some of my wedding photos to her Instagram.

""When people were asking for my wedding photos the only thing I had to show were these screenshots of her Instagram.""

At that point Smith who works in healthcare in South Waikato said Dysart had still not sent her any images and was ignoring her messages.

""I was emailing her I was sending her text messages Instagram Facebook like everything and she wasn't replying.""

It wasn't until the end of February or mid-March that Smith said she got any images from Dysart. Nearly a year on from her special day she said she's still waiting for the prints.

""I didn't realise how many people she had done this to. And yeah I just want my photos I want nothing more than for everyone else to get their photos or some form of justice. Because it's not fair.""

Xavia Connolly was in a similar boat.

At the Otorohanga teacher's wedding day on December 20 Connolly said Dysart arrived late and was ""very casual"".

When the event wrapped up she alleges Dysart told her she would send through about 10 photos as a ""sneak peek"" in the next few days.

But like the others she said her images also did not arrive on time and by January 10 she emailed Dysart to inquire about where her ""sneak peek"" photos were.

Near the end of January she got a copy of the 10 preview shots and in March she received some more back. But she was still waiting for the remaining images when the Herald on Sunday first spoke to her.

""We don't even have a photo of our actual wedding ceremony. Like we don't we don't even have a photo of me walking down the aisle or us standing. We don't have those"" she said earlier this month.

""It's not just the photos it's not just the money it's the moments of our life aren't captured any more.""

Like Grace Xavia received the images from Dysart this week.

""The fact that we have our photos back is surreal in two ways: one that we have actually got them back; and two that she seemingly only got them back to us because she caught wind that her misdealings were finally catching up with her.""

A spokesperson for Consumer NZ said a photographers' clients are covered under the Consumer Guarantees Act (CGA) which requires the provider to undertake their service with reasonable care and skill and within a reasonable time.

They argued that taking up to a year to hand over images or not handing over the photos as expected breached the consumer's rights under the CGA.

Dianne Lewis a law student from Tauranga decided to take Dysart to the Disputes Tribunal earlier this year after waiting many months to get the photos from her wedding.

She said an adjudicator ruled in Lewis' favour that Dysart had breached their contract and she was ordered to pay $1400.

This Lewis said was the cost they had to pay to the other photographer who had covered her December wedding day after Dysart claimed she hadn't had her second Covid-19 jab in order to get the images from her.

It wasn't until after the Herald on Sunday contacted Dysart this month that Lewis said the photographer finally transferred the funds.

Jenna* who doesn't want to use her real name was also taking Dysart to the Disputes Tribunal over her experience.

Two days before Jenna was due to wed in late January Dysart informed her she was a Covid close contact so she would be unable to photograph the wedding but she had again hired a fill-in who would take the images and Dysart would edit them.

Again as time passed the pictures had still not been sent and by the third month of waiting Jenna realised something was up.

Screenshots of messages from Jenna to Dysart show her messaging the photographer on several occasions across several days and Dysart not replying.

""I was feeling very anxious very nervous and possibly a little bit depressed about it as well.""

Jenna said she reached out to the photographer who was there on her wedding day asking why she couldn't give her the images from her wedding day.

""She said it's because it goes against her agreement with Sharni.""

She said the photographer advised her to try to go through the tribunal route to get the images. While her hearing was scheduled for later this month after Herald inquiries she said Dysart provided the images back on Friday.

This week she too received her images back Dysart.

""It's our wedding day. And you don't want to not have your photos back of your big day. It only happens once.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

With Chase Elliott pursuing him relentlessly for the final 50 laps Chris Buescher held on to win Saturday‚Äôs Bass Pro Shops Night Race at Bristol Motors Speedway becoming the 19th different NASCAR Cup Series winner this season.

After the event that set the field for the Round of 12 in the series Playoffs‚Äîand eliminated superstars Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick from the postseason‚Äîa dozen drivers were breathing sighs of relief and hoping fervently for a return to stock car sanity in the next round.

A two-tire pit stop under caution on Lap 438 of 500 put Reddick in the lead for a restart on Lap 444. The driver of the No. 17 Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing Ford led the final 61 laps and a race-high 169 overall to give the RFK organization its first victory since Ricky Stenhouse Jr. took the checkered flag at Daytona on July 1 2017 at Daytona.

The victory was the first for RFK Racing since Brad Keselowski joined the organization as an owner/driver after the 2021 season.

Buescher was the third straight non-Playoff driver to win a race in the Round of 16 an unprecedented occurrence.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so special here‚Äù said Buescher whose only other Cup win came in a rain-shortened race at Pocono in 2016. ‚ÄúI love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here. It‚Äôs so special. It‚Äôs pretty awesome.‚Äù

Buescher said he wasn‚Äôt worried about starting the final run on two fresh tires even though everyone chasing had four.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt a bit‚Äù he asserted. ‚ÄúIt was up to me at that point. I made it work and we had a really fast (car). We knew we had a really fast race car in practice and didn‚Äôt quite get the job done in qualifying (20th)‚Äîbut what a race car.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what all to say right now. I‚Äôm out of breath. This place will wear you flat-out and I love that about it. It‚Äôs just a special night.‚Äù

Elliott was .458 seconds behind Buescher at the finish. William Byron came home third followed by Christopher Bell who posted his third straight top-five finish in the Round of 16. Kyle Larson was fifth and Ross Chastain sixth as all five drivers immediately behind Buescher in the finishing order advanced to the Round of 12.

Denny Hamlin Chase Briscoe Daniel Suarez Joey Logano Ryan Blaney and Alex Bowman also clinched spots in the next round though all had serious issues during the race.

Elliott got closer to Buescher on the final two laps but ran out of time.

‚ÄúI felt like we were gaining but it was‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt close enough to do anything with him‚Äù Elliott said. ‚ÄúBut I appreciate the effort. We had a long day yesterday. Was able to battle back from a bad qualifying effort (23rd) to get a top two so proud of that.

‚ÄúGlad to be moving on (in the Playoff) and looking forward to some more opportunities here these coming weeks.‚Äù

Needing a victory to advance to the next round Harvick ran consistently in the top five after staying out at the end of Stage 1 to gain track position. But Harvick‚Äôs chances evaporated in the pits on Lap 438 when his crew failed to secure the left-rear on his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford.

As the tire rolled away Harvick had to back up into his pit stall. The lost time left him 10th for the final restart on Lap 444. That‚Äôs where he finished exiting the Playoffs in 16th place.

‚ÄúIt was pretty tough‚Äù Harvick said. ‚ÄúWe pitted in front of the 17 (Buescher) so just kind of the way the year has gone. Just went from having a chance to lead the parade to being a part of the parade. Just difficult to pass.‚Äù

Busch‚Äôs ouster was a touch-and-go affair. Both he and Tyler Reddick fell two points short after Austin Cindric who finished seven laps down in 20th place but gained enough positions by passing back markers to advance.

Busch had accumulated 14 points in the first two stages and was running above the cut line when his engine blew on Lap 270‚ÄîBusch‚Äôs second such failure in the three Playoff races.

‚ÄúIt just goes with our year‚Äù Busch said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what to say. I‚Äôm flabbergasted. I just feel so bad for my guys. They don‚Äôt deserve to be in this spot. They work too hard. We are too good of a group to be this low‚Äîdown on the bottom fighting for our lives just to make it through. Two engine failures in three weeks that will do it to you.‚Äù

Reddick and Richard Childress Racing teammate Austin Dillon both failed to make the Round of 12 after both drivers‚Äô Chevrolets were damaged in a 12-car pileup on the backstretch on Lap 277. Reddick finished 25th and Dillon 31st.

Keselowski led 109 laps and appeared to have race-winning chances until his right-front tire went flat on Lap 414 while he was leading.

‚ÄúWe had two cars that were really good today and one that was unlucky and one that executed and everything came the right way for them‚Äù Keselowski said.

It took a two-tire pit stop with about 60 laps left to go at Bristol Motor Speedway to get clean air for the No. 17 RFK Racing driver.

Buescher who led 169 laps became the 19th driver to win in 2022 tying the Modern Era record.

‚ÄúThis is just so special this team does such a great job‚Äù Buescher told NBC Sports after the race. ‚ÄúJust so special here at Bristol. I love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here so special to me. Lost one that had really broke our heart back in 2015 on the Xfinity [Series] side with [Scott] Graves on top of the box so this makes up for that.‚Äù

When asked whether he was worried about the two-tire call on the last pit stop Buescher replied ‚ÄúNot one bit. It was up to me at that point. Just hold on and make it work. We had a really fast Fastenal Mustang. Just so proud of everybody. We knew we had a good racecar after practice and didn‚Äôt quite get the job done in qualifying. But what a racecar. It‚Äôs special. To get RFK in victory lane for the first time. We had great racecars Brad [Keselowski] had really good speed too.‚Äù

Tyler Reddick Kyle Busch Austin Dillon and Kevin Harvick ended up below the cut line after the race.

Chase Elliott placed second while his Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron was third. Christopher Bell was fourth after leading 143 circuits and Kyle Larson rounded out the top five.

Ross Chastain AJ Allmendinger Cole Custer Denny Hamlin and Harvick took positions six through 10 respectively.

Multiple cars including several playoff contenders encountered issues throughout the night.

It started with the Fords as several incurred flat right-front tires in stage one. First Harrison Burton and JJ Yeley had flats while Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney suffered down right-front tires later on.

Blaney‚Äôs issues continued throughout the early portion of the race which included a tire coming off on pit road and he eventually went behind the wall for repairs on the rear end of the car. He came back out on the track on lap 266.

All these problems brought the caution out several times allowing for differing pit strategies. The RFK Racing duo of Keselowski and Buescher were among those who had stayed out and the clean air helped them stay up front. Keselowski ended up winning stage one.

Buescher stayed out as did many others and held off advances from Harvick to maintain the lead through about lap 237.

During this period four Toyotas and one Chevrolet Alex Bowman reported power steering problems including both 23XI Racing drivers Bubba Wallace and Ty Gibbs. The pair‚Äôs pit crews worked on the cars behind the wall and sent them back out late in the race (lap 290 for Wallace; lap 317 for Gibbs).

A couple of Joe Gibbs Racing teammates also had troubles: Martin Truex Jr and Hamlin. Truex‚Äôs powersteering gave out as it blew the seals out. Hamlin had a right-front tire go down around lap 235 which also brought out the caution. He was able to continue.

A third JGR driver Bell inherited the lead when Buescher pit on lap 237 going on to win stage two.

Bell ended up leading the next 100 laps while the fourth JGR Toyota of Busch had an engine failure around lap 270. This once again brought out the yellow flag.

Then shortly after the next restart the Bristol big one occurred when Daniel Suarez got loose and tagged the No. 47 of Ricky Stenhouse Jr. As cars stacked up several got into each other including Richard Childress Racing‚Äôs Reddick and Dillon.

Reddick was able to get back on track but Dillon couldn‚Äôt due to a suspension problem.

Back at the front Bell was able to lead for much of the race though he lost the lead to Larson on pit road. Keselowski pulled a slide job on Larson on lap 388 to take first place.

Another playoff driver Joey Logano had a right-front flat with just over 100 laps remaining and had to pit.

Then a few laps later race leader Keselowski had his right-front tire go down forcing him to pit and allowing Bell to retake first.

On lap 425 pole-sitter Aric Almirola who had spun early on when Blaney got into the wall had a power steering problem and took his car behind the wall. About 11 laps later Bell‚Äôs right-rear tire went flat and the caution waved again.

Two more drivers in the playoff hunt had problems on pit road: Harvick and Hamlin. Harvick had a loose wheel but was able to back up without going very far and get a tire back on. However his hopes to win the race were dashed with this miscue.

The No. 11 had a bit of a different issue as some pins were damaged on the hub.

Buescher took two tires and found himself out front and in clean air. It was enough to hold on for the win becoming the third-straight non-playoff driver to win in the Round of 16.

BRISTOL Tenn. ‚Äì In one of the most surprising NASCAR Cup Series upsets of the year Chris Buescher made sure that the first round of the playoffs was all about drivers who aren‚Äôt competing for the championship this postseason.

Following in the footsteps of Southern 500 winner Erik Jones and Kansas Speedway winner Bubba Wallace Buescher became the third non-playoff driver in a row to visit victory lane with a thrilling late-race strategy play in Saturday night‚Äôs Bass Pro Shops Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway.

Buescher and crew chief Scott Graves elected for a two-tire pit stop during the final round of service with 61 laps to go following a lap-436 caution flag after Christopher Bell slowed from the race lead with a cut right-rear tire.

The quick pit stop got Buescher out first then the Prosper Texas native drove a masterful 57-lap stint to the checkered flag. He powered away from his nearest pursuers on the final restart of the night and then held Chase Elliott off through traffic in the closing stages.

Buescher ultimately collected the checkered flag by .458 seconds over Elliott for his second Cup Series win in his 250th premier level start.

‚ÄúThis is so great. This team does such a great job‚Äù a near-speechless Buescher exclaimed after climbing from his No. 17 Fastenal Ford Mustang. ‚ÄúThe first Cup win for Fastenal for a points-paying race so that‚Äôs awesome. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just so special here at Bristol. I love this racetrack. I love the fans. I love every time we come here. It‚Äôs so special to me.

‚ÄúI lost one that really broke my heart back in 2015 on the Xfinity (Series) side with Graves on top of the box so this makes up for that‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty awesome. I wasn‚Äôt worried at the end. It was up to me at that point. I just had to hold on and make it work. I don‚Äôt know what else to say right now. I‚Äôm out of breath. This place will wear you flat out and I love that about it but what a special night.‚Äù

Buescher‚Äôs eventual victory came on a wild night where 12 of the 16 playoff contenders encountered some sort of issue during the 500-lap battle at The Last Great Colosseum. The chaos shuffled the deck at the front of the field numerous times and shocked drivers and fans alike.

Tire issues doomed Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney‚Äôs hopes before lap 100. An engine failure took Kyle Busch out of the race on lap 270. The ensuing restart after Busch‚Äôs woes sparked a multi-car accident that eliminated Alex Bowman and Austin Dillon as well as scuttled any hopes Tyler Reddick had due to heavy front end damage. Bell‚Äôs dominance leading four times for 143 laps ended with his cut tire late.

Through it all however Buescher remained consistently in contention eventually leading more circuits ‚Äì 169 ‚Äì than anyone else did all night en route to the first win for his race team since it rebranded as RFK (Roush Fenway Keselowski) Racing during the winter months.

That made the night bittersweet for team co-owner Brad Keselowski who paced 109 laps in his own right but fell back late after a tire went down on his No. 6 Ford Mustang on lap 414 finishing a lap down in 13th.

‚ÄúI was thinking for a while there I was going to be in (the media center) wearing both hats as the (winning) owner and driver but unfortunately we had that tire go down for an unknown reason with about 85 to go‚Äù Keselowski lamented. ‚Äú That was quite a roller coaster of emotions and then Chris and Scott Graves made a really bold call there to put two tires on.

‚ÄúThey had a great car don‚Äôt get me wrong but the call to get the lead and knowing what they had was really clever. I‚Äôm proud of them.‚Äù

Though Elliott had fresher left-side tires than Buescher did in the final laps he wasn‚Äôt able to make up enough ground as he worked through traffic to be able to challenge for the win.

Elliott closed slightly in the final two laps but was forced to settle for second in the No. 9 Hooters Chevrolet Camaro ZL1.

‚ÄúI actually really liked my car. I thought our Hooters Chevrolet was driving really good and honestly I don‚Äôt think I could realistically ask for anything more balance-wise‚Äù noted Elliott after the race. ‚Äú I just needed to be able to do a better job getting in some different lanes. The top had gotten so dominant there at the end. The bottom was pretty good there early in the night and you could run down there for a long time and then as the night went on ‚Ä¶ the top got better and better and better and that momentum was hard to beat.

‚ÄúUnfortunately for me we never got to any lap traffic to make him move but we were starting to (gain) there in those last three or four laps‚Äù Elliott added. ‚Äú I felt like we were gaining but I wasn‚Äôt close enough to do anything with him. I appreciate the effort from my guys. We battled back. I‚Äôm glad to be moving on (in the playoffs) and looking forward to some more opportunities (to contend) in these coming weeks.‚Äù

Elliott‚Äôs Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron came home third followed by Bell and Larson who put on a thrilling duel for the top spot across nearly 150 laps in the middle portion of the race before ending up fourth and fifth respectively.

Ross Chastain A.J. Allmendinger Cole Custer Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick closed out the top 10.

Harvick who was in a must-win scenario entering Bristol appeared to be a threat to steal a win to advance in the playoffs before a miscue on pit road during the final round of stops saw him lose a left-rear wheel. He was shuffled back to 10th and never recovered from there.

The 2014 Cup Series champion joined two-time titlist Busch and Richard Childress Racing teammates Reddick and Dillon as drivers who were bounced from playoff contention at the end of Saturday night‚Äôs elimination race.

Elliott will open the Round of 12 as the highest-seeded driver 15 points ahead of Joey Logano when the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs continue on Sept. 25 at Texas Motor Speedway ‚Äì appropriately the home track for Saturday night‚Äôs winner.

He knew it as well before leaving into the Bristol night.

‚ÄúI love this place but I‚Äôm glad to be heading home‚Äù Buescher noted with a smile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDQ5MzEwLW5hc2Nhci1hdC1icmlzdG9sLTIwMjItcmVzdWx0cy1jaHJpcy1idWVzY2hlci1lYXJucy0ybmQtY3VwLXNlcmllcy13aW4tb2YtY2FyZWVy0gGNAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDA0OTMxMC1uYXNjYXItYXQtYnJpc3RvbC0yMDIyLXJlc3VsdHMtY2hyaXMtYnVlc2NoZXItZWFybnMtMm5kLWN1cC1zZXJpZXMtd2luLW9mLWNhcmVlci5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASCAR at Bristol 2022 Results: Chris Buescher Earns 2nd Cup Series Win of Career,"Logan Riely/Getty Images

Chris Buescher took the checkered flag at the Bass Pro Shops Night Race in Bristol Tennessee on Saturday night.

Buescher's win is just the second of his NASCAR Cup Series career. He previously won the Pennsylvania 400 as a rookie in 2016. The 29-year-old is the third straight non-playoff driver to win in the Round of 16 joining Bubba Wallace and Erik Jones.

This race was also notable for being the final leg of the first round of the playoffs with the field being cut from 16 to 12 based on the point standings after this result.

Kevin Harvick the 2014 Cup Series champion was first on the cut line coming into Bristol. He was 35 points behind Austin Cindric in the No. 12 spot. The other three drivers facing elimination‚ÄîKyle Busch Austin Dillon and Chase Briscoe‚Äîwere all within nine points of advancing.

Briscoe put himself in a good position to make a move after qualifying in the No. 2 spot. Aric Almirola who did not make the playoff field won the pole position.

This was the best performance of Buescher's career and a banner night for RFK Racing with Brad Keselowski.

Buescher began the race from the No. 20 position and climbed all the way up to the top spot in the first stage. He wound up blowing by his previous career-high total for laps led set earlier this year.

Chase Elliott was the only driver who finished within one second of Buescher (0.458 seconds). Keselowski fell off the pace in the final stage after experiencing issues with his car. He ultimately finished 13th overall but he did get a point bump from winning the first stage.

Elliott's second-place finish and seven bonus points in stage two pushed him all the way up to first place in the playoff standings. The Hendricks Motorsports star began the day 12 points behind Christopher Bell for the top spot but he's now 15 points ahead of No. 2 Joey Logano.

Things got very close for Dillon after the second stage. He was one point behind Daniel Su√°rez for the 12th and final spot.

Some of the drama was gone by the final stretch of the race as Suarez wound up finishing in the 19th spot and Dillon was No. 31 in the standings.

Briscoe was the only driver on the brink of elimination who was able to climb out of the bottom four. He racked up 15 points in the two stages and finished 14th in the race. The 27-year-old moved up to ninth overall in the point standings.

As Bed Bath & Beyond goes through a seismic downsizing its Philadelphia-area footprint is shrinking too.

At the end of August the company announced that it would close about 150 ‚Äúlower-producing‚Äù stores but a list of the first 56 stores slated for closure was only released this week.

The only Pennsylvania location so far is the Bed Bath & Beyond at the Wynnewood Shopping Center where the store currently occupies 61030 square feet of retail space. The rest of the company‚Äôs closures are concentrated in the Midwest New York and New Jersey although none yet in South Jersey. The closest store is in Manalapan Township in Monmouth County.

The company did not respond to requests for comment about how quickly their business will wind down or the number of employees affected. A Bed Bath & Beyond spokesperson would only say that the store would be shuttered ‚Äúin the coming months‚Äù and that locations in King of Prussia and Jenkintown would remain.

Retail experts say that the Wynnewood Shopping Center‚Äôs landlord Federal Realty Investment Trust will have no difficulty finding another tenant in that location.

‚ÄúThis is a sizable vacancy on the Main Line which doesn‚Äôt happen that often‚Äù said Steven Gartner executive vice president of retail services with CBRE. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often a good thing for shopping centers when a tenant that might not be relevant goes away. This is one of those do-overs that landlords get in tight real estate markets.‚Äù

Federal Realty Investment Trust did not return requests for comment.

Bed Bath & Beyond has experienced extreme turbulence in recent months as its stock plunged it announced mass store closures and a 20% reduction in staff. The company‚Äôs struggles turned even more tragic a couple of days after the announced downsizing when chief financial officer Gustavo Arnal leapt to his death from a Manhattan high rise.

Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs troubles arrive amid an uncertain time in the retail industry. In Center City the marquee Walnut and Chestnut Street corridors are still in flux after the pandemic drove a substantial amount of shopping online.

But some big box retailers like Target Macy‚Äôs and Kohl‚Äôs are performing strongly. In high-end suburban areas like Philadelphia‚Äôs Main Line retail sales have remained strong. That‚Äôs partly because the square footage available has not changed substantially as new development tends to be scarce in wealthy inner-ring suburban areas.

‚ÄúMain Line retail remains extremely desirable and competitive for a few reasons‚Äù Gartner said. ‚ÄúVery high barriers to entry there‚Äôs virtually no development sites so properties like Wynnewood Shopping Center remain highly desirable.‚Äù

The Wynnewood retail hub dates to the 1950s during the postwar boom when the number of American suburban shopping centers exploded from eight in 1946 to 4000 in 1960. It marked the first of John Wanamaker‚Äôs department stores to open outside the central city. Today Bed Bath & Beyond occupies the space where Wanamakers once was.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHA6Ly9tLm1vdW50dmVybm9uZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL3NlcC8xNy9zY2VuZXMtbW91bnQtdmVybm9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scenes in Mount Vernon,"The community of Mount Vernon stretches along the Potomac River from Old Town Alexandria to Fort Belvoir and inland past Richmond Highway.

A new Wendy‚Äôs restaurant is going up near Beacon Mall off Richmond Highway. The mall is really an outdoor shopping center but it used to be an enclosed mall back in the late 1970s-early 1980s.

The bike trail construction continues south of this spot where crews are building a new bridge across Dogue Creek and rehabilitating the trail along Mount Vernon Memorial Highway all the way from Richmond Highway to the Mount Vernon Plantation.

The company based in Memphis Tennessee warned it will likely miss Wall Street‚Äôs profit target for its fiscal first quarter that ended Aug. 31. And it said it expects business conditions to further weaken in the current quarter amid weaker global volume.

Its stock fell more than 16% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

‚ÄúGlobal volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter both internationally and in the U.S.‚Äù FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are swiftly addressing these headwinds but given the speed at which conditions shifted first-quarter results are below our expectations.‚Äù

The company‚Äôs FedEx Express business was particularly hurt by challenges in Europe and weaker economic trends in Asia which led to a roughly $500 million revenue shortfall for the segment. FedEx Ground revenue meanwhile came in about $300 million below the company‚Äôs forecasts.

High operating expenses were also a drag on the company‚Äôs results FedEx said.

In response it said it will cut costs by closing over 90 FedEx Office locations and five corporate offices deferring new hires and operating fewer flights.

The company scrapped its forecast for its earnings in its current fiscal year that it had issued less than three months ago.

For the three months ended Aug. 31 FedEx now projects adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 and $23.2 billion in revenue. That‚Äôs below analysts‚Äô consensus forecast of $5.14 adjusted earnings per share and $23.6 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

Subramaniam noted that he remains confident FedEx will achieve its fiscal year 2025 financial targets.

For the current quarter which ends in November FedEx expects revenue to range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion and adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.75. Wall Street analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of $5.48 and $24.86 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

In 2014 court records show a FedEx truck slammed into the back of Naddia Dhalai‚Äôs car when the driver failed to properly apply his brakes. FedEx admitted liability for the crash. Dhalai filed suit in 2016.

At issue was the extent of Dhalai‚Äôs neck and back injuries. FedEx alleged that a second unrelated car crash Dhalai experienced months after the crash involving FedEx was responsible for her current condition.

Settlement offered declined

The case dragged on for years and was further delayed by the pandemic. FedEx offered to settle the case for $1.8 million. In three separate mediations the plaintiff‚Äôs attorneys offered to settle the case for $2 million.

FedEx stood its ground: The case would go before a Nevada state court jury.

After a near-two-week trial it was clear the jury took a substantially divergent view from the FedEx position. The jury awarded Dhalai $8 million of which $5 million was allocated for Dhalai‚Äôs future medical care largely based on the testimony of the woman‚Äôs treating physicians.

‚ÄúWe served a Rule 68 Offer of Judgment early on in the case for $2 million which means that in addition to the $8 million we should get another $4 million in attorney‚Äôs fees costs and interest‚Äù one of the plaintiff‚Äôs attorneys Benjamin Cloward said in an interview. ‚ÄúSo essentially because FedEx was unwilling to pay the additional $210000 if all appeals are upheld they could end up paying an extra $10 million. I specifically outlined these risks to FedEx in the hopes of bringing about resolution but they flatly refused all of our efforts to resolve the case for $2 million.‚Äù

Take it to court?

‚ÄúThey should have taken my case to court‚Äù is a consistent message insurance brokers claim adjusters and underwriters hear. Some lawsuits do wind up in court like the FedEx case. While we don‚Äôt know all of the details regarding the litigation the case does shed light on the rationale for avoiding court whenever possible.

MEMPHIS Tenn ‚Äî Some fear troubling times for Memphis-based company FedEx as the global shipping giant announced Thursday that it would be closing 90 stores.

The company also said it would put off making new hires and cut flights at FedEx Express. The thought of a looming global recession is what the company's CEO Raj Subramaniam has argued is reflected in taking these steps.

Dr. John E. Gnuschke is Director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research and the Center for Manpower Studies and Professor of Economics at The University of Memphis.

""Anything that's negative that happens to FedEx is also very negative for the Memphis economy"" Gnuschke said. ""If it's a minor disaster for them it's a major disaster for us.""

Late Thursday FedEx slashed its earnings forecast announcing a shortfall of half a billion dollars. The company expects business conditions to worsen in the weeks ahead.

High operating expenses getting the blame for dragging down financial results in the most recent quarter.

""FedEx's global hub is here and its headquarters are here"" Gnuschke said. ""As a result of that they have a huge local impact‚Äînot only as a result of their employees and their earnings but as a result of all of their supplies.""

FedEx which employs approximately 30000 people across the city of Memphis said it will aggressively cut costs.

Some economists are saying that as demand declines shipping reductions should be expected.

""The announcement from FedEx that their revenues were less than expected and their earnings per share were less than expected was a result of reductions in demand globally and those reductions are exactly what we should expect to see"" Gnuschke said.

Still Gnuschke said he doesn't believe a full-on recession will ultimately occur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1lYWdsZXMtZmFucy1zdWUtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1jb21tYW5kZXJzLXJhaWxpbmctY29sbGFwc2VkL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtZWFnbGVzLWZhbnMtc3VlLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tY29tbWFuZGVycy1yYWlsaW5nLWNvbGxhcHNlZC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four Philadelphia Eagles fans sue Washington Commanders after railing collapsed at FedEx Field last season,"Four Eagles fans sue Washington Commanders after railing collapsed at FedEx Field last season

Four Eagles fans sue Washington Commanders after railing collapsed at FedEx Field last season

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Viral video captured the frightening moments in the stands. Last season a railing collapsed at FedEx Field which sent Eagles fans falling onto concrete.

Now some of those fans are taking legal action.

Four Philadelphia Eagles fans are suing the Washington Commanders alleging they are still coping with injuries after a railing collapsed last January following a game at FedEx Field.

The four fans are each seeking more than $75000 for injuries they say they are still dealing with including medical costs and loss of income.

""It is remarkable how many mistakes were made"" Robert Sokolove an attorney from Curtin & Heefner LLP representing the Eagles fans said.

""The railings themselves were inadequate"" he added.

Video of the incident shows the four friends waiting for quarterback Jalen Hurts as he was walking off the field. Just as Hurts begins to high five the crowd the railing gives ‚Äì sending several people tumbling to the ground and narrowly missing Hurts himself.

""It could have been catastrophic"" Sokolove said.

Sokolove said after the fall neither the team nor stadium staff assessed his clients' injuries.

""There was no care given no medical attention no contact"" Sokolove said. ""They didn't even get their names.""

Hurts can be seen helping fans and later wrote a letter to the NFL and Washington Commanders about follow-up action is being considered.

""The only person that seemed to be helping the people who landed on the ground is Jalen Hurts the guy who almost got clobbered"" Sokolove said.

Sokolove also said while one of the men injured takes a selfie with Hurts immediately after the fall that doesn't discount the seriousness of what happened.

""You're in a fog you're in a daze and I dare say when you end up literally at the feet of Jalen Hurts you're probably still in the fog"" Sokolove said.

Sokolove said while his clients deserve to be compensated these lifelong Eagles fans want something more

""They're really interested to make sure this doesn't happen again to anybody"" Sokolove said.

After the incident the team issued a statement saying the fans were offered an on-site medical evaluation and left of their own accord.

CBS3 reached out to the Commanders about this lawsuit but we have yet to hear back."

Hunting YMCA a good use of available land?

It‚Äôs a question city leaders may have to answer.

Grand Action 2.0 a private economic development group wants to bring professional soccer to West Michigan and it‚Äôs eyeing as a potential site several parking lots near the corner of Pearl Street NW and Mt. Vernon Avenue NW owned by the Grand Rapids Downtown Development Authority.

The idea has generated lots of enthusiasm and curiosity and it‚Äôs seen as a potential way to boost activity downtown and draw more visitors to the region.

But there‚Äôs also questions.

How would the development impact surrounding neighborhoods and parking availability and how would it affect the city‚Äôs goal of adding nearly 9000 housing units by 2025? Previously the site under consideration for the stadium was envisioned by Downtown Grand Rapids Inc. as a spot that could potentially accommodate nearly 1000 units.

It‚Äôs unclear by how much the stadium would reduce the amount of housing that could be added there.

‚ÄúWe desperately need housing so I‚Äôm not sure how a soccer stadium‚Äôs going to accomplish that goal‚Äù said Annette Vandenberg executive director of the West Grand Neighborhood Organization which is located north of the parking lots under consideration.

Vandenberg said she doesn‚Äôt have a position on the project at this time and that‚Äôs she‚Äôs waiting to learn more should Grand Action push forward with the idea.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt need soccer‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying we need a lot of housing.‚Äù

The parking lots under consideration some of which officials have said are underused are serviced by the city‚Äôs free downtown area shuttle.

The concept

Grand Action 2.0 whose co-chairs include Carol Van Andel Dick DeVos and Fifth Third Bank Regional President Tom Welch was launched in 2020. The group‚Äôs original incarnation Grand Action helped create large transformational projects such as Van Andel Arena DeVos Place the Grand Rapids Downtown Market and more.

At this point Grand Action says it‚Äôs simply exploring the idea of using the publicly owned parking lots and adjacent property as a site for the stadium and it has not committed to building it there.

‚ÄúIn late August Progressive AE submitted materials related to development of a downtown soccer and event stadium on a proposed site to the City of Grand Rapids for preliminary and informal review‚Äù the organization said in a statement said.

‚ÄúWhile the stadium site has not been confirmed and plans for this facility are still in the very early stages this review is an important step in the due diligence process to determine if this site would even be viable.‚Äù

The stadium is expected to cost $125 million according to a request the Grand Rapids-Kent County Convention/Arena Authority submitted to Kent County for federal stimulus dollars to help fund the stadium.

One property near the parking lots the downtown Big Boy at 407 Pearl St. NW was purchased in July for $3.2 million by a limited liability company connected to Dan DeVos.

DeVos is chairperson of the Orlando Magic basketball team co-owner of the Grand Rapids Griffins and chairman and CEO of DP Fox Ventures.

DeVos could not be reached for comment and it‚Äôs unclear whether his purchase was connected to plans to bring a stadium to the site. However a conceptual rendering of the stadium that appeared on social media shows the Big Boy property being used for the project.

Grand Action has also reached out to the David D. Hunting YMCA about the project and enquired about purchasing its parking lot to use for the stadium said Scott Lewis president and CEO of the YMCA of Greater Grand Rapids.

He said the idea is ‚Äúexciting‚Äù but that he‚Äôs waiting to hear more including where patrons of the downtown YMCA would park if his organization were to sell its property to Grand Action

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really really really preliminary‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had two conversations about it briefly.‚Äù

Housing questions

If Grand Action were to select the parking lots as the site of the stadium it would have to purchase them from the DDA. The DDA is overseen by Downtown Grand Rapids Inc. whose initial plan for the site included housing.

Rick Winn president of AHC Hospitality and chair of the DDA‚Äôs board said he doesn‚Äôt have a formal stance on the soccer stadium concept at this point. He‚Äôs waiting to hear more about the idea from Grand Action once further due diligence is conducted he said.

‚ÄúI would hope that if that is the chosen site that we would incorporate housing as well‚Äù Winn said. ‚ÄúThat would be our goal. Once we get to that point that will all be discussed.‚Äù

While adding housing is important so is elevating the region‚Äôs recreation and tourism economy Winn said.

‚ÄúAny entertainment venue whether it‚Äôs sports related or otherwise is a boost to downtown and to the region to the county‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think anything that we can do to encourage people to visit Grand Rapids and the region is a boost to everybody.‚Äù

The discussion over the soccer stadium comes amid a push to add more housing in Grand Rapids.

In 2020 Bowen National Research an Ohio-based real estate market analysis firm released a study examining Grand Rapids‚Äô housing needs. The study estimated Grand Rapids needs to add 8888 housing units ‚Äî apartments townhomes condos single family homes ‚Äî by 2025 to meet demand.

Since then the city has added 1045 housing units with another 1000 units or so in the pipeline according to figures provided by the city of Grand Rapids in mid-July. However the city does not appear to be on track to hit the 8888-unit goal by 2025 officials acknowledge.

Vandenberg said there‚Äôs a significant need for more housing in her West Side neighborhood.

‚ÄúAnytime somebody comes to us and says I have a housing plan I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs four housing units ‚Äî that‚Äôs four more housing units‚Äù she said regarding the community being adjacent to the proposed stadium site. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how bad we need housing.‚Äù

Other questions about the concept include how it would impact parking traffic and other quality of life factors in the neighborhood Vandenberg said.

‚ÄúWest Grand loves to see the West Side grow and thrive‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut at the same time we want it to be where the people already here don‚Äôt get pushed out.‚Äù

In December 2020 Downtown Grand Rapids Inc. which oversees development in the urban core presented a plan that envisioned the parking lots ‚Äî that are now being considered for the soccer stadium ‚Äî being used for housing.

The plans known as Bridge South indicated the parking lots could include as many as 1000 housing units depending on how densely they are developed the presentation showed. A rendering of the proposed soccer stadium showed at least one large parking lot known as parking lot 9 would not be touched by the soccer stadium possibly leaving it open for future housing.

Tim Kelly president and CEO of Downtown Grand Rapids Inc. said his organization will take into account the Bridge South plan if discussions about the potential soccer stadium site continue.

One DDA board member said he would like to see some land on the site used for housing should Grand Action push to build a stadium there.

‚ÄúOne of my interests is in housing and making sure that we have housing downtown that meets a variety of price points a variety of opportunities for people‚Äù said Jim Talen. ‚ÄúFrom what I saw there will be some housing potentially incorporated and I know that DGRI will be pushing that the staff will be because that was part of the vision‚Äù for the site.

Kara Wood executive director of Grand Action 2.0 could not be reached to discuss the question of housing on the site.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early to discuss soccer stadium development and potential ancillary development tied to any specific site at this time‚Äù according to a statement provided by Truscott Rossman public relations on behalf of Grand Action. ‚ÄúThe preliminary site plan that was published online was not released by Grand Action 2.0 and that site has not been confirmed.‚Äù

Another area resident Peter Carlberg who sits on the board for the adjacent John Ball Park neighborhood said he‚Äôs only familiar with the soccer stadium concept through media reports.

If the project were to move forward he said his questions would center on factors such as how the project would affect traffic and parking in his neighborhood.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a high priority for us that there be housing there necessarily over any other use‚Äù Carlberg said. ‚ÄúAlthough we would prefer housing to let‚Äôs say more bars.‚Äù

Some solar industry groups and researchers say that level of concentration poses a risk to the solar supply chain. They also argue that moving production elsewhere could decrease solar‚Äôs carbon footprint and avoid companies accused of using forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In the US the Inflation Reduction Act promises funds for restarting idle polysilicon factories and investing in manufacturing of other solar components. But companies must still turn that momentum into solar panels.

Wacker Chemie‚Äôs chemical plant in Charleston Tennessee is large enough to have its own street system. Lettered streets run roughly east to west intersecting numbered avenues at perfect 90¬∞ angles.

The 220-hectare site produces polysilicon a key material used to make solar panels and computer chips. Two pipe-covered distillation systems the length of football fields tower over Second Avenue while reactors used to make polysilicon occupy an entire block between C Street and D Street.

Site Leader Ken Collins says Wacker has already invested nearly $3 billion in the plant and the site is still growing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actively looking at things in F‚Äù he says pointing to the location of a future street on the edge of the facility. ‚ÄúAnd then long term it goes well beyond.‚Äù

Wacker is in the midst of spending $200 million to add the production of silicone polymers. Collins says the property is also laid out to allow for polysilicon expansion. Wacker hasn‚Äôt announced specific plans for new polysilicon infrastructure but national governments and the solar industry are pushing to increase production in places like Tennessee.

Producers don‚Äôt want to rely upon unstable sources. James May CEO REC Silicon

Most of the world‚Äôs polysilicon is made in China and the US solar industry is encouraging suppliers to increase production elsewhere. Solar companies argue that a less-concentrated supply chain will be more resilient emit less carbon and circumvent companies accused of using forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The US and Indian governments recently added momentum to this endeavor pledging billions of dollars to scale up domestic solar manufacturing and guarantee future access to clean energy.

Some companies are already responding. Reliance Energy says it will spend $7.5 billion on a green energy manufacturing hub in India that will include polysilicon production. The other two companies that make polysilicon in the US‚ÄîHemlock Semiconductor and REC Silicon‚Äîare also ramping up production. Hemlock turned on idle capacity for solar-grade polysilicon at its plant in Michigan this summer and REC Silicon plans to reopen a polysilicon facility in Washington. ‚ÄúProducers don‚Äôt want to rely upon unstable sources‚Äù REC Silicon CEO James May says.

Even with all that momentum challenging China‚Äôs preeminence in solar manufacturing will not be easy. In addition to its massive polysilicon capacity Chinese companies control the subsequent steps in the supply chain: the production of silicon ingot and wafers solar cells and final solar panels. Supply chain experts say other countries must build up capacity in those parts of the supply chain as well if they are to decrease the risk of disruptions. And polysilicon makers outside China must prove they can compete with rivals in China that have access to ample government support.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) an industry group argues that incentives in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will kick-start US solar production eventually making it competitive with China. Over the next 8 years SEIA hopes companies will build US factories capable of making 50 GW of solar panels per year nearly enough to power every home in Texas.

‚ÄúMaybe half of that crosses the finish line‚Äù Collins says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a lot of polysilicon demand. Much more than the three producers in the US make today.‚Äù

The process

Polysilicon is at the heart of a solar panel. Small amounts of other elements are added to polysilicon so that one side of the material has extra electrons. When sunlight hits a solar cell it displaces those extra electrons. They flow to the opposite side of the cell which has molecules that can accept them. The flow of electrons creates an electric current.

The process for making polysilicon starts in mines extracting quartzite which is essentially gravel with high levels of silicon dioxide and low levels of impurities like iron. Many of those mines are in China but quartzite reserves are abundant in Brazil Norway and the US. The gravel is melted down in a furnace with a carbon source usually coal or charcoal to produce silicon metal silvery-gray rocks that are at least 98% silicon.

Companies like Wacker use the Siemens process to remove the remaining impurities. The resulting polysilicon is a crystallized form of silicon that needs to be at least 99.9999% pure for solar applications‚Äîand even purer for computer chips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really technical plant that turns silver rocks into silver rocks‚Äù Collins says of the facility he leads.

In the first step at the Tennessee plant the silicon metal is crushed into a powder and combined with hydrogen chloride at high temperatures to form liquid trichlorosilane. Wacker distills the liquid in spiraling columns several stories tall to increase the purity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very similar to what you do to a bourbon‚Äù Collins says.

The purified trichlorosilane is converted to gas and pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a filament of polysilicon about the diameter of a pencil. Some companies use silane gas instead. Electricity runs through the filament illuminating it like a light bulb and increasing its temperature to 1000 ¬∞C. At those high temperatures silicon from the trichlorosilane slowly deposits onto the filament gradually turning it into a thick rod. As a final step the rod is broken into chunks.

MAKING POLYSILICON To create the polysilicon‚Äîa crystallized form of nearly pure silicon‚Äîneeded for solar panels manufacturers begin with quartzite gravel a compound that contains silicon dioxide. The multistep process results in 99.9999% silicon. Step 1: Quartzite gravel containing silicon dioxide is the starting material for polysilicon. Step 2: The quartz is melted down to silicon metal which is at least 98% pure silicon. Step 3: Silicon metal is combined with hydrogen chloride to form liquid trichlorosilane. Step 4: Impurities are removed by distilling the trichlorosilane. Step 5: Trichlorosilane is pumped into horseshoe-shaped chambers that contain a thin filament of polysilicon. Electricity runs through the filament heating it to 1000 ¬∞C. Step 6: The silicon deposits onto the filament turning it into a thick rod that is at least 99.9999% silicon. Step 7: The rods are broken into chunks and sold to companies that make silicon wafers for solar panels.

Some companies such as REC Silicon use a slightly different method called the fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) process. REC Silicon says the FBR process uses less energy. Companies using the Siemens process have to use lots of energy to heat the filament but they also have to use additional energy to cool the walls of the reaction chamber so that silicon doesn‚Äôt deposit there.

At the start the FBR process looks similar to the Siemens process with conversion of silicon metal into silane. But then the gas flows through a column seeded with tiny polysilicon beads rather than a chamber with a filament. Silicon deposits on the beads which grow into polysilicon spheres a few millimeters wide.

Beads from the FBR process or chunks from the Siemens process are sold to companies that turn them into cubed ingots which are sawed into paper-thin wafers. The wafers are textured and treated with other elements to turn them into individual solar cells. Multiple cells are soldered and sandwiched between a glass panel and a plastic back sheet to form solar panels.

Outsourcing

It‚Äôs a complex process and China dominates nearly every step of it. The country makes more than three-quarters of the world‚Äôs polysilicon according to data compiled by polysilicon consultant Johannes Bernreuter. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China also manufactures over 80% of all solar cells and assembled solar panels. The country produces virtually all the wafers used for solar panels.

It wasn‚Äôt always this way. In 2010 polysilicon production was split almost evenly among the US Europe South Korea Japan and China. In 2014 the US had nearly a dozen factories producing ingots and wafers according to SEIA data. Today there are none. The IEA estimates that companies in China have invested more than $40 billion in solar manufacturing since 2014 15 times what companies in North America have invested.

Bernreuter says the Chinese government fueled the growth of the country‚Äôs solar industry by offering favorable loans affordable land and cheap electricity. ‚ÄúChina early on recognized that solar will be a huge market‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey have strategically bet on that industry and supported it.‚Äù

US polysilicon producers also suffered a blow in 2014 when China imposed an import tariff cutting off US facilities from some of their most important customers.

Hemlock and Wacker were both building polysilicon plants in Tennessee when the tariffs took hold. Hemlock abandoned its $1 billion project in Clarksville in 2014 as it was on the verge of starting up. Wacker originally intended to focus on the solar market but shifted production to semiconductor-grade silicon when its plant came on line in 2016. In 2019 the tariffs forced REC Silicon to mothball its $1.7 billion polysilicon plant in Moses Lake Washington.

Heymi Bahar an IEA analyst who directed the organization‚Äôs report says China‚Äôs investment helped decrease the price of solar panels but also concentrated too much production in one place.

The report notes that a single factory in China produces 14% of the world‚Äôs polysilicon. In 2020 an explosion at a plant operated by China‚Äôs GCL-Tech temporarily halted a tenth of the world‚Äôs production capacity according to a report from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ‚ÄúIf there is a supply chain disruption the whole world is affected‚Äù Bahar says.

Xinjiang

Because China gets much of its electricity from coal-fired power plants making polysilicon and other solar materials outside China would also reduce the industry‚Äôs carbon footprint some companies and sustainability researchers argue.

Michael Parr executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance an industry group says the heat used to deposit silicon from trichlorosilane onto the rod requires enormous amounts of power so production is usually located in places where electricity is cheap.

‚ÄúIn China that means western China in Xinjiang . . . and increasingly Inner Mongolia where the grid is almost entirely coal based‚Äù Parr says.

He estimates that polysilicon made in China is three times as carbon intensive as polysilicon from other countries largely because of the Chinese electricity grid‚Äôs reliance on coal. The IEA reports that even the most carbon-intensive solar panels make up for all their manufacturing-related emissions in less than a year by generating carbon-free electricity but Parr still wants to see production move to places that have access to cleaner electricity grids. He says cheap power from hydroelectricity plants works especially well for polysilicon production.

Dominating solar



REC Silicon‚Äôs Washington plant will run on hydropower and the company boasts that the FBR process it uses will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hemlock the largest single energy user in Michigan also says it has access to renewable energy that reduces polysilicon‚Äôs carbon footprint.

Reliance on coal-based power isn‚Äôt the US solar industry‚Äôs only concern with the Xinjiang region. In May of last year Laura Murphy a human rights professor at Sheffield Hallam University coauthored a report accusing four of the largest polysilicon makers in Xinjiang as well as companies that supply them with silicon metal of participating in a forced labor program operated by the Chinese government.

Murphy says the labor program conducted ostensibly to increase economic prosperity in a poor region forces everyone in Xinjiang with Uyghur or Kazakh background to have a job. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the case even if they have to be forcibly placed there by a government agency‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere are government agents who go door to door.‚Äù

Murphy says China‚Äôs government will separate Uyghur and Kazakh families take away their land and even demolish whole villages essentially forcing them to leave their homes and work in their assigned jobs.

There is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect. Alan Crawford polysilicon consultant

An environmental social and governance report from Daqo New Energy a polysilicon maker with operations in Xinjiang denies that the company uses forced labor and says its suppliers have signed declarations attesting that they don‚Äôt use forced labor. A spokesperson for the company declined to answer specific questions. Other major polysilicon makers in Xinjiang‚ÄîGCL-Tech Xinte Energy and East Hope Group‚Äîdid not respond to emailed questions.

The evidence of forced labor use was strong enough that earlier this year the US government started enforcing a ban on essentially all products made in Xinjiang. Parr expects the ban to have a big effect. ‚ÄúThe game has changed and easy access to Chinese solar is a thing of the past‚Äù he says.

Polysilicon consultant Alan Crawford says polysilicon is made in other places in China without forced labor and with a lower carbon footprint. The problem is that ethically produced polysilicon‚Äîfrom other parts of China or other countries‚Äîmust flow through ingot factories in China where it‚Äôs blended with polysilicon from Xinjiang making it almost impossible to say with certainty whether a solar panel was made without forced labor. ‚ÄúThere is no silicon-based solar panel you can buy today that is not suspect‚Äù Crawford says.

Jill Engel-Cox director of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory says companies buying solar panels are starting to pay more attention to such issues. She says there‚Äôs an expectation that renewable energy projects will benefit the world broadly‚Äînot just its climate.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been so focused on economics making them as cheap as possible which is important because they need to be able to compete with other types of energy‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut now how do we consider the social benefit and the environmental benefit?‚Äù

REshoring

The US‚Äôs ban on solar products from Xinjiang the ongoing trade war between China and the US and the current difficulties of shipping products across the ocean are problems for AES Clean Energy a power company that buys lots of solar panels. President Leonardo Moreno says the supply of panels coming from China has become unreliable. ‚ÄúWe have to build hundreds of megawatts of renewables in the US. We want a supply chain that‚Äôs stable‚Äù he says.

AES is part of a consortium of solar companies trying to incentivize a more resilient supply chain in the US. The consortium is promising to spend more than $6 billion on solar panels as long as suppliers set up US manufacturing operations. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what gives them certainty‚Äù Moreno says. ‚ÄúThey can build and the demand will be there.‚Äù

To encourage production outside China and avoid supply chain risks IEA analyst Bahar says governments also need to offer solar manufacturers support. He says they should use tax policies or incentive schemes to reduce the start-up costs for polysilicon manufacturers and ensure that they have access to cheap electricity just as China has done.

In August US president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. It offers a direct tax credit for the production of solar-grade polysilicon and also offers incentives for other parts of the supply chain like ingot and wafer manufacturing.

In an investor call the day after the signing REC Silicon‚Äôs May said the tax credits were a big part of the company‚Äôs decision to restart operations at its plant in Washington. The company expects to receive $48 million in credits annually once the facility is operating at full capacity.

The South Korean company Hanwha Solutions which made a major investment in REC Silicon earlier this year is scouting out sites in Texas South Carolina and Georgia for a facility to produce ingots wafers and solar panels according to documents filed with the Texas comptroller‚Äôs office. If the project moves forward the company says it would begin operating in 2025. SPI Energy hopes to set up wafer production in the US by 2023 and Convalt Energy hopes to be producing wafers in upstate New York by 2024.

Building wafer manufacturing in the US would have a domino effect Bernreuter says and likely complete a solar supply chain outside China. ‚ÄúIf you solve that step of the value chain I think a lot of the other steps could follow relatively easily‚Äù he says.

The US could also avoid silicon-based solar panels altogether by using another technology: thin-film cadmium telluride which makes up about 5% of the global solar market. First Solar the largest producer of cadmium telluride panels has operations in the US Malaysia and Vietnam and will soon add a base in India.

The same forces fueling the growth of silicon-based solar manufacturing outside China are also boosting cadmium telluride. The US Department of Energy recently announced $20 million in funding for a consortium to advance the technology and First Solar says it will invest $1.2 billion in US manufacturing now that the Inflation Reduction Act has passed.

They can build and the demand will be there. Leonardo Moreno President AES Clean Energy

Other countries are also hoping to build up their solar industries. In 2021 for example India started offering incentives to help expand its capacity. Shirdi Sai Electricals Reliance Energy and Adani Infrastructure have all committed to building at least 4 GW of manufacturing capacity‚Äîfrom polysilicon to finished panels‚Äîbefore 2024.

‚ÄúConsidering the economies of scale and to be more cost competitive most manufacturers are actually planning for probably 10 GW plus especially for the polysilicon‚Äù says Balachander Krishnan who is overseeing the launch of Shirdi Sai Electricals‚Äô planned ingot wafer and module plant.

REC Silicon‚Äôs May welcomes the Inflation Reduction Act but he notes that the clock for adding the new capacity started ticking as soon as the tax credit was approved. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs designed to promote investment‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe caveat is that it‚Äôs got a time limit: 10 years.‚Äù After that May says US solar companies will have to be able to compete on their own.

Moreno says the tax credits will give companies the confidence they need to scale up solar manufacturing in the US. That should reduce costs he says. When the countdown hits zero the US will be ready he thinks. ‚ÄúThe reason the Chinese panels became very cheap over the years is not technology itself‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the scale.‚Äù

At Wacker‚Äôs Tennessee plant Collins says the company is focused on the long-term opportunity for polysilicon rather than the Inflation Reduction Act.

The US plant is modeled after Wacker‚Äôs flagship industrial park in Burghausen Germany which started operating in 1916 with 450 employees. Today the facility has 10000 employees and an app to help them navigate the sprawling campus.

The company wants to replicate Burghausen in Tennessee. ‚ÄúWhen the Wacker family . . . came to this site they said this is the Burghausen of the US‚Äù Collins says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs their vision.‚Äù

Driving around the plant in Tennessee Collins points to all the empty spaces where buildings may rise in the decades to come.

Then things really get serious.

Our solar system is on its way out. Slowly. Over the next several billion years a series of unfortunate events will take place spanning from the not-so-great to the truly tragic. Afterward our solar system will be gone: All of the planets will be lost and the sun will be a solitary white dwarf.

(Pause to wipe away tears.)

I will guide us through our solar system‚Äôs future one step at a time. Since Earth is our home base I‚Äôll include a key event affecting life on Earth. Here are the five steps to come:

1. Earth‚Äôs oceans will boil off.

2. The rocky planets‚Äô orbits may go unstable leading to a potential giant collision between planets.

3. The sun will become a red giant and swallow the rocky planets.

4. A passing star will trigger a dynamical instability among the remaining planets.

5. A passing star will strip away the final planet.

It is a near certainty that each of these events will happen with the exception of number 2 (which has only a relatively small probability). But it will take about 100 billion years to reach the end.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

The End of Liquid Water (and Life) on Earth

The sun is ever-so-slowly heating up. Today it‚Äôs about 30 percent brighter than right after it formed. As the sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core the mean molecular weight increases thus increasing the core‚Äôs temperature and the rate of the fusion reaction (called the proton-proton chain). This slowly increases the sun‚Äôs energy output.

Life as we know it requires liquid water. In order to maintain liquid water on a planet‚Äôs surface there must be a balance between the energy coming in and the energy going out that maintains the right temperature range.

The energy balance is always adjusting itself. If the amount of greenhouse gases in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere increases (as it is doing today) the ‚Äúblanketing‚Äù effect of greenhouse gases creates a new energy balance with a hotter surface.

Earth does have a built-in thermostat: the carbonate-silicate cycle which regulates the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere thus maintaining a stable climate. Unfortunately for us humans it operates on about a million-year timescale so it is much too slow to help us with the current global warming problem.

HOT BLANKET: The greenhouse effect basically makes our atmosphere act like a blanket by slowing down the loss of energy to space. More greenhouse gases means a thicker blanket. Credit: Time Scavengers

Another way for a planet to heat up is if the amount of incoming energy increases. This is exactly what is happening as the sun‚Äôs brightness slowly increases. And although there are much shorter-term variations in Earth‚Äôs climate from seasons changes in atmospheric composition (both from human-made greenhouse gases and sometimes from volcanic dust) and Milankovitch cycles Earth‚Äôs surface is slowly but inexorably heating up due to the increasing solar brightness.

At some point Earth‚Äôs atmosphere will no longer be able to maintain a stable energy balance and the greenhouse heating will enter a runaway phase. In a runaway greenhouse there is a positive feedback loop. The planet‚Äôs surface becomes hotter which causes more water to evaporate into the atmosphere. Water is a strong greenhouse gas so this increases the strength of the greenhouse effect which further heats the planet‚Äôs surface.

Once the greenhouse effect goes runaway it will heat up Earth‚Äôs surface to the point that the oceans will entirely vaporize. This will just make the planet hotter and hotter until a new balance is reached with a scorching hot surface and all of the water trapped in the atmosphere (likely in a ‚Äúsupercritical‚Äù state meaning there is no distinction between liquid and gas). There will be more water vapor close to Earth‚Äôs surface but no liquid ocean.

Another way to think of this is in terms of the ‚Äúhabitable zone‚Äù‚Äîthe region of orbits around a star inside which a planet can maintain liquid water provided it has an appropriate atmosphere. The inner edge of the habitable zone is the distance from the star inside which a planet‚Äôs atmosphere will undergo runaway greenhouse heating. Right now the inner edge of the sun‚Äôs habitable zone is at about 95 percent of the Earth-sun distance.

With the brightening sun that inner edge of the habitable zone is slowly marching outward. Exactly when the inner edge of the habitable zone will cross Earth‚Äôs orbit is a little tricky to pinpoint but estimates point to about a billion years from now.

From that point on there won‚Äôt be any more liquid water on Earth. No more liquid water means no more life at least as we know it. In the words of the great Mel Brooks: ‚ÄúThere goes the planet!‚Äù

Chaotic Destabilization of the Rocky Planets‚Äô Orbits

The planets‚Äô orbits are chaotic. In a mathematical sense this means that we cannot predict their exact positions in the distant future (beyond about 10 to 100 million years).

When thinking of the future it‚Äôs easy to imagine the worst. When my kids were still crawling around I would find myself imagining horrific futures in which they crawled off the edge of well anything tall. Luckily nothing like that ever happened. But the prospect terrified me.

Given that the rocky planets‚Äô orbits are chaotic we cannot know their future. Should we just assume that their orbits will remain nice and stable for all time? Or like a young parent should we assume the worst that things will somehow go terribly wrong?

Computers can help us find an answer albeit a probabilistic one. Using codes designed to follow the orbits of the planets forward in time we can simulate many possible futures for the solar system. Each simulation starts from very slightly different positions for the planets today then projects those into the future. We know the positions of the planets quite accurately but there are uncertainties at the level of millimeters to meters and those uncertainties are magnified by chaos.

Some simulations find that Mercury‚Äôs orbit will become extremely stretched-out or eccentric. This can happen if Mercury enters a ‚Äúsecular resonance‚Äù with Jupiter. The resonance causes an orbital alignment between the two planets in which the planets‚Äô apsidal lines‚Äîthe line connecting the sun to the position of closest approach‚Äîstart to precess together maintaining their alignment over many thousands of years. This acts to progressively stretch out Mercury‚Äôs orbit in dramatic fashion:

Once Mercury‚Äôs orbit becomes so stretched-out that it crosses the orbit of Venus all sorts of crazy things can happen. Mercury can come so close to the sun that it is engulfed. Another possibility is that Mercury collides with Venus. Perhaps the most dramatic (and tragic) outcome seen to date is that it is possible for Mercury to end up perturbing the other rocky planets‚Äô orbits to the point of triggering a collision between Earth and Mars as you can see in this image:

What is the likelihood of this happening? Is Earth really going to collide with Mars in 3 billion years? The most rigorous study to date from 2009 showed that there is about a 1 percent probability of Mercury entering the secular resonance with Jupiter and wreaking havoc in the next 5 billion years. Even if Mercury enters the resonance there is only a small chance of a collision with Earth. It is much more likely that Mercury will simply fall into the sun or collide with Venus.

In other words there is a 99 percent chance that the rocky planets‚Äô orbits will continue to zoom around the sun like clockwork at least until the sun itself starts to change ‚Ä¶

The Sun Will Evolve Into a Red Giant Swallow the Inner Planets and Become a White Dwarf

In about 5 billion years the sun‚Äôs core will run out of hydrogen the fuel of its fusion reactor. The sun will continue to fuse hydrogen in an expanding shell and this will puff the sun up into a red giant.

Betelgeuse Orion‚Äôs bright right shoulder is a good example of a red giant. The sun will be a red giant for about half a billion years. It‚Äôll increase in brightness shifting the habitable zone outward to encompass Jupiter and Saturn. During this phase the giant planets‚Äô large moons may have the conditions for liquid water on their surfaces. Many of those moons have a lot of water in their interiors including some (most famously Europa) with liquid oceans under icy shells. Ganymede the solar system‚Äôs largest moon has a mass about 40 times smaller than Earth yet is thought to be about half water! That makes Ganymede‚Äôs water budget significantly larger than Earth‚Äôs since our planet is only about 1 part water in 1000 by mass. Ganymede will make quite the ocean moon in about 7 billion years.

The planets‚Äô orbits will adjust to the changing sun. The inner planets will be engulfed when the sun is a red giant. Planets far from the sun will expand onto wider orbits as the sun loses mass to powerful winds flowing out from its surface. As the sun‚Äôs gravity weakens a planet‚Äôs orbit naturally widens like a slinky losing its tension and stretching out with age.

Now a red giant is big. The sun will expand by about a factor of 100 to become a red giant and will extend out about as far as Earth‚Äôs current orbit. Our planet is at the brink: We don‚Äôt know whether it will be swallowed by the sun or escape onto a larger orbit.

Meanwhile the sun‚Äôs core will contract until the increased temperature and pressure enable the fusion of helium. There will be a few flashes then the sun will puff off its outer layers as a ‚Äúplanetary nebula‚Äù (which has nothing to do with planets‚Äîit‚Äôs just an old name that stuck around). What will remain of the sun is its core a small white dwarf that does nothing but slowly cool off for eternity.

White dwarfs are almost as massive as the sun but only about the size of Earth. This gives them extremely strong surface gravities and any material heavier than hydrogen or helium settles out of their atmospheres and into the stars themselves in days to months‚Äîan astronomical blink of the eye.

When we look at white dwarfs a large fraction of them appear to be ‚Äúpolluted‚Äù: Instead of having pure hydrogen or helium spectra their outer layers are contaminated with rocky (or sometimes ice-rich) material. Because it should settle out very quickly this rocky material must have collided with the white dwarf quite recently.

White dwarfs might be polluted by a slow trickle of material falling onto their surfaces from disks of debris on very close orbits. The debris comes from small bodies that were gravitationally sling-shotted by the planets during and after their orbital shift. Since a white dwarf is a tiny target small bodies do not crash into the star but instead are torn apart by its gravity spinning out disks of rocks that are ground to dust as they orbit very close to the white dwarf.

In about 7 billion years the sun will be a white dwarf. Earth will have either been swallowed by the red giant sun or just thoroughly roasted. Viewed by a distant observer the only hint that a pale blue dot once orbited this dime-a-dozen white dwarf will be a few distinctive spectral lines‚Äîthe blood spatter from a long-dead planetary system.

To this point our story looks like this:

But this is not the end. Five (or maybe six if Earth is lucky) planets will survive to see the sun as a white dwarf.

A Passing Star Triggers a Dynamical Instability Among the Planets

Nothing lasts forever (even cold November rain).

After the sun becomes a white dwarf its planetary system will be almost twice its current size. Not in terms of the number of planets of course (bye-bye inner rocky planets) but in terms of the sizes of the surviving planets‚Äô orbits. The sun will have lost about 40 percent of its mass much of it going to create a beautiful planetary nebula on its way to becoming a white dwarf. The planets‚Äô orbits will widen in response by about 85 percent. Neptune‚Äôs orbit will grow from 30 to about 55 astronomical units marking the outer edge of the planets.

It should be just smooth sailing from here to eternity right? The planets will be on nice nearly circular orbits around a white dwarf. And that pesky inner chaotic part of the solar system will have been swallowed by the sun.

Only one thing could possibly endanger the solar system now: other stars.

Stars only spend a lot of time close to each other when they‚Äôre babies. In their birth clusters stars frequently pass relatively close to each other. (The exact number depends on the size and density of the birth cluster.) Sometimes stars pass so close that their gravity affects what‚Äôs in orbit around each star. For instance a passing star can destabilize the very outermost parts of another star‚Äôs planet-forming disk. And in some cases a passing star can even steal a very wide-orbit planet. (This is a possible origin for the hypothetical Planet 9.)

One model proposes that the orbits of very distant objects in the Kuiper belt were shaped early in solar system history when a star came within a few hundred to a thousand astronomical units of the sun. (It‚Äôs a contentious model.) This is a typical distance for the closest encounter that a star like the sun would experience in a birth cluster like the sun‚Äôs. This encounter may even have been the closest encounter the sun ever underwent at least from its birth to its becoming a white dwarf.

Once their birth clusters dissipate stars generally stay far away from each other. This is just because space is really big. Given the density of stars in the sun‚Äôs neighborhood and how fast they move around we can calculate the typical time it takes for a star to pass within a given distance of the sun. On average another star passes within 10000 astronomical units of the sun every 20 million years or so within 1000 astronomical units every billion years and within 100 astronomical units every 100 billion years.

Let me describe a fantastic 2020 study by Jon Zink Konstantin Batygin and Fred Adams that really improved our understanding of the solar system‚Äôs far future. They performed 10 simulations of the solar system‚Äôs orbital evolution for a trillion years starting from the present day and then following the planets as the sun becomes a red giant then a white dwarf and continues into the distant future. The Big Bang was only 14 billion years old so Zink and colleagues‚Äô simulations stretch to about 70 times the current age of the universe. Each simulation represents a possible future for the solar system. In this case the futures differ mainly in terms of the passages of stars close to the sun and planets.

A planetary system is only strongly affected when a star passes very close-by within three to five times the size of the largest planetary orbit. With Neptune at 30 astronomical units a star would need to pass within about 100 astronomical units to have a strong impact on the present-day solar system. But with Neptune at 55 astronomical units around the white dwarf sun a star passing within about 200 astronomical units will have a strong effect on the planets. Even a flyby at 500 astronomical units gives Neptune a noticeable gravitational kick.

In Zink and his colleagues‚Äô simulations within about 30 billion years a star passed within a few hundred astronomical units triggering a dynamical instability. This will be a much stronger instability than the one that happened early in solar system history because it will include gravitational scattering between Jupiter and Saturn. Instead of relatively gentle spreading of the giant planets‚Äô orbits this will look like the dynamical instabilities that astrophysicists think are commonplace among systems of giant exoplanets (and that often destroy their rocky planets):

This dynamical instability will eject all of the remaining planets but one. The gravitational kicks between planets will give each planet (but one) enough orbital energy to be launched into interstellar space to become free-floating planets. In most of Zink‚Äôs simulations Jupiter was the last planet standing surviving on a stretched-out orbit similar to those of giant exoplanets.

From this point on the solar system will consist simply of the white dwarf sun and Jupiter. This is fitting in an odd way because if we were to search for solar systems around nearby sun-like stars using present-day technology Jupiter is still the only solar system planet that could be detected (for now).

The Close Passage of a Star Strips Away the Sun‚Äôs Last Planet

Just like every rope has a breaking point any planet can be stripped away from its star if another star passes close enough.

At this stage Jupiter the solar system‚Äôs last planet standing will be on a wide stretched-out orbit.

Distant flybys of stars can gently nudge Jupiter toward ejection but the effect of very rare very close encounters is actually what dominates. Zink‚Äôs simulations need to wait about 100 billion years for a star to pass within about 200 astronomical units. The star gives Jupiter the gravitational energy it needs to escape from the white dwarf sun and never come back. (Zink‚Äôs simulations had a range in the timing of the ejection of the last planet standing from about 40 billion years in the future to a little over 300.)

So here are what the last phases of the solar system‚Äôs lifetime will look like:

When all is said and done five or six of the sun‚Äôs eight original planets will still be intact just not in orbit around the sun. Those planets will survive as free-floating or ‚Äúrogue‚Äù planets (the other two or three having been swallowed during the red-giant phase). Of course those planets won‚Äôt be alone: The abundance of free-floating planets will be constantly increasing as many other stars lose their planets to interstellar space.

This marks the end of the solar system. Wraps it all up. I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed its story.

Previous images had shown a part of the Earth and a part of the moon together. But we‚Äôd never seen the Earth and moon as whole worlds in space in the same frame and in color. That‚Äôs until Voyager 1 took this image on today‚Äôs date 45 years ago. Can you imagine how the image affected people at the time? I can because I remember it. It was a stunning revelation and such an incredible photo.

Voyager 1 left Earth on September 5 1977. It lifted off from Cape Canaveral Florida aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket.

It was 7.25 million miles (11.66 million km) from Earth ‚Äì directly above Mount Everest on the night side of the planet ‚Äì when it captured this image.

Voyager 1 and 2: The Grand Tour

Voyagers 1 and 2 were sent into the outer solar system to take advantage of a favorable arrangement of outer planets. It was to be a Grand Tour of our solar system‚Äôs gas giants. Voyager 1 made successful reconnaissance flybys of the planet Jupiter and Saturn and Saturn‚Äôs moon Titan in 1979 and 1980. Voyager 2 also performed flybys of Jupiter and Saturn in 1979 and 1981 as well as the very first and so far only visits to the planets Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989.

Afterwards both Voyagers kept moving outward heading out of the solar system.

Timeline for Voyager 1

On February 17 1998 Voyager 1 reached a distance of 69 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. At that point it overtook Pioneer 10 as the most distant spacecraft from Earth.

On August 25 2012 Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause the boundary at which our sun‚Äôs influence ends thus entering the space between the stars.

As of September 18 2022 Voyager 1 has operated for 45 years and 13 days. The spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return data.

On August 24 2022 the SETI Institute said that its Allen Telescope Array (ATA) in northern California had picked up signs of intelligence. But it wasn‚Äôt aliens. These signs came from NASA‚Äôs Voyager 1 spacecraft the farthest human-made object from Earth. After an upgrade on the ATA SETI tested its new capabilities and was able to to seek and detect Voyager 1‚Äôs carrier signal.

Voyager 1‚Äôs extended mission is expected to continue until around 2025 when its radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments.

Then onward through interstellar space

After the generators fade it will then be moving silently through space with its audio-visual Golden Record on board whose sounds and images were selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

Explaining the Browns' new midfield logo at FirstEnergy Stadium,"An iconic figure in Cleveland sports is finally getting the recognition he deserves.

The Browns have officially made Brownie the Elf the new midfield logo at FirstEnergy Stadium ahead of their home opener against the Jets this Sunday. Brownie was declared the winner of an online poll that let fans pick which logo would be used for home games throughout the 2022 NFL season.

The team unveiled its new field design to fans on Tuesday.

Browns fans will already be very familiar with the longtime mascot. But others might be wondering what is Brownie the Elf exactly?

What is Browns mascot Brownie the Elf?

A ""brownie"" is actually a mythical creature from English and Scottish folklore. It's an elf or fairy that inhabits houses and comes out at night to help out with chores around the place ‚Äî pretty much an ideal roommate.

Brownie has a long and storied history as a symbol of the Browns franchise dating all the way back to the very early years of the team.

Back in the 1940s the newly founded Browns were dominating the All-American Football Conference (an early challenger to the NFL). Owner Arthur McBride was pleased with the success but wanted to improve the team's branding to increase off-field visibility. He asked the citizens of Cleveland to submit mascot logos that would help the team stand out.

After much deliberation McBride chose Brownie the Elf as the team's mascot and the rest is history. No one is sure exactly who came up with the concept and illustration but it's been used on Browns tickets and merchandise ever since.

Brownie has long patrolled the sideline in Cleveland as a costumed mascot but 2022 is the first time he'll be painted on the field itself. The Browns had been the only NFL team without a midfield logo since 2016 when they decided to remove their classic helmet design from the turf.

The move has been met with excitement by the Browns faithful and they'll be hoping to commemorate Brownie's debut at midfield with a win against the Jets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2pldHMtZGVmZWF0LWJyb3ducy0zMS0zMC1vbi1taXJhY2xlLWZpbmlzaC1hZnRlci1iZWluZy1kb3duLTEzLXdpdGgtMi1taW51dGVzLXRvLWdvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets come from behind to win 31-30 over Browns after trailing by 13 with 2 minutes to go,"CLEVELAND ‚Äî After an abysmal performance a week ago the Jets were hoping for better results against the Cleveland Browns in their home opener at FirstEnergy Stadium.

On a sunny 80-degree day the Jets pulled some late-game magic out of their hats nabbing their first win of the season in stunning fashion after trailing by 13 with 1:55 to play.

The Jets defeated the Browns 31-30 after an onside kick by Ashtyn Davis and a Joe Flacco 15-yard pass to Garrett Wilson with 25 seconds left.

They avoid falling to 0-2 for the fourth consecutive season which was tied for the third-longest streak in franchise history. Gang Green had also lost 14 straight games in September coming into Sunday dating back to 2018.

‚ÄúWe are off the snide‚Äù Jets coach Robert Saleh said about the team‚Äôs first win of the season. ‚ÄúI love the way this feels. We have to find a way to stack them up.

‚ÄúThere is a lot of stuff we have to clean up but I‚Äôm just proud of the guys because we didn‚Äôt quit. That‚Äôs probably the biggest thing I‚Äôll take away from it.‚Äù

Joe Flacco who started his second game while quarterback Zach Wilson continues to recover from a meniscus injury completed 26 of 44 passes for 307 yards and four touchdowns.

Two Jet rookies were significant contributors. First-round pick Garrett Wilson led the Jets in receptions as he caught eight passes for 102 yards and two touchdowns and Breece Hall selected in the second round finished with 60 all-purpose yards and a touchdown catch.

Browns quarterback Jacoby Brissett starting for Deshaun Watson as he is serving an 11-game suspension for violating the NFL‚Äôs personal-conduct policy was nearly flawless. He completed 22 of 27 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown.

Browns running back Nick Chubb rushed for 87 yards and three touchdowns on 17 carries. He also had three catches for 26 yards. Wide receiver Amari Cooper torched the Jets defense the entire day recording nine receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown.

‚ÄúWe win as a team we lose as a team‚Äù Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. ‚ÄúWe lost We got beat. Did not play a 60-minute game.

‚ÄúIt is really frustrating‚Äîfrustrating to me to our players in the locker room and I am sure to our fans.

‚ÄúIt is not how we play. We have to finish and do the things that allow you to win games and we didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Chubb‚Äôs 12-yard touchdown run with 1:55 left in the game appeared to put the game on ice at 30-17. But the Jets kept fighting as Corey Davis‚Äô 66-yard touchdown catch cut the Browns lead to 30-24. Then Justin Hardee recovered the onside kick to keep Gang Green alive.

That allowed Flacco and the Jets move the ball down the field. Then on third and 10 Flacco‚Äôs 15-yard pass to Wilson along with Greg Zuerlein‚Äôs extra point gave the Jets a 31-30 lead.

‚ÄúIt was just about executing on the same plays that we hit on early in the game‚Äù Garrett Wilson said. ‚ÄúWe kind of got the same look so just taking advantage of the middle of the field.

‚ÄúIf they give it to us especially during that time in the game we gotta take advantage.‚Äù

Unlike last week when the Jets didn‚Äôt get their first touchdown until 1:01 left in the game against the Ravens the team‚Äôs offense was much more efficient against the Browns.

New York scored 14 points in the first half. The team also had 178 yards and was five of eight on third down conversions. The Jets only converted two first downs in the loss against the Ravens.

The Jets defense kept them in the game during the first half last week. However on Sunday Gang Green‚Äôs defense allowed a touchdown on the Browns‚Äô first possession.

After a Jets‚Äô punt on the opening drive Cleveland drove 90 yards as Nick Chubb scored a four-yard touchdown to give the team an early 7-0 advantage.

However the Jets offense responded as they drove down the field after a fake punt and a throw by Braden Mann to Jeff Smith. Six plays later Gang Green found the end zone on a Flacco touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson.

Cleveland answered right back as they continued to drive down the field without must resistance from the Jets defense. Cooper ended the drive with a 6-yard touchdown that put the Browns up 14-7.

The Jets appeared like they were set to tie the game up in the second quarter but a Jadeveon Clowney strip sack and fumble on the Browns 20-yard-line ended the Jets eight-play 40-yard drive.

However New York‚Äôs offense recovered as it got the ball with 1:05 before halftime. The Jets called six passing plays including a Breece Hall 10-yard touchdown reception that tied the game at 14-14 before halftime.

After the break the Browns retook the lead on a Cade York 22-yard field goal. But the Jets defense played much better to begin the second half. However they allowed three second-half touchdowns.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where it ranks but it is up there‚Äù Flacco said. ‚Äù Look at one point you‚Äôre sitting on the bench and they have the opportunity to run the clock.

‚ÄúYou have to give credit to the guys on the sideline the guys that were in this game. The fact that they just kept believing and kept doing their job this is what happens.‚Äù

Up next for the Jets they will return to MetLife Stadium next Sunday as the Cincinnati Bengals will come to town. The Browns will have a short week as they will host the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM0NjM2NzczL3doby1icm93bmllLWVsZi1zdG9yeS1jbGV2ZWxhbmQtYnJvd25zLW1hc2NvdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who is Brownie the Elf? Inside the rise fall and revival of the Browns' mascot,"Open Extended Reactions

CLEVELAND -- Nobody at least still living knows for sure how Brownie the Elf came to be the first official mascot of the Cleveland Browns some 76 years ago.

Yet one fact is certain: It was Art Modell who put the elf on the shelf after buying the team in 1961.

""My first official act as owner of the Browns"" Modell told newspaper reporters at the time ""will be to get rid of that little f---er.""

Brownie is back -- and bigger than ever.

Topping a preseason online fan vote Brownie has returned as the team's midfield logo an oversized rendition of his original mysterious appearance preceding Cleveland's inaugural season in 1946.

The latest caricature of Brownie spans the 45-yard lines horizontally exceeds the hashmarks vertically and can be easily spotted from airplanes passing overhead.

And if you're bemused about Brownie's existence as an NFL mascot well you're not alone.

""I don't know what to think about it"" Cleveland pass-rusher Myles Garrett said. ""It's original it's unique. But I've always been more of a fan of the dog. I mean we're the Dawg Pound but we've got an elf?

""I think we're a little bit confused on what route we want to go creatively.""

One of the most inexplicable losses in franchise history sullied Brownie's grandiloquent midfield debut on Sunday. Cleveland became the first team in 21 years to blow a 13-point lead in the final two minutes. With 1:55 to play the New York Jets scored a 66-yard touchdown recovered an onside kick then scored another touchdown to stun the Browns 31-30. In another fan poll via 850 ESPN Cleveland more than 5% of voters actually blamed Brownie for the defeat.

Brownie might be 0-1 as Cleveland's midfield logo heading into Thursday night's clash with the Pittsburgh Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET Prime Video). But more than seven decades ago Brownie was the boyish face of pro football's most dominant dynasty. So prolific he very nearly once became the logo on the helmet.

THE LEGEND OF the Brownies began in Britain and dates back to at least the early 16th century. According to John T. Kruse an author and blogger of British fairy lore the first published reference to the Brownies came in 1522.

""He's a small hairy ... creature that lives in houses and farms with people"" Kruse told ESPN of the mythical beings. ""He undertakes a range of domestic and agricultural chores on the understanding that he gets free board and lodging from the humans.""

As Brownie The Elf re-debuts onto the field for @Browns home games we look back at the first time Brownie debuted.



It was the day the Browns played the first game in team history. pic.twitter.com/5l9UaOhcDT ‚Äî Pro Football Hall of Fame (@ProFootballHOF) September 18 2022

Despite their diligence Brownies can be quite finicky.

Kruse noted that Brownies appreciate milk and fresh bread being left out for them at night. But they detest being spied on whether working or eating. And they especially despise both compliments and criticisms.

""Any gift of clothes really antagonizes him. It's seen as an insult or some sort of subjection"" Kruse said. ""The usual result of this is that he'll undo everything he's done make a mess in the house then leave forever.""

The Dobby character in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books is derived from the Brownie legend which began to surface in America in the early 20th Century. In 1916 the Girl Scouts referencing the same Brownie legend started calling their members ages 7-9 ""Brownies"" taken from the story ""The Brownies and Other Tales"" by Juliana Horatia Ewing which was originally published in 1870.

In 1929 the Atlas Beverage Company in Detroit began producing a Brownie caramel cream root beer whose bottles were adorned with an elf. The company soon put a sign advertising the soda on the side of a building in downtown Massillon Ohio.

Off that so the story goes Brownie the Elf was born.

BEFORE PAUL BROWN was winning NFL titles as coach of the Cleveland Browns he was stacking state championships at Massillon High School.

Going into his final season at Massillon in 1940 Brown commissioned a local artist A.D. Small with creating a logo for the Tigers -- Obie (which stands for orange and black Massillon's colors).

After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II Brown was hired to coach Cleveland's new pro football franchise. Owner Mickey McBride and the team held a fan contest to determine the nickname. ""Browns"" was the winning submission in honor of the first coach. Brown initially vetoed it. Another submission -- the ""Panthers"" -- was chosen instead until a local businessman informed the team that he owned the rights to ""Cleveland Panthers."" Brown finally relented on the name ""Browns.""

Next the team needed a logo.

""But what does 'Browns' represent?"" said Browns historian Barry Shuck who's been pursuing the Brownie the Elf origin story for years. ""Mud? A dessert? Dog poop?""

Brownie first appeared in an ad promoting ticket sales days before the Browns‚Äô first game against the Miami Seahawks in 1946. Barry Shuck

Did Brown come up with the idea for Brownie the Elf from that root beer sign in Massillon? And did he again have Small produce the drawing?

""If you look at Obie and you look at Brownie it's the same character"" said Shuck who also writes for the Browns site DawgsByNature.com. ""They're both running. They both got a stiff arm. They're both wearing a hat.""

The Cleveland-area newspapers made no mention of Brownie until he appeared in an ad promoting ticket sales days before the Browns' first game against the Miami Seahawks in 1946.

Steve King a longtime sportswriter in Northeast Ohio who subsequently worked for the Browns from 2004-13 has also spent years digging into Brownie the Elf's conception. He even once asked Paul Brown's son Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown if he knew where Brownie came from (Mike Brown didn't).

Yet through his research King came to the same conclusion as Shuck.

""I'm sure I've gotten as close as anyone was going to get"" King said. ""The truth is buried in a cemetery somewhere -- and I don't know where. ... but the mystery of Brownie is what makes it so cool.""

Did former Cleveland coach Paul Brown come up with the idea for Brownie the Elf after seeing a Brownie caramel cream root beer sign in Massillon Ohio? Barry Shuck

PROPELLED BY PAUL BROWN Otto Graham Lou Groza and yes Brownie the Elf the Cleveland Browns won four consecutive All-America Football Conference titles from 1946-49.

Tommy Flynn an assistant equipment manager would dress up like Brownie on game days and emulate Brown on the sidelines.

""If Paul Brown threw his hands up Tommy Flynn would throw his hands up"" Shuck said. ""If Paul Brown took his hat off and slammed it on the ground Tommy Flynn would take his hat off and slam it on the ground.""

Flynn's antics went away when the Browns joined the NFL in 1950. But Brownie the Elf and Cleveland's winning ways remained. The Browns won another championship in their first season in the NFL.

By 1953 Brown wanted to showcase Brownie even more. He tasked Browns trainer Leo Murphy with putting the Brownie logo on one of Cleveland's orange helmets to see what it would look like.

""Leo finally gets it done and he's all proud"" King said. ""He walks in Paul Brown's office [and] sets it on his desk. But Brown took one look at it and said 'I don't like it. Take it away.'""

Decades later King was visiting Murphy's house in Medina Ohio when Murphy said he had a secret to show him.

""He goes back and brings out this Browns helmet"" King recalled. ""And it's got Brownie the Elf on the side. ... he kept the helmet all those years which was incredible.""

Murphy died in 2018. Whatever became of his Brownie helmet is a mystery as well.

BROWNIE THE ELF appeared on the cover of Cleveland's media guide in 1961 for the final time. Modell bought the team and banished Brownie. A year later the media guide cover featured star running back Jim Brown instead.

But for the following 30-plus years Cleveland Plain-Dealer cartoonist Dick Dugan helped keep Brownie's spirit alive. A reader could tell if the Browns had won or lost just by looking at Dugan's Brownie cartoons.

""My first official act as owner of the Browns will be to get rid of that little f---er."" Former Browns owner Art Modell

""If the Browns won the elf was all proud or whatever"" King said. ""If the Browns lost he looked like he had been beaten up in a fight.""

In 1995 Modell infamously took away the Browns relocating the franchise to Baltimore. But when owner Al Lerner and president Carmen Policy brought the Browns back four years later they reinstated Brownie.

Gradually the legend has returned as well.

Brownie was the team's official training camp logo in 2006. The Brownie sideline mascot made his debut in 2015.

Kevin Stefanski has worn a Brownie the Elf cap almost every day since becoming Cleveland's head coach in 2020. And this year Brownie is on the sleeve of the team's walkthrough jerseys.

Now he's the face of Cleveland's field.

""We won seven championships with the elf?"" Garrett asked. ""If we get an eighth championship with that elf I might come in here with a little elf outfit on."""

According to a statement from the company by the end of next year NCR plans to have completed the separation which is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Following the separation NCR‚Äôs ATM business ‚Äî initially dubbed ‚ÄòATMCo‚Äô ‚Äî will offer a ‚ÄúATM as a service‚Äù to banks and retailers. This company will look to maintain and grow self-service banking ‚Äî currently 70% of its revenues ‚Äî and ATM networks globally as well as explore growth into new markets such as digital currencies.

Meanwhile the digital commerce business ‚Äî CommerceCo ‚Äî will focus on growth opportunities in digital banking as well as retail and hospitality. Approximately 14% of its revenue currently comes from digital banking according to a presentation to investors with the business offering services similar to those from banking tech firms FIS and Fiserv.

NCR chief executive officer Michael Hayford said the business split would allow each arm to focus on growing at scale and innovating in their separate areas. It would also allow the companies to simplify operations and ‚Äúput us in the best position to drive the most competitive products and solutions for our customers‚Äù Hayford added.

Frank Martire executive chairman of NCR‚Äôs board said the decision would allow NCR to ‚Äúaccelerate the pace of transformation by enabling each [company] to execute its own growth strategies and better capture the value-creation opportunities ahead‚Äù.

The decision was reached following a strategic review of the company initiated by the board in February this year.

Georgia-based NCR had received ‚Äúmaterial interest‚Äù from third parties keen to purchase the company as a whole but Martire said market conditions had not allowed for a whole company deal that ‚Äúreflects an appropriate and acceptable value for NCR to our shareholders‚Äù.

However in a presentation to investors the company made it clear that if attractive alternative options became available that would improve upon the separation decision the board would consider them.

The company said it was ‚Äúcontinuing to assess key aspects of CommerceCo and ATMCo including potential cost-saving opportunities management teams boards capital structures and capital return policies‚Äù.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The foundation said that it is moving money into 'movement-building work' but did not provide specifics.

The organization's president Darren Walker said in a statement on September 16 that the charity had come to the decision to shut down the Ford Fellowships at the National Academies program by 2028.

Walker said that there is too much money in racial equity programs and that the group is looking to expand in other areas. He noted that philanthropic support for education is the second highest funding category for philanthropy in the US today.

The program was launched in November 2015 as a way to help to create diversity in in leadership positions in higher education as well as putting money towards academic research.

According to the program's website the fellowships seeks 'to increase the diversity of the nation‚Äôs college and university faculties by increasing their ethnic and racial diversity.'

Walker cited a litany of achievements in his statement including spending nearly $1 billion on the project where he also stated: 'This was a painful sacrifice but a necessary one.'

He added: 'To be clear no one is declaring victory for diversity and equity in higher education‚Äînot in the United States not around the world.'

Walker also said: 'We must hold higher-education institutions accountable for the persistent lack of diversity in tenured and leadership positions despite a robust pipeline of diverse talented scholars.'

In launching the racially sensitive initiative in 2015 Walker said that the foundation felt the need to move away from other areas of academic philanthropy because other charities such as the Gates Foundation were so heavily invested in schemes promoting education.

Walker goes on to make reference to 2020 and the 'the backdrop of America‚Äôs historic reckoning with racial inequality' a likely reference to the Black Lives Matter protests that engulfed the nation following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

The Ford Foundation the charitable arm of the Ford Motor Company was established in 1936 It's headquarters shown here are located in Midtown Manhattan

Just this week the foundation announced it's plan to provide $1 million in order to fight disability discrimination in higher education

He said that those protest and riots led to the foundation seeking 'to further increase our funding for racial justice advocacy across all of our program areas.' Again no specifics were provided about what programs the money will be diverted towards.

The fellowships will continue as normal through 2023 and will welcome fewer and fewer applications until 2028 as part of its sunset plan.

Just this week the foundation announced it's plan to provide $1 million in order to fight disability discrimination in higher education reports Forbes.

The grant was made to the American Association of People with Disabilities.

The Ford Foundation is an independent nonprofit grant-making organization with assets currently valued at $16 billion.

Since 1936 it has worked with people in the areas of social change worldwide 'guided by its mission to strengthen democratic values reduce poverty and injustice promote international cooperation and advance human achievement' the organization says on its website.

It is headquartered in New York and the foundation has offices in Latin America Africa the Middle East and Asia.

Walker became president of the Ford Foundation one of the largest foundations in the U.S. in 2013. He came in with a vision to shape the organization's in part through funding the arts.

To symbolize that mission Walker arranged to sell the foundation‚Äôs art collection of works almost exclusively from white male artists.

Starting in 2017 the collection displayed at the foundation‚Äôs buildings was rebuilt with some 350 works of newer artists many of whom are people of color women and queer people.

Controversially in October 2021 Walker was behind the foundation's decision to divest from fossil fuels.

He said that 'Going forward the foundation says it will invest its energy portfolio in alternative and renewable energy and funds that 'address the threat of climate change and support the transition to a green economy.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlZ2VuZ2xlLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvYXV0b21vdGl2ZS1lbGVjdHJpZmljYXRpb24tZ2V0cy1hLWNoYW5jZS10by1zaGluZS1hdC1uYXNjYXItcmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automotive Electrification Gets A Chance To Shine At Nascar Race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregengle/2022/09/18/automotive-electrification-gets-a-chance-to-shine-at-nascar-race/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlZ2VuZ2xlLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvYXV0b21vdGl2ZS1lbGVjdHJpZmljYXRpb24tZ2V0cy1hLWNoYW5jZS10by1zaGluZS1hdC1uYXNjYXItcmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Max Homa was on the ropes. He had just left his third shot from the bunker at the par-5 18th at the Silverado Resort and Spa North Course short of the green.

His opponent Danny Willett was already one shot ahead and had less than four feet for birdie to seal the win.

The 2022 Fortinet Championship was over.

Until it wasn‚Äôt.

Homa holed his fourth shot from a collection area left of the 18th green‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and then watched as Willett missed his birdie putt and then shockingly missed again this one from about five feet handing the first title of the 2022-23 PGA Tour season to Homa.

Winning is hard.



3 putts from 4 feet and Danny Willett loses by a stroke. pic.twitter.com/mfljIjUAOt ‚Äî PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) September 18 2022

Under these stunning circumstances Homa successfully defended his Fortinet victory from a year ago and started the new season with his fifth career Tour win.

‚ÄúMy coach just said just hang around hang around hang around‚Äù Homa said after the win. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt know last like three minutes are kind of a blur.‚Äù

Willett looked in control for much of Sunday‚Äôs final round. He quickly grabbed the lead from 54-hole leader Justin Lower with three birdies in the first eight holes.

Homa who was tied with Willett through three rounds at 12 under remained steady through the same stretch before pulling even with Willett early on the back nine thanks to three-straight birdies of his own.

Willett took control again on 14 hitting a miraculous second shot which bended some 50 yards around a tree directly in front of him and setting up a birdie giving him a one-stroke advantage which he took to 18.

The Englishman hasn‚Äôt won on the PGA Tour since his dramatic victory at the 2016 Masters.

In that tournament it was Willett who stole the show from Jordan Spieth who seemingly had the major locked up.

This time however it was Homa who took the title and Willett who was left shell-shocked.

‚ÄúI played really good golf I played solid‚Äù Homa said. ‚ÄúDanny and Justin both played great but I just tried to play my game and just see where it got me. I don‚Äôt know it was a wild finish.‚Äù

After holing his fourth Homa looked at his caddie Joe Greiner slowly walked over to him and let out a big scream in jubilation. His final-round 68 put him at 16 under for the tournament.

Willett simply smiled.

‚ÄúI expected him to do it but then it‚Äôs still a bit of a shock when it happens‚Äù Willett said of the moment. ‚ÄúHe played ‚Äî we all played really good today. Like I said bit of a shame to kind of finish how I did.‚Äù

In the end Willett pulled his birdie putt by the hole and did the same on the par putt from slightly farther away both catching the left lip.

‚ÄúI hit it obviously far too hard‚Äù Willett said. ‚ÄúI thought it was straighter ‚Ä¶ just ended up tailing off and missing left. Yeah disappointing way to finish but you know first out of the season like I said to be in contention things are in a good place. Yeah we‚Äôll live to fight another day.‚Äù

Homa kicked off the new PGA Tour season with a win and will take the momentum from Napa ‚Äî plus his T5 finish at the Tour Championship last month ‚Äî into his first team appearance at the Presidents Cup next week in Charlotte.

Homa was the only U.S. team member to tee it up in Napa and the move paid off in the best way possible.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy to be in form to represent my country play with those boys‚Äù Homa said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre some good golfers so I just wanted to come in in form. Honestly I got a lot of people ‚Äî I know this is Twitter but I‚Äôve had a lot of people tell me if the LIV guys wouldn‚Äôt have left I wouldn‚Äôt have made the Presidents Cup team so I had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder this week.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2hlcmUtaXMtdGhlLXByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dC1mb3ItZWFjaC1nb2xmZXItYXQtdGhlLTIwMjItZm9ydGluZXQtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlw0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29sZmRpZ2VzdC5jb20vc3RvcnkvaGVyZS1pcy10aGUtcHJpemUtbW9uZXktcGF5b3V0LWZvci1lYWNoLWdvbGZlci1hdC10aGUtMjAyMi1mb3J0aW5ldC1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's the prize money payout for each golfer at the 2022 Fortinet Championship,Homa the defending champion pulled out a one-shot victory over Danny Willett after holing a chip for birdie on the 72nd hole to close out a four-under 68 and a 16-under 272 total. It didn‚Äôt seem that it would matter too much though as Willett still had a 3¬Ω-foot putt for birdie that would have given him the victory. But Willett proceeded to miss the putt and leave himself with an even longer comebacker. He then missed that six-footer giving Homa the title.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvbWF4LWhvbWEtd2lucy1mb3J0aW5ldC1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shocker: Max Homa defends at Fortinet Championship in stunning fashion,"Max Homa defended his title at the Fortinet Championship in stunning fashion.

Trailing by one stroke on the final hole Homa chipped in for birdie and watched in amazement as leader Danny Willett took three putts from less than 4 feet.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe what I just saw‚Äù Golf Channel announcer Terry Gannon said.

Neither could Homa who closed in 4-under 68 at Silverado Resort‚Äôs North Course in Napa California and signed for a 72-hole total of 16-under 272. It was good enough for his fifth PGA Tour title and third in the Golden State.

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know really know what happened‚Äù Homa said. ‚ÄúThe last three minutes are kind of a blur.‚Äù

On a cool gusty rainy day Willett built a three-stroke lead early in the final round with birdies at Nos. 1 4 and 8 but gave a stroke back with a bogey at the ninth. He pulled ahead again with an incredible birdie at 14 where he hooked his approach from behind a tree to 15 feet and canned the putt. Homa a 31-year-old Cal-Berkeley grad put up a valiant effort to defend his title making three straight birdies beginning at No. 9.

‚ÄúMy coach (Mark Blackburn) said ‚ÄòJust hang around hang around hang around‚Äô ‚Äù Homa recalled.

Homa did just that and when he chipped in for birdie at 18 it forced Willett to hole from inside 4 feet for the trophy.

‚ÄúI spun it and once it hit the pin it almost like spun straight into the ground. It was just one of those things‚Äù Homa said. ‚ÄúGolf‚Äôs a weird game some crazy stuff happens on the last hole it seems like and that was very crazy.‚Äù

It was as clutch as clutch gets and yet it didn‚Äôt appear to be enough until Willett hit his putt for the win too firmly and it lipped out. Willett‚Äôs miss of the 5-foot comebacker was even more shocking and gift-wrapped the trophy to Homa.

‚ÄúThis game never ceases to amaze me‚Äù said Golf Channel‚Äôs Tom Byrum.

Rickie Fowler who tied for sixth secured just his third top-10 finish in his last 59 starts. Making his first Tour start since the 2013 Wyndham Championship a span of 3315 days Paul Haley II finishes T-12.

Homa‚Äôs second shot at the par-5 18th caught the left green side bunker leaving himself an awkward 30-yard shot from the sand.

‚ÄúI kind of had to assume he was going to make it and I kind of went for the hero bunker shot and didn‚Äôt quite catch it‚Äù Homa said.

He exploded 33 feet short of the green before holing out for the eventual winning birdie.

‚ÄúI expected him to do it‚Äù Willett said ‚Äúbut then it‚Äôs still a bit of a shock when it happens.‚Äù

For the week the 34-year-old Englishman had holed more than 96 percent of his putts from inside 10 feet including a clutch 9-foot par putt at 17 to maintain his lead. But his first putt from 4 feet rimmed out on the left side and he faced a longer par putt to force a playoff than his previous attempt. Willett was attempting to win his first PGA Tour title since the 2016 Masters but it wasn‚Äôt to be.

‚ÄúJust a shame how I finished but that‚Äôs golf‚Äù Willett said. ‚ÄúYeah we‚Äôll live to fight another day.‚Äù

Homa heads to his first appearance representing the United States on its 12-man team in next week‚Äôs Presidents Cup a biennial team match-play competition against the world‚Äôs best 12 non-European players with an extra boost of confidence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy to be in form to represent my country play with those boys. They‚Äôre some good golfers so I just wanted to come in in form‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know this is Twitter but I‚Äôve had a lot of people tell me if the LIV guys wouldn‚Äôt have left I wouldn‚Äôt have made the Presidents Cup team so I had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder this week.‚Äù"

A number of businessmen have turned up dead over the past few months as Russians grow increasingly dissatisfied with the drawn-out invasion in Ukraine. Ivan Pechorin a managing director for aviation industry at the Corporation for the Development of the Far East and Arctic on Sept. 12 died after reportedly falling from a speeding boat off the coast of Vladivostok.

Ravil Maganov chairman of Russian oil giant Lukoil died after reportedly falling from the sixth-floor window of a Moscow hospital on Sept. 1. He and his company had urged Putin to end the invasion calling it a ""tragedy."" Lukoil claimed Maganov ""passed away after a severe illness.""

Aleksandr Subbotin a former top manager of Lukoil was found dead in the basement of a Moscow residence in May after he allegedly visited a healer to cure him of hangover symptoms but instead suffered heart failure.

RUSSIA-LINKED WAGNER GROUP RECRUITS RUSSIA CONVICTS AMID FLAGGING TROOP COUNT IN UKRAINE: BRITISH INTELLIGENCE

At least eight other Russian oligarchs have died in strange circumstances over the past few months according to Euro News. International investigators have suggested looking at the deaths as staged suicides or assassinations as retaliation for their opposition to the Ukraine invasion or links to corruption in Russian gas company Gazprom.

Leonid Shulman head of transport service at Gazprom Invest was found dead in February in the run-up to the invasion. Authorities said they found a suicide note beside the executive who reportedly slashed his wrists in the bathroom of his St. Petersburg cottage.

The morning after the invasion started authorities found Alexander Tyulyakov a senior executive at Gazprom‚Äôs Corporate Security hanging in the garage of his home. An unnamed law enforcement source told Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta that Gazprom‚Äôs own security unit had arrived ahead of police.

Rebekah Koffler a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and author of ""Putin‚Äôs Playbook: Russia‚Äôs Secret Plan to Defeat America"" told Fox News Digital at the time of Pechorin‚Äôs death that ""the truth is unlikely to be discovered because Russian investigations cannot be trusted.""

""If this was a hit job it would be made to look exactly like a tragic accident"" Koffler had explained.

She also noted that Russian media ""couldn‚Äôt keep its story straight today on what happened to Maganov"" when he died explaining that the Russian news agencies are mostly controlled or at least influenced by the Russian government.

Pending a vote from the firm‚Äôs more than 10000 partners across 140 countries the split would mean less confrontations with regulators‚Äô restraints along with possible dividends coming the partners‚Äô way many even in the millions.

‚ÄúThe world is changing and we have to adapt to continue to thrive and achieve our full potential while we address the needs of all of our stakeholders‚Äù Nguyet Thu Vu EY‚Äôs director of marketing and communications said in a statement. ‚ÄúHaving carefully considered various options we firmly believe that we can embrace the changing landscape build businesses that redefine the future of our professions create exciting new opportunities and deliver greater long-term value for EY people clients and communities.‚Äù

The move comes amid rising pressure from governments to promote accountability and to avoid conflicts of interest internally and with other big accounting firms. In addition to EY the other United Kingdom-based ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù firms include Deloitte PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG.

After energy company Enron Corp. committed fraud in 2001 Congress pushed for increased oversight of accounting firms. It tasked the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board within the Securities and Exchange Commission to take a closer look at the internal activity of large accounting firms.

A series of high profile fraud cases followed in recent years including construction company Carillion PLC‚Äôs scandal in 2020 and ethics training issues at EY in June.

The other three big firms have not made plans to cut their consulting practice from their accounting companies. Deloitte even refuted news about plans to split its advisory and accounting businesses.

EY provides its services to some of the world‚Äôs most prominent corporations which include Hewlett-Packard Co. Coca-Cola Co. Lockheed Martin Corp. AT&T Inc. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Intel Corp. Walmart Corp. and General Motors Co.

EY establishing its consulting division as a separate company is a tactic to avoid missing out on business from clients that the accounting firm serves. The firm‚Äôs multinational foothold requires corroboration with the individual oversights of domestic and international governments and the split would save time and resources spent meeting these demands.

For all of its benefits the split may end up causing some complications.

It is likely that the new consulting company could go public with an initial public offering that would deliver payouts to partners managing the consulting practice as well as some in the accounting one ‚Äî as much as $8 million and $2 million each respectively.

With most shareholders being past partners within the consulting division the new business needs to exercise care regarding equity distribution. Shareholders would no longer enjoy the unregulated profit gains they did as partners.

Additionally accounting partners may argue that the resources of the whole firm have been responsible for new and future growth in consulting revenue.

EY‚Äôs partner appointments rose 38% between 2020 and 2021 with more partners now than ever.

The voting process will begin as soon as the end of 2022 and could finish in early 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdW5pY29ybnJpb3QubmluamEvMjAyMi9taW5uZWFwb2xpcy1lbmVyZ3ktYmlsbHMtYW5kLXRheGVzLWZ1bmRpbmctdGltLW1pY2hlbHMtcmlnaHQtd2luZy1jYW5kaWRhY3ktaW4td2lzY29uc2luL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minneapolis Energy Bills and Taxes Funding Tim Michels' Right-Wing Candidacy in Wisconsin - UNICORN RIOT,"Minneapolis MN ‚Äì The Michels Corporation headed by Trump-endorsed Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has contracts with the City of Minneapolis and an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy to service gas lines in Minneapolis which raises concerns for residents.

In 2015 Minneapolis resident DeCourcy Squire shut off the gas to her Stevens Square condo stopped paying the Houston based gas conglomerate CenterPoint Energy (CPE) and began using alternative energy to power her home. She had been a tax resister ever since the Vietnam War and after becoming involved with the grassroots group MN350 working to oppose the Line 3 Dakota Access Pipeline she could not in good conscience contribute to the gas company any longer.

Squire told Unicorn Riot that she first learned about Michels Corporation while protesting Line 3 but didn‚Äôt realize they had an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy until recently.

‚ÄúPushing for corporate divestment is very important but I think personal divestment is also a small step towards an alternative future‚Äù Squire said not just referring to alternative energy but also alternative politics free of corporate influence.

The Michels Corporation including its subsidiaries Michels Pipeline Inc Michels Power Inc. Michels Construction Inc. Michels Utility Services Inc. Michels Trenchless Inc. Michels Road and Stone Inc. and Michels Pacific Energy Inc. has become one of the largest utility contractors in North America. Many Twin Cities activists first became aware of them through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction as reported by Unicorn Riot.

Michels currently has three offices in Minnesota their newest being the Brooklyn Park office which opened in 2017 adding to its Lakeville and Rogers sites. According to Michels website their goal is to expand service capabilities in the Midwest.

CenterPoint Energy‚Äôs website lists 27 active projects within Minneapolis alone including Minnehaha Hiawatha Fulton Kenwood and Jordan neighborhoods all using Michels Corporation.

As Transportation Funds Increase So Do Michels‚Äô Revenues

Michels Corp. and Michels Pipeline Construction have involvement in several special interest groups especially three main lobby associations ‚Äî Wisconsin Transportation Building Association Transportation Development Association and Construction Business Group all with the primary aim to increase state transportation funds allowing for more public contract money to flow directly to the Michels Corporation.

In the 2022 election cycle individual employees and immediate family members of Michels Corporation have donated an accumulated $46142 to campaigns with the Republican National Convention (RNC) being the largest recipient of $20000 according to the research group OpenSecrets a national organization that tracks money in elections and its effects on public policy. This amount is far lower than the $134905 the RNC received from Michels affiliates in the 2020 election cycle. Recent campaign donations to Republican congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden and U.S. Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin has also been tracked to individuals from the Michels Corporation in the amounts of $17399 and $4650 respectively.

Wisconsin Right Now a conservative news outlet found that Michels‚Äô involvement in special interest groups with Michels executives serving in lieu of himself has helped the company acquire nearly 1.2 billion dollars in contracts with the state of Wisconsin implying public-private profiteering. The Minneapolis based news site Southwest Voices reported that Michels Corp. has $12.7 million in contracts with the City of Minneapolis since the start of 2020 alone.

While there is no official tie to Michels personally lobbying for increased gas taxes higher registration fees and blocking tax exemptions on gas and diesel fuel sold to school districts it is clear that special interest groups Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association which Michels served as Board President and the Transportation Development Association where Michels served on the executive board have contributed financially to groups fighting to increase the gas tax.

Both the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that if Tim Michels wins the Wisconsin governorship he said he will divest from the Michels Corporation leaving his two brothers in charge. Regardless if Michels becomes Wisconsin‚Äôs next governor his family company and special interest groups will have one of their own at the helm of decisionmaking on government contracts and public utilities spending.

Michels admittedly said that he wants his family to continue seeking state-wide contracts despite obvious political conflicts of interest. The company‚Äôs contracts in just the last five years from the state of Wisconsin exceed $660 million in payments.

Tim Michels‚Äô Right-Wing Gubernatorial Campaign

In 2021 Michels announced his candidacy for governor of Wisconsin. But Wisconsin residents have challenged Michels‚Äô residency pointing to his East Coast homes where he lives much of the year including his seventeen-million-dollar mansion in Connecticut and luxury penthouse on New York City‚Äôs Upper East Side.

Screenshot of Tim Michels from his gubernatorial campaign ad called Tear Down.

In June 2022 former President Trump endorsed Michels who has supported the ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù that Trump won the 2020 election and has suggested he will work to overturn the state‚Äôs 2020 election results if he wins in November. He vowed to abolish the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission which administers and enforces state election laws. Additionally Michels has doubled down in recent cultural wars committing to fight so-called ‚Äòcritical race theory‚Äô (CRT) being taught in public schools abortion and more.

Michels has been outspoken about his anti-abortion stance and says he‚Äôd ban abortion and emergency contraceptives if elected Wisconsin governor. ‚ÄúI believe God is unhappy with the country that allows for the killing of babies‚Äù he said at an event in Calumet County WI.

Polls throughout 2022 consistently had former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch ahead as the favorite in the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial primary by a comfortable margin. Kleefisch is supported by her former boss the past GOP rising star former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. However Michels won the Republican primary on August 9 the day after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago with 47% of the vote beating Kleefisch by five points.

Residents React to the Minneapolis ‚Äì Michels Connection

Residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin are concerned about Michels Corp.‚Äôs ongoing government contracts and its exclusive partnership with CenterPoint Energy which holds a monopoly on natural gas in the Twin Cities. These concerns are becoming intensified now as they become aware of their unwitting contribution to Michels‚Äô campaign.

‚ÄúI wonder if I‚Äôm paying for this unnecessary MPD protection & supporting Tim Michels for governor through my CenterPoint bill or directly to MPD with my property taxes?‚Äù Nikki Carlson who uses the handle @M_Nikki_dUrso tweeted.

Carlson who is a North Minneapolis resident took to Twitter on July 13 to share her encounter with a Michels worker. She observed what she believed was an ineffective use of Minneapolis law enforcement.

‚ÄúI asked the Michels guy why there are so many police squads there. He said to guard their employees while working in ‚Äòthe ghetto.‚Äô‚Äù

He explained MPD protection was a condition of their contract. He said ‚Äúghetto‚Äù to my face.



FYI the contractor replacing the gas lines Michels Construction is based in Wisconsin. Their owner Tim Michels is a right-wing candidate for governor of WI.



/2 ‚Äî Domestic Infant Supply ‚Äô65 (@M_Nikki_dUrso) July 13 2022

North Minneapolis is the historic Black section of the city that has been over-policed and under-resourced for generations activists say.

The Michels‚Äô worker told Carlson that police protection was a condition of their contract. However Michels has been seen working in other parts of the city by residents without police protection.

One person tweeted that Michels‚Äô staff vehicles have far-right bumper stickers on them that make residents feel ‚Äúvery uneasy.‚Äù

Minneapolis residents have also raised concerns about Michels‚Äô hiring practices and worry that the company apparently doesn‚Äôt hire Black people. ‚ÄúWHY is this co. laying pipe in N. Mpls & putting their workers from Wright County in hotels when we have qualified people right here?‚Äù Carlson tweeted.

Minneapolis City Council President Andrea Jenkins has expressed these same concerns in emails. ‚ÄúI share many of the concerns you‚Äôve identified and have brought these issues up with CenterPoint Energy many times‚Ä¶While it is true that our utilities payments support the Michels company no taxpayer dollars support this in fact the utility companies have to pay for permits to the city to do the work.‚Äù

However Michels Corp. has several contracts with the city‚Äôs Public Works Department paid by Minneapolis taxpayers which was reported last month by Southwest Voices.

Although Minneapolis police (MPD) are providing security for Michels while they do work in North Minneapolis cops are being privately paid through its contract with CPE Council Member Jenkins said.

MPD is allowed to wear their city uniforms and drive taxpayer-funded squad cars while working off-duty security jobs for private companies.

However Fox 9 recently found MPD protecting Target and Michels construction crews during their regular shift. ‚ÄúDuring those day shifts Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites.‚Äù

Yup. Not hard to find‚Ä¶ https://t.co/X7SwWAY5XQ pic.twitter.com/VZyoEi2vKC ‚Äî Dimitri Drekonja (@Ddrekonja) September 15 2022

Carlson tweeted that a drunk cop working security for Michels aggressively confronted her and implied that they are indeed being paid by taxpayers. ‚ÄúAngry intoxicated MPD officer just told me it isn‚Äôt about preserving police resources to focus on violent crime it‚Äôs about OVERTIME pay for light duty & I need to STFU. (& everyone but me knows this).‚Äù She reacted ‚ÄúI was naive thinking the objective was public safety.‚Äù

MPD is said to inform contractors in construction when and if they need protection according to a source.

Jenkins added ‚ÄúTo be clear I find the response of the Michels employee to the Northside resident‚Äôs question to be despicable Michels needs to create a more diverse workforce that reflects the communities they serve.‚Äù However the city council president made no commitment to take any action.

One resident who uses the handle @JenAntila tweeted that when their sewer line failed over a decade ago a city public works employee gave them a list of city approved sewer line contractors and said ‚Äú‚ÄòI can‚Äôt recommend anyone but my pen slipped‚Äô Michels was circled. I hired them.‚Äù

Screenshot from Twitter

@JenAntila told Unicorn Riot that it was mid January when her sewer line failed and that Michels did a good job repairing it. But she also regrets her decision after discovering the politics of the company. ‚ÄúI just hate knowing what an a-hole [Tim] Michels is and knowing how much the city and & constituents (like me) bankroll him and have for decades.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese are the same a$$holes that last summer were tearing up forests wet lands & waters in Northern MN to put in another Enbridge pipeline‚Äù tweeted another.

Residents noted the irony of Minneapolis cops calling the city dangerous while the same officers are being used to protect private companies rather than protecting the public.

‚ÄúThese police officers care more about protecting out-of-towners from imaginary danger than protecting their own citizens from real danger‚Äù one user tweeted.

Also residents claim that police have intentionally made the city more dangerous by slowing down their work and threatening not to exit their squad cars while patrolling.

‚ÄúAnd they say they don‚Äôt have staff to patrol/have a constant presence in Dinkytown at night‚Äù tweeted another.

As Trump-endorsed Republican Tim Michels solidifies his conservative ideologies in Wisconsin‚Äôs gubernatorial race it remains unclear to Minneapolis residents just how much they are funding his right-wing campaign steeped in anti-democracy rhetoric simply by paying taxes and their monthly gas bill.

‚ÄúMinnesota‚Äôs energy dollars are supporting a candidate for governor of Wisconsin that wants to ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. He opposes same-sex marriage and all LGBQT rights. Is that what we want? I know I don‚Äôt‚Äù Carlson told Unicorn Riot.

While the exact dollar amount coming from Minneapolis residents into Michels‚Äô campaign cannot be estimated it is apparent that Tim Michels is profiteering from his company‚Äôs contracts with the City of Minneapolis Public Works Department and its exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy helping fund his race ‚Äî with Michels being the largest donor to his campaign at $11940882.25 of the $12 million raised.

Nathaniel Guthrie who goes by the Twitter handle @WoodGhuthriempls suggested boycotting CPE. ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúImagine that Centerpoint energy supports racists. We can‚Äôt be shocked that the cops do but this open cowardice and racism from Michels corporation should be stressed to center point.‚Äù Adding ‚ÄúBe a shame if we all here in ‚Äòthe ghetto‚Äô stopped paying them en masse.‚Äù

Screenshot from Twitter

Unicorn Riot called and emailed several people at CenterPoint Energy for this story. When we asked CenterPoint Energy‚Äôs Director of Communications in Minneapolis Hannah Gullickson if CPE will respond to the numerous residents who object to funding Michels‚Äô right-wing campaign through their gas bills she said she doesn‚Äôt speak to the press and forwarded the message to Ross Corson Senior Communications Specialist. We have not received an immediate response from Corson.

In 2015 Minneapolis resident DeCourcy Squire shut off the gas to her Stevens Square condo stopped paying the Houston based gas conglomerate CenterPoint Energy (CPE) and began using alternative energy to power her home. She had been a tax resister ever since the Vietnam War and after becoming involved with the grassroots group MN350 working to oppose the Line 3 Dakota Access Pipeline she could not in good conscience contribute to the gas company any longer.

Squire told Unicorn Riot that she first learned about Michels Corporation while protesting Line 3 but didn‚Äôt realize they had an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy until recently.

‚ÄúPushing for corporate divestment is very important but I think personal divestment is also a small step towards an alternative future‚Äù Squire said not just referring to alternative energy but also alternative politics free of corporate influence.

The Michels Corporation including its subsidiaries Michels Pipeline Inc Michels Power Inc. Michels Construction Inc. Michels Utility Services Inc. Michels Trenchless Inc. Michels Road and Stone Inc. and Michels Pacific Energy Inc. has become one of the largest utility contractors in North America. Many Twin Cities activists first became aware of them through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction as reported by Unicorn Riot.

Michels currently has three offices in Minnesota their newest being the Brooklyn Park office which opened in 2017 adding to its Lakeville and Rogers sites. According to Michels website their goal is to expand service capabilities in the Midwest.

CenterPoint Energy‚Äôs website lists 27 active projects within Minneapolis alone including Minnehaha Hiawatha Fulton Kenwood and Jordan neighborhoods all using Michels Corporation.

As Transportation Funds Increase So Do Michels‚Äô Revenues

Michels Corp. and Michels Pipeline Construction have involvement in several special interest groups especially three main lobby associations ‚Äî Wisconsin Transportation Building Association Transportation Development Association and Construction Business Group all with the primary aim to increase state transportation funds allowing for more public contract money to flow directly to the Michels Corporation.

In the 2022 election cycle individual employees and immediate family members of Michels Corporation have donated an accumulated $46142 to campaigns with the Republican National Convention (RNC) being the largest recipient of $20000 according to the research group OpenSecrets a national organization that tracks money in elections and its effects on public policy. This amount is far lower than the $134905 the RNC received from Michels affiliates in the 2020 election cycle. Recent campaign donations to Republican congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden and U.S. Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin has also been tracked to individuals from the Michels Corporation in the amounts of $17399 and $4650 respectively.

Wisconsin Right Now a conservative news outlet found that Michels‚Äô involvement in special interest groups with Michels executives serving in lieu of himself has helped the company acquire nearly 1.2 billion dollars in contracts with the state of Wisconsin implying public-private profiteering. The Minneapolis based news site Southwest Voices reported that Michels Corp. has $12.7 million in contracts with the City of Minneapolis since the start of 2020 alone.

While there is no official tie to Michels personally lobbying for increased gas taxes higher registration fees and blocking tax exemptions on gas and diesel fuel sold to school districts it is clear that special interest groups Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association which Michels served as Board President and the Transportation Development Association where Michels served on the executive board have contributed financially to groups fighting to increase the gas tax.

Both the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that if Tim Michels wins the Wisconsin governorship he said he will divest from the Michels Corporation leaving his two brothers in charge. Regardless if Michels becomes Wisconsin‚Äôs next governor his family company and special interest groups will have one of their own at the helm of decisionmaking on government contracts and public utilities spending.

Michels admittedly said that he wants his family to continue seeking state-wide contracts despite obvious political conflicts of interest. The company‚Äôs contracts in just the last five years from the state of Wisconsin exceed $660 million in payments.

Tim Michels‚Äô Right-Wing Gubernatorial Campaign

In 2021 Michels announced his candidacy for governor of Wisconsin. But Wisconsin residents have challenged Michels‚Äô residency pointing to his East Coast homes where he lives much of the year including his seventeen-million-dollar mansion in Connecticut and luxury penthouse on New York City‚Äôs Upper East Side.

Screenshot of Tim Michels from his gubernatorial campaign ad called Tear Down.

In June 2022 former President Trump endorsed Michels who has supported the ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù that Trump won the 2020 election and has suggested he will work to overturn the state‚Äôs 2020 election results if he wins in November. He vowed to abolish the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission which administers and enforces state election laws. Additionally Michels has doubled down in recent cultural wars committing to fight so-called ‚Äòcritical race theory‚Äô (CRT) being taught in public schools abortion and more.

Michels has been outspoken about his anti-abortion stance and says he‚Äôd ban abortion and emergency contraceptives if elected Wisconsin governor. ‚ÄúI believe God is unhappy with the country that allows for the killing of babies‚Äù he said at an event in Calumet County WI.

Polls throughout 2022 consistently had former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch ahead as the favorite in the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial primary by a comfortable margin. Kleefisch is supported by her former boss the past GOP rising star former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. However Michels won the Republican primary on August 9 the day after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago with 47% of the vote beating Kleefisch by five points.

Residents React to the Minneapolis ‚Äì Michels Connection

Residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin are concerned about Michels Corp.‚Äôs ongoing government contracts and its exclusive partnership with CenterPoint Energy which holds a monopoly on natural gas in the Twin Cities. These concerns are becoming intensified now as they become aware of their unwitting contribution to Michels‚Äô campaign.

‚ÄúI wonder if I‚Äôm paying for this unnecessary MPD protection & supporting Tim Michels for governor through my CenterPoint bill or directly to MPD with my property taxes?‚Äù Nikki Carlson who uses the handle @M_Nikki_dUrso tweeted.

Carlson who is a North Minneapolis resident took to Twitter on July 13 to share her encounter with a Michels worker. She observed what she believed was an ineffective use of Minneapolis law enforcement.

‚ÄúI asked the Michels guy why there are so many police squads there. He said to guard their employees while working in ‚Äòthe ghetto.‚Äô‚Äù

He explained MPD protection was a condition of their contract. He said ‚Äúghetto‚Äù to my face.



FYI the contractor replacing the gas lines Michels Construction is based in Wisconsin. Their owner Tim Michels is a right-wing candidate for governor of WI.



/2 ‚Äî Domestic Infant Supply ‚Äô65 (@M_Nikki_dUrso) July 13 2022

North Minneapolis is the historic Black section of the city that has been over-policed and under-resourced for generations activists say.

The Michels‚Äô worker told Carlson that police protection was a condition of their contract. However Michels has been seen working in other parts of the city by residents without police protection.

One person tweeted that Michels‚Äô staff vehicles have far-right bumper stickers on them that make residents feel ‚Äúvery uneasy.‚Äù

Minneapolis residents have also raised concerns about Michels‚Äô hiring practices and worry that the company apparently doesn‚Äôt hire Black people. ‚ÄúWHY is this co. laying pipe in N. Mpls & putting their workers from Wright County in hotels when we have qualified people right here?‚Äù Carlson tweeted.

Minneapolis City Council President Andrea Jenkins has expressed these same concerns in emails. ‚ÄúI share many of the concerns you‚Äôve identified and have brought these issues up with CenterPoint Energy many times‚Ä¶While it is true that our utilities payments support the Michels company no taxpayer dollars support this in fact the utility companies have to pay for permits to the city to do the work.‚Äù

However Michels Corp. has several contracts with the city‚Äôs Public Works Department paid by Minneapolis taxpayers which was reported last month by Southwest Voices.

Although Minneapolis police (MPD) are providing security for Michels while they do work in North Minneapolis cops are being privately paid through its contract with CPE Council Member Jenkins said.

MPD is allowed to wear their city uniforms and drive taxpayer-funded squad cars while working off-duty security jobs for private companies.

However Fox 9 recently found MPD protecting Target and Michels construction crews during their regular shift. ‚ÄúDuring those day shifts Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites.‚Äù

‚ÄúDuring those day shifts Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites‚Äù



Yup. Not hard to find‚Ä¶ https://t.co/X7SwWAY5XQ pic.twitter.com/VZyoEi2vKC ‚Äî Dimitri Drekonja (@Ddrekonja) September 15 2022

Carlson tweeted that a drunk cop working security for Michels aggressively confronted her and implied that they are indeed being paid by taxpayers. ‚ÄúAngry intoxicated MPD officer just told me it isn‚Äôt about preserving police resources to focus on violent crime it‚Äôs about OVERTIME pay for light duty & I need to STFU. (& everyone but me knows this).‚Äù She reacted ‚ÄúI was naive thinking the objective was public safety.‚Äù

MPD is said to inform contractors in construction when and if they need protection according to a source.

Jenkins added ‚ÄúTo be clear I find the response of the Michels employee to the Northside resident‚Äôs question to be despicable Michels needs to create a more diverse workforce that reflects the communities they serve.‚Äù However the city council president made no commitment to take any action.

One resident who uses the handle @JenAntila tweeted that when their sewer line failed over a decade ago a city public works employee gave them a list of city approved sewer line contractors and said ‚Äú‚ÄòI can‚Äôt recommend anyone but my pen slipped‚Äô Michels was circled. I hired them.‚Äù

Screenshot from Twitter

@JenAntila told Unicorn Riot that it was mid January when her sewer line failed and that Michels did a good job repairing it. But she also regrets her decision after discovering the politics of the company. ‚ÄúI just hate knowing what an a-hole [Tim] Michels is and knowing how much the city and & constituents (like me) bankroll him and have for decades.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese are the same a$$holes that last summer were tearing up forests wet lands & waters in Northern MN to put in another Enbridge pipeline‚Äù tweeted another.

Residents noted the irony of Minneapolis cops calling the city dangerous while the same officers are being used to protect private companies rather than protecting the public.

‚ÄúThese police officers care more about protecting out-of-towners from imaginary danger than protecting their own citizens from real danger‚Äù one user tweeted.

Also residents claim that police have intentionally made the city more dangerous by slowing down their work and threatening not to exit their squad cars while patrolling.

‚ÄúAnd they say they don‚Äôt have staff to patrol/have a constant presence in Dinkytown at night‚Äù tweeted another.

As Trump-endorsed Republican Tim Michels solidifies his conservative ideologies in Wisconsin‚Äôs gubernatorial race it remains unclear to Minneapolis residents just how much they are funding his right-wing campaign steeped in anti-democracy rhetoric simply by paying taxes and their monthly gas bill.

‚ÄúMinnesota‚Äôs energy dollars are supporting a candidate for governor of Wisconsin that wants to ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. He opposes same-sex marriage and all LGBQT rights. Is that what we want? I know I don‚Äôt‚Äù Carlson told Unicorn Riot.

While the exact dollar amount coming from Minneapolis residents into Michels‚Äô campaign cannot be estimated it is apparent that Tim Michels is profiteering from his company‚Äôs contracts with the City of Minneapolis Public Works Department and its exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy helping fund his race ‚Äî with Michels being the largest donor to his campaign at $11940882.25 of the $12 million raised.

Nathaniel Guthrie who goes by the Twitter handle @WoodGhuthriempls suggested boycotting CPE. ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúImagine that Centerpoint energy supports racists. We can‚Äôt be shocked that the cops do but this open cowardice and racism from Michels corporation should be stressed to center point.‚Äù Adding ‚ÄúBe a shame if we all here in ‚Äòthe ghetto‚Äô stopped paying them en masse.‚Äù

Screenshot from Twitter

Unicorn Riot called and emailed several people at CenterPoint Energy for this story. When we asked CenterPoint Energy‚Äôs Director of Communications in Minneapolis Hannah Gullickson if CPE will respond to the numerous residents who object to funding Michels‚Äô right-wing campaign through their gas bills she said she doesn‚Äôt speak to the press and forwarded the message to Ross Corson Senior Communications Specialist. We have not received an immediate response from Corson.

Winner: Enduro

Garmin Enduro vs Enduro 2: Design

If you place both the Enduro and Enduro 2 watches side by side it won‚Äôt be too obvious how these watches differ. Apart from the colour finish both devices look pretty much identical. Still design isn‚Äôt just about appearance. The touch and feel are also important factors and weight and thickness can change things drastically here.

When it comes to size the Enduro 2 is slightly thicker to accommodate a bigger battery (which we‚Äôll talk about later) coming in at 15.6mm thick while the original Enduro measures 14.9mm thick so it's not even a full millimetre‚Äôs difference.

""The titanium version of the first Enduro model was even lighter coming in 61g ‚Äì almost 10g lighter than the Enduro 2."" (Image credit: Future)

There‚Äôs a similar theme happening in the weight department too. The Enduro 2 weighs in at 70g which is pretty light for a smartwatch thanks to the lightweight materials used for its construction (e.g. titanium). However the titanium version of the first Enduro model was even lighter coming in 61g ‚Äì almost 10g lighter.

This is likely again down to the bigger battery so at least there is a good reason for it. Still 10g is pretty significant for a watch as it‚Äôs a weight difference you‚Äôre likely to feel on the wrist. [Editor's note: all stats above are case-only]

The Enduro 2 Power Sapphire glass meaning it not only has a solar panel built into the perimeter of the display to give it extra power when out and about but it‚Äôs also made from a sapphire crystal which is incredibly scratch resistant against knocks and drops.

The original The Enduro has the same solar tech but is made instead from Gorilla Glass which isn‚Äôt as durable as sapphire but is less reflective meaning it‚Äôs slightly easier to read in environments where there‚Äôs direct light. So whether giving up the ruggedness of sapphire for a more readable display is worth it or not will come down to personal preference.

Winner: Enduro

Garmin Enduro vs Enduro 2: Performance and features

Both Enduro devices have the same goal: rugged outdoor fitness. However the newer Enduro 2 has been given a few upgrades by Garmin to give it that edge over its predecessor while offering users something new. Let‚Äôs get into what these main differences are.

One of the biggest differences between the two flagship watches is the updated user interface. Not only is this a little different from the Enduro 2 but it's actually a touch interface that you can interact with by prodding with your finger and swiping around. Yes there are buttons and the touch interface can be disabled if you prefer to use only them but the option is there at least - unlike with the original Enduro which is limited to button control only.

Another big difference between the two watches‚Äô feature sets is maps and navigation. Enduro 2 features built-in maps in the form of TopoActive Mapping meaning that you can navigate around without needing a tethered phone and internet connection in tow. It‚Äôs a very powerful feature and allows you to set waypoints and create turn-by-turn directions. The Enduro however doesn‚Äôt tout this feature. While it does have breadcrumb mapping (basically a blank map with a line demonstrating where you‚Äôve been and want to go) it severely lacking in the navigation department.

""The Enduro 2 features built-in maps meaning you can navigate without needing a tethered phone and internet connection in tow."" (Image credit: Matt Kollat/T3)

Accuracy is another area where the Enduro 2 really excels thanks to its multi-band GPS tech which means it can access several GPS satellite systems at once making it super accurate. The original Enduro on the other hand makes use of Garmin's older GPS chipset and so isn‚Äôt quite as accurate but is still pretty darn good.

Battery life is one of the most important factors when splashing out on a new smartwatch so how does that fare between the two Enduro models?

The Enduro 2 can track up to 150 hours of GPS activity with solar enabled. By comparison the Enduro offers just 80 hours in the same mode. While the latter should still be suitable for most people using the watch for standard activities like marathon running or regular-distance triathlons the latest device would be better suited to those doing ultramarathons or those without access to charging points for a prolonged time between activities.

However quite sneakily the original Endro‚Äôs battery does outperform its successor when it comes to standby time and smartwatch modes for example when you‚Äôre not tracking activities - lasting up to 50 days. The Enduro 2? Just 34 days. Relatively a month is still a very long time so it‚Äôs not really a massive deal in the scheme of things. As before it all comes down to preference and which watch you opt for depends on how you plan to use it.

WINNER: Enduro 2

Garmin Enduro vs Enduro 2: Verdict

The original Enduro won more rounds in our head-to-head battle.

This is mostly because it offers a very similar user experience and set of features to its successor but at a much lower price point. So unless you‚Äôre an avid ultramarathon runner with the need for near-perfect accuracy and longer GPS-powered battery life ‚Äì or in desperate need of advanced mapping tools ‚Äì you probably don‚Äôt need to invest in the latest and greatest Enduro model. Yet anyway we're sure prices will drop eventually.

While this can be exciting it can also leave students feeling overwhelmed anxious and depressed.

Often away from home and their previous support systems it‚Äôs not uncommon for college students to struggle with their mental health and these issues are increasing.

That's where services like Bemidji State University's Student Health and Counseling Services come in providing students resources and support to help with their mental health.

A recent study part of the Healthy Minds Network which analyzes mental health trends among college populations found that around 60% of students in the past year met the criteria for one or more mental health problems. This is a near 50% increase from when the study began in 2013.

‚ÄúAs students are returning to school we know there‚Äôs an increase in anxiety‚Äù said Kirsten Craft clinical manager and behavioral health specialist with Sanford Health. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stressful being away from your family especially for newer students.‚Äù

Now alongside the usual adjustments college students across the country have also faced the added stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years.

‚ÄúThe volumes (of mental health calls) have increased greatly from the pandemic‚Äù Craft said ‚Äúand now as we‚Äôre getting further into it reintegration back into communities and what people used to do is increasing some of those anxieties.‚Äù

For college students in particular the last two years have been unusual. The sudden transition to online learning and now the transition back to in-person classes has left many students facing additional and unexpected stress.

‚ÄúThere are the typical challenges but now this group of students had this period of time with online learning. Now they‚Äôre in the middle of two transitions: back to in-person and going to college‚Äù said Jennifer Fraik a nurse practitioner at BSU.

BSU which participated in the Healthy Minds Network survey thanks to the work of Associate Professor of Psychology Dr. Sarah Cronin now has its own numbers regarding student mental health.

Among just BSU students in 2021 32% scored positively on an anxiety screening and 37% screened positive for depression while 49% have at one point in their life received a mental health diagnosis.

With numbers like these growing the importance of discussing mental health with college students and providing them with access to resources and treatment has also increased.

‚ÄúHuge adjustments can bring out bigger stressors and those stressors can release more mental health symptoms than normal‚Äù said Amanda Gartner a mental health counselor at BSU. ‚ÄúWe really do push for destigmatizing mental health. Everyone is welcome (to seek help) no symptom is too small.‚Äù

Signs someone might be struggling

Recognizing potential signs of mental health difficulties is key but it‚Äôs important to remember that mental health presents differently in each individual. Something that‚Äôs unusual for one person could be typical for another.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so individual every person presents with different things"" Fraik explained. ""Some people present with body symptoms and come to see me for a lack of appetite stomach pain inability to eat or sleep.‚Äù

Sometimes when a student approaches Fraik with these concerns the conversation starts to reveal causes that might be more related to the student‚Äôs mental health.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I usually introduce the idea that it might be helpful to talk to one of our counselors and talk about any anxieties you might have or whatever symptoms we uncovered on the medical side‚Äù Fraik said.

While stress and mental health worries might express themselves physically for some people for other people signs might take a different form like withdrawing socially or being easily irritable.

‚ÄúEspecially if people are feeling more depressed (a sign could be) withdrawing from things they would normally do irritability is often a common one we see‚Äù Gartner shared. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to be angry than to feel sad or anxious or maybe you‚Äôre so tired of holding it all together that suddenly you‚Äôre snapping at everyone.‚Äù

Significant changes in behavior and mood can be a sign that someone is struggling with their mental health and these can be difficult to recognize even for the individual going through them.

ADVERTISEMENT

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also this group that is very concerned that their issues aren‚Äôt severe enough for help. You see that especially with students on the perfectionist side because they are high achievers‚Äù Gartner explained. ‚ÄúIt can still be helpful to come and see us. Sometimes we have to break through that personal stigma as well.‚Äù

Recognizing these signs and deciding to seek help can be challenging but it can be the first step toward helping alleviate and manage any mental health concerns.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not on a continuum as compared to everyone else. You‚Äôre on your own continuum‚Äù Fraik said. ‚ÄúOur goal is to help people early when they‚Äôre starting to find out that they‚Äôre struggling a little bit with whatever it is in life.‚Äù

Seeking help

After noticing that someone is struggling talking with them about it is the next step. Gartner explained that it‚Äôs important to validate their feelings and see if they would be willing to go to a counselor or other professional.

‚ÄúGet their foot in the doorway into medical counseling it doesn‚Äôt really matter ‚Äî whatever they‚Äôre willing to do‚Äù Gartner said.

While these conversations might be uncomfortable at first there are resources available on how to have them. Craft who works with a local mobile crisis line emphasized that anyone is welcome to call even if it‚Äôs a parent looking for advice on how to talk about mental health with their child.

‚ÄúNormalizing that experience of how tough it must be for them (is important) and exploring it with them‚Äù Craft said. ‚ÄúAsking 'If you can‚Äôt talk to me would you like me to find someone you can talk to?'‚Äù

Knowing the resources available locally is also helpful to bring into those conversations.

‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre in a depressed state to find those resources so to have those easily available can be really helpful‚Äù Craft explained.

For college students most campuses have some form of counseling available. There are also off-campus resources that those offices can direct students to.

In Bemidji BSU and Northwest Technical College have counseling and health services which can provide individual and group counseling medication management and a number of other services. They can also help students access off-campus care set up insurance plans and find other resources.

The local mobile crisis line (800) 422-0045 is also available for anyone to call. This line can be reached by someone in an active crisis someone looking for advice or a list of resources or someone reaching out worried about a friend or family member.

As students return to school their mental health and well-being should be a priority. It‚Äôs normal for individuals of any age in a stressful situation to have difficulties and discussing and addressing these concerns can help keep them from growing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to talk about it"" Fraik said. ""No matter what the topic is it's important that we take care of it.‚Äù

As Bed Bath & Beyond goes through a seismic downsizing its Philadelphia-area footprint is shrinking too.

At the end of August the company announced that it would close about 150 ‚Äúlower-producing‚Äù stores but a list of the first 56 stores slated for closure was only released this week.

The only Pennsylvania location so far is the Bed Bath & Beyond at the Wynnewood Shopping Center where the store currently occupies 61030 square feet of retail space. The rest of the company‚Äôs closures are concentrated in the Midwest New York and New Jersey although none yet in South Jersey. The closest store is in Manalapan Township in Monmouth County.

The company did not respond to requests for comment about how quickly their business will wind down or the number of employees affected. A Bed Bath & Beyond spokesperson would only say that the store would be shuttered ‚Äúin the coming months‚Äù and that locations in King of Prussia and Jenkintown would remain.

Retail experts say that the Wynnewood Shopping Center‚Äôs landlord Federal Realty Investment Trust will have no difficulty finding another tenant in that location.

‚ÄúThis is a sizable vacancy on the Main Line which doesn‚Äôt happen that often‚Äù said Steven Gartner executive vice president of retail services with CBRE. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often a good thing for shopping centers when a tenant that might not be relevant goes away. This is one of those do-overs that landlords get in tight real estate markets.‚Äù

Federal Realty Investment Trust did not return requests for comment.

Bed Bath & Beyond has experienced extreme turbulence in recent months as its stock plunged it announced mass store closures and a 20% reduction in staff. The company‚Äôs struggles turned even more tragic a couple of days after the announced downsizing when chief financial officer Gustavo Arnal leapt to his death from a Manhattan high rise.

Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs troubles arrive amid an uncertain time in the retail industry. In Center City the marquee Walnut and Chestnut Street corridors are still in flux after the pandemic drove a substantial amount of shopping online.

But some big box retailers like Target Macy‚Äôs and Kohl‚Äôs are performing strongly. In high-end suburban areas like Philadelphia‚Äôs Main Line retail sales have remained strong. That‚Äôs partly because the square footage available has not changed substantially as new development tends to be scarce in wealthy inner-ring suburban areas.

‚ÄúMain Line retail remains extremely desirable and competitive for a few reasons‚Äù Gartner said. ‚ÄúVery high barriers to entry there‚Äôs virtually no development sites so properties like Wynnewood Shopping Center remain highly desirable.‚Äù

The Wynnewood retail hub dates to the 1950s during the postwar boom when the number of American suburban shopping centers exploded from eight in 1946 to 4000 in 1960. It marked the first of John Wanamaker‚Äôs department stores to open outside the central city. Today Bed Bath & Beyond occupies the space where Wanamakers once was.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aGNhcmVpdG5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW56L2ludGVyb3BlcmFiaWxpdHktaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1iZXR0ZXItY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LWJldHRlci1wYXRpZW50LWNhcmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interoperability in healthcare: better connectivity for better patient care,"Improving interoperability in healthcare will enhance the services delivered by clinicians ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. It delivers secure access and integration of electronic health data so it can be used to optimise health outcomes. By bringing together patient information from multiple trusted sources healthcare providers and patients will have greater visibility of accurate information that leads to better decisions which in turn leads to better outcomes.

The importance of interoperability in healthcare has been clear for some time ‚Äì and is only gaining importance in Australia and around the world.

Australia is continually working towards open data policies that create an environment for interoperability and use of data assets as a national resource. However although progress has been made there are still obstacles in the way of connected care.

These obstacles are complex and varied but include how to best manage unstructured patient data and content and how to integrate data from multiple EHR systems. Additionally healthcare organisations are challenged with integrating new solutions with existing software solutions or legacy systems as well as addressing clinician and staff resistance to adopting new solutions into existing workflows. While these barriers need to be overcome one thing is clear: Access to crucial patient content must be improved if we are to meet tomorrow‚Äôs standard of patient care.

The ONC Health Interoperability Outcomes 2030 survey found consensus among providers that interoperability is a top priority with goals of integrating patient data from inside and outside the system and combining clinical and administrative data to support patient care and business applications. This is a view that is widely reflected in Australia as well as around the globe.

The industry has backed this interest with significant investment: The global healthcare interoperability solutions market ‚Äì at $2.9 billion in 2021 ‚Äì is projected to reach $5.7 billion by 2026 according to Markets and Markets forecast for Healthcare Interoperability Solutions.

The 2022 State of Connected Care Survey conducted by HIMSS Market Insights details that healthcare leaders are looking to implement interoperability improvements. The survey found that 67% of respondents are currently using piloting or planning to integrate point-of-care imaging and workflows. While this is a step in the right direction the fundamental issue remains ‚Äì information is often stored in siloes and interoperability can only be achieved with enterprise solutions like Vendor Neutral Archives (VNA) that can store data in its original format. Access to medical images and patient records enhances clinician ability to make informed decisions for improved patient outcomes.

Why is interoperability in healthcare important?

Patient information like all information in the global datasphere is exploding. The driving force for this is the proliferation of capture devices (like mobile phones) and the sophistication of video and jpeg formats. The total volume of patient data is growing in terms of total volume but it is also becoming more complex diverse and larger. More information can provide deeper insights but it also creates challenges in securely ingesting sorting normalising classifying and analysing it to make it useful in a timely manner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9odW1hbi1yZXNvdXJjZS9tb3JlLWJvc3Nlcy1hcmUtc3B5aW5nLW9uLXF1aWV0LXF1aXR0ZXJzLWl0LWNvdWxkLWJhY2tmaXJlLTExNjYzMzk3MTkwOTAwLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlL21vcmUtYm9zc2VzLWFyZS1zcHlpbmctb24tcXVpZXQtcXVpdHRlcnMtaXQtY291bGQtYmFja2ZpcmUvYW1wLTExNjYzMzk3MTkwOTAwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More bosses are spying on quiet quitters. It could backfire | Mint,"In the battle against ‚Äúquiet quitting"" and other obstacles to productivity in the workplace companies are increasingly turning to an array of sophisticated tools to watch and analyze how employees do their jobs. The sobering news for America‚Äôs bosses: These technologies can fall short of their promises and even be counterproductive.

Patchy evidence for the effectiveness of workplace monitoring tech hasn‚Äôt stopped it from sweeping through U.S. companies over the past 2¬Ω years. Since the start of the pandemic one in three medium-to-large U.S. companies has adopted some kind of worker surveillance system and the total fraction using such systems is now two in three says Brian Kropp vice president of HR research at Gartner. While there is a broad spectrum of how these systems work and what data they gather many of them include constant monitoring of nearly everything workers do on their devices.

That is a pace of adoption that is rare in the history of technology‚Äîeven at the steepest part of the curve of its embrace by Americans not even the smartphone spread as quickly. This technological shift is particularly jarring for white collar workers who have tended to have greater leeway in their work practices than blue-collar workers who have to punch time clocks.

In changing the very nature of work how it is perceived by those doing it and what companies can expect of workers this shift has the potential to represent a profound unbalancing of the power between employee and employer say those who study it and even some within the industry who create it.

Intra-office surveillance capitalism

By law what data employers can gather on employees is extraordinarily broad. There is software that can take a screenshot of a worker‚Äôs computer every 10 minutes while also recording what apps and websites that worker visited and how long she stayed. Critics of this kind of monitoring have nicknamed these systems ‚Äúbossware"" and deride them as a new form of morale-eroding micromanagement like having your manager look over your shoulder at every moment of the day.

Gathering this much data about what a worker does all day generally requires what are called ‚Äúagent-based"" systems in which a piece of software is installed on a company-issued device. Such systems can have complete access to everything that happens on a computer tablet or phone. (This is not incidentally how the most sophisticated forms of spyware used by nation-states capture data from the devices of targets.) Examples of this kind of software include ActivTrak and Teramind.

‚ÄúRealistically the vast majority of customers don‚Äôt find the need to enable full monitoring on all users all the time"" says Isaac Kohen vice president of research and development at Teramind. The company‚Äôs software is designed to automatically record or flag user behavior if an employee does something untoward such as emailing company secrets to a competitor or spending all day on Facebook. But it is entirely up to employers how to use the system and what rules to establish. ‚ÄúUnfortunately due to the nature of Teramind the system can be abused if placed in the wrong hands"" he adds.

ActivTrak says on its website that it has ‚Äúevolved from an employee monitoring tool to a privacy-conscious powerful productivity platform."" This means its software now includes privacy controls and anonymized aggregated data says a company spokeswoman. Unlike similar tools ActivTrak does not support keystroke logging camera access video recording or email reading or counting she adds.

At the other end of the spectrum are systems that are more familiar to office workers such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365. These gather data but deliberately limit how much and what kind. Both allow a senior administrator in an organization with appropriate privileges to see which applications within these systems an employee uses and how often but may obscure the employee‚Äôs identity and offer data only over a period of weeks not days or hours. For some services more detailed data like how many messages or emails are sent and when can be extracted. Notably however these systems aren‚Äôt capable of the all-encompassing tracking that agent-based ones do. They can‚Äôt track every keystroke or take screenshots of a worker‚Äôs device for example.

Microsoft has taken pains to make employee-level data and activity within its apps difficult even for IT administrators to access says a company spokesman. Microsoft does not believe that activity is the same thing as productivity and organizations should be careful about tracking the wrong kinds of things in order to assess employee performance he adds.

Companies like Prodoscore take the data common business applications gather and parse it in ways that the makers of those applications generally don‚Äôt. David Powell president of Prodoscore says the line that marks where ‚Äúcreepy"" employee monitoring begins and ends is this: All of the data Prodoscore uses is already gathered by the cloud-based software suites companies use and is available through APIs which are connection points for software.

Even with this limited data Prodoscore can create for bosses an incredibly detailed breakdown of precisely what Prodoscore-connected services an employee is using when and whether from the office or outside it. The company‚Äôs software can even chart that worker‚Äôs productivity across time digesting it all into a single score which Mr. Powell compares to a credit report but for work. While the service is intended to help bosses recognize exceptional effort in some employees and to coach others whose productivity may be falling below their historical average this level of data could be misused if a manager were to be overly reliant on it.

‚ÄúWe think of it like a gun"" says Mr. Powell. ‚ÄúIt can be used for good or bad.""

Fierce debate about usefulness

For a relatively complicated and potentially intrusive technology to be so heartily embraced by so many company leaders you would think there would be overwhelming evidence that it delivers on its promises. But there is no independent peer-reviewed research showing that it does say Antonio Aloisi and Valerio De Stefano professors who recently combed the literature on this subject for their book ‚ÄúYour Boss Is an Algorithm"" about the growing phenomenon of management by software.

‚ÄúThere is definitely no study pointing out that this increases productivity in any meaningful way"" says Dr. Aloisi who is based in Madrid.

Ben Waber is president of Humanyze a company that uses data to assess organizational health over long periods of time without allowing managers to track individual employees. He says that systems focused on quantifying things like when an individual employee is sitting at their desk and how many emails they send every day should be viewed with extreme skepticism. ‚ÄúThere is no research showing that those kinds of things have any correlation with any outcome that employers care about"" adds Mr. Waber.

Adrian Reece principal data scientist at Prodoscore says that the academic literature on productivity monitoring tools is divided into two camps. One finds that such tools increase accountability at work and can help people set and track their progress toward goals. The other camp argues these tools are ethically dubious inequitable and lead to a feeling of low personal agencywhich can decrease productivity.

Systems that simply track whether workers are logged in and at their desks and ding them for not being connected can cause workers increased stress according to a number of studies says Dr. De Stefano.

For example one 2020 survey of 2100 call center workers across seven companies found that more intensive monitoring of workers‚Äîincluding recording keystrokes and tracking online activity‚Äîwas associated with increased stress lower job satisfaction higher absenteeism and more desire to quit.

In a 2020 survey of more than 2000 of its members the UK‚Äôs Trade Union Council found that 56% said the introduction of new worker monitoring systems had damaged trust between workers and employers.

There is also evidence adds Dr. De Stefano that introducing these systems can encourage users to game the systems themselves rather than doing their actual jobs.

The price of working from home

In some ways what‚Äôs going on here is that companies are conducting a gigantic research experiment on their employees without necessarily being equipped to understand the data their worker-surveillance systems produce. Only about one in three medium-to-large companies has an analytics and data science team capable of parsing the kind of data these systems spit out says Mr. Kropp of Gartner.

However employees feel about increased monitoring of how they do their work they may not have much choice about it as more companies make working from home contingent on employee acceptance of monitoring. One Prodoscore client that recently shifted to remote work specified that employees who wanted to work from home had to use Prodoscore says Mr. Powell. In the first month 80% of the company‚Äôs employees or 3200 of them opted in he adds.

After tasting premiership success in 1972 and 1973 the Sea Eagles beat the Parramatta Eels 13-10 on September 18 1976 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

It was Parramatta's first grand final appearance after entering the first grade premiership in 1947 with Manly.

Parramatta scored two tries to one in the grand final but Manly's experience and and class saw them capture their third premiership victory in five years.

Former Manly player and Kangaroo Frank Stanton claimed his first premiership victory with Sea Eagles captain Bob Fulton capturing his third premiership title alongside Graham Eadie Ian Martin and Terry Randall.

It was a fitting way to send Fulton off in his final game for Manly.

A group at Sorbonne University in Paris simulated PET/MRI imaging with a 90% reduction in injected F-18 FDG radiotracer dose in patients with cognitive impairment. The images remained reliable for differentiating Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia according to the findings.

""The ultralow-dose protocol offers a possibility of substantial reduction in ionizing radiation exposure"" wrote medical physicist Marine Soret PhD and colleagues.

In the last five years PET technology has improved significantly with hybrid PET/MRI scanners offering increased axial field of views that result in higher sensitivity. For brain F-18 FDG-PET/MRI reducing total PET acquisition time (and thus radiation exposure by F-18 FDG) is limited by MRI however which usually requires an image acquisition time of 20 minutes or more.

Thus the researchers suggest that increasing PET acquisition time to match that of MRI allows the dose of F-18 FDG radiotracer to be decreased. In previous work the group has shown that radiotracer activity can be reduced to 1 MBq/kg versus standard 2 MBq/kg without significantly degrading image quality. In this feasibility study they aimed to reduce injected F-18 FDG activity by 10-fold.

The authors used a previously validated method to simulate a 0.2 MBq/kg dose of injected FDG. Essentially they reconstructed a second set of images from data acquired during the first two minutes of the standard PET/MRI scan (Signa PET/MRI GE Healthcare) with the scanner's parameters optimized by physicists to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio.

The researchers then compared imaging from the simulated ultralow-dose PET/MRI protocol with imaging from the standard protocol in 50 patients with cognitive impairment. They compared visual analyses of the methods by three experienced physicians.

The physician readers classified F-18 FDG PET patterns into seven categories: normal (N) nonevaluable (NE) Alzheimer's disease (AD) logopenic variant progressive primary aphasia (lvPPA) posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) semantic variant progressive primary aphasia (svPPA) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Based on a consensus reading of images with standard F-18 FDG dose amount exams were visually normal in 16 patients and suggestive of Alzheimer's disease in 15 svPPA in six FTD in eight and lvPPA or PCA in five.

According to the findings intraoperator agreement between standard-dose FDG (2 MBq/kg) and ultralow-dose FDG (0.2 MBq/kg) for visually classifying patients into the seven categories was almost perfect in one rater and substantial in the other two (‚â• 0.71) over the whole group.

In addition group comparisons of radiotracer uptake between the 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease and eight patients with frontotemporal dementia on successive scans using both methods generated very similar results the authors wrote. As expected uptake ratios were significantly decreased in Alzheimer's disease compared with FTD in the parietal precuneus and lateral occipital cortices (p < 0.005).

The researchers concluded that performing 20-minute brain PET/MRI with F-18 FDG activity reduced to as low as 0.2 MBq/kg is feasible without compromising quantitative measurements.

""It does not change either imaging diagnosis in patients with clear regional anomalies"" the researchers wrote of the protocol.

Ultimately this was a feasibility study showing that an ultralow-dose protocol involving a 90% reduction of F-18 FDG injected activity did not significantly modify assessments of brain PET/MR images. This suggests that an activity as low as 0.2 MBq/kg may be sufficient for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from FTD the group wrote.

Reducing the injected dose of F-18 FDG can significantly reduce radiopharmaceutical costs in a department performing a lot of FDG-PET scans as well as improve radiation protection for young patients undergoing repeated scans the authors wrote.

Based on these results they recommend injecting 1-2 MBq/kg (70-140 MBq) for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders to guarantee a precise diagnosis and reserving the ultralow-dose protocol for subsequent scans.

""The ultralow-dose protocol offers a possibility of substantial reduction in ionizing radiation exposure but should be reserved for the differential diagnosis or follow-up in patients with severe cognitive impairment or dementia"" Soret and colleagues concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NuZXdzdGhpc3dlZWsuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2dlcy1qb2huLWYtd2VsY2gtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1jZW50cmUtaW4tYmVuZ2FsdXJ1LWNvbXBsZXRlcy0yMi15ZWFycy1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAXZodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzbmV3c3RoaXN3ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9nZXMtam9obi1mLXdlbGNoLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktY2VudHJlLWluLWJlbmdhbHVydS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtMjIteWVhcnMtaW4taW5kaWEv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GE‚Äôs John F Welch Technology Centre in Bengaluru completes 22 years in India,"Bengaluru September 17 2022: With a unique multi-disciplinary ecosystem that fosters innovation GE‚Äôs John F Welch Technology Centre in Bengaluru completes 22 years in India today.

Ms. Moore 15 scrolled TikTok‚Äôs app until she found two videos: one explaining how to ask teachers for a recommendation letter and the other showing a template for one. Both had been made by teachers and were easier to understand than a Google search result or YouTube video said Ms. Moore who is planning to talk to her teachers this month.

TikTok is known for its viral dance videos and pop music. But for Generation Z the video app is increasingly a search engine too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvZ29vZ2xlLXNlYXJjaC10aWt0b2stZ2VuLXovMTAzNjEyMzMwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok is the new Google: Young people get search results from TikTok,"When Ashley Storino wants a new pair of black boots or book recommendations she knows what gets results ‚Äì and it isn‚Äôt Google.

No blue links for this 22-year-old digital marketer. Rather than wade through pages of search results she opens TikTok instead quickly scans video after video and checks the comments to make sure she can trust the content. Only when she knows precisely what she‚Äôs looking for does she turn to Google first.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I want to find the best mascara. Before I used to look it up on Google and those results would feature articles and blogs with top 10 lists or top lists. As someone who has worked in marketing and PR I know a lot of these lists are often if not always influenced by outside parties or brands trying to get products in an article‚Äù Storino said.

‚ÄúNow I turn to TikTok to get honest reviews from real people. I can look up a brand of mascara or 'best mascara' and there are all of these people who have done reviews and can speak to the product. It‚Äôs much more relatable and you know who‚Äôs telling you the information. And then you can go into the comments section and see if the same information is reinforced.‚Äù

Is TikTok becoming the new Google?

A growing number of young people are using the short-form video app better known for dance moves and viral high jinks the way others use Google to find a new lunch spot or a film to watch plan a weekend getaway or update their wardrobe.

They also rely on TikTok for questions that used to be Google's bread-and-butter such as health tips or a skin care regimen.

‚ÄúConsumers are switching to social media specifically TikTok because it feels more authentic‚Äù said Jenna Drenten associate professor of marketing at Loyola University Chicago. ‚ÄúGoogle feels incredibly overwhelming in today‚Äôs internet economy. It‚Äôs just inundated with content.‚Äù

TikTok is taking on Google as a search engine

A Google commissioned study of U.S. users ages 18 to 24 found that nearly 40% use TikTok or Instagram to search online.

‚ÄúWe keep learning over and over again that new internet users don‚Äôt have the expectations and the mindset that we have become accustomed to‚Äù Prabhakar Raghavan who runs Google‚Äôs knowledge and information organization said in 2022 at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference.

Google under heavy antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe has an incentive to point out the rising competition. ‚ÄúYou know none of us were talking about TikTok three years ago"" Sundar Pichai CEO of Google parent Alphabet said at Vox Media‚Äôs Code conference in 2022.

Google has more than 90% market share and isn't likely to get toppled. Whereas TikTok can be an inspirational place to find a Halloween costume or ideas for your fall wardrobe Google is the fastest way to look up a news article or get directions to the post office.

Google spokesperson Mallory De Leon said the company‚Äôs research ‚Äúdid not find that they are using TikTok instead of Google but often in addition to.""

Teens and young adults prefer TikTok because it's more visual and authentic

These changing habits among teens and young adults signal a generational sea change says Natalie Pennington an assistant professor of communication at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.

With many videos less than a minute long ‚ÄúI can consume that information and move on quickly‚Äù Pennington said.

‚ÄúThere's a very visual component to it‚Äù she added.

Pennington turned to TikTok when she was searching for a travel bag that would fit Spirit Airlines‚Äô personal item dimensions.

‚ÄúIt was fantastic‚Äù she said. ‚Äú(I could) see it and see people load the bag versus a Google search where someone would be like ‚Äòthis is the best bag.‚Äô‚Äù

Social media apps like TikTok and Instagram also give users the ability to interact with content creators with comments questions and likes.

‚ÄúIt's a pretty social process which people can gain a lot of gratification‚Äù said Yini Zhang an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo‚Äôs Department of Communication.

Karishma Jashani relies on the internet for all sorts of questions: Where should she go for date night? How will a certain makeup brand look on her skin tone? What‚Äôs a good salad recipe?

But instead of typing her queries into a traditional search engine Jashani turns to social media. The 26-year-old content creator said she goes to Google for less than 30% of her searches now reserving it for ‚Äúserious‚Äù matters like maps and news.

For most everything else she opens TikTok.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so much more effective‚Äù said Jashani who is based in Singapore. ‚ÄúIt's just faster to get information rather than navigating through multiple sources‚Äù on Google.

Unlike Google TikTok has a feeling of immediacy Jashani says.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so bite-sized‚Äù she told USA TODAY. ‚ÄúWith Google it‚Äôs more static where you just have to scroll through a bunch of text.‚Äù

But should you trust TikTok?

Zhang noted that apps like TikTok and Instagram have an advantage by sourcing from dozens of users ‚Äì ‚Äúaverage people from all corners of society‚Äù ‚Äì instead of a few large websites or media outlets.

While that can help broadcast more diverse voices it can also lead to lower quality results. Zhang warned that turning to social media for information could be a hotbed for misinformation and disinformation.

TikTok increasingly markets itself as a place for people to learn. TikTok last month began testing a new feature that highlights keywords in the comment section that brings users to search results for the term. Earlier this year it launched an ad campaign #TikTokTaughtMe that launched the slogan ""there is no limit to the knowledge that can be discovered on TikTok.‚Äù

Yet users mostly teens and young adults routinely encounter false or misleading claims when they search for information on TikTok according to a NewsGuard study.

Almost 20% of searches Newsguard sampled on news topics such as COVID-19 vaccines and the Russian invasion of Ukraine contained misinformation NewsGuard found.

‚ÄúTikTok ‚Äì whose library of user-generated videos can be easily searched by typing in keywords in its search bar ‚Äì repeatedly delivered videos containing false claims in the first 20 results often within the first five‚Äù the NewsGuard report said. ‚ÄúGoogle by comparison provided higher-quality and less-polarizing results with far less misinformation.‚Äù

Viral TikToks can be dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers that a hack to keep avocados fresh longer by putting them in an airtight container filled with water inside the refrigerator could make people seriously ill.

‚ÄúI do see a lot of downsides related to this trend particularly with TikTok which is such an algorithmically driven platform‚Äù Zhang said. ‚ÄúIt's difficult for people to spot misinformation and disinformation.‚Äù

While many internet users have been trained on how to spot trusted sources on google ‚Äì websites with a .edu or .gov tag for example ‚Äì the same rules don‚Äôt apply to social media.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more entertaining than informative‚Äù Zhang said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvd2lsbGlhbWFycnVkYS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3BlcnNvbmFsLWJyYW5kaW5nLWFuZC10aGUtbmV3LXdvcmxkLW9mLXdvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Personal Branding And The New World Of Work,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2022/09/18/personal-branding-and-the-new-world-of-work/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvd2lsbGlhbWFycnVkYS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L3BlcnNvbmFsLWJyYW5kaW5nLWFuZC10aGUtbmV3LXdvcmxkLW9mLXdvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL21zaS10ZWFzZXMtbmV4dC1nZW4taW50ZWwtejc5MC1tb3RoZXJib2FyZC1sYXVuY2gtZm9yLTI3dGgtc2VwdGVtYmVyL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL21zaS10ZWFzZXMtbmV4dC1nZW4taW50ZWwtejc5MC1tb3RoZXJib2FyZC1sYXVuY2gtZm9yLTI3dGgtc2VwdGVtYmVyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI Teases Next-Gen Intel Z790 Motherboard Launch For 27th September,"MSI has teased the launch of its next-generation Intel Z790 chipset-powered motherboards for 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs later this month.

MSI Z790 Motherboards For Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs Teased To Launch Later This Month

MSI has tweeted about its next virtual product launch event ""The Next Playground - Reframed"" which will take place on 27th September at 9:20 AM (Pacific Daylight Time). This means we are about 10 days away from the launch of the upcoming products. The teaser image shows four upcoming motherboards that will be part of the Z790 family and will support Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs.

https://twitter.com/msigaming/status/1571484518380605445

The motherboards include the MSI MAG MPG and MEG series products such as the MEG Z790 ACE MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi MPG Z790 EDGE WiFi Force and the MAG Z790 Tomahawk. MSI has already teased its next-gen MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi a few weeks back which we covered here. The silhouette of this motherboard reveals some interesting new design choices. Of course the MSI Z790 motherboards will have been offering brand new features over the Z690 lineup.

Intel 13th Gen 'Raptor Lake' CPUs LGA 1700 Platform

Intel is sticking with its LGA 1700 platform for at least one more CPU lineup and that's Raptor Lake. Chipzilla confirmed that Raptor Lake CPUs will be compatible with the existing LGA 1700 boards based on the 600-series chipset. But like each generation motherboard makers will be offering a brand new lineup of motherboards based on the 700-series chipset which will come with higher I/O lanes. In addition to that Raptor Lake chips will be supporting DDR5-5600 speeds which is a nice bump over the native DDR5-5200 speeds that Alder Lake supports.

The Z790 chipset will offer 20 PCIe Gen 4 & 8 PCIe Gen 3 lanes while the CPUs will feature 16 PCIe Gen 5 and 4 PCIe Gen 4 lanes. We know that the motherboard maker will have a few products which will split the x16 discrete graphics card lanes with an x4 PCIe Gen 5 M.2 slot. Intel won't have native PCIe Gen 5 M.2 support till 14th Gen Meteor Lake chips.

This offers a nice upgrade path to users who are currently running a mainstream Core i3 or Core i5 CPU and want to upgrade to a higher-end chip. They can simply replace their existing 12th Gen CPU with a higher-end Core i7 or Core i9 SKU which will increase the overall performance of their PC.

One potential byproduct of this phenomenon is that influencers might become a great deal more influential than they are right now since around 47% of Gen Z said that they trusted them while making purchasing decisions.With all of that having been said and now out of the way it is important to note that Baby Boomers are far less likely to trust influencers. Only about 9% of them follow influencer accounts. Conversely 55% of baby boomers followed retail social media accounts with only 35% of Gen Z doing the same.However the most widely followed category of social media accounts by far is that of brands. 52% of Gen Z 59% of Millennials 51% of Gen X and 39% of Baby Boomers stated that they followed accounts belonging to brands.In the world of influencers the numbers are less stellar but they are still quite high as far as the younger demographics are concerned. 41% of Millennials said that they followed accounts belonging to influencers. 41% of Gen X also stated the same and that means that the current influx of investment into the influencer economy has nowhere to go but up.The influencer market is expected to rise to just shy of $5 billion this year or $4.99 billion to be precise. That represents a solid 27.8% increase from the $3.9 billion that was seen in 2021 and current predictions estimate that there will be double digit annual growth over the next two years as well.Influencers are becoming an increasingly central component of marketing strategies. Developing parasocial relationships with younger buyers is essential for driving a continued growth in sales as well a revenue and that is something that marketing professionals should keep in mind. If the current growth predictions hold out influencer marketing could become far bigger in a couple of years.H/T: Klarna Read next: 24% of Gen Z Willing to Pay to Get Rid of Ads

Highland's Lockheed Martin and the other major defense manufacturers located there are constructing weapons key to turning around the war in Ukraine say military generals and other experts.

And Camden population 10300 is working to shore up a dwindling downtown and other amenities to maintain the area's most important industry -- the launchers missiles and defense weapons built by 2800 workers at Highland.

Lockheed's HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) made in Camden has ""been key to the turnaround in Ukraine no doubt about it"" said retired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark of Little Rock in an interview last week .

The former NATO Supreme Allied Commander now strategic adviser still has working ties to Ukraine. He had just returned from the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv.

HIMARS serves as ""a substitute for the Ukrainian Air Force"" Clark said. The missiles are satellite guided with a 200-pound explosive warhead that travels about 50 miles he said. It's accurate within about 10 feet military experts say.

""It's a very easy-to-use system usually mounted on a truck"" Clark said. ""It does what is called 'Shoot and Scoot.' It's very hard for the enemy to take out in advance. It's also able to get away after the rocket is fired.""

The artillery rocket system is built only at Lockheed's installation in south Arkansas according to Aaron Huckaby site director of Lockheed's Camden operations.

Military leaders including Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have appeared in international news reports in recent weeks applauding the HIMARS successes in Ukraine. HIMARS-launched missiles by last month had struck more than 400 Russian targets according to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Ukranian defense authorities have said the weapon has far exceeded expectations. It's been instrumental in reclaiming 1158 square miles of formerly Russian-occupied territory.

The attention has spilled over to HIMARS' builders in Arkansas and Camden as its city of origin.

A CBS ""Sunday Morning"" broadcast Sept. 4 talked about the weapon's production in rural south Arkansas. Politico a politics and policy news website on Sept. 9 examined Camden and Highland Industrial Park in a magazine-length article ""The Struggling Arkansas Town That Helped Stop Russia in Its Tracks.""

Two top military officials -- William LaPlante undersecretary for defense and Assistant Secretary of the Army Doug Bush -- visited Highland and Lockheed Martin late last month for an announcement regarding HIMARS and Lockheed's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS.

""We have received nearly $400 million to replenish HIMARS and GMLRS"" in defense department stockpiles LaPlante said according to a Camden News newspaper report. ""In addition we are planning nearly $200 million to expand and accelerate production...""

LaPlante and Bush also thanked Lockheed workers for the ""impact their efforts are having on the battlefield"" in Ukraine.

When Ramona Crain a real estate agent in Camden read the Politico article she was ""very pleased"" at the attention for the Camden area and its defense contractor industry.

""I had known by hearing around town that some of the industries were producing weapons for the fight in Ukraine"" she said. ""I am proud of their contribution. Many hard-working individuals are contributing to the success of these plants.""

Still Crain was surprised in some ways at all the recognition. The defense manufacturers don't get talked about a lot in Camden she said. And someone driving through the city wouldn't necessarily know the giant installation is a few miles outside.

""They're like a quiet group of defense industries that are doing a good job"" she said.

OUT OF THE CONVERSATION

Travel northeast from Camden on U.S. 79 Business cross the Ouachita River and rural countryside and -- at about East Camden population 798 -- turn onto U.S. 278 then Arkansas 274 to motor into Highland Industrial Park's 18780 acres.

At the entrance pass a hulking orange-and-tan billboard advertising the industrial park's 25-plus tenants.

Among the largest: Lockheed Martin -- ""We never forget who we're working for;"" Aerojet Rocketdyne; General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems; Raytheon Missiles and Defense.

A white-and-blue Lockheed building sits alongside the billboard across from the Highland Industrial Park administrative building.

The park also includes SAU Tech community college which trains workers including engineers and Arkansas' state fire and police training academies.

Most tenants according to John Schaffitzel the industrial park's president feed the defense industry.

Recent national attention on the Lockheed Martin Camden workforce ""has been nice"" site director Huckaby said in a digital interview .

His company which occupies more than 2000 acres at Highland has built more than 550 HIMARS ""from ground up -- truck chassis launcher that can fire various munitions"" he said. ""Some other sub-components are produced by our supply base. We have a number of suppliers across Arkansas and the nation.""

Ukraine has 16 HIMARS systems and wants more according to news accounts. The Pentagon announced plans last month to build 500. Lockheed doesn't divulge the HIMARS system's cost.

Huckaby said he like many employers worries about workforce development and retention. He wants to be more creative in identifying skilled and diverse talent while attracting and retaining the best.

Like many other companies at Highland Park Lockheed works four 10-hour days Monday through Thursday unless overtime is required. That helps workers who drive in from El Dorado Hot Springs Arkadelphia and other areas to work at the plants.

Pay and benefits are a big attraction.

Lockheed ranked the nation's largest defense contractor describes its pay only as ""competitive and fair."" Camden business leaders guess the lowest starting salary at $15 per hour with pay for engineers and other senior and highly trained staff climbing into ""six figures.""

Benefits surpass many Arkansas employers they say.

In addition to health insurance and a retirement plan Lockheed awards tuition assistance of $7500 to $12500 per year and up to four weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave according to a company spokesman.

Huckaby would like to see the Camden area offer workers better quality day care schools housing and other amenities which are issues his employees talk about ""on an ongoing basis.""

When he meets with state business and government leaders he sees ""a lot of momentum"" around growth in Northwest Arkansas and the Little Rock-Central Arkansas area. ""I think South Arkansas is missing from that conversation in a lot of ways"" he said.

Still Lockheed Camden has ""a healthy business and a healthy backlog"" Huckaby said. The company in June 2019 announced a $142 million investment in its Camden operation.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY

Defense contractors Lockheed Aerojet and others have built defense department weapons near Camden for decades.

Highland Industrial Park privately owned traces its history back to World War II as a U.S. Navy installation.

World-War-II era buildings still huddle close to high-tech factories. The site contains about 640 earth-covered munitions storage bunkers from its military days according to industrial park officials. They're handy for use by missile manufacturers.

After the Navy's Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot shut down in the late 1950s the Brown family of Texas bought 25000 acres Schaffitzel said. Highland Resources Inc. a subsidiary of Brown Engineering has operated the industrial park since 1968 he said.

Years ago Camden residents say it wasn't too difficult to get inside the defense industries at Highland Industrial Park if they had business there. But stepped-up security has made access more difficult. Lockheed and Aerojet declined Arkansas Democrat-Gazette requests to come inside their plants.

Defense manufacturing plants at Highland today sit behind individual wire-topped fences and guardhouses.

Lockheed and Aerojet are the largest tenants each with more than 1000 employees according to company spokesmen.

Aerojet's Camden operation on almost 2000 acres produces 75000 solid rocket motors a year to power defense systems including the Javelin Stinger Patriot Missile and other missile defense and tactical systems according to a company spokeswoman.

General Dynamics builds air-to-ground rockets and warheads. Raytheon constructs components for Navy missiles.

The Arkansas Economic Development Commission lists aerospace and aviation which includes defense industries as Arkansas' No. 1 export. The commission's website also describes Highland as one of the nation's ""fastest growing defense corridors.""

But unlike Walmart Tyson Foods JB Hunt Trucking and Dillard's Highland Industrial Park is hardly a familiar name across the state.

Asked how well-known is the Camden-area installation that builds launchers missiles and other military weapons Schaffitzel who has been on his job almost a year said he isn't sure.

""Is it highly known?"" he said. ""I don't know that they [defense contractors] want it to be highly known.""

Although state business and economic development officials know the industrial park well more widely it ""has been kind of a well-kept secret"" said James Lee Silliman executive director of the Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation.

""I don't know if that's by design.""

CAMDEN COMEBACK?

Decorative banners in downtown Camden recall the days of steamboats on the Quachita River.

Nearby a new mural on a renovated apartment building shouts rockets missiles and defense workers.

Camden settled in the early 1800s was a paper mill town for decades until International Paper Co. closed here in 2001. Now residents say it's a city that ""builds bombs.""

By all accounts the Camden area struggles with the same problems of other communities in the rural South and Midwest: declining population worries about access to education opportunities good-paying jobs medical care amenities.

Camden's defense workers are ""very important to the economy. They're transferring in buying homes settling in helping us build our community"" said Tammy George principal broker at Century 21 Campbell & Company.

She sees ""recent development and improvements in our downtown area new retail and restaurants. We're really pleased to see some growth.""

Still she doesn't know of any new homes currently under construction. And she remembers Camden in the 1970s nearly 50% larger with a population of about 15000 boasting stores such as Watts J.C. Penney Montgomery Ward Bealls and Gibson's that are gone now.

Lockheed's Huckaby said Camden's evolution may look better to those who have moved in more recently. The past 10 years have shown ""increases in the amenities and downtown"" residents tell him.

Highland Park's Schaffitzel said he pitches quality of life in the river city.

""The energy in downtown Camden is pretty amazing"" he said. ""They have First Friday events that draw 2000 or 3000 out in the streets."" He points to new restaurants like the Postmasters Grill in an historic renovated post office building.

'BOOM MODE'

Jim Golden who owns Jim Golden Ford in Camden counts on business from the defense companies and their workers. He also sees deeper inside the local military weapons industry than most residents as president of the Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development board.

In Golden's view ""the economy is fantastic in Camden right now due to the influx of aerospace jobs. It is very very good for Camden and very very good for this business. A lot of people work out there they buy vehicles from me I service their vehicles.""

""If it wasn't for these industrial plants this Ford place probably wouldn't be here"" he said. ""Or if it was it would be very small.""

Silliman Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation's executive director believes the area's military weapons builders are ""in a boom mode. The companies are all busy right now and have been. I can only speculate that a lot of the inventories will be replenished. It sounds like there's going to be steady production for a while"" he said.

Meanwhile attention on Camden's defense weapons industry and the city itself is mostly encouraging said many interviewed.

Clark whose family moved to Little Rock from Chicago when he was a child said defense industries chose Camden and Arkansas for good reasons.

After defense contractors were forced to shrink their operations at the end of the Cold War ""these companies decided where the best places were to concentrate their manufacturing. Camden fit the bill based on high-quality workforce and low cost"" he said.

""This is representative of the best of Arkansas"" Clark said. ""We have a lot of high-quality people here. They're stable love their families work hard and pay attention to what they're doing.""

Ford dealership owner Golden says that when foreign governments say they're grateful to Arkansas for life-saving weapons produced at Camden he's ""really proud"" of where he lives.

Defense plant workers and other area residents ""realize they're doing something special"" Golden said. ""They do.""

Here's why employers wage a 'constant battle' to hire.,"Electric Boat is hiring welders as fast as the submarine manufacturer can find them. Highland Park Market is looking for entry-level supermarket workers. And during blistering heat spells this summer broken air conditioners went without repairs for lack of technicians.

In Connecticut and across the U.S. employers in nearly all industries are scrambling to find workers who quit during the pandemic retired or are stymied by a lack of transportation and day care.

‚ÄúEveryone is out hiring‚Äù said Cathy White director of talent acquisition at Electric Boat. ‚ÄúCompetition is fierce for skilled labor.‚Äù

The subsidiary of General Dynamics Corp. faces U.S. Navy deadlines to manufacture two nuclear submarines a year in addition to the start of production of its next-generation Columbia class setting a pace only imagined a few years ago.

Electric Boat with shipyards in Groton and Quonset Point Rhode Island expects to hire 500 welders this year at starting pay of nearly $22 an hour White said. Hiring managers use various strategies such as ‚Äúwalk-in Wednesday‚Äù sessions at the company‚Äôs employment office; job fairs; outreach to high schools technical schools and colleges; and appearances at events such as Military Appreciation Day in New London in August a summer boat festival in Hartford and the Travelers Championship in June.

Timothy Devanney one of the owners of Highland Park Market which operates three supermarkets in Farmington Glastonbury and Manchester said hiring is a ‚Äúconstant battle.‚Äù

Ten applicants will respond to one job posting and managers will reach four. Two will come to the interview and one will be hired. It‚Äôs a ‚Äú50-50 shot‚Äù if the successful job-seeker shows up for work he said.

Highland Park Market which closed two hours earlier at 7 p.m. during the pandemic has kept the reduced hours due the labor shortage Devanney said.

Stop & Shop which said it‚Äôs hiring for all departments shifts and jobs scheduled a hiring fair in August to fill more than 400 permanent part-time e-commerce and store jobs including positions in the bakery deli grocery seafood and produce departments. The supermarket chain hired 185 part-time workers for its Connecticut stores as a result of the job fair. Openings remain for overnight shifts cashiers porters baggers and home shoppers.

Police departments too are grappling with shortages brought on by retirements and difficulty finding candidates said John Ventura chief of the Wallingford Police Department. ‚ÄúPeople are not going into law enforcement. It‚Äôs not an attractive landing pad for people‚Äù he said.

Employment opportunities that once drew 500 to 1000 prospective candidates now attract fewer than a dozen Ventura said.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday 113000 job openings in Connecticut in July forcing employers to figure out how to find workers or get around shortages by offering more overtime and cutting hours of operation. Nationally 11.2 million open jobs in July increased from 11 million in June.

The number of job openings is 41% higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic when available jobs in Connecticut didn‚Äôt exceed 80000 said Patrick Flaherty director of research at the state Department of Labor.

The state Department of Labor reported 77800 unemployed workers in August or 35200 fewer than the number of job postings. In comparison in pre-pandemic 2019 68700 jobless workers outnumbered 65000 open jobs.

‚ÄúThis is both a Connecticut issue and a national issue‚Äù Flaherty said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately some people in the labor force before the pandemic have not returned. Some died. Some were sick with COVID.‚Äù

Economist Donald Klepper-Smith cautioned against reading too much into the job openings data published by federal officials. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought on significant changes to the economy he said: shortages of labor and supplies high inflation after years of price stability and an abrupt change in work as employees operate from their homes.

‚ÄúPeople try to explain in simple terms there are more jobs than people‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of extrapolation with that. It‚Äôs a squishy number.‚Äù

The sectors with the greatest number of of open jobs are health care and social assistance retail manufacturing and finance and insurance according to Connecticut‚Äôs Help Wanted Online Data Series.

Worker shortages are so acute in the heating ventilating and air conditioning business that employers have a ‚Äúvery hard time‚Äù taking on new customers said Stillman Jordan government affairs chairman of the Connecticut Heating and Cooling Contractors Association.

Columbia Manufacturing Inc. can‚Äôt find experienced welders and instead hires young workers it trains on the job. Pictured here from left welders Isaiah Hutchins and Gustavo Sanchez build parts for a B-52 inside the Columbia plant in Columbia Connecticut. (Courant file photo)

At peak demand during this summer‚Äôs heat waves air conditioning repair workers couldn‚Äôt be found he said.

Rob Friedland chief executive officer of Columbia Manufacturing Inc. which makes turbine engine components said welders and inspectors with aviation experience are the hardest workers to find.

He‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty much abandoned hope‚Äù of finding experienced welders and instead hires young workers who are trained at the manufacturer in Columbia after completing their schooling he said.

Friedland said a shortage of welders who are in demand in numerous industries such as construction and manufacturing will get worse as commercial aviation rebounds from its low point during the pandemic when airline fleets were grounded

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all going to be looking for people‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not expecting it to get better anytime soon.‚Äù

Chris DiPentima president of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association said the worker shortage tracks the state‚Äôs stagnant population that has been largely unchanged since the recession of 2008-2009.

More housing is needed particularly close to public transportation and can be encouraged with incentives for builders to renovate blighted housing he said.

DiPentima also cited Connecticut‚Äôs cost of living taking aim at the state‚Äôs gift tax he said ‚Äúcomes into play‚Äù with business successions. Connecticut is the only state that imposes the tax according to the Tax Foundation a tax policy research group.

No uniform explanation applies for worker shortages. Flaherty said for every worker ‚Äúmissing‚Äù from the labor force ‚Äúthere‚Äôs probably a reason and a strategy.‚Äù

Jordan blamed the shortage of heating and cooling repair workers on an emphasis of college over trade schools and restrictive state policies in Connecticut disputed by organized labor that limit the number of apprentices that can be hired.

Local police shortages are the result of abundant opportunities at other agencies Ventura said. A study by the International Association of Chiefs of Police said recruitment troubles are due to ‚Äúmultiple social political and economic forces‚Äù that include an increasing emphasis by employees on work-life balance and public perception of police following high-profile police shootings.

Conglomerates are feeling the impact of worker shortages that are magnified because of the size of the businesses. CEO Greg Hayes said Raytheon Technologies Corp. the parent company of jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney and two military and intelligence units began the year with 174000 employees. The Arlington Virginia-based company has hired more than 23000 workers this year about half of whom are engineers he said Wednesday at an industry analysts‚Äô conference.

About 15000 employees have left the company and after hiring 13000 jobs remain open he said.

‚ÄúThat is the challenge that we all have is: Where are all those workers going to come from?‚Äù Hayes said.

With more than 3700 such trades in those three years alone the investigation reveals potential conflicts of interest in nearly every area of policymaking.

Defense policy is no different. At least 25 members sat on committees that shape national security policy while simultaneously trading financial assets in companies that could create competing interests with their work such as defense stock. With a near-even party split Democrats and Republicans may have found a rare instance of common ground.

The majority of these members sat on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees ‚Äî the committees responsible for the budget and oversight of the Department of Defense.

The list includes the former chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee James Inhofe (R-Okla.) who bought and sold shares of technology companies as they fought over a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon which eventually went to Microsoft. When the Pentagon later decided to cancel the contract House Armed Services Committee member Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) sold up to $250000 worth of Microsoft stock two weeks before it was publically announced. Fallon served on the subcommittee which oversaw the deal though a spokesperson said at the time that he had ‚Äúabsolutely no prior knowledge the Pentagon intended to cancel‚Äù the contract.

It also includes Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) who reported more trades than any other member of Congress. Though they were ‚Äúmade by trusts in the name of his wife and young children‚Äù these trades spanned all of the top five weapons contractors ‚Äî Lockheed Martin Raytheon Boeing General Dynamics Northrop Grumman ‚Äî which could conflict with his role as a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Khanna has been an opponent of overspending on the Pentagon an indication that there is not always a straight line between stock ownership and votes on the budget. But that is decidedly not the case with many other members who cash in on defense stocks while wielding power in favor of bigger defense spending.

Members of the Foreign Affairs Homeland Security Intelligence and Appropriations committees also reported trades that could constitute a conflict of interest.

John Rutherford (R-Fla.) for instance traded Lockheed Martin Microsoft and BAE Systems stock while sitting on the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for determining the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs funding. All three of those companies have been awarded contracts with the Department of Homeland Security. Rutherford then bought Raytheon stock the day that Russia invaded Ukraine a company that has also been awarded contracts by the Department of Homeland Security.

The New York Times analysis defines a potential conflict of interest fairly narrowly only focusing on stock trades in companies relevant to committee assignments. Given the daunting task of assembling such a comprehensive list it is also limited to that three-year span. As a result it doesn‚Äôt include instances like Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) picking up Raytheon stock the day of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine or Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) buying Lockheed Martin stock the day before. By the Times‚Äô own admission ‚Äúthe analysis is surely an undercount.‚Äù

Though all of these lawmakers deny any impropriety the capacity for competing interests is clear; Congress continues to approve defense budgets beyond what even the Pentagon even asks for more than half of which goes to private contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon which could in turn privately benefit members of Congress invested in those stocks.

This could create a perverse incentive structure when taking into account that when global tensions rise defense stocks tend to follow suit. War is often good for defense companies‚Äô bottom line; Jon Schwartz noted in the Intercept last year that ‚Äúdefense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by 58 percent during the Afghanistan War.‚Äù Some members of the defense industry even acknowledge this connection as Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes did during an earnings call earlier this year:

‚ÄúWe are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales. We just have to look to last week where we saw the drone attack in the UAE which have attacked some of their other facilities. And of course the tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we‚Äôre going to see some benefit from it.‚Äù

Pressure is mounting for Congress to seriously consider self-regulation of stock trading. Seventy percent of Americans support banning lawmakers from trading stocks including a majority of both Democratic and Republican voters. To date at least six different bills have been proposed to limit the ability of members of Congress to trade stock.

Despite the popularity of these measures self-regulation is always a tall order. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) went on record saying that limiting lawmakers‚Äô ability to trade stocks would be ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and that ‚Äúit would really cut back on the amount of people that would want to come up here and serve.‚Äù Tuberville himself traded stock of major defense contractors such as Honeywell and General Dynamics while sitting on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Confidence in Congress sits in the single digits as overinvestment in the Pentagon has come at the underinvestment in healthcare education and addressing the climate crisis. Even if lawmakers defend their trades as routine the goal should be to eliminate both the appearance and reality of conflict in setting national security priorities.

She knew she wanted a career in design or the arts by the time she was in high school.

Then while attending the College for Creative Studies (CCS) in Detroit she landed a summer internship at General Motors. That paved the way for where she is now GM's Executive Director of Global Industrial Design.

She worked her way up taking on jobs both large and small. Eventually Crystal started managing a design team and then became a brand director. She's worked on GM designs for vehicles like the Impala Escalade and the new electric SUV the 2023 Lyriq.

‚ÄúThat was an amazing experience. To be responsible for GM‚Äôs premium brand"" she said of her time working as Director of Interiors for Cadillac.

In 2008 Crystal became the first Black woman director in GM Design‚Äôs history.

Thursday she'll be taking center stage at the Garden Theatre to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award.

It's all part of the Ajamu Group's 11th Annual Multicultural Media Luncheon.

The founder of the Academy Awards-style luncheon ceremony is Cheryl Parks Ajamu who spent years attending the Detroit Auto Show as a media professional. While there she noticed something was missing.

‚ÄúThere was so many people of color. Asian Hispanic African American. And no one knew about these people"" she said speaking about the talented designers she'd meet at the show. ‚ÄúSo I said well let me see if there‚Äôs something I can do to create a platform and educate the public about it.‚Äù

The awards ceremony is now in its 11th year. This year's celebrity keynote speaker is sports agent Rich Paul who will be speaking on ‚ÄúBuilding A Disruptive Brand: The New Normal.""

‚ÄúThe talent has always been there. It just needed a platform where more people could learn about communities of color and what they‚Äôre doing within this automotive industry"" Cheryl said.

Windham said representation has played a role in her professional journey in several ways. She said she was encouraged to explore automotive design by a mentor at CCS.

‚ÄúThe fact that they came to me and said you would be really marketable. Because companies need to reflect their customer base. And because you are a Black female that is a customer that they definitely wanted to understand even better"" she said.

Crystal said meeting GM's first Black female designer while still at CCS did a lot for her.

""Knowing her was great. It said to me that I can do this too"" Crystal told 7 Action News.

While this award is for lifetime achievement Windham has big plans ahead.

‚ÄúI have plenty of time... to help the pipeline of talent. That means I can help others"" she said. ‚ÄúBeing in this role you know I don‚Äôt want to be the last. I want to make sure we help build a pipeline of diverse talent.""

Her advice for young creatives considering automotive design? Confirm your talent seek out mentorship and get out of your comfort zone.

She also suggested knowing for sure if you like or love something.

""The way I tell the difference between liking and loving doing something is that you wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it all day and all night.""

Further building on the UN's commitment against all forms of discrimination including that against women and girls Equal Pay Day represents longstanding efforts towards achieving the same wage for work of equal value.

Women hardest hit

Meanwhile women have been among the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic including in terms of income security representation in sectors hardest hit and gendered division of family responsibilities.

This in turn has led negatively impacted their employment and threatened to reverse decades of progress made towards gender equality.

As countries emerge from the pandemic taking action to address gender equality setbacks is not only relevant and timely but also critical for an inclusive sustainable and resilient recovery.

ILO YouTube EPIC: Can pay transparency measures help reduce the gender pay gap?

Closing the gap

Governments employers and workers organizations recognize that closing gender pay gaps is more important than ever.

Over the past few years increasingly more governments are proposing transparency measures and information sharing to address gender wage gaps.

According to recent research depending on how they are put into place pay transparency measures can effectively identify compensation differences and reduce broader gender inequalities in the labour market.

‚ÄúThese are still early days for pay transparency‚Äù said Manuela Tomei Director of the ILO Conditions of Work and Equality Department noting that countries are pursuing different approaches to advance it.

She pointed out that ‚Äúthere is no ‚Äòone-size fits all‚Äô solution‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhile more time is needed to assess the effectiveness of the different measures and practices it is encouraging that Governments workers‚Äô and employers‚Äô organizations seek to devise innovative solutions such as pay transparency to tackle a stubborn problem‚Äù.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9tb2JpbGl0eS9lbi9yZXNlYXJjaC1hbmFseXNpcy9hdXRvbW90aXZlLWludmVudG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automotive Inventory,"With June 2022 industry 'number of days supply' coming in at 26 days the automotive industry now has experienced an unprecedented 14 consecutive months of inventories below a 30-day supply. ""Normal"" inventories are usually in the 55-65 days range so a drop below 30 days for just one month would be extraordinary. For such a shortage to continue for over a year is unheard of.

Predictably as the automotive inventory began to shrink leverage shifted towards the sellers including brands and dealers. Both these constituencies have taken advantage of the suppy and demand for vehicles imbalance to raise prices for both financed and leased vehicles. Resulting monthly vehicle loan payment on average have surged 8.5% in the last 14 months when compared to those in the previous 14 months while vehicle lease payments have climbed 11% over the same time. The average April 2022 new vehicle monthly loan payment of $663 is the highest of any month dating back to (at least) the start of January 2020. While the April monthly vehicle lease payments of $527 is down from its November 2021 peak of $542 the 14-month average as mentioned remains elevated.

The Full-Size Luxury Car Segment's 13.5% monthly payment increase among owners surpasses that of any other segment and is 5 percentage points higher than the industry-wide jump (see chart below). The average Compact Utility Segment loan monthly payment ranks second with a 10.6% increase followed by the Full-Size Half Ton Pickup Segment.

As the model-level data below illustrate though these averages mask noteworthy model-level dynamics. Specifically the averages are pulled up by the recent introduction of several new high-priced (and frequently EV) models in each of these two segments. When these recent entries are removed the segment increases are more modest.

Going forward as more electric vehicles are launched we are likely to see their price points continue to pull up segment averages.

The pandemic altered the financial landscape for banks and customers and with new opportunities for growth have come new risks.



Financial crime is multi-faceted multi-national and difficult to detect making it hard for authorities and institutions to identify measure and remediate. Fraud money laundering terrorist financing illegal payments and many more crimes fall within this category of offenses with fraud and fraud-related offenses such as counterfeiting being one of the most prevalent crimes in the UK according to the National Crime Agency . It impacts individuals major corporations small businesses and the public sector ‚Äì and costs the UK billions of pounds each year. According to the International Compliance Association financial crime accounts for 3.6% of global GDP.



It‚Äôs a growing and rapidly evolving issue for financial institutions economies and governments across the globe in part due to the pandemic and digital transformation. The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly altered financial behaviours making it harder for banks to identify anomalies and behaviour that could amount to financial crime. During the pandemic it‚Äôs been prime time for fraudsters who have made the most of people turning to online shopping while some businesses may have become more likely to engage in unethical financial practices to support themselves. This has heightened the risk of banks becoming caught up in financial crime particularly where payments are concerned.

Biden is among the scores of dignitaries and royals from across Europe Asia Africa and the Americas who will attend Monday's funeral. Hundreds of thousands of people have descended on London to pay tribute to Britain's longest-reigning monarch who died on September 8 aged 96.

Elizabeth's body has been lying in state at the historic Westminster Hall since Wednesday and people from all walks of life and from around the country and overseas have queued for hours to file past her coffin in a constant emotional stream.

As Biden took his place on the balcony alongside his wife Jill he made the sign of the cross before briefly placing his hand on his heart.

After witnessing the sombre scene the US leader Japan's Emperor Naruhito French President Emmanuel Macron and other heads of state from around the world headed for a reception with King Charles III.

Biden who flew in late Saturday has said the queen who reigned for a record-breaking 70 years ""defined an era"".

Britain marks a minute of silence

Hours later Britain paused for a minute of silence in memory of the queen. London's iconic Big Ben chimed at 8pm local time at the start of the silence period and chimed again to mark its end.

Britons paused to remember their longest-serving monarch with applause following at some events across the kingdom.

Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska also paid her respects at Westminster Hall on Sunday during her first visit to the UK since the February 24 Russian invasion.

Dressed in black Zelenska was accompanied by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal and the country's ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko.

She later met Catherine Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace with the women pictured sitting together in checked armchairs.

French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte also paid their respects before the queen‚Äôs coffin as did European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

'Constant reassuring presence'

Australia's anti-monarchy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who viewed the lying-in-state and met Charles on Saturday told Sky News Australia that the queen was ""a constant reassuring presence"".

There was also a private audience at Buckingham Palace for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand which like Australia and 12 other Commonwealth realms now counts Charles as its sovereign.

""You could see that it meant a huge amount (to Charles) to have seen the sheer scale and outpouring of people's love and affection for her late Majesty"" she told BBC television Sunday.

But in a sign of challenges ahead for the new king Ardern added that she expected New Zealand to ditch the UK monarchy ""over the course of my lifetime"".

Leaders from Russia Afghanistan Myanmar not invited

Biden will join presidents prime ministers kings queens and sultans representing nearly 200 countries and territories at the funeral on Monday.

Macron was seen walking near the River Thames earlier on Sunday mingling with those gathered in the streets around parliament.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman however is no longer expected to attend reported Reuters quoting an unnamed British government source. Inviting the man Western leaders believe ordered the murder in 2018 of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been controversial. The Saudi crown prince has denied any role in the killing.

Britain has invited heads of state or ambassadors from any country with which it has full diplomatic relations but it is up to those nations who they send. The change was made by Saudi Arabia the source added.

Leaders from Russia Afghanistan Myanmar Syria and North Korea were not invited to join the 2000 guests.

Moscow's foreign ministry last week called the decision ""deeply immoral"" and ""blasphemous"" to the queen's memory. China will attend at the abbey but was barred by parliamentary leaders from the lying-in-state.

Listening to their stories and regaling patrons with a few of his own he offered advice guided them through troubled times and steered them toward a better path in life.

For years after he retired in his late 80s from the Roxbury tavern that bore his name Sonny Walker kept stopping by to keep company with his regulars in the ways that barkeeps do.

During a working life that stretched from shining shoes as a boy to being a pioneering Black tavern owner in Boston Mr. Walker became a legend that spread far beyond Roxbury.

He was 97 when he died last Monday in the VA Medical Center in West Roxbury. Mr. Walker had lived in Randolph since 1985 where for years he walked 3 miles to a bus stop to catch a ride to his tavern.

In 2018 when the family was preparing to sell Sonny Walker‚Äôs Gerry called the tavern the ‚ÄúBlack Cheers‚Äù ‚Äî Roxbury‚Äôs version of the bar made famous on TV.

Nearly everybody knew the names of Mr. Walker‚Äôs most famous friends some of whom dated back to his pre-bar days as a barber when his clientele included players from Boston‚Äôs sports royalty.

‚ÄúHe cut the hair of a lot of local stars: George Scott Sam Jones K.C. Jones Bill Russell Satch Sanders‚Äù said Gerry who lives in Randolph.

But whether Mr. Walker was wielding scissors or shot glasses his regulars mattered most. And he kept everyone in line.

Mr. Walker ‚Äúwould never allow people to swear in front of women when they came into the bar‚Äù said Andrea who lives in Dorchester.

‚ÄúWhen a woman would walk in he would say ‚ÄòYou all be cool. A lady is here‚Äô "" recalled Terry Washington of Roxbury a longtime friend and patron. ‚ÄúHe would give them the utmost respect. Any cussing that was going on would quiet down.‚Äù

Patrons would step into the tavern and see Mr. Walker ‚Äúholding court‚Äù said former state senator Dianne Wilkerson. ‚ÄúYou behaved when you were around him. Things were calm.‚Äù

Women felt comfortable going to Sonny Walker‚Äôs alone she said. ‚ÄúHe ran an A1 classy business where no one was afraid or concerned to be there.‚Äù

For many customers the biggest draw of Sonny Walker‚Äôs was Sonny Walker.

‚ÄúHe was a patrons‚Äô bartender. He knew how to work a crowd‚Äù said Sonny Lovelace a longtime friend who now lives in Falmouth. ‚ÄúSonny always had a smile on his face always had something good to say.‚Äù

If Mr. Walker sensed that an argument might escalate Lovelace said he would take an angry patron aside.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôd say ‚ÄòCome here man come down to the other end of the bar. Let‚Äôs talk‚Äô "" Lovelace recalled. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd say ‚ÄòHere have a drink. A fight‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äô He knew how to talk to people civilly without using a curse word. He was a charmer and he was a great bar owner.‚Äù

At Sonny Walker‚Äôs Gerry said ‚Äúeverybody felt at home. Everybody felt comfortable.‚Äù

The younger of two siblings Arthur Henry Walker was born in Cambridge on March 30 1925 and grew up in the South End raised by his mother.

Adelaide Gwendolyn Walker ‚Äúwas a cleaning woman‚Äù Andrea said. ‚ÄúShe cleaned stores and office buildings downtown. She would scrub floors on her hands and knees.‚Äù

Known as Sonny as far back as anyone remembers Mr. Walker began working to help support his family Andrea said. ‚ÄúHe started working at the age of 10 when he was able to get a permit to sell newspapers and shine shoes.‚Äù

In 10th grade he left high school and went to Maine to learn to be a welder sending money home to his mother and sister.

Then he joined the Army was stationed overseas and subsequently traveled widely in the Merchant Marine.

Returning to Boston he worked a series of jobs including as a bellhop before he began cutting hair with Charles Canada first in the South End and then in Grove Hall.

The two became partners and decided in 1969 to buy a bar the M&M Tavern from one of their customers.

Men were growing their hair out into Afros which required fewer trips to the barbershop. A bar seemed like a safer bet on future income.

‚ÄúWe were like here we go‚Äù Mr. Walker told the Globe in 2018 when he and his children were selling the tavern.

Mr. Walker was surrounded by his friends and family as they reviewed old photos of himself and his tavern through the years. John Tlumacki

Running their first bar Charles Canada and Sonny Walker helped break Boston‚Äôs color line as Black tavern owners. They bought a second establishment in 1980 and renamed that Warren Street bar the C&S Tavern. Years later it became Sonny Walker‚Äôs.

By 1985 they had purchased a block in Grove Hall which they developed for businesses.

In all his ventures Mr. Walker ‚Äúwas the type to mentor the young people who came through especially if he knew them‚Äù Gerry said.

‚ÄúHe was always a gentleman my father‚Äù Andrea said. ‚ÄúHe always tipped his hat. And he was always very patient. He didn‚Äôt yell he didn‚Äôt scream he didn‚Äôt lose his cool.‚Äù

Mr. Walker also never drove. When the family lived in Mattapan he‚Äôd walk to work in Grove Hall. After the family moved to Randolph in the mid-1980s Mr. Walker caught a bus to Roxbury walking to and from the bus stop Gerry said.

In the late 1940s Mr. Walker met Roberta Estelle Debnam a New England Telephone and Telegraph Co. operator who was so dedicated to her job that she hitched rides on snowplows to get to work during the Blizzard of 1978 according to her Globe obituary.

The two of them ‚Äúlived around the corner from each other. And my father had an eye for my mother‚Äù Gerry said.

One March day in 1947 Mr. Walker asked her for a date. She said she was busy that weekend because it was her birthday.

‚ÄúAnd he said ‚ÄòWell it‚Äôs my birthday too.‚Äô They found out they had the same birthday‚Äù Gerry said.

‚ÄúHe went home and told his mother ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to marry her‚Äô "" Andrea said and he did in 1950.

Mrs. Walker died in 2009. Charles Canada died nearly 30 years ago.

During most of Mr. Walker‚Äôs final years he was able to stay in Randolph because ‚ÄúLinda Randall his visiting nurse was an angel‚Äù Andrea said.

As his health declined he went to the VA hospital for additional care. ‚ÄúThe nursing people there were fantastic‚Äù she said.

In addition to his daughter and son Mr. Walker leaves two grandchildren.

A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday in the Forsyth Chapel in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain.

Everywhere Mr. Walker spent time especially in his tavern he was ‚Äúalways so dapper‚Äù Wilkerson said.

‚ÄúHe loved clothes. He was that guy who haunted Filene‚Äôs Basement and would find something and hide it until it was marked down‚Äù Andrea said.

‚ÄúEverything he wore was customized‚Äù Gerry recalled. ‚ÄúHe was a real fashionista.‚Äù

Bangladesh ‚Äì like many other nations across the globe ‚Äì is facing economic headwinds and the local life and non-life insurance companies need to keep a larger-than-required amount of paid up capital now more than ever to better secure depositors‚Äô money.

But the reality is quite different. The Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority‚Äôs (IDRA) unaudited data for 2021 reveals that 34 of the 79 such firms did not maintain the minimum level of capital required by law.

Of these firms 19 are life insurance and 15 are non-life insurance companies.

As per the Insurance Act 2010 a life insurance firm must maintain a minimum paid-up capital of Tk 30 crore which is Tk 40 crore for general insurance companies. Sixty per cent of the capital will be provided by sponsors and directors and 40 per cent will be open to general investors.

A firm‚Äôs paid-up capital represents the extent to which it depends on equity financing to fund operations. This figure can be compared with a firm‚Äôs level of debt to assess if it has a healthy balance of financing given its operations business model and prevailing industry standards.

When approached for comments a number of insurers ‚Äì who failed to meet the minimum paid-up capital requirement ‚Äì claimed that a low amount of paid-up capital causes no harm and it is a normal practice in the insurance sector of Bangladesh.

They also stated that increasing the paid-up capital will put them in trouble as they are not doing well in premium business due to extra commissions.

There are currently 81 insurance companies in the country. Of which 35 are life insurance and 46 non-life insurance firms. Investment in the sector stood at Tk49293 crore until 2020 and the sector employed 40575 people directly.

There are around 42673 agents working in the sector.

Why is low paid up capital risky?

Economists and industry insiders say it is crucial for insurance firms to increase paid up capital considering the present economic indicators. They also warned that low paid up capital can be a grave threat to the security of their customers‚Äô money.

If a company suffers financial losses or its income falls drastically its low paid-up capital can lead to problems in paying customers‚Äô insurance claims they said adding that the regulatory body should take initiatives to help these firms maintain their paid-up capital as per regulations.

Sadharan Bima Corporation Director AKM Ehsanul Haque said ‚ÄúThe paid-up capital of Tk 30 crore is insufficient as per the Insurance Act. In case of a financial crisis most such firms will be financially insolvent.

‚ÄúIn such a situation if the paid-up capital is low then the risk for customers increases. If capital is low the insurance companies will fail to pay customers in the future.‚Äù

Ahsan H Mansoor Executive Director of Policy Research Institute said ‚ÄúIDRA the regulatory body of insurance companies is not yet capable of regulating the insurance sector. As a result insurance companies are taking advantage of loopholes in the law.‚Äù

Mirza Azizul Islam former advisor to the caretaker government told The Business Post ‚ÄúThe sponsors and directors of insurance companies share the profit among themselves in various ways without increasing the paid-up capital.

‚ÄúIn this regard the regulatory body should take appropriate measures.‚Äù

19 life insurers with paid-up capital below Tk30cr According to the unaudited IDRA report of insurance companies for 2021 19 out of the 33 life insurance companies in the country have paid-up capital less than Tk 30 crore.

Sunflower Life has Tk 3 crore paid-up capital Golden Life Tk 3 crore Homeland Life Tk 3 crore Jiban Bima Corporation Tk 5 crore Progressive Life Insurance Tk 16.54 crore Alfa Islami Life Tk 18 crore Baira Life Tk 18.26 crore Best Life Insurance Tk 18 crore.

Bengal Islami Life has Tk 18 crore Diamond Life Tk 18 crore Jamuna Life Tk 18 crore Mercantile Life Insurance Tk 18 crore NRB Global Life Tk 18 crore Protective Islami Life Tk 18 crore Swadesh Life Tk 18 crore Trust Islami Life Tk 24 crore and Zenith Islami Life Tk 18 crore.

On the issue Golden Life Insurance CEO Amzad Hossain Khan said ‚ÄúThe board has already taken a decision to increase our paid-up capital.‚Äù

Homeland Life Insurance Chairman Mohammad Julhas said ‚ÄúThere are errors in the unaudited report. At present the paid-up capital of our sponsors and directors stands at Tk 18 crore. The remaining amount of the paid-up capital will be fulfilled once the company is listed in the stock market as per the rules.‚Äù

15 non-life insurers with paid-up capital below Tk 40cr

Non-life insurance companies are in a slightly better position in terms of capital adequacy. Among the 46 non-life insurance companies 15 have paid-up capital below Tk 40 crore.

These companies are ‚Äì Bangladesh Cooperative Insurance with Tk 1.95 crore Provati Insurance Tk 3.48 crore Sonar Bangla Insurance Tk 4 crore Phoenix Insurance Tk 4.03 crore Northern General Insurance Tk 4.27 crore and Eastern Insurance Tk 4.31 crore.

South Asia Insurance has Tk 6 crore Pragati Insurance Tk 6.56 crore Federal Insurance Tk 7.10 crore Meghna Insurance Tk 24 crore Sikder Insurance Tk 24 crore Union Insurance Tk 29.04 crore Islami Commercial Tk 30.39 crore Agrani Insurance Tk 31.76 crore and Mercantile Insurance Tk 33.90 crore.

What insurers say

Managing Director and CEO of Phoenix Insurance Company Md Jamirul Islam said ‚ÄúSo far the board has not taken any decision on increasing the paid-up capital. Still the company is not doing well in premium business with extra commissions.

‚ÄúHowever if the business expands in the future the board may increase the paid-up capital.‚Äù

Md Mofizur Rahman company secretary of Agrani Insurance Company ‚ÄúIt is normal for our company to have less paid-up capital and I do not see any harm in it.‚Äù

Regulator working on the issue

IDRA Executive Director and Spokesperson SM Shakil Akhtar said ‚ÄúThere is ambiguity in the law about the paid up capital and the insurance companies are taking advantage of this situation.

‚ÄúThe issue of paid-up capital will be clarified in the rules of Insurance Act 2010. When it is done every company will have to ensure the minimum requirement of paid up capital.‚Äù

Bangladesh Insurance Association (BIA) President Sheikh Kabir Hossain said ‚ÄúWe have written to the IDRA seeking a suspension of the minimum paid-up capital guidelines of companies until rules are formulated according to section 21(3) of the Insurance Act 2010.

‚ÄúIn what manner and within what time limit life and non-life insurance companies licensed before 2010 will fulfill the conditions of having the capital has not been gazetted so far. In this situation it is specifically requested to suspend the instructions of the above memoranda until the rules are framed as per section 21(3) of the Insurance Act 2010.‚Äù

IDRA‚Äôs SM Shakil Akhtar said ‚ÄúInstructions have been issued to life and non-life insurers to maintain minimum paid-up capital and retain 60 per cent share of the paid-up capital through sponsors and directors.

‚ÄúLater after the BIA letter the matter of minimum capital preservation was postponed.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2J1c2luZXNzL2RyZWFtLWxpdmVzLWZpZWxkcy1ob3Blcy1yZXZpdmUtdGhvcm91Z2hicmVkLWhvcnNlLXJhY2luZy1oYXJkd2ljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A dream lives on. Fields hopes to revive thoroughbred horse racing in Hardwick.,"The self-described horse enthusiast poured millions into Suffolk Downs ‚Äî New England‚Äôs last thoroughbred horse track ‚Äî only to watch its future evaporate when state gaming regulators in 2014 awarded the sole Greater Boston casino license to rival Wynn Resorts. As racing ended at Suffolk Downs in 2019 Fields and his Suffolk Downs partners set their sights on the other side of the state in Great Barrington but ran into local resistance. Then Fields teamed up with Kingsbury health clubs founder Armand Janjigian to advance a track proposal in Sturbridge. No dice: Town meeting voters turned that one down last year.

Developer Richard Fields likes to explain his quixotic quest for a thoroughbred racetrack in Massachusetts with sailing terms not equestrian ones: You need to keep tacking to the left and then to the right to catch the wind.

Might Fields be finally rounding to the finish line? He sure thinks so now that he has found a community he believes is ready to embrace his dream.

He has teamed up with Robin Kalaidjian a horse breeder who is married to Janjigian to build a mile-long turf track in Hardwick a farming town in Central Massachusetts about 25 miles west of Worcester. At a joint planning board and selectmen meeting last week the group presented its vision to establish the Commonwealth Equine and Agricultural Center at the 360-acre Great Meadowbrook Farm a former dairy farm that‚Äôs still used for cultivating hay. If all goes according to plan the sounds of thundering hooves might be heard in these quiet fields off Upper Church Street as soon as next September.

It would be a tribute to Fields‚Äôs tenacity and willpower. It would also be a tribute to his efforts to make sports betting legal in Massachusetts. Fields knows full well that a horse track isn‚Äôt viable without additional revenue from gambling. For Fields this would come from sports betting at a kiosk on race days and year-round via a mobile app.

To try and make that happen Fields has emerged as one of the state‚Äôs biggest lobbying forces on Beacon Hill during the past year. His Commonwealth Racing LLC spent $180000 in Massachusetts in the first six months of 2022 according to newly released figures from Secretary of State William Galvin‚Äôs office. That tied Fields with Eversource Energy in fourth place in corporate lobbying spending behind major health care employers Mass General Brigham Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Beth Israel Lahey Health. It‚Äôs unusual to see a small outfit such as Commonwealth Racing up so high in these rankings but it underscores how important this dream is for Fields.

Commonwealth Racing first showed up as one of the state‚Äôs top lobbying spenders during the second half of 2021 after Fields hired former House Ways and Means chairman Brian Dempsey‚Äôs firm Dempsey Associates. Fields also has three other well-connected firms on retainer: Smith Costello & Crawford; Charles Stefanini Consulting and Finneran Global Strategies.

The main goal: to get sports betting passed into law. On that front in the final hours of the Legislature‚Äôs regular formal sessions this summer the House and Senate reached a deal. It was one of the last major bills to be sent to Governor Charlie Baker for his signature.

The new law requires licenses to be made available to operators of live horse races. The last such business in Massachusetts is Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville a track that features harness races with standardbreds pulling two-wheeled carts. Former track operators with simulcasting licenses ‚Äî the Suffolk Downs partnership of which Fields is still a member and Raynham Park owned by the Carney family ‚Äï also can get brick-and-mortar betting licenses as can the state‚Äôs two resort casinos MGM Springfield and Wynn‚Äôs Encore Boston Harbor.

Sports betting might bring several million dollars a year to the proposed horse track in Hardwick. Helpful yes. But not a giant windfall either.

There‚Äôs another subsidy that Fields and his allies are eyeing: the state‚Äôs racehorse development fund which is backed by a sliver of casino taxes set aside to help support the horse industry when the Legislature legalized casinos in 2011. Most of this money is to be used for race prizes. With no live racing the pot for thoroughbreds has swollen to nearly $22 million.

Fields said he‚Äôs close to reaching a purchase-and-sale-agreement with the owners of the farm in Hardwick. There are other hurdles to clear such as planning board approval and a race-meet license from the state Gaming Commission.

To win over residents Fields and his team pledged to build an ‚Äúagritourism destination‚Äù that honors the town‚Äôs farming heritage. No more than 20 race festival days would be held each year and even fewer would be held initially. On-site gambling would only take place during race meets at temporary kiosks. Eventually Fields and Kalaidjian hope to operate a thoroughbred breeding center and retirement home as well as a farm-to-table restaurant and a bed-and-breakfast inn. These businesses would create 25 to 50 permanent jobs and at least $500000 in new annual taxes for Hardwick ‚Äî an 8 percent increase to the 3000-person town‚Äôs current revenue.

Can they pull it off? Paul Umbrello executive director of the New England Horsemen‚Äôs Benevolent and Protective Association is banking on it. He jokes that he slept like a baby after the meeting with town officials last week because he saw little to no opposition this time. These races will support horse farms which in turn support hay farms which together he said help preserve the open space and rural character of many New England towns. He doesn‚Äôt have any data about how many farms the region has lost to development in recent years. But from his vantage point on the board of the Mass. Thoroughbred Breeders Association he can track these numbers: Membership is down to fewer than 50 roughly a third of what it was just three years ago.

It was Umbrello who clued Fields into the availability of Great Meadowbrook Farm. Fields said he visited last year and fell in love with the site and the town.

No one said chasing the wind would be easy. But with this property in Hardwick Fields is betting all that zigzagging will prove to be worthwhile in the end.

Bitcoin in ‚Äúbottom phase?‚Äù

A team of Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius raised their prediction for the speed of Federal Reserve benchmark rate hikes. They noted that the United States central bank would increase rates by 0.75% in September and 0.5% in November up from their previous forecast of 0.5% and 0.25% respectively.

Fed‚Äôs rate-hike path has played a key role in determining Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends in 2022. The period of higher lending rates ‚Äî from near zero to the 2.25-2.5% range now ‚Äî has prompted investors to rotate out of riskier assets and seek shelter in safer alternatives like cash.

Bitcoin has dropped by almost 60% year-to-date and is now wobbling around its psychological support of $20000. Some analysts including a pseudonymous trader Doctor Profit believe BTC‚Äôs price has entered the bottom phase at current levels. However the trader warned:

‚ÄúPlease consider FEDs next decisions. 0.75% [rate hike] already priced in 1% and we see blood.‚Äù

On the other hand Bitcoin‚Äôs consistently positive correlation with the U.S. stock market particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite poses deeper correction risks.

Sharon Bell a strategist at Goldman Sachs suggests that the recent rallies in the stock market could be bull traps echoing her firm‚Äôs warning that equities could crash by 26% if the Fed gets more aggressive with its rate increases to fight inflation.

Interestingly the warnings coincide with a recent rise in Bitcoin short positions held by institutional investors according to CME data highlighted in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) weekly report.

‚ÄúDefinitely a sign that some people are counting on a risk asset meltdown this fall‚Äù noted Nick an analyst at data resource Ecoinometrics.

Bitcoin options expiring at the end of 2022 show most traders betting on the BTC price dropping all the way down to the $10-000-12000 area.

Overall the call-put open interest ratio was 1.90 on Sept. 18 with call options for the $45000 strike price carrying the maximum weight. But strike prices between $10000 and $23000 showed at least four puts for every three calls ‚Äî which is perhaps a more realistic interim evaluation of market sentiment.

From a technical perspective Bitcoin‚Äôs price could drop by roughly 30% to $13500 as the price forms a convincing inverse up-and-handle pattern.

Conversely a decisive rally above the 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $21250 could invalidate this bearish setup positioning BTC for a rally toward $25000 as its next psychological upside target.

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar.

Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for 2023 U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as it projects a more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening policy through the rest of this year and sees that pushing the jobless rate higher than it previously projected.

Goldman analysts said in a note released late Friday that it now sees GDP growth of 1.1 percent next year down from its prior call for 1.5 percent growth from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the end of 2023.

The Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to raise U.S. borrowing costs faster and further than previously expected after data this week showed underlying inflation broadening out rather than cooling as expected.

The investment bank now expects the Fed to hike policy rates by 75 basis points at its meeting next week up from 50 basis points previously and sees another 50 bp hikes in November and December with the Fed funds rate peaking at 4-4.25 percent by the end of the year.

""This higher rates path combined with recent tightening in financial conditions implies a somewhat worse outlook for growth and employment next year"" Goldman analysts wrote.

It sees the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent by year-end up from 3.6 percent and rising to 4.1 percent by the end of 2023 from 3.8 percent forecast previously.

Friday Hasbro workers unveiled a Ghost Rider and Hell Charger collectible as the next addition to the company's HasLab crowdfunding efforts. Costing a whopping $349.99 the package comes with the typical 6-inch Robbie Reyes figure with interchangeable heads. Furthermore his iconic Charger has all sorts of extra goodies including LED lights that light up the interior and wheels as if they're on fire.

Just two days after launch the campaign has gotten 3500 backers out of the needed 9000 to produce the item. As of this writing the effort still has 44 days left meaning it's on a good pace to eventually reach its goal. Nonetheless collectors and Marvel fans alike are so hyped over the Legends figure both Robbie Reyes and Marvel Legends became trending topics on Twitter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2xvd25maXNodHYuY29tL3JvYmJ5LXJleWVzcy1naG9zdC1yaWRlci1pcy1oYXNsYWJzLW5ldy1jcm93ZGZ1bmRpbmctY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robby Reyes's Ghost Rider Is HasLab's New Crowdfunding Campaign!,"



HasLab is having success crowdfunding everything except Star Wars toys lately. The Cobra H.I.S.S. blew through multiple stretch goals; the same can be said about the Proton Pack. And now it appears that even Marvel‚Äôs Ghost Rider is proving to be more loved than the Rancor or Reva!

OK it also helps that this combination of Ghost Rider and the Engine of Vengence looks fantastic. Lots of LED lights flame effect accessories and one of the coolest-looking versions of Ghost Rider in twenty years make this a must-back campaign. Others think so too since over 3200 backers have signed on since the campaign kicked off yesterday. The end goal is 9000 before getting into stretch goal territory but there are still 44 days to go. The campaign will end for better or worse on October 31st at 11:59 PM EST. Early backers who help the campaign reach 9k before September 23rd will receive Robbie Reyes in human form. That‚Äôs pretty cool but what about the stretch goals? Well those are a mystery for now.

The painful part of all this is the price. $349.99 for a Marvel Legends figure and an 18‚Ä≥ long car. Oof. I cannot deny that the whole thing looks cool but the price doesn‚Äôt match the types of things we‚Äôve seen for Batman and other properties in the past few years. Literally the toy aisles today are full of toys that capture the same type of features as the Engine of Vengence but for less than one-third the price.

From Carter Slade to Johnny Blaze to Danny Ketch to Robbie Reyes many names have taken on the Ghost Rider mantle fueled by vengeance and a sick ride. The next Marvel Legends HasLab project will bring another Ghost Rider to life like never before starring a vehicle unlike any on your shelf. With Hasbro Pulse fans can bring the Spirit of Vengeance into our realm ‚Äî and it won‚Äôt even cost you your soul!

If the campaign reaches its funding goal here‚Äôs what‚Äôs included:

Engine of Vengeance vehicle inspired by the supernatural muscle car in Marvel Comics All-New Ghost Rider (2014)

Premium 1:12 scale car design measuring approximately 18.5 inches long 7.5 inches wide and 5.5 inches tall

Vehicle fully equipped with 20 LEDs for scorching Hellfire light-up effects in tires engine grill tailpipes and driver‚Äôs seat headrest (requires 3 AA batteries not included)

6 flame trail effect pieces for tires and tailpipes

2 Brimstone Risers for dynamic car display

4 interchangeable tires and 1 additional engine to convert Engine of Vengeance from Hellfire Mode to Street Mode

Exclusive Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider 6-inch scale figure with comic-inspired accessories including real metal chain

Given the location and circumstance the OC Health Care Agency (HCA) is urging residents to be on the alert and avoid contact with any bats. Rabid bats are identified routinely each year in Orange County and around the country. Contact with bats should be avoided and any potential bat bite should be discussed with a medical provider.

Anyone who may have had physical contact with this bat or saw someone else having contact with the bat is asked to call the HCA Health Care Agency (HCA) Communicable Disease Control Division at (714) 834-8180 to determine the risk for rabies. Owners of pets who may have had contact with this bat should contact their veterinarian.

The rabies virus is found in an animal‚Äôs saliva and is transmitted to people by a bite from a rabid animal. Although very rare contamination of the eyes mouth or an open wound by the saliva of a rabid animal can also transmit rabies. Most cases of human rabies in the United States in recent years have resulted from bat strains of rabies; bats have very small teeth and their bites may go unnoticed.

Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies the disease is nearly always fatal. For that reason preventive treatment to stop the rabies virus from causing illness is given to anyone who may have been exposed to rabies. Medical assistance should be obtained promptly after an exposure so any wound can be cleaned and preventive treatment can be started. This treatment is safe and effective.

The HCA and OC Animal Care recommend the following actions to minimize the risk of rabies:

Avoid all contact with wild animals

Vaccinate all cats and dogs against rabies.

Do not sleep with open unscreened windows or doors.

If bats are seen inside the house or other structure close off the area and contact animal control.

Once the bat(s) have been removed close off any areas allowing entrance into the house.

Do not leave pet food outside where it will attract wild animals.

Immediately wash all animal bites with soap and water being sure to flush the wound well then contact your doctor.

Report all animal bites to OC Animal Care.

Report stray animals to OC Animal Care.

Potential exposure to a bat or other wild animal should be reported to the HCA Communicable Disease Control Division at (714) 834-8180. To report a bat in your home an animal bite or a stray animal contact OC Animal Care at (714) 935-6848.

For example many people don‚Äôt realize allergies can be deadly. Or that eating local honey living in a dry climate or avoiding cut flowers won‚Äôt cure allergies or prevent an allergic reaction.

And these days there‚Äôs often the question: Is it allergies or is it COVID-19? Fortunately there are tests doctors can perform that can help them make that distinction. Here are a few facts that can help you too.

What To Look For

Allergy symptoms can include:

Watery Eyes

Congestion

Runny Nose

Itchy Eyes

Vomiting and/or stomach cramps

Wheezing

Shortness of breath

Dizziness or feeling faint

Pale or blue skin

Weak pulse

Hives

Repeated cough

Tight hoarse throat trouble swallowing swollen tongue

What is an Allergy?

Allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. An allergy is an overreaction of the body‚Äôs immune system to an ordinarily harmless substance.

Allergies exist throughout the year indoors and out and affect people of all ages. Animal dander house dust mites foods grasses trees weeds and molds can all trigger an allergic reaction.

Autumn Allergies

Some allergies are seasonal and more likely to occur at different times of the year. The most common culprit for fall allergies is ragweed which grows wild almost everywhere generally between August and November.

A number of plants that thrive during cool nights and warm days also trigger fall allergies.

Who is Affected?

Twenty to 40 percent of the population‚Äîincluding at least one of every four children‚Äîsuffers from allergies*.

People with allergies are often sensitive to more than one allergen. Prevention or treatment can make the difference between chronic illness and a productive healthy life.

Diagnosing Allergies

Unfortunately many of these also show up when someone has a cold the flu or even COVID-19 but doctors do have ways to tell the difference. The first step is to identify allergen-specific antibodies called Immunoglobulin E (IgE). This can be done two ways.

1. Skin Prick Testing: Commonly performed on the forearm and sometimes the back the skin is cleaned with alcohol and an allergen extract is pricked into the skin. If an allergy is present a small itchy bump and surrounding redness often referred to as a ‚Äúwheal and flare‚Äù will appear in about 15 minutes. This indicates the specific allergen.

2. In-Vitro Testing: The doctor simply draws a small amount of blood and has it tested in a lab. It is a less invasive method and receives test results within 24 hours. Many professional medical societies recommend also using in-vitro tests such as the OPTIGEN¬Æ Allergy Test.

So once you know you have allergies what can be done? Here are some options.

Treatments

Allergy management falls into three main categories: avoidance medication and immunotherapy.

Avoidance: Once the source of an allergy is identified a solution may be to simply avoid it. This is most effective with food and animal allergies.

Medication: Prescription drugs can reduce allergy symptoms. Many are effective immediately though some may have side effects or not work for everybody.

Immunotherapy: Allergy shots are given frequently in scheduled doses of gradually increasing concentrations using extracts containing relevant allergens. The idea is to slowly desensitize the body to the offending allergens. Ideally an injection program can be discontinued after some years.

Hockey has returned to MedStar Capitals Iceplex with the Washington Capitals holding their Rookie Camp prior to the official start of the 2022-23 training camp on September 22. Among those overseeing the future generation of Capitals is Hershey Bears Head Coach Todd Nelson who replaced Scott Allen in July after Allen was tagged as the replacement for former Capitals Assistant Coach Scott Arniel.

The 53-year old Nelson will enter this season as the 28th bench boss in Chocolatetown although for now he is getting familiar with the Capitals as an organization.

‚ÄúI think just getting acclimated to everybody here. I know a few players I coached Dylan McIlrath I coached Anthony Mantha Nick Jensen Kale Kessy is coming to camp but everybody else is new‚Äù said Nelson during a meeting with the media at MedStar.

‚ÄúAlso I have a new staff myself it‚Äôs a fresh staff which I‚Äôm really excited about. Along with our philosophy we‚Äôre trying to get to know Peter‚Äôs [Caps Head Coach Peter Laviolette] philosophy.‚Äù Nelson will have the support of Bears Assistant Coach (and former defenseman) Patrick Wellar who will return for another season behind the bench.

‚ÄúI like his intensity think he‚Äôs a good skater‚Äù noted Nelson describing defenseman Vincent Iorio. The Capitals drafted Iorio a participant in the team‚Äôs rookie camp with the 55th overall pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft and he could quite possibly be considered the team‚Äôs top defensive prospect. The 19-year old right-handed blueliner is eligible to play Juniors this season although he could also join the Caps‚Äô American Hockey League affiliate Hershey Bears.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a decision we‚Äôll have to make going through camp and go from there‚Äù said Nelson when asked about the prospect of Iorio donning the Chocolate and White ‚ÄúLike I said I‚Äôm rather new to the organization so we‚Äôll have to see where the pieces fall and what the organization viewpoint is and we‚Äôll take it day-by-day at camp.‚Äù

Despite being a new face to the Capitals organization with a large amount of on the fly knowledge being presented to him Nelson is still observative of the players with which he is currently working.

‚ÄúAs we go along here and see the players in games I‚Äôll have a better understanding of what the players are like and I‚Äôm really excited about that.‚Äù The Capitals work closely with the Bears‚Äô front office and coaching staff to ensure the team‚Äôs prospects are as best prepared upon their arrival to the NHL.

‚ÄúI want to see what kind of latitude I have‚Äù said Nelson ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with teams where they want to play exactly the same system in the minors I‚Äôve been with teams where the head coach goes ‚Äòyou‚Äôve got your personnel you figure out what systems work best for you and try to win hockey games‚Äô so we‚Äôll have that conversation after rookie camp‚Äôs done.‚Äù

Some teams already look like section champions and district playoff contenders. Others hope to improve on last year‚Äôs records. Some players are well on pace for double-digit scoring while others look forward to starting every game of the year.

Ellie Hershey‚Äôs first goal for this fall was just to get back on the field.

Hershey a senior at Conestoga Valley had open heart surgery last spring making that goal anything but a certainty.

‚ÄúI was running in a track meet and blacked out‚Äù Hershey said.

Doctors found a cyst on Hershey‚Äôs heart. It was benign but it was reducing the amount of blood circulating through her body. In April Hershey had surgery meant to remove the cyst but her doctors found that all they could do was push the cyst down allowing the blood to flow properly again.

‚ÄúThe first two weeks were horrible‚Äù Hershey said. ‚ÄúThere was so much pain. It took three months for me to recover.‚Äù

It may have been three months during which Hershey could not participate in athletics but she was able to use that time to support her Buckskin teammates.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always been a team leader‚Äù Conestoga Valley head coach Kelly Dearolf said. ‚ÄúShe showed up a every practice and Nook League game even before she was cleared.‚Äù

Hershey was cleared to play in July.

‚ÄúIt was devastating to not be on the field with my teammates‚Äù Hershey said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre literally my best friends and family. They celebrated with me when I was first cleared and again for my first game back.‚Äù

Though Hershey is now back on the field and has shown no signs of trouble this fall it is still a balancing act for Dearolf to know how much to play her each day.

‚ÄúShe would play in her sophomore and junior years every game all game‚Äù Dearolf said. ‚ÄúWhen she came into practice (this season) she hadn‚Äôt run or done cardio. She was cleared but you just didn‚Äôt know how long she could play at a time. When she looks tired we get someone to sub in for her. But she was told by her surgeon that she needs that exercise for her heart to grow stronger so we don‚Äôt want to hold her back either.‚Äù

Buckskins attacking the net

Conestoga Valley has been one of the area‚Äôs top-scoring teams in the first half of the season. The Buckskins have four of the top 10 scorers in the Lancaster-Lebanon League: Alaina Culbert (seven goals nine assists entering the weekend) Mikyla Rineer (nine goals three assists) Jamie Handwerger (nine goals) and Sophia Livingston (six goals two assists).

‚ÄúConestoga Valley field hockey wasn‚Äôt always known as a big scoring team‚Äù Dearolf said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been known for keeping the ball out of the cage. I was pleasantly surprised to have us average four or five goals a game. We have a lot of speed in our forwards.‚Äù

Almond takes reins at Northern Lebanon

Warwick alum Noelle Almond is guiding Northern Lebanon as a first-year head coach. Progress has been slow for the Vikings early but they still have not faced a Section Four opponent.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really looking forward to those games‚Äù Almond said. ‚ÄúWe played Octorara who‚Äôs Section Three but a comparable size to Section Four and I was encouraged to tie with them.‚Äù

Almond graduated from Warwick in 2015 and played one year of college hockey at Lock Haven and another at Shippensburg. She always hoped to get back into the sport but her profession got in the way for a few years.

‚ÄúI work as a physical therapist assistant. My first job didn‚Äôt give me time to here. I got a new job and I had the availability and opportunity to be head coach.‚Äù

In addition to adjusting to a new head coach the Vikings are also adjusting to a new turf field.

‚ÄúI think we are adjusting well‚Äù Almond said. ‚ÄúWith a new coach and new players there are changes with a new style of play. I‚Äôm seeing improvement. And with a turf field after playing on grass there has to be an adjustment.‚Äù

Visitors are testing their wits at the latest spine-chilling attraction Hersheypark‚Äôs Dark Nights. Advertised as a ‚Äúnew frightfully immersive haunt experience‚Äù the new addition opened Sept. 17 as part of the park‚Äôs fall season and features three ‚Äúscare zones‚Äù and four haunted houses.

Judging by wait times of up to one hour Saturday night at some of the attractions the park is delivering on its promise.

Grant Williams 15 of Monroe Township a Hersheypark enthusiast said he was excited to be among the first to experience Dark Nights. As he stepped out of the Haunted Coal Mine a haunted house located near the Trailblazer catering area he admitted it wasn‚Äôt for the faint of heart.

‚ÄúThat genuinely terrified me‚Äù he said.

Inside ghouls lurked in a maze of dark hallways where fog and specialty lights created the illusion of walking in swampy green water.

‚ÄúHersheypark in the Dark has always been a really fun Halloween event but now it‚Äôs like 10 times crazier‚Äù Williams added. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even have words to even describe what just happened. Hershey outdid themselves on so many levels.‚Äù

Basically Dark Nights expands on the park‚Äôs annual Halloween season and caters to a missing segment teenagers and young adults. Nearly 50 rides as well as Treatville trick-or-treat trail character glow dance parties and flashlight tours of ZooAmerica remain a part of the Halloween celebration.

In the words of Chris Brown the park‚Äôs director of planning and design there‚Äôs a method behind the madness of Dark Nights.

‚ÄúWe wanted it to be differentiated super entertaining and super scary‚Äù he said.

In order to make that happen Brown and the other team members invested 18 months researching and traveling to about 50 other Halloween themed attractions throughout the United States. Many of those stops included regional venues he said adding central Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many haunted attractions.

‚ÄúWe came back with the greatest hits list‚Äù he said.

The ‚Äúscare zones‚Äù are part of the park‚Äôs general admission and include Darkstone‚Äôs Hollow the Valley of Fear and Midway of Misery. At the Midway a creepy top-hat wearing ringmaster in a purple suit commands the space where fire jets into the air and haunted characters playfully slide across the ground.

It‚Äôs enough to send visitors shrieking and equally as many into laughter.

As for the haunted house they are located in familiar sections of the park and include: A haunted coal mine; ‚ÄúThe Descent‚Äù which takes you through underground tunnels; ‚ÄúCreature Chaos‚Äù where Professor Darkstone pits you against Pennsylvania‚Äôs deadliest creatures; and ‚ÄúTwisted Darkness‚Äù where you have your tarot read by a mysterious fortune teller and join a ‚Äúcarnival of nightmares.‚Äù

Sophisticated scenery and impressive lighting and sound effects play a big role in the haunted houses. More than 100 people were hired as scare actors and the park partnered with several national companies to create the special effects.

Unlike some haunted venues Hersheypark‚Äôs haunted houses do not feature gore or blood. Characters jump out and scare but do not touch visitors. The haunted houses which are recommended for guests ages 13 and up require a separate add-on ticket (basically a wristband used for entry) for $24.95.

Guests with young children can follow routes to avoid the scary zones.

Dark Nights also features exclusive branded merchandise such as Christmas ornaments sweatshirts and hats as well as limited-time food and drinks including glowing cocktails pork barbecue on black buns oversized milkshakes and eyeball doughnuts.

INFO: Dark Nights runs through Oct. 30 from 6-11 p.m. on Saturdays (and Fridays starting Oct. 14) and 6-10 p.m. on Sundays.

First he reached the epic milestone of 100 million subscribers on his main YouTube channel. Then he also took major steps in his businesses like starting the first Beast Burger outlet and now Feastables chocolates being made available at Walmart.

The 24-year-old started Feastables in January 2022 in hopes of delivering the highest-quality chocolate to the masses. Further he included the prize to be part of his viral Chocolate Factory video to promote his new business. Since its release Jimmy Donaldson‚Äôs chocolates have seen positive growth in profits.

Fans can get their Feastables chocolates from Walmart

Fans had reported seeing Feastable chocolates in their nearby Walmart stores for the past few weeks. Eventually MrBeast officially announced that his chocolates would be available at all Walmart stores across the US. Earlier these chocolates were only available online through the official Feastables or Walmart site.

The 24-year-old further released a video on his subsidiary channel MrBeast 2. In the video Donaldson and his crewmate Nolan visited a Walmart and asked fans to taste and compare Feastables versus a Hershey‚Äôs chocolate bar. So after tasting both chocolates everyone favored Feastables over the other branded chocolate.

It seems MrBeast completed his quest of delivering high-quality chocolate for which he started this business. Moreover fans wouldn‚Äôt have to buy bundles of Feastables as they can buy only one from Walmart for $2.48. Also MrBeast shared about another product vegan Feastables cookies which will be exclusive to Walmart for $4.48.

MrBeast hosts a $10000 giveaway for Feastable buyers

Arguably no one can host a better giveaway than MrBeast. It won‚Äôt be wrong to say he took giveaways to another level as he easily gives away tons of money and exclusive prizes like cars and private islands. So how could he leave the opportunity not to host a giveaway to promote Feastables availability at Walmart?

In the recent video on MrBeast 2 the YouTuber shared about giving away $10000. However there are some eligibility requirements for winning the amount as fans need to share their Walmart bill for buying Feastables chocolates and share it by texting 69420. Then MrBeast will award the $10000 to a random person.

After the chicken has marinated take the bowl from the fridge and let it aside for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. Combine the flour and spices in a resealable bag. Mix everything. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture then return it to the marinade. Finally coat the chicken in flour and place it on a rack to allow the crust to stick to the bird.

Hilton a franchise icon and civic treasure: Kravitz - The Athletic,"It was 2012 Reggie Wayne‚Äôs 12th year with the Colts and T.Y. Hilton‚Äôs first after being selected in the third round out of Florida International. Over the years Hilton would become known as ‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù a nickname given to him by Chuck Pagano but for a time there he was The Shadow.

He wouldn‚Äôt leave Wayne alone.

Wherever the Colts veteran wide receiver went The Shadow would be there in the locker room in the cafeteria everywhere.

‚ÄúHe got on my nerves‚Äù Wayne said with a smile. ‚ÄúHe came in all bright-eyed and bushy tailed and he sat next to me every day. Every day. But that‚Äôs how he learned to be a pro.‚Äù

All these years later Hilton forged one of the greatest careers in Colts receiving history. On his resum√©: four Pro Bowls the league leader in receiving yards in 2016 631 receptions 9691 yards and 53 receiving touchdowns. With Andrew Luck as his quarterback Hilton surged past 1000 receiving yards four straight years. Oh and he owns the Houston Texans (103 catches 1820 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns in 20 games).

So if this is it ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a huge banner of Hilton now adorning Lucas Oil Stadium reading ‚ÄúThank you for the memories‚Äù ‚Äî he will be remembered not only as the third-most productive receiver in Indy history (behind Wayne and Marvin Harrison) but as a guy who grew from a quiet eager rookie to a grown man who became a leader for the Colts‚Äô young rookie corps.

Theoretically it‚Äôs possible there may be more football in Hilton but it‚Äôs highly likely that will happen elsewhere ‚Äî if it happens at all. The door to a Colts‚Äô return has been closed. An organization doesn‚Äôt hang a ‚Äúthanks for the memories‚Äù banner if they have any designs on re-signing the 32-year-old receiver.

By the end of his tenure in Indy he was doing for Michael Pittman Jr. and others what Marvin Harrison did for Wayne what Wayne did for Hilton. It‚Äôs the circle of football life.

‚ÄúWhenever you‚Äôre coming from a (receivers) tree it (leadership) kind of falls in your lap more than you wanting it‚Äù Wayne said. ‚ÄúI remember when Marv left I wasn‚Äôt raising my hand to be a leader; I became one by default. I think it was the same way with T.Y. I don‚Äôt think he came here as a leader but he became one.‚Äù

Harrison started it all landing as the franchise‚Äôs all-time leading receiver with 1102 receptions for 14580 yards and 128 touchdowns ending up in the Hall of Fame. Wayne came next finishing with 1070 catches for 14345 yards and 82 TD‚Äôs becoming the Colts‚Äô second most-productive receiver; he remains a Hall of Fame candidate. Then there was Hilton whose numbers would have been even more impressive had Luck stayed healthy.

We saw Hilton grow up and grow into his role. When he got here from FIU the 23-year-old Hilton was a quiet sort; friendly always accommodating eminently approachable but he didn‚Äôt have a lot to say ‚Äî or a lot he felt he needed to share with the media. He was an anti-diva never complaining about getting his touches on the football field. And that never changed throughout his marvelous career save for one bump in the road in 2017 when he publicly criticized his team‚Äôs offensive line for failing to adequately protect his good friend quarterback Jacoby Brissett. (He wasn‚Äôt wrong ‚Äî Brissett was sacked 10 times by the Jaguars that day ‚Äî but he did apologize later).

Over time he grew became more vocal within the locker room and by the end he became a beloved and respected figure whose pre-game speeches became the stuff of legend.

Talk to current Colts and they‚Äôll tell you they were whipped into a frenzy when Hilton returned from a frightening neck surgery last October and gave a speech that stirred the locker room before a game against the Houston Texans. The Colts won easily 31-3.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget that‚Äù said safety Julian Blackmon. ‚ÄúHe was so fired up to play because he was coming off that surgery and he went off. He was so fired up in that speech and we know he‚Äôs such a quiet guy but him being back on the field everybody seeing how much that game meant to him that fired everybody up watching him battle against adversity and be back on the field with everybody that got everybody turned up.‚Äù

Wait T.Y. Hilton orator?

The media didn‚Äôt typically see this side of him. But as last year‚Äôs season-long ‚ÄúHard Knocks‚Äù revealed Hilton was the unquestioned heartbeat of the organization. That may explain why he remained with the team even beyond the point when he was no longer as productive as he once was. It was his presence his leadership his gravitas.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard from the guys that he gave some great speeches last year‚Äù Wayne said. He smiled. ‚ÄúThat surprises me honestly. That‚Äôs the kind of thing he used to shy away from; he was more laid back took more of a Marvin (Harrison) approach. He‚Äôs a quiet guy or he used to be when I was here. His humility he was never braggadocious never a me-guy. Quiet humble put his head down and worked.

‚ÄúBut he worked into more of a vocal leadership role.‚Äù

More though it was the small stuff that endeared him to his teammates and the city never more so than the 2014 home game against Jacksonville; his wife had given birth to their daughter earlier in the week and when Hilton scored a touchdown instead of doing the usual ‚ÄúT.Y.‚Äù celebration he mimicked rocking a baby to sleep.

It was the little things he did that were so big.

Like when Parris Campbell was working his way through a series of season-ending injuries that made him a rehab regular in the trainer‚Äôs room.

‚ÄúHe always made an extra effort to be there when I was there to support me and show me he was there for me‚Äù Campbell said. ‚ÄúWe got really close through those times. He went out of his way to show me he was there for me when he really didn‚Äôt need to do that. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôll always appreciate.‚Äù

The little things ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWe would go out to dinner and he would tip above and beyond way above and beyond and you‚Äôd see the waiter or waitress they have a big smile on their face‚Äù Campbell said ‚ÄúJust things like that. He was so good with people. He just likes to make people smile. He cares. Sometimes in this game people kind of lose sight of the human element. T.Y. is a great human who goes out of his way for a lot of different people in a lot of different ways.‚Äù

The little things ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHe showed me how to run routes at a controlled pace‚Äù Colts receiver Ashton Dulin said. ‚ÄúLike not everything has to be run at a hundred miles an hour. T.Y. was real savvy like that being able to run routes under control.‚Äù

The little things ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúCornhole‚Äù Dulin said with a smile. ‚ÄúI miss our (locker room) cornhole games.‚Äù

Hilton came along in the same 2012 draft as Andrew Luck and together the pair combined to become one of the league‚Äôs most dynamic passing combinations. He is the last remnant of the Ryan Grigson Era part of an amazing draft that helped the Colts go 11-5 in 2012 after a complete rebuild and a 2-14 season.

When Luck retired in 2019 he singled out Hilton as the reason he returned to football after missing the 2017 season.

‚ÄúI had more fun throwing the football to T.Y. than should be allowed probably‚Äù Luck said during his farewell address. ‚ÄúWhen I was away in 2017 for the latter half of the season I had to figure out why I wanted to come back to play football. And I boiled it simply down to the fact that I liked my friends and I loved throwing the ball to T.Y. Hilton. He‚Äôs the best football player I‚Äôve ever played with and he‚Äôs a better teammate than he is a football player.‚Äù

As a player and as a man Hilton was and is a civic treasure. If this is it ‚Äî ‚ÄúThanks for the memories‚Äù sounds a whole lot like a heartfelt goodbye ‚Äî Hilton will be recalled as one of the franchise‚Äôs all-time greats.

The Ring of Honor beckons.

With the sun shining drinks on the table and music in the air it looks like the young men in the video which has gone viral on Chinese social media have picked a great day for a picnic.

Dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts shorts and sandals and chatting jovially in Mandarin as they hunch over a controller and screen it‚Äôs hard to believe they could be up to anything shady ‚Äì until one of them shouts excitedly ‚ÄúI got a tank!‚Äù

But these men aren‚Äôt playing a computer game. They are flying drones over a military site on a nearby Taiwan-controlled island.

The 15-second video clip is among a number of videos that have popped up recently on the Chinese social media site Weibo and show what appear to be civilian-grade drones trolling Taiwan‚Äôs military. The island‚Äôs military later confirmed these mysterious menaces are indeed civilian drones from mainland China.

The videos show detailed drones‚Äô-eye footage of military installations and personnel on Taiwan‚Äôs outlying Kinmen islands. Accompanied by soundtracks ranging from ballads to dance music and plenty of emojis the clips seem designed to highlight the unpreparedness of Taiwan‚Äôs troops.

One video captures the moment four soldiers from Taiwan realize they are being watched by a drone that‚Äôs hovering in the sky above their guard post. Caught off guard they respond by throwing stones at the intruding drone which zooms in so close you can make out the faces of individual soldiers.

Video footage of these bizarre encounters has gone viral on Chinese social media and is attracting hundreds of comments mocking Taiwan‚Äôs military. The clips seems to expose a stunning vulnerability: the ability of Chinese drones to photograph restricted military sites in Taiwan at any time.

‚ÄòGray zone‚Äô warfare

Analysts say the footage being beamed across the internet ‚Äì showing military sites and personnel in fine detail for all the world to see ‚Äì is at best embarrassing for Taiwan and at worst outright dangerous.

The drone incursions come amid increased tensions following a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a self-governing democracy of nearly 24 million people in August.

That trip angered China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party ‚Äì which views Taiwan as part of its territory despite never having governed it ‚Äì and it responded by launching unprecedented military drills around the island sending warplanes across the Taiwan Strait and firing missiles over the main island.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has claimed the drone incursions are the latest ratcheting up of this pressure; a new front in China‚Äôs ‚Äúgray-zone‚Äù warfare tactics to intimidate the island. On September 1 after warning it would exercise its rights to self-defense Taiwan shot down a drone for the first time.

But provocative though the footage is it is difficult to be sure exactly who is behind the drone incursions.

Beijing has brushed off the drone incursions as ‚Äúno big deal.‚Äù Questioned about civilian-grade drones flying in the Kinmen area a spokesperson for China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently responded: ‚ÄúChinese drones flying over China‚Äôs territory ‚Äì what‚Äôs there to be surprised at?‚Äù

Fueling suspicions China hasn‚Äôt removed the videos from its otherwise highly censored internet or prevented the drones from traveling through its own highly controlled airspace.

Beijing also doesn‚Äôt appear to be interested in trying to punish those behind the footage; flying drones over domestic military sites is punishable by prison time.

‚ÄòDeniable harassment‚Äô

Isabel Hilton an international journalist and longtime China watcher said it was impossible to know who was piloting the drones ‚Äì and that was exactly what made them so well-suited to ‚Äúdeniable harassment.‚Äù

The machines appear to be civilian models but could ‚Äúbe operated by anybody including the military‚Äù said Hilton the founder of China Dialogue suggesting that ‚Äúgovernment agencies in the guise of a popular movement‚Äù could be behind the controls.

Hilton drew a parallel to events in the South China Sea where China has been accused of using a maritime militia to enforce its territorial claims by swarming disputed areas with hundreds of what are ostensibly civilian fishing boats.

Western experts say the militia ‚Äì sometimes dubbed China‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Blue Men‚Äù ‚Äì is funded and controlled by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army. China doesn‚Äôt acknowledge their existence and when questioned refers to them as a ‚Äúso-called maritime militia.‚Äù

In both arenas the ideal result for China is to gain an advantage ‚Äúwithout the military appearing to be involved‚Äù Hilton said.

‚ÄúWhether you‚Äôre using fishing boats or civilian drones it doesn‚Äôt look as though this is official policy. It doesn‚Äôt look like direct military harassment in the way that the incursion of a warplane does. And so it‚Äôs a deniable provocation.‚Äù

Hilton said not only did the drones serve reconnaissance purposes ‚Äì ‚Äúthey‚Äôre flying very low over military installations or taking very clear photographs of individually identifiable soldiers‚Äù ‚Äì they could also have a psychological impact on the soldiers who ‚Äúfind their faces very clearly put up on Chinese social media where they are liable to be insulted and where people are liable to call for them to be killed.‚Äù Taiwan‚Äôs media have reported that such exposure could hurt the morale of the island‚Äôs soldiers.

‚ÄúThis is all very demoralizing for Taiwanese and it‚Äôs kept at a level which is designed not to let Taiwan relax not to let Taiwan forget the threat‚Äù Hilton said.

‚Äú(It‚Äôs) designed to remind Taiwan that there‚Äôs no escape from Chinese pressure and that in the end China will take over. That‚Äôs the purpose.‚Äù

Trolls with drones

But not everybody suspects the invisible hand of China‚Äôs military.

Paul Huang a research fellow at the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation a non-profit non-governmental think tank thinks that the drones are operated by private civilians who ‚Äúmaybe out of curiosity maybe out of nationalism‚Äù want to provoke Taiwan.

‚ÄúFlying that close to a Taiwanese military guard post and catching their attention ‚Ä¶That‚Äôs not really the way any military would deploy or utilize their drones. And frankly I don‚Äôt see any good reason that the (People‚Äôs Liberation Army) would even attempt something like that‚Äù Huang said.

Still where he and Hilton agree is that Beijing could stop the drone incursions if it wanted to ‚Äì but it doesn‚Äôt because it sees an advantage in letting them continue.

‚ÄúBeijing (sees the incursions) as an attempt by their own population to troll Taiwan to provoke Taiwan to make fun of Taiwan‚Äôs incompetence. They treat it as a propaganda victory‚Äù Huang said.

China Dialogue‚Äôs Hilton said Beijing is ‚Äúdefinitely playing a double game here.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeijing as we know controls its own domestic internet it controls domestic airspace. If this is happening it‚Äôs because the government wishes it to happen.‚Äù

Changing threat

Taiwan has faced the threat of invasion ever since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs defeated Nationalists fled there to set up a new government having been chased out of the mainland by Mao Zedong‚Äôs Communist Party.

More than 70 years later the Communist Party continues to view Taiwan as something akin to a breakaway province that must be ‚Äúreunified‚Äù with the mainland at all costs ‚Äì and it has made clear it is prepared to use force if necessary to fulfill that objective.

If China were to invade the Kinmen islands ‚Äì most of which have been controlled by Taiwan since the end of the war ‚Äì would make a tempting first target. Lying just a few miles from the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen ‚Äì and hundreds of miles from Taiwan‚Äôs capital Taipei ‚Äì they are acutely vulnerable.

It‚Äôs for this reason that for the past seven decades beaches in Kinmen have been lined with countless iron spikes designed to make any amphibious assault as costly as possible to an invading force.

For Taiwan the problem is that the nature of that invading force is changing.

The Kinmen islands‚Äô proximity to the mainland puts them well within the range of commercially available drones which are cheap and plentiful in China home to the world‚Äôs second largest market for the machines and no shortage of potential operators among its population of 1.4 billion.

And while iron spikes might be useful in a beach invasion they will not do much against a drone operator trolling Taiwan‚Äôs military from the safety of a Xiamen park.

Fighting back

Still Huang said Beijing may come to regret failing to rein in the trolls whoever they are.

He said Taiwan could ask DJI the China-based manufacturer whose logo appeared in a few of the trolling videos to make the Kinmen islands a restricted area in its database ‚Äì a move that would prevent operators from being able to fly the drones there.

If DJI refused to comply Taiwan could exclude it from its market ‚Äì dealing a further blow to a company that has already been added to a US investment blacklist due to its alleged links to the Chinese state. DJI the world‚Äôs top drone maker declined to comment to CNN for this article.

And Beijing‚Äôs ‚Äúpropaganda victory‚Äù may come with other unintended ‚Äì and unwanted ‚Äì consequences.

Shortly after the series of drone incursions Taiwan‚Äôs Ministry of National Defense announced that the island would deploy a new anti-drone system at military bases beginning next year. It also announced plans to boost its overall defense budget to a record $19.4 billion a 13.9% increase over 2022.

‚Äú(China) doesn‚Äôt really see a problem as of yet which I think they should because this could lead to escalation that they didn‚Äôt want. If they want to be in control they better control these civilian drone operators first‚Äù Huang said.

Taiwan meanwhile appears to have realized that ignoring the drones and their mystery operators is not an option. Within days of shooting down its first drone it released a series of pictures to the media showcasing its shiny new anti-drone weapons. It appeared to be sending its own propaganda message: next time the drones come calling it will be ready.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L3N1aXRlLXNhdHVyZGF5cy1tYXN0ZXItc3VpdGUtaGlsdG9uLW1leGljby1jaXR5LXJlZm9ybWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suite Saturdays: Master Suite @ Hilton Mexico City Reforma,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/09/17/suite-saturdays-master-suite-hilton-mexico-city-reforma/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3L3N1aXRlLXNhdHVyZGF5cy1tYXN0ZXItc3VpdGUtaGlsdG9uLW1leGljby1jaXR5LXJlZm9ybWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Srebotnik 41 was part of an emotional retirement ceremony during championship Sunday at the Zavarovalnica Sava Portoroz in her home country of Slovenia.

Srebotnik received video congratulations from many stars during the ceremony including WTA Legends Billie Jean King Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles along with her frequent doubles partners Kveta Peschke and Ai Sugiyama. She also received a framed collage commemorating her numerous career highlights.

After the ceremony Srebotnik responded:

""Many thanks to the tournament organizers for such a beautiful ceremony.

""In my career I experienced many beautiful and some less pleasant moments and today's farewell day is definitely one of the most difficult ones. Although I knew that this moment is inevitable for every athlete it took me quite some time to accept it deep inside. This decision was difficult for me mainly because tennis has been my great passion since the age of 7 and because it has given me so many extraordinary and unforgettable moments which I will cherish forever. I can proudly say that even at the age of 41 my feelings remain the same. This is also the main reason why I competed for so long - not because I had to but because I enjoyed every second of it. And to be completely honest I will miss competitive tennis.

""A big thank you to the WTA which gives the opportunity to female tennis players all over the world to be a part of this wonderful tour and I'm proud that we have such an amazing association. Thank you as well to the entire WTA staff and medical team who always ensure that the players are optimally prepared for their matches.

""There have been many people on my tennis journey who have helped me achieve my goals and I would like to thank each and every one of them but unfortunately I cannot name everyone in this statement. Thanks to all the coaches tennis clubs sponsors and media that have been part of my career.

""I would especially like to thank my family because without their support I would not be where I am today. Thanks to my parents for all the love and support I received for never doubting me and for letting me live my dreams. And thanks also to my sister for never complaining when my tennis was a priority. I will always be grateful for everything.

""Last but not least a sincere thank you to all the fans who have supported me throughout my career and for picking me up when I was down and then carrying me high when I was on a winning streak.

""Despite the emotions that are present today deep down inside I am smiling and happy because I am very proud of everything I have achieved. I look forward to the next chapter.""

During her 23-year pro career Srebotnik won 39 Hologic WTA Tour doubles titles including 2011 Wimbledon (with Kveta Peschke). Following that Grand Slam triumph Srebotnik rose to WTA Doubles World No.1 for the first time. She held the top spot for a total of 10 weeks during her career.

Srebotnik also had a fruitful singles career winning four WTA singles titles -- her first at age 17 -- and reaching a career-high ranking of World No.20. She can boast of 27 wins over Top 10 players in singles and she reached the second week at Grand Slam singles events three times.

The Slovene is also a five-time Grand Slam mixed doubles champion capturing three titles at Roland Garros and one each at the Australian and US Opens.

Her early achievements in each discipline were recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records last year when she was lauded for being the first tennis player to win the first singles doubles and mixed doubles events they played in at tour level -- a feat still unmatched by any player female or male.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9tYXJ5LWotYmxpZ2Utc2V0cy10aGUtdG9uZS1vbi1vcGVuaW5nLW5pZ2h0LW9mLWdvb2QtbW9ybmluZy1nb3JnZW91cy10b3VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary J.

Fashion Square is still doing business as usual continuing with new tenants and leases according to documents filed with the Albemarle County Planning Department. Mall officials have said retailers currently in the mall will continue with their leases.

Court documents obtained by Sean Tubbs of Town Crier Productions and shared with The Daily Progress show that the mall has new tenants slated to come into the shopping center while others may leave.

Among those coming into the mall is the Jefferson Area Board for Aging which plans to open a 2500 square-foot Medicare Insurance Counseling office in the mall‚Äôs south wing next to the Eddie Bauer store.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to be able to offer in-person counseling for this open enrollment season and [we‚Äôre] grateful to the new landlord for working with us‚Äù said Randy Rodgers JABA‚Äôs insurance counseling program manager. ‚ÄúTo be able to provide more people this important service we needed a bigger space. And having this site at Fashion Square Mall along with Zoom and phone appointments we hope to be able to help several thousand people.‚Äù

Mall officials confirmed this week that Home Depot the Georgia-based home improvement big box retailer with more than $150 billion in revenue purchased the mall with the exception of the women‚Äôs Belk store and the former JCPenney storefront. The mens‚Äô Belk storefront which is separate from the women‚Äôs store is included in the purchase.

Home Depot‚Äôs national competitor Lowe‚Äôs has a retail outlet about a mile away from the mall.

Attempts to reach Home Depot for comment on the sale or plans for the mall have been unsuccessful. The purchase price has not been announced.

Home Depot and the local holding company that purchased the mall at a July 2021 foreclosure auction on the county courthouse steps entered into a sale agreement on July 8 of this year with a July 31 effective date according to Tubbs.

Tubbs has been a reporter for local news organizations for 30 years. He now produces the Charlottesville Community Engagement newsletter and podcast.

On Sept. 2 the Charlottesville Circuit Court recorded three documents between Home Depot USA and Charlottesville JP 2014-CP the holding company that previously owned it.

One of the documents is a Deed of Bargain and Sale with no clear sale price and another is a detailed list of parcels affected. Another document releases Home Depot from a ground lease and sublease that governs the property.

That document references the bankruptcy of Sears Roebuck and Company which anchored one end of the mall and was part of the original operating agreement for the shopping center.

Sears declared Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 2018 and closed the Albemarle County store early the next year.

Online records at Albemarle County do not show an updated ownership of the mall. Those records often lag behind however.

County assessor records show the land on which the mall sits is assessed at $8796000 as of Jan. 1. The building and improvements on the site are assessed at $7329900 for a total assessed valuation of $16125900.

The assessed value is what the county uses to determine tax bills.

In a separate transaction Fashion Square Assets LLC a company associated with developer Richard Hewitt purchased the former JCPenney space on Sept. 10 2020.

Earlier this summer Albemarle County agreed to rent a portion of the space for use as a public safety center including vehicle parking and bays for maintenance.

Albemarle County Fire Rescue maintenance crews would be at the site and Albemarle County police will station the department‚Äôs traffic unit there.

The county will pay $3.1 million to refit the site and $558000 for the first year‚Äôs rent.

The sale is the latest in a series of ownership changes for the once-bustling 570000-square-foot indoor shopping center that has struggled for relevance in the wake of online sales and the pandemic.

Built in the early 1980s the mall was once the moving force in retail sales in Central Virginia. Like other indoor malls across the country its popularity faded as people switched to online purchases and many retailers left or went bankrupt between 2015 and 2021.

The mall was purchased by Simon Property Group in 1997. It was assigned to Simon‚Äôs spin-off company Washington Prime Group in 2014. The spin-off company held Simon‚Äôs strip center business and smaller enclosed malls. It merged with Glimcher Realty Trust in January 2015 and became WP Glimcher.

In late 2019 the mortgage loan secured by Fashion Square was transferred to special servicing after the borrower notified the lender that future projected cash flows will be insufficient to ensure future compliance with the mortgage loan.

After a request by Midland Loan Services the special servicer for Fashion Square a judge in March 2020 approved the appointment of a special servicer. In 2021 the mall was sold at auction back to the lender after defaulting on the loan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5mcm9udHJvdy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS9lbGVtZW50b3ItMTg2NjcxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jorge Sedano Expands His ESPN Role Into College Football With Curiosity And Willingness,"The initiatives I‚Äôm most proud of at the Walt Disney Company/ESPN are the continued efforts toward diversity and inclusion.

According to a filing on the Los Angeles City Planning Commission website Home Depot wants to build a 130000-square-foot store. The new development would mean that about 13 other businesses would be lost.

The Granada Hills South Neighborhood Council hosted a town hall this weekend. Several dozen neighbors showed up to express their anger over the proposal. They say the new store would create too much disruption to their neighborhood.

Chinese Parts Found in F-35 Jet May Spell Trouble,"If additional components of Chinese origin are discovered in Lockheed Martin‚Äôs F-35 Lightning II its production may be seriously jeopardized.

The Pentagon is suspending all deliveries of the F-35 fighter jet after discovering materials from China in the aircraft‚Äôs supply chain. This is a major blow to the F-35 program which has been plagued with significant problems since its inception.

This setback is likely to delay production at a time when more orders are coming in amid Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and the remilitarization of Europe.

The aircraft component is a cobalt and samarium alloy used in the turbomachine pumps and it poses no major risk to Lockheed Martin‚Äôs flagship program. Replacing this component should be quite simple since it does not transmit data or seem to be a technologically advanced element.

However until all suppliers are fully screened it cannot be ruled out that there is another Chinese-made component on the aircraft.

The core technology is provided by Lockheed Martin but if smaller suppliers report more controversial components the whole F-35 program could be dramatically affected.

Just like Honeywell the supplier that let this Chinese component slip through there could be many more security breaches in the F-35 supply chain. The stealth fighter is made up of over 300000 parts from about 1700 suppliers. Therefore checking every component of the F-35 is going to be challenging and time-consuming.

With this massive task ahead it is hard to know how long F-35 production will be halted. The effects will be felt beyond the production line and impact several foreign air forces on the waiting list to receive the aircraft.

This massive technological security breach not only affects the United States but also all its NATO allies. The F-35 fighter is currently in high demand so stopping production will leave hundreds of orders on standby from countries such as Australia Israel Japan South Korea and the United Kingdom.

Additionally finding more components from China in the supply chain would make the entire program stumble. Relying on Chinese materials to manufacture the F-35 is a major threat to the future of the fifth-generation stealth fighter program.

China is directly competing with the United States in the development of fifth-generation aircraft and could sabotage the F-35‚Äôs production to benefit its Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter. Moreover amid a U.S.-China arms race relying on the goodwill of the Chinese government is a major handicap for the U.S. military‚Äôs flagship project.

In any case this is not the F-35‚Äôs first problem. The fifth-generation fighter has been plagued by cost overruns and delays over the last few years as well as multiple design flaws. For instance the U.S. military recently grounded part of its F-35 fleet after discovering a problem with the aircraft‚Äôs ejection seats. The issue was discovered during a routine inspection of the aircraft and affects a batch of ejection seats manufactured by the British firm Martin Baker.

However the most pressing concern now is determining how this Chinese component ended up in the most sophisticated aircraft operated by the United States today and what steps can be taken to prevent it in the future.

Despite these challenges the F-35 has been hailed as a game-changer and touted by the Pentagon as a key part of its defense plans.

Two days later it was announced that the F-35 Joint Production Office would seek a waiver without which the production run of over 140 airframes per year could be placed at serious risk.

Far from an isolated development this reflected part of broader and growing difficulties the United States military has had with its industrial supply chains as a result of the contraction of U.S. defense and civilian industries since the end of the Cold War. The shrinking of these industries has made foreign inputs particularly from East Asia increasingly indispensable for key U.S. weapons programs.

As the world‚Äôs largest-ever weapons program the future backbone of NATO and allied fleets and for years the only fighter the U.S. Air Force was acquiring the F-35 serves as a potent symbol of a wider trends affecting the United States‚Äô defense sector and its post-Cold War weapons programs. Its turbomachine pump is hardly the first part of the aircraft found to be reliant on Chinese inputs. Indeed the Pentagon previously provided a waiver to allow their use in the fighter program‚Äôs early stages as not doing so would have caused unacceptable delays to a development effort already several years late. This was despite China which has since emerged as the only other country to field indigenous fifth generation fighters already widely being considered the primary target of future F-35 deployments highlighting the country‚Äôs centrality in supply chains for high tech products.

Alongside China further very significant inputs into the F-35 have long been sourced from Taiwan which is permitted to remain a key supplier due to the indispensability of its world-leading electronics and semiconductor industries. It also does not include the reliance on inputs from firms located in friendly countries that are under Chinese ownership ‚Äì a notable example being British-built core circuit boards which Lockheed Martin initially denied were from a Chinese-owned firm before this was confirmed in 2019.

There is a not insignificant chance that further Chinese inputs into the F-35 will be discovered in future particularly as U.S. firms have in the past sought to disguise the Chinese origins of their products to supply the military ‚Äì Adventura Technologies being a notable example. This is aside from inputs of rare earth minerals from China; if supplies were cut it could seriously hinder the program. China provides over 85 percent of the world‚Äôs rare earths and approximately 417 kilograms of them are required to produce each F-35.

As a consequence of the tectonic shift in global industry and high tech toward East Asia analysts at the National Interest questioned in 2018 ‚Äúwhether it is even possible anymore to make purely American weapons‚Äù highlighting the low feasibility of reshoring production to the United States. Defense journalist Brett Tingley was among many to underline three years later: ‚Äúcurrently the U.S. is almost entirely reliant on foreign-made electronics to power most of its technologies both in the defense and consumer sectors.‚Äù He stressed that this had very significant implications both for civilian high tech‚Äôs ability to compete as well as for the defense sector. Since globalization of tech supply chains and a decline a civilian high-tech manufacturing in the 1990s coincided with a shrinking defense budget and thus an increasing impetus toward outsourcing the self-reliance of the U.S. defense sector has been in sharp decline.

A notable result was the widespread opposition to calls in the 2000s for regulations mandating a return to reduced foreign inputs into products going to the Pentagon. In 2003 for example the Aerospace Industries Association opposed calls for greater reliance on U.S.-made equipment on the basis that restricting foreign imports would not only significantly raise the costs but would also prevent access to many of the most advanced electronics and information technologies. Flat panel displays which were no longer made in the United States were highlighted as an example. As the discrepancies between U.S. and East Asian high-tech industries and that of China in particular continued to grow this issue has only become more serious.

Industrial trends not only place American supply chains at greater risk particularly in wartime but also place Chinese defense products at an advantage due to the much larger scale of R&D and larger civilian industrial base and scale of high-tech manufacturing which they can draw from. Flat panel displays are but one example of a key input that can be sourced locally for China‚Äôs J-20 stealth fighter but cannot for the F-35. Greater concentration of high-tech manufacturing has also been repeatedly linked to greater levels of innovation the results of which will likely become more conspicuous over the coming decade.

Industrial trends portend that the U.S. defense sector will face not only greater difficulties ensuring components come from politically favorable actors but also greater struggles in keeping up with advances in Chinese armaments and the degree of supply chain security they enjoy. Meanwhile the incentives to disguise the origins of Chinese and other East Asian inputs for U.S. weapons systems will continue to grow as it becomes more difficult and more costly to source inputs locally ‚Äì an issue compounded by the fact that even today‚Äôs friendly overseas suppliers may in future be seen as less reliable.

The key to the United States‚Äô ability to produce world leading weapons systems during the Cold War was its central position in global high tech and the near unrivaled scale of its advanced industries positions which have fast diminished since the 1990s and continue to do so. Reliance on foreign inputs for its weapons programs and the strong incentives firms will have to integrate Chinese and other foreign technologies and components into them is but one of the many consequences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3J1c3NpYXMtc3UtNTctYmV0dGVyLXRoYW4tYm90aC11cy1mLTIyLWYtMzUtc3RlYWx0aC1maWdodGVycy_SAVtodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9ydXNzaWFzLXN1LTU3LWJldHRlci10aGFuLWJvdGgtdXMtZi0yMi1mLTM1LXN0ZWFsdGgtZmlnaHRlcnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If 22+35=57 Is Russia‚Äôs Su-57 Warplane Better Than Both US‚Äô F-22 Raptor & F-35 Stealth Fighters?,"As the Pentagon for now has stalled accepting any more F-35 Lighting II stealth fighters following the discovery of a Chinese-made part in its engine debates about the plane‚Äôs effectiveness against its equivalent Russia‚Äôs Su-57 have again sprung up.

While US and Russian experts vouch for their warplanes experts have extolled the virtues of the Su-57.

Reports stated that an alloy in the F-35‚Äôs engine‚Äôs ‚Äòturbomachine‚Äô manufactured by Honeywell came from China. Defense authorities have clarified that the part does not transmit information while alternatives were being arranged as acceptance of fresh deliveries of the jet has been paused.

Su-57 Vs. F-35 ‚Äì Who Wins?

It is indeed true that the Su-57 is a competent aircraft with shallow observability features powerful engines greater payload and even crazier maneuverability. The defining feature of the ‚Äòfused wing and body‚Äô Generation 5 jet is the radar array spread all around the aircraft allowing it to practically ‚Äòlook‚Äô in all directions possible.

In November 2018 Chief Designer and Director of the Sukhoi Design Bureau Mikhail Strelets claimed that the Su-57 could fully perform air-to-air and air-to-ground tasks unlike the F-22 and F-35 which were designed for a particular role.

The F-22 was mainly found incapable of carrying larger air-to-ground munitions in its internal bays after the Americans realized the constraints imposed by a purely air-superiority/air dominance fighter.

Strelets then pointed to the coincidence of the sum of 22 and 35 is 57 maintaining that they ‚Äúspecifically didn‚Äôt choose‚Äù the numerical designation for their jet.

Then in January 2021 renowned test pilot Magomed Tolboyev claimed the Su-57 could easily beat the F-35 in a ‚Äòdogfight‚Äô owing to its extreme ‚Äòsupermanoeuvrability‚Äô of which the F-35 is ‚Äúsimply incapable.‚Äù

But Tolboyev admitted that the F-35 possesses the ‚Äúelectronic might.‚Äù He said electronic warfare could be disrupted by factors like solar flares and how the era of ‚Äòdogfights‚Äô is a pass√©.

Tolboyev might have been referring to the massive computing sensor fusion sensor data processing and data linking capabilities of the F-35 besides the full aspect of ‚Äòpure stealth.‚Äô

In a previous interaction with EurAsian Times Billie Flynn an F-35 test pilot described it as a ‚Äúdata-gathering spaceship with 8.6 million lines of software code.‚Äù

American techno-military doctrine in general and Flynn in particular consider this the biggest game-changer that allows the individual pilot to make the most informed tactical decision primarily while operating with other allied F-35s.

‚ÄúIt is the capability to mesh all the data and sensors to give the pilot a simplified prioritized display of knowledge of the battlespace. No data or information but knowledge of what is out there in the battlespace‚Äù Flynn said.

The emphasis on the term implies a distinct discernible picture of the battlefield they do not have to sit and analyze.

Its complete stealth combined with a powerful radar sensors and deadly EW capabilities also would allow it to break the ‚Äòattrition‚Äô cat-and-mouse game. ‚ÄúThe F-35 can detect the enemy first shoot first turn around and speed away‚Äù Flynn explains.

Flynn adds that the Ukraine war was precisely designed for the environment for which the F-35 was designed.

According to an IAF aviation expert who did not wish to be quoted the Su-57 has six radars spread all around its airframe in place of the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) sported by the F-35.

This system was pioneered on the Su-35 Flanker E Gen. 4++ fighters that entered service in 2014 where the jet‚Äôs nose carried the Irbis-E electronic-cum-mechanical scanning radar.

But the two N036B-1-0-1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) L-band radar sensors in the wings‚Äô leading edges enhance the Su-35‚Äôs long-range detection capability.

Adopted onto the Su-57 the six radars distributed across its airframe allow it to track 60 targets simultaneously from its rear and sides and operate in different wavelengths to detect stealth aircraft.

It also carries the K-77M 200-kilometer range Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile one of the few in the world to carry an AESA seeker.

Signals its transceivers receive are digitally processed allowing the K-77M to immediately respond to sharp and fast maneuvering targets and maintain a high ‚Äòhit probability.‚Äô Whichever plane wins a mere tactical victory in the air will mean nothing without a complete political and strategic success."

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui ‚Äî the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani ‚Äî continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million ‚Äî which was up 17% year over year ‚Äî and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

SCORE HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook $2177 at HP Pros Great look and feel

Fantastic video conferencing experience

Thunderbolt 4

4G LTE/5G wireless available

Haptic touchpad and spill-resistant keyboard

Extra security with vPro Cons USI pen not included with all configurations

Palm rejection could be better

Made for business and priced that way

HP Google and Intel set out to create a complete Chromebook for enterprise more than two years ago. A Chromebook that didn't have just a couple of important features but all of the features business users wanted. The Elite Dragonfly Chromebook is the result a legit ChromeOS dream machine for hybrid workers.

Josh Goldman/CNET

But despite the Elite Dragonfly Chromebook's greatness it's probably not for you. Again this is primarily designed for businesses. Of course for consumer Chromebook converts who already know the right combo of web Android and Linux apps needed to get their work done the Elite Dragonfly is perfect for being productive anywhere.

Unless your IT department is handing one of these beauties over to you though the price is likely going to be a deterrent. The Elite Dragonfly Chromebook starts at $1149. The custom configuration HP sent us for review is more than $1500 however and it's an enterprise model with an Intel Core i5 vPro processor -- a first for Chromebooks -- to increase security (which is already strong on Chromebooks). Enterprise versions also get a year of Parallels for Chromebook for those who might need legacy software. For commercial use you might want a vPro chip but otherwise the base model is going to be plenty for most Chromebook users. It doesn't include HP's excellent wireless rechargeable pen and it also doesn't support the pen available for HP's Chromebook x2 11.

HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook Price as reviewed $1519 Display size/resolution 13.5-inch 2256x1504 touch display CPU Intel Core i5-1245U vPro Memory ‚Äé8GB LPDDR4X 4266 MHz Storage 256GB NVMe PCIe SSD Connections Thunderbolt 4 USB-C (x2) USB-A HDMI 2.0 out microSD slot 3.5mm combo audio jack Networking Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) Bluetooth 5.2 4G LTE/5G optional Operating system ChromeOS/Android 11 AUE June 2030

Complete collaborative experience

One of the main things HP Google and Intel focused on with the Elite Dragonfly Chromebook was the collaborative experience. Most manufacturers in the past year bumped up the webcam resolution on premium Chromebooks from 720p to 1080p aka HD to full HD. HP did that putting a 5-megapixel webcam in the Dragonfly. But it also uses image processing developed originally for Google Pixel phone cameras. There is HDR processing going on in the background to balance out strong shadows as well as blown-out highlights.

Thanks to HDR algorithms from Pixel phones the Dragonfly's webcam delivers great results with backlit subjects. Josh Goldman/CNET

For example the picture above is a screenshot of the Dragonfly's webcam. I'm sitting in a room only lit by the window behind me. While the image is slightly soft and noisy because of the low-light conditions of the room it's by no means bad. More importantly the color is accurate and I'm not shrouded in shadows and the building outside the window is visible not entirely blown out by sunlight. Try this with just about any other built-in webcam and you'd never get an image like this.

And while many laptops will kick on their fans a few seconds into a conference call the Elite Dragonfly stays silent because of how optimized it is for the task. Add in strong noise cancellation for the built-in mics and clear clean audio from its top-firing speakers and video calls are actually pleasurable. Plus there's a physical privacy shutter on the camera and a mic mute button on the keyboard for when you don't want to be seen or heard.

A built-in shutter lets you quickly block the webcam. Josh Goldman/CNET

Performance to get you through the day

The 12th-gen Intel Core i5 processor is a champ getting me through typical workdays using a mix of Chrome and progressive web apps for Microsoft Office and Zoom Adobe Creative Cloud apps from the Play store and the Linux app for Slack. As I mentioned earlier that this is the first VPro Chromebook but it's an Intel Evo laptop too. The two combined mean the Dragonfly meets certain standards for design and performance.

Evo is essentially a guarantee the Chromebook has a thin-and-light body (it weighs less than 3 pounds) has all-day battery life (10 hours 56 minutes on our streaming video test) instant-on performance when you lift the lid and fast wireless. With VPro it adds enhanced security namely total memory encryption (TME) and KeyLocker. HP also included a fingerprint reader on the keyboard deck for additional security though I would rather have it integrated into the power button on the left side of the body for when the two-in-one is in tablet or stand mode.

Haptic touchpad spill-resistant keyboard tall display

HP started talking with Google more than four years ago about adding a haptic touchpad to Chromebooks. Coincidentally the talks dovetailed with Google's desire to improve the keyboard and trackpad experience overall for Chromebook users. The basic idea: create a premium device with a touchpad so good you won't need to carry around a travel mouse.

The keyboard is comfortable and the haptic touchpad is big and responsive. Josh Goldman/CNET

The Elite Dragonfly's haptic touchpad (another first for Chromebooks) feels like a traditional click and not like a vibration you'd get from a phone or tablet display. Plus you get the same click feel regardless of where you press on the pad. The strength is adjustable but even maxed out it's not aggressive. I do wish there was some way to increase palm rejection though because I regularly ended up dragging the cursor on the screen while typing.

The haptics work for other ChromeOS actions giving you a little buzz when you switch between virtual desktops for example or when you snap a window to one side of the display. Google also has plans to build out haptic integration into other areas such as Google Workspace apps. Having this touchpad makes the Elite Dragonfly Chromebook that much more attractive for work.

There's not much to say about the backlit keyboard beyond that it's spacious and comfortable to type on for an extended time. I also appreciate that HP made the function keys a little smaller to squeeze in buttons for the keyboard backlight playing/pausing media and muting the mic.

The stylus tools menu shows you the battery life for the Elite Dragonfly's USI pen. Josh Goldman/CNET

As I mentioned earlier my Dragonfly included an excellent USI pen for taking notes or drawing on the display. It wirelessly charges on the right side of the Chromebook. It magnetically snaps to the side and starts charging and it attaches strongly enough to store that way.

The 3:2 display is close to the size of a standard sheet of paper making it nice for note-taking. It's also tall so you can fit more vertically on the screen for less scrolling while you work. It wasn't quite bright enough to use outdoors without fighting reflections but it was manageable. HP does offer a 1000-nit panel which would be the way to go for frequently working outdoors. Plus it features HP's privacy screen to block people from seeing what's on the display from an off angle.

The Dragonfly Chromebook can be directly connected to an external display by HDMI or USB-C. Josh Goldman/CNET

While the display keyboard and touchpad are excellent sometimes it's just more comfortable to work on a big display and use a full-size keyboard and mouse. The Elite Dragonfly Chromebook has a Thunderbolt 4 port on each side. That means you can not only charge from either side but connect to a docking station like the HP Elite Thunderbolt Dock G4 for a single cable connection to all your peripherals for quickly getting to work.

The dock adds an Ethernet port for the Dragonfly for a wired web connection while working at a desk. But the Chromebook has top-flight wireless too with Wi-Fi 6E as well as optional 4G LTE and even 5G support (yet another first for a Chromebook).

A Chromebook crystal ball

Josh Goldman/CNET

Chromebooks were somewhat indistinguishable for several years after they first arrived in 2011. But as ChromeOS matured higher-end Chromebooks started to show up more regularly. Although even these premium models topped out at around $500 except for the occasional showpiece. The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook is a showpiece loaded with several design and technology pieces that will find their way into future Chromebooks for both business and personal use. It carries a hefty price tag that is likely too much for most people considering a Chromebook even a premium model. But it's also worth every penny.

Still if it's too much the next best options right now are the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 or the slightly less expensive Spin 513. You can also check out our list of top Chromebooks that we've tested.

Despite the differences in each VR headset they actually have a lot in common right down to similar price points. (Though Meta recently hiked theirs up .)

To determine the best VR headset in this goggle-to-goggle eyeball-to-eyeball face-off we put these top-tier competitors through the ringer Matrix-style. Read on to see which VR platform gives you the most bang for your virtual buck ‚Äî and why.

Round 1: Game / App library

Whether you‚Äôre considering one of the best VR headsets for work or (more likely) play the app store is always a good place to start your research. After all even the beefiest of specs on the best gaming laptops and best VR-ready laptops won‚Äôt do much good if the apps and games you desire reside on another platform.

Sorry Meta users this particular apocalypse ain‚Äôt for you. (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

As of this writing there were roughly 5700 VR-only apps and games available on Steam and only 1345 in the Oculus Store. Whereas I could frolic amid famously familiar franchises like Fallout VR and Skyrim VR with the Reverb G2 once I began downloading those massive installation files I could see where the hefty minimum requirements come into play; Fallout VR alone took up roughly 25GB of storage on my laptop which always ran hot as‚Ä¶well nuclear fallout during gameplay. (In contrast the app for Song in the Smoke ‚Äî a deceivingly simple caveman simulation game ‚Äî is only 2GB if you download it directly to the Quest 2 and 8.1GB if you download it separately to your laptop via the Oculus Link app.)

Winner: HP Reverb G2

From a developer standpoint VR games and apps made exclusively for the well-out-of-beta Steam platform tend to be more resource-heavy which explains why so many of them aren‚Äôt exactly wireless-friendly. (The Meta Quest 2 headset only has 256GB of onboard memory after all which would fill up pretty quickly if apps were 25GB each.) Nevertheless Steam has been around for roughly two decades making it more appealing to both early adopters and hardcore gamers alike.

That being said VR newbies will be plenty pleased by the myriad apps and games available on the Oculus Store and for anyone looking to dip their virtual toes into the metaverse you may appreciate the built-in community features that Meta‚Äôs been working on lately ‚Äî such as their new Horizon Worlds tools .

Round 2: Side-by-side specs

As you can see in the chart below the HP Reverb G2 gives users a wider field of view and higher-res imaging overall but that Windows-only headset requires the proper hardware to run it ( including a top-notch GPU ) and you‚Äôre necessarily tethered to your tech via the bundled 6-meter cable which can be somewhat unwieldy depending on your play area ‚Äî and VR titles of choice. (Pro tip: it‚Äôs easy to get your arms tangled up if you‚Äôre waving them around with an invisible sword in hand.)

However while the Meta Quest 2 is technically wireless out of the box you can connect it to your computer via a USB cable (and the Oculus Link desktop app ) for a notable performance boost ‚Äî if your Windows system meets the minimum requirements which are similar to the Reverb G2.

Winner: Tie

There‚Äôs something to be said for the Quest 2‚Äôs wonderfully wireless offerings but once you‚Äôve connected the headset to your PC and installed the Oculus Link desktop app you can toggle the refresh rate between 72Hz 80Hz 90Hz and 120Hz and adjust the render resolution between 2432 x 1216 and 5408 x 2736. (There also tends to be additional graphics settings within the games themselves that are notably absent in the wireless versions.) This manual performance boost gives Meta the extra edge for casual VR gamers in comparison to the Reverb G2‚Äôs native resolution of 4320 x 2160 ‚Äî which is fantastic but‚Ä¶not wireless.

Round 3: Design and comfort

User beware: if you purchase the Meta Quest 2 headset with that floppy default strap you might be turned off to the whole VR experience in no time flat. The Elite Strap (a $60 upsell) is exponentially more comfortable ‚Äî especially for fast-twitch gaming ‚Äî and it cradles the back of your head more ergonomically holding the whole headset securely in place as you flail about. The Elite Strap with Battery gives you double the juice for double the price ($120) which might be worth the extra spend if your pockets are deep enough.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

HP put plenty of thought into the Reverb G2‚Äôs overall ergonomics and according to their website they‚Äôve made some subtle adjustments from the previous model. In my testing the padded cranial cradle was just as comfortable for longer VR sessions as the Quest 2 but it took more trial-and-error to position all three straps to their optimal lengths; the main cable hangs off the back and it‚Äôs admittedly cumbersome but not overly so.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Both headsets have built-in interpupillary distance sliders which you can adjust on the fly for optimized comfort but the Reverb G2 features bonafide external speakers for slightly more robust soundscapes.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

In a side-by-side comparison you won‚Äôt find much difference between HP‚Äôs and Meta‚Äôs controllers and that‚Äôs a good thing. They both have a similar shape and similar button/joystick placement. All par for the course at the end of a beautiful day in the metaverse.

Winner: Meta Quest 2

By a virtual hair. The overall ergonomics are nearly identical but Meta‚Äôs wireless capabilities give the Quest 2 an absolute edge ‚Äî if you splurge for the Elite Strap that is.

Round 4: Setup process

Setting up each of these headsets really illustrated how much more family-friendly the Quest 2 is in comparison to the Reverb G2. Whereas getting started with Meta‚Äôs headset is just a matter of charging it up; turning it on; pairing the controllers; setting up your Meta account; and hitting the ‚Äòverse HP‚Äôs setup process is a bit more involved even if you don‚Äôt hit any software snags.

Or literal ones. (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Once you‚Äôve confirmed your laptop meets all of the minimum specs to run the Reverb G2 properly you'll need a Steam account to pair it with. The headset also requires its own power source (via wall outlet) and it connects to your laptop via USB-C and DisplayPort. Long-story-long: if you opt for the Reverb G2 you might have some extra troubleshooting to do during setup. (Just think of it as a real-world boss fight if that helps pass the time.)

Winner: Meta Quest 2

The Reverb G2‚Äôs setup process is logical enough but it‚Äôs not nearly as intuitive as the Quest 2 platform which is practically ready to use right out of the box. Well played Meta.

Round 5: Overall performance

Logistics and hardware aside what sort of VR experience do these goggles have to offer anyway? That‚Äôs the question of the hour. As mentioned above the Meta Quest 2 goggles can be plugged into your laptop via a USB-C cable for a sizable performance boost. (And VR-style access to your desktop which is neat.) This sacrifices that aforementioned mobility of course but the extra oomph makes a difference for more photorealistic games such as The Climb (a rock-climbing simulation). Just remember if you max out all the visual settings you‚Äôll likely see a drop in frame rates across the board.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

In my testing with an HP ZBook Fury 17 G8  a Xeon-powered laptop that‚Äôs literally made for the Reverb G2 I experienced comparable gaming performance between each headset especially once the Quest 2 was plugged in. (Though as mentioned above each headset is only as good as the laptop it‚Äôs plugged into.) To give you an idea of what these headsets are capable of take a gander at the gameplay footage below with laptop performance settings maxed out and headset settings on default for the best visual performance my machines could muster.

Both of these titles represent what got me into PC gaming in the first place (I put over 90 hours into Fallout: New Vegas back in the day) but now that we live in the future it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed with the VR versions of both big-box titles and if I‚Äôm not careful I might sign into Skyrim one day and never come back.

I couldn‚Äôt record gameplay footage directly from the Quest 2 headset with the Oculus Link app running but from an anecdotal perspective I could absolutely observe better graphics quality in both of these games when I plugged the goggles into my laptop especially when it came to shadow effects background landscapes and close-up details. Exploring beautiful mountaintops and prehistoric environments was a surprisingly immersive experience but even more so when powered by my laptop.

In terms of audio performance I experienced a surprisingly robust soundscape from the hard-to-find built-in speakers on the Quest 2 goggles which were of similar quality to the external adjustable speakers on the Reverb G2. (Audiophiles can also offload SFX to their computer if your wired cans can do better.) One thing‚Äôs for sure: thanks to the consolidation of VR hardware in recent years either option looks slick as hell.

As a side note I prefer the Quest 2 home environments (there are 11 to choose from) which feel more‚Ä¶well homey somehow.

Winner: Tie

Based on my testing as a casual gamer (and metaverse trekker) I‚Äôd say the overall performance of each headset is fairly subjective based on how resource-heavy a given app might be and while the Meta Quest 2 goggles feel more accessible as a platform the HP Reverb G2 headset feels more like an advanced tech tool. From an anecdotal perspective it also appears to be more capable (and futureproof to some degree) when paired with the proper hardware. When the settings are tweaked properly both platforms feel smooth as butter.

Overall winner: Meta Quest 2

I‚Äôve only scratched the surface of what these VR headsets can do but if you have the right gaming rig at the ready you can expect better overall performance ‚Äî and access to more popular apps ‚Äî from the HP Reverb G2 which hardcore gamers are bound to appreciate. That being said those less concerned with high-end graphics and more concerned with super-social community features will be better served with the Meta Quest 2 which has plenty of power baked into a perfectly portable package.

HP Envy 16 MSRP $1150.00 Score Details ‚ÄúThe HP Envy 16 is beautiful powerful and surprisingly affordable laptop for content creators.‚Äù Pros Excellent overall performance

Spectacular 4K+ OLED display

Solid and attractive build

Good keyboard and touch display

Webcam is crisp and clear Cons Touchpad is too small

Gaming performance is erratic

HP‚Äôs Envy line lands in a unique space. These are premium laptops through and through and often have the performance to back that up for content creators.

However they aren‚Äôt as expensive as machines like the MSI Creator Z16P or the 16-inch MacBook Pro . A case in point is the new HP Envy 16 the replacement for the Envy 15 a laptop that‚Äôs been on our list of best 15-inch laptops and best video-editing laptops. Given its strong performance and solid build quality the Envy 16 is an even more compelling entry than its predecessor.

Fastest when it matters

Performance is the name of the game with the Envy 16. The keyboard display and clean design will have been for nothing if the Envy 16 didn‚Äôt live up to its promise of excellent performance. Fortunately it does.

My loaded $2600 review unit came with the 45-watt 14-core/20-thread Core i9-12900H CPU 32GB of DDR5 RAM fast 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD (with two 1TB SSDs running in RAID 0 as an even faster option) and an RTX 3060 GPU.

On paper the Envy 16 is a speedy mainstream laptop especially given a thicker chassis and an upgraded thermal design with dual fans and a liquid vapor chamber. Note that the $1180 entry-level configuration includes an Intel Arc A370M GPU rather than the RTX 3060 so choose wisely if GPU performance is important.

Interestingly in our benchmarks the Envy 16 was much faster at single-core tasks than at multi-core tasks. This extended to both Geekbench 5 and Cinebench R23 where the Envy 16 led the pack in single-core results while falling behind in multi-core. The HP Command Center utility used to switch thermal profiles had little impact. I‚Äôve reported balanced and performance mode scores but only minor differences exist with the Envy 16.

Creative applications tend to be heavily multi-threaded meaning creators won‚Äôt benefit as much from the Envy 16‚Äôs fast single-core performance. Our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB video as H.265 is a prime example with the Envy 16 being slower than all but the MacBook Pro 16. And that includes laptops running the lesser Core i7-12700H.

At the same time the Envy 16 performed well in the PugetBench Premiere Pro benchmark which runs a live version of Adobe Premiere Pro and makes copious use of both the CPU and the GPU. It was the fastest Windows laptop in our comparison group in balanced mode. While it fell behind laptops like the Asus ZenBook Pro 16X and MSI Creator Z16P in performance mode it was within spitting distance of the much more expensive Apple MacBook Pro 16 with its Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Synthetic benchmarks aside the Envy 16 appears to be a strong performer in the kind of real-world applications that matter most to creators. It can also handle the most demanding productivity workflows with ease.

With a fast CPU and an RTX 3060 it‚Äôs natural to play some games on the Envy 16. I expected solid gaming performance given the high single-core performance but the Env7 16 had mixed results. Its 3DMark Time Spy score was strong for an RTX 3060 but that didn‚Äôt translate across all our gaming tests.

Specifically the Envy 16 was fast in Civilization VI and Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla but it fell behind in Cyberpunk 2077 and Fortnite. It‚Äôs probably safest to assume that you can run modern titles at 1080p and high graphics and then be happy when you find games that will run well at 1440p.

Large and in charge

The Envy 16 focuses on performance and display size not on the size of its chassis. In fact HP deliberately extended the chassis to allow room for better airflow and the migration to a 16:10 display adds some depth. Compared to its competition though it‚Äôs not overly large ‚Äî for example it‚Äôs slightly smaller than the MSI Creator Z16P.

It‚Äôs quite a bit larger than the Dell XPS 15 but the Dell has a slightly smaller display and tiny display bezels. At 0.78 inches thick and 5.12 pounds the Envy 16 is thicker than the Creator Z16P and a bit lighter and it‚Äôs thicker and heavier than the XPS 15. Overall it‚Äôs not huge but it‚Äôs still not a laptop you‚Äôll want to haul around to the coffee shop.

Some extra weight comes from the all-aluminum chassis which is quite sturdy and resists most bending flexing and twisting. Only a little keyboard flex differentiates the Envy 16 from the best such as the MacBook Pro 16 and the Dell XPS 15. Aesthetically the Envy 16 is conservatively designed with just the right angles in the right place and no bling to distract from its minimalist good looks.

Of course the primary appeal of a 16-inch laptop is its large display which provides plenty of room to work. HP offers two displays for the Envy 16 at 16-inches and 16:10. I reviewed the 4K + OLED panel which is sharp and stunning.

By every metric but brightness the display is perfect for the creators HP is targeting. Even though the brightness is a bit low the colors are wide and accurate and the contrast provides the typical inky blacks we expect from the best OLED laptops. Productivity users and media consumers will also love this display.

Quad speakers provide great-sounding audio with clear mids and highs and more bass than usual. The only problem is volume ‚Äî the Envy 16 doesn‚Äôt get very loud. It‚Äôs great sound for watching Netflix by yourself but if you want to entertain a group then you‚Äôll want some Bluetooth speakers. Music sounds good but again the volume gets in the way. If you like to crank your tunes you‚Äôll want a good pair of headphones . The Dell XPS 15 provides equally good audio that gets a lot louder.

The large chassis offers another advantage specifically a spacious keyboard with large keycaps even though it‚Äôs flanked on each side by a speaker grille. That‚Äôs also a result of HP excluding a numeric keypad which most buyers likely won‚Äôt miss. The keyboard switch mechanism wasn‚Äôt quite as precise as on the Spectre lineup with plenty of travel and a light touch but not as snappy a bottoming action. It‚Äôs a comfortable keyboard that‚Äôs just one step behind the best.

The touchpad is disappointing in that it seems like there would have been room for a larger version. It was reliable in supporting Windows 11‚Äôs multitouch gestures and its click was confident and quiet but HP could have squeezed in a considerably larger touchpad. The OLED display comes with multitouch support and that was welcome.

Finally the Envy 16 supports all the connectivity that most people need. I would have preferred to see a full-size SD card reader rather than microSD and some people would benefit from an Ethernet port. But even so connectivity is a strength thanks to Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support.

The small touches

It might seem wrong to call battery life an ‚Äúincidental‚Äù aspect but a machine meant to churn through demanding creative and productivity workflows is likely to be plugged in most of the time. And no fast performer will last long on a charge when the CPU and GPU are fully engaged.

Even so the Envy 16 did reasonably well in our battery tests. Its 83 watt-hour battery which isn‚Äôt a lot for this class of machine managed to keep it running for almost 8.5 hours on our web-browsing test and nearly 13 hours in our video test.

It fell behind in the PCMark 10 Applications battery test at just 7.5 hours but these are decent numbers for a fast laptop with a high-res OLED display.

You won‚Äôt find many 16-inch class laptops that last much longer although the Dell XPS 15 was stronger and the MacBook Pro 16 was in another universe entirely. But if you‚Äôre doing less demanding work you might get most of a day out of the Envy 16.

With such a large high-res display you‚Äôd expect the Envy 16 to be an excellent machine for videoconferencing. And you‚Äôd be right thanks to the 5MP webcam with Auto Frame capabilities. The image quality was excellent during my testing.

There‚Äôs also an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello passwordless login support and a physical webcam shutter for privacy controlled by a function key. HP omitted any user presence detection functionality that‚Äôs been showing up on more recent laptops  so there are no automatic sleep and wake capabilities.

A solid addition to the 16-inch class

We liked the performance and build quality of the Envy 15 and the Envy 16 improves on both. While it‚Äôs certainly a premium laptop it‚Äôs less expensive than competitors like the MSI Creator Z16P and MacBook Pro 16 and faster than similarly priced laptops like the Dell XPS 15.

If you‚Äôre looking for a powerful creative workstation that won‚Äôt break the bank then the Envy 16 is a solid option.

Debuting September 27 the plug-in hybrid SUV will have a regular production run rather than being a limited series as was the case with the mid-engined coupe of which just 453 units were made. The Concept XM unveiled at the end of November 2021 previewed the boldly styled behemoth which is the next model to get the company‚Äôs newly developed S68 engine.

The twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 with mild-hybrid tech will work together with an electric motor to deliver a combined output of 650 horsepower in the standard 2023 BMW XM available upon launch. It‚Äôs going to carry a steep asking price in Europe of around ‚Ç¨170000 and will be followed at a later date by a more potent derivative XM Label rather than wearing the ‚ÄúCompetition‚Äù badge. Matching the concept‚Äôs output this beefier 750-hp variant is coming and it‚Äôs rumored to cost around 190000 ‚Äì 195000 euros on the Old Continent.

The launch version of this more powerful model will be the XM Label Red and we‚Äôve heard some of these Label-badged models will be special editions with unique color options. There‚Äôs no word about the final torque figure but the Concept XM had a colossal 737 pound-feet (1000 Newton-meters). The first fully fledged M car with electrification will boast a 25-kWh battery pack with enough energy for a WLTP-certified maximum electric range of 55 miles (88 kilometers).

The third BMW model to get split headlights after the new 7 Series / i7 and X7 LCI the XM will ride on standard 22-inch wheels but there will be an option for an even bigger 23-inch set. It‚Äôll largely retain the concept‚Äôs striking appearance right down to the stacked exhaust tips. The kidney grille will be rather massive but teasers have hinted it won‚Äôt be as big as the concept‚Äôs.

Assembly of the XM will start before the year‚Äôs end at the Spartanburg plant in South Carolina and BMW projects the United States will represent the model‚Äôs most important market. There won‚Äôt be a pure ICE version as the high-performance SUV will be sold exclusively with a PHEV setup. It is believed an entry-level model with an inline-six engine and an electric motor will follow later in the life cycle.

The XM won‚Äôt be the end of BMW‚Äôs busy schedule for 2022 as far as product launches since the M2 G87 will debut on October 12. We‚Äôll also see the hotly anticipated 3.0 CSL revival to properly celebrate 50 years of the M division.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ocC16Ym9vay1maXJlZmx5LWc5LTE0LWluY2gtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP ZBook Firefly G9 (14 inch) review: Lots of power in a small package,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9ocC16Ym9vay1maXJlZmx5LWc5LTE0LWluY2gtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Trying to adjust to a Tanner Morgan pass Autman-Bell landed awkwardly after not receiving contact and grabbed around his knee after a play late in the first half of Saturday‚Äôs 49-7 win against Colorado at Huntington Bank Stadium.

With a pained look Autman-Bell needed help off the field and into the medical tent where he was assessed for seven minutes and then needed further help into the locker room. He did not return to the sideline for the second half.

Head coach P.J. Fleck said Saturday night that Autman-Bell was at a hospital getting images taken on his leg and he didn‚Äôt have a forma diagnosis on the sixth-year senior. The manner in which Fleck spoke about the injury did not make it seem run of the mill.

‚ÄúOur thoughts and prayers are with him sending positive thoughts‚Äù Fleck said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfortunate. Reached back for a ball takes kind of a funky step and hurts himself so I know we got some amazing doctors and amazing medical care. I will let you know as soon as I know what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

Autman-Bell led the Gophers with three receptions on four targets for 58 yards and one touchdown on Saturday. Through the first three games the sixth-year senior had team highs of 11 receptions and 214 yards and is tied with others at one TD.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the most (integral) parts to what we do and how we do it on and off the field‚Äù Fleck said. ‚ÄúOne of the best people but no matter what we are trained to Row The Boat.‚Äù

Minnesota had just welcomed back receiver Daniel Jackson on Saturday. After missing the first two games with an ankle injury Jackson had one reception for eight yards in the first half.

After Autman-Bell went down Morgan connected with Dylan Wright on a 16-yard touchdown pass before the half and five other receivers.

Outside of Autman-Bell the Gophers have primarily relied on slot receiver Michael Brown-Stephens and tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford in the passing game. Wright has also had a role along with smaller roles for Lemeke Brockington and Clay Geary. Geary a Lakeville native caught his first touchdown Saturday.

‚ÄúI think we are deeper than we‚Äôve ever been when you look at athletes and playmakers‚Äù Fleck said. ‚ÄúWe might not have that one or two. Maybe in past years when you look collectively on how we are running our offense we have a lot of people involved.‚Äù

Spann-Ford was second on the team Saturday with three receptions of 34 yards but he tipped a pass that led to a Buffaloes interception. It was the U‚Äôs first and only INT through 68 passing attempts.

Briefly

Guard Axel Ruschmeyer exited Saturday‚Äôs game. He also left the season opener on Sept. 1 with an injury. All Fleck said was Ruschmeyer is ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Linebacker Mariano Sori-Marin had a team high four tackles. The Gophers honored women‚Äôs basketball coach Lindsay Whalen during the first quarter Saturday; the Hutchinson native was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame last weekend.

Following Colorado‚Äôs latest embarrassment a 49-7 loss to Minnesota at Huntington Bank Stadium on Saturday the calls for his firing from the fan base are getting louder.

Even national media is starting to look into what it would cost CU (0-3) to fire Dorrell. The answer to that basically is that he would be owed the remainder of his contract which is roughly around $9 million.

Asked if he‚Äôs feeling the heat Saturday Dorrell said ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm more frustrated with the players because I know that they want it but we just don‚Äôt know how. We don‚Äôt know what the how is yet. So we‚Äôve just got to keep pushing the envelope to keep those guys moving forward about finding the how.‚Äù

Based on the tone of his answer it‚Äôs believed Dorrell meant he‚Äôs frustrated for the players instead of with them. Regardless the Buffs are a program that has regressed in Dorrell‚Äôs third season.

Following a 4-0 start to his tenure in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season ‚Äì a start that got the Buffs to the Alamo Bowl and earned Dorrell Pac-12 coach of the year honors ‚Äì CU is 4-13. Nine of those 13 losses have come by 20 or more points.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more than we can do right now quite frankly then to just get back to hard work in trying to get this to come out of our players‚Äù Dorrell said. ‚ÄúTry to get production efficiency execution. We‚Äôve got to get all those things done correctly for us to be as good as we can be but right now we‚Äôre far away from that.‚Äù

Rare start

Left guard Van Wells became just the 13th true freshman in CU history to start on the offense line ‚Äì and the first since Frank Fillip (who lined up at left tackle Saturday) did so on Oct. 27 2018.

Dorrell and the CU staff made the change to try to spark the offensive line. Jake Wiley normally the starter at right tackle sat during the first half. He was replaced by Casey Roddick the normal starter at left guard.

‚ÄúJust a change to try to figure out if Casey was the better tackle which Casey did a pretty good job out there‚Äù Dorrell said. ‚ÄúBut then we had some issues inside (during the first half) and then we moved Casey back inside and put Jake out there.‚Äù

During the second half Wells went back to the bench while Roddick moved to left guard and Wiley to right tackle. Wells was flagged for a pair of false start penalties in the first quarter.

Smith scores

It certainly didn‚Äôt mean much in the big picture but CU‚Äôs lone touchdown with 8:55 to play in the fourth quarter was a big deal for redshirt freshman tight end Austin Smith.

Not only was it the first career touchdown for Smith it was his first career catch. Smith caught a pass from JT Shrout and stretched his arms out to get the ball across the goal line for the score.

‚ÄúYeah it was nice to see that‚Äù Dorrell said. ‚ÄúA couple of young guys having a touchdown there so that was a good point at least at the end.‚Äù

According to CU Smith is the 18th known player in CU history to score a touchdown in his first career touch.

Notable

Starting running back Alex Fontenot and slot receiver Chase Penry did not make the trip to Minneapolis as both are dealing with undisclosed injuries. ‚Ä¶ Walk-on running back Charlie Offerdahl had career highs in rushing attempts (eight) and yards (55) and picked up five first downs. ‚Ä¶ In addition to Wells tight end Caleb Fauria safety Jeremy Mack and running back Deion Smith made their first career starts. ‚Ä¶ Linebacker Isaac Hurtado quarterback Owen McCown and offensive lineman Ben Reznik made their first appearances with CU. ‚Ä¶ Safety Isaiah Lewis picked off a Minnesota pass giving him the third interception of his career. ‚Ä¶ Brendon Lewis has thrown 156 consecutive passes without an interception the second-longest streak in CU history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ29waGVyc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvOS8xNy9mb290YmFsbC1pYnJhaGltLWdvcGhlcnMtc3RlYW1yb2xsLWNvbG9yYWRvLTQ5LTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ibrahim Gophers Steamroll Colorado 49-7,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9nb3BoZXJzLWNvbG9yYWRvLWZvb3RiYWxsLTQ5LTctY2hyaXMtYXV0bWFuLWJlbGwtaW5qdXJ5LzYwMDIwNzg0My_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gophers steamroll Colorado 49-7 but lose receiver Chris Autman-Bell to injury,"Among the hopes for the Gophers football team in the three-game nonconference season was to get the offense ‚Äî especially the passing game ‚Äî rolling again continue the stingy defensive ways it established in 2021 and emerge in good health entering Big Ten play.

On a sunny Saturday afternoon at Huntington Bank Stadium the Gophers checked two of those boxes by routing Colorado 49-7 to complete a non-league schedule in which they outscored opponents 149-17 and outgained them 1684-512.

However a knee injury to top wide receiver Chris Autman-Bell cast a shadow on the day. Autman-Bell landed awkwardly and hit his right knee hard into the turf while trying to catch a pass late in the second quarter. He was tended to on the field then assisted off it by training staff. He immediately was taken to the medical tent and did not return to the game.

Gophers coach P.J. Fleck did not have any details on the severity of Autman-Bell's injury during his postgame news conference saying he was being evaluated at a hospital.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with him. Sending positive thoughts'' Fleck said. ""‚Ä¶ He's a big member of this football team. I'd be lying if I said he wasn't one of the most integral parts of what we do and how we do it.''

Fleck added: ""It's the hardest part. It's hard to see somebody's teammate laying on the ground like that.''

Autman-Bell's injury came on a banner day for another sixth-year senior running back Mohamed Ibrahim who rushed 23 times for 202 yards and three touchdowns. In the process he tied Darrell Thompson's program record of 40 career rushing TDs.

""DT was a big part of Minnesota history so to be tied up with him it's just amazing'' Ibrahim said.

Meanwhile Tanner Morgan completed 11 of 16 passes for 157 yards and three TDs with an interception and the Gophers defense held the Buffaloes (0-3) to 39 total yards in the first half. The Gophers finished with 500 total yards their second game in a row with 500 or more.

""We had great protection the whole time and we ran the football really well'' Morgan said.

The Gophers also converted 13 of 15 third-down opportunities while holding the Buffaloes to 1-for-12. ""We got 13 of 15 but I've got to continue to get better'' Morgan said lamenting missed opportunities.

Until Autman-Bell's injury almost everything was going right for the Gophers who dominated their third consecutive opponent as they prepare for next Saturday's Big Ten opener at No. 11 Michigan State. The Spartans (2-1) lost 39-28 at Washington on Saturday night.

Ibrahim started the game with a powerful 19-yard run in which he knocked over a Buffaloes defender then finished the 75-yard march with a 5-yard TD run for a 7-0 lead.

Minnesota's defense came knocking right away with cornerback Terell Smith blitzing hitting Colorado quarterback J.T. Shrout and forcing a fumble that Gophers defensive lineman Jalen Logan-Redding recovered at the 11. Two plays later Ibrahim scored on a 2-yard run for a 14-0 Gophers lead with 8:44 left in the first quarter.

""Really good call by Joe [Rossi defensive coordinator]'' Fleck said. ""Really good execution by the players.''

The Gophers stretched the lead to 21-0 with 9:08 left in the second quarter on an 18-yard run by Ibrahim that looked like a rugby scrum with tight end Nick Kallerup and wide receivers Dylan Wright and Mike Brown-Stephens helping drag the running back into the end zone. The rushing TD was the 40th of Ibrahim's career tying him with Thompson.

""You saw that 'push the pile''' Fleck said. ""That's what our program is about.''

The Gophers boosted the lead to 35-0 on Morgan's 39-yard TD pass to Autman-Bell with 1:37 left in the half and Wright's beautiful catch of a Morgan pass for a 16-yard TD with 8 seconds left. Autman-Bell was injured on the third play of the latter hurry-up drive.

The Gophers got a spectacular TD catch by Clay Geary in the third quarter and a 22-yard TD run by Bryce Williams in the fourth before Colorado avoided a shutout with 8:55 to play.

That left Minnesota with three dominant wins and a key player possibly lost to injury for an extended period.

""Last year when I went down the main emphasis was to keep rowing together'' said Ibrahim who suffered a season-ending Achilles' tendon rupture in the 2021 opener. ""That that's the important message: row together just think together and you will get through it with each other.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYW50b25yZXAuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY2FudG9uLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvYWJjZC1zZWVrcy1hcnBhLW1vbmV5LWZvci1uZXctZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRzLXJlc2lkZW50cy1yYWlzZS1jb25jZXJucy82NTQ3NDg5MTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ABCD seeks ARPA money for new developments residents raise concerns,"CANTON ‚àí Roger Wells has lived for 18 years on Charles Ede Boulevard SE in a low-income housing development built by ABCD Inc. with state tax credits.

He unsuccessfully tried to purchase the four-bedroom house from ABCD in 2020 under the original rent-to-own terms and was taken aback when the new owners Gateway Cherry LLC raised rent from $565 to $825 last January.

Wells wasn't the only one with grievances about the rent increase purchasing process or maintenance. He and seven other residents met at his home in late August and discussed forming a tenant union with representatives from Canton for All People and Community Legal Aid.

""Everybody here got to have a place to live"" said Wells who doesn't want to move and feels as if low-income residents are being ousted.

Criticism of ABCD has come from residents in southeast Canton and a few residents of the northeast Richmond Homes ‚Äï an affordable senior housing complex where some residents also praised the development. Both projects used some form of government funding.

More: Housing crunchStark County seeing more homeless

Now the nonprofit corporation has asked for a share of Canton's American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds. Will Dent president and CEO of ABCD said he hopes to receive $1 million for construction of a 100-unit housing development on Richmond Avenue NE; and $186000 for a storage garage a training center and 24 senior apartments in the 1200 block of Harrisburg Road NE.

ABCD sells Gateway Cherry homes

The Ohio Housing Finance Agency awarded $332043 in low-income housing tax credits to help ABCD finance Gateway Place and awarded $335233 for Cherry Homes according to past reports. Each consists of about 30 four-bedroom houses in the area of Gateway Boulevard SE and Cherry Avenue SE.

The 15-year tax credits expired in 2019. The following year ABCD sold both developments to Gateway Cherry LLC. Stark County Property records show that a total of 60 parcels were purchased for about $1.35 million.

""We sold them with the understanding that the equity that residents had accrued would pass on and they would remain affordable"" Dent said and such terms are included in the purchase agreements he shared.

Residents earn $1000 a year or a maximum of $15000 in equity to be used toward the purchase of the houses.

Dent said the former property management company East Akron Neighborhood Development Corporation mailed letters about the sale to residents. But all eight residents who met at Wells' place said they received nothing of the sort.

Yolanda Howard who has lived in the community for 11 years and volunteered to be the tenant union president said she once saw a person in the area introducing themselves as the new owner. Vanessa Colter a resident for seven years said she found a handwritten note in her mailbox about the new owner.

That was the extent of the group's notifications about the sale. Several residents also said they received little advanced notice about the rent increase or only the second of two apparent notices sent by mail.

Gateway Cherry raise rent in Canton

Ryan Stubenrauch an attorney representing Gateway Cherry LLC said the rent increase ""probably could've been communicated better.""

Stubenrauch said the ownership group tried to give residents a month's notice by mail and although they would've liked to send representatives door-to-door don't have enough personnel for that. Gateway Cherry must adhere to federal housing standards and rent to low-income residents even though the tax credits have expired he added.

""So these projects for the first 15 years they're in the tax credit phase and then for the next 15 years they're in what's called the extended use phase"" he said.

The Ohio Housing Finance Agency approved the increase in rent which is less than the maximum permitted for a four-bedroom LIHTC unit in Stark County this year ‚Äï $1116 for households earning 50% or less of the area median income and $1339 for households earning 60% or less of the area median income.

ABCD had not raised the rent in years and Stubenrauch said the new owners acquired ""a lot of deferred maintenance."" They refrained from raising rent in the midst of the pandemic.

""Eventually this just became a math problem"" he said. ""There's no way to meet the maintenance needs to pay for these increasing costs of repairs and supplies. We simply can't do that on rent amounts that hadn't changed since the mid-2010s.""

Maintenance was another point of contention for the southeast residents. Brandy Brown who has lived on Gateway Boulevard for 18 years said appliances are replaced with even older ones and contacting maintenance is difficult.

""Nobody picks up the phone"" Brown said adding that she only gets a response by text message.

Canton Councilwoman Chris Smith who represents the southeast Ward 4 and is an ABCD board member said she spoke with Mike Doss ‚Äï a former NFL player born in Canton who is part of the ownership group ‚Äï and his attorney about resident concerns but felt like she ""didn't get anywhere."" She wanted the new owners to meet with residents to explain the rent increase and hear their concerns.

""I just want the residents to be you know happy pleased get some solutions and to be taken care of in a proper and timely manner especially when it comes to their repairs"" Smith said.

Stubenrauch said the owners have reviewed the communication practices of the property management company Lawrence Realty after the concerns were brought to their attention. A letter to tenants dated Feb. 23 shared a number to an automated phone system for service requests and stated that ""records show there are many maintenance requests each month and almost all of them are scheduled for repairs or resolved within a day.""

The letter also addressed the reason for the rent increase and the process for purchasing the homes.

Residents report purchasing problems

Dent said ABCD began selling the homes after the first 15 years as intended and four purchase agreements were transferred to the new owners. Before the sale to Gateway Cherry LLC the nonprofit sent letters encouraging residents to buy their houses.

""They never had any problems from us"" Dent said about residents who reported purchasing issues.

Howard said she asked for information about buying her house and never received a response when the property was owned by ABCD and managed by EANDC. Wells and Brown both said it took repeated attempts to receive their purchase agreements and they also learned about liens on the property without explanation.

Brown ultimately gave up when she felt ""stonewalled"" by ABCD and then the new owners. Wells was told by lenders that his credit score wasn't good enough after he received his purchase contract in February 2020 from ABCD.

""I just had a lot of problems"" he said.

Vanessa Colter a resident of seven years was pre-qualified for a mortgage loan in June and has texted Lawrence Realty about purchasing her house for the past several months. She said she's received no definitive answer about the status of the transaction.

However three residents successfully purchased their homes since the ownership change because Stubenrauch said Gateway Cherry now owns 57 properties. The letter sent in February also encouraged long-term residents who are interested in buying their house to get a mortgage preapproval and then contact the owners or management company.

The liens are from OFHA he added. ""The lien is to prevent us from selling it to a private company"" Stubenrauch said. ""These units can only be sold with government approval.""

Home values questioned

Rev. Don Ackerman who leads Crossroads United Methodist Church's community development corporation ‚Äï Canton For All People said his greatest concern is the seeming sale of homes to Gateway Cherry for less than their worth.

""I know Will (Dent) said that all the people were offered a chance to buy their homes but was it the same price that he sold them to Mike Doss for?"" he said.

Dent said ABCD offered to sell houses to residents at below the appraised values of $40000 to $50000. The purchase contract given to Wells in February 2020 listed an appraised value of $39655 for a purchase price of $24655 after accounting for his 15 years of equity.

The Gateway and Cherry homes were sold in two groups to the new owners according to Stark County property records. The average price per parcel was $21516 for Gateway Place houses and $23793 for Cherry Homes.

In June 2021 Gateway Cherry LLC and Brown entered a contract for a base purchase price of $56400 and her credit was $11000 toward the base price and $4000 toward closing costs.

Stubenrauch said some frustration likely comes from the ""market reality"" of increased house prices. ""People sell things at what a buyer's willing to pay and what a seller's willing to sell.""

Gateway Cherry is a for-profit company but low-income housing is not a ""get rich"" venture Stubenrauch said. The ownership's goal is to make a little money while providing for Canton residents.

The tenants who agreed to form a union plan to meet again this week and define their objectives. Ackerman said they also will ratify an organizing covenant that defines the responsibilities of the tenants Community Legal Aid and Canton For All People.

""I know they're going to start meeting monthly stay up-to-date develop out objectives and organize together to see better living conditions in their units"" he said.

ABCD Inc. plans more developments in Canton

ABCD has requested government assistance for more developments in northeast Canton.

Dent described one as a ""massive development"" on about 28 acres along Richmond Avenue NE. It'll consist of 100 apartments and some duplexes and single-family houses. ABCD will work with Giltz & Associates the developer of the existing Richmond Homes ‚Äï nine single-family houses that were sold to low- to moderate-income residents for $117500 each in 2021.

""We're partnering with them with the same kind of structure except in this instance we are 50% owners of the land"" Dent said. ""So we are more involved with the new development than we were with the nine Richmond Homes.""

One resident of those homes has numerous complaints about the quality of construction two others mentioned slow response times for repairs or maintenance and another praised Harry Giltz Sr. as a man of ""integrity"" at City Council the same night that Dent presented ABCD's plans to council members.

Dent said the developers have been ""very responsive"" to residents and both he and Giltz said the complaints have come from a single resident.

""There's one out there who's had some complaints but I don't need to go into that"" Giltz said.

Dent said the new $38 million development along Richmond Avenue will be ""totally separate"" and called Richmond Heights. The other upcoming projects involve converting the former Huntington Bank building on Mahoning Road NE into ABCD's office ‚Äï for which the city already approved $300000 in federal Community Development Block Grant funds ‚Äï and redeveloping the former Parkland Market nearby.

The former market building on Harrisburg Road NE is expected to be demolished and replaced with a training center storage garage and 24-unit apartment complex. That combined with the bank renovations is estimated to cost $8 million.

According to Public Service Director John Highman the city has received multiple requests for ARPA funding and the administration is determining which ones to present to City Council for approval. ABCD has requested a total of nearly $1.19 million.

""As you know we have limited ARPA funds so just because a request was made does not necessarily mean a project is moving forward"" Highman said via email. ""At this point it would be premature to speculate as to whether or not the city will be able to participate with the other requests as they are in the vetting process.""

La propia Armada espa√±ola lo define como el portaaviones ¬´m√°s moderno actualmente en servicio en el mundo¬ª. Es el USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) un tit√°n de los mares de propulsi√≥n nuclear y alta tecnolog√≠a que est√° a punto de vivir su despliegue inaugural en la base naval norteamericana de Norfolk (Virginia). Dicho despliegue tendr√° una duraci√≥n aproximada de dos meses y Espa√±a participar√° con la fragata √Ålvaro de Baz√°n F-101 que ha zarpado del Arsenal Militar de Ferrol en donde tiene su base. La fragata realizar√° ejercicios con los buques del Grupo n√∫mero 12 (CSG-12) de la marina estadounidense y con buques de las marinas de Alemania Reino Unido Dinamarca Canad√° y Francia para potenciar su interoperabilidad con otras unidades de caracter√≠sticas similares.

El USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) es el barco l√≠der en la clase Ford de portaaviones la primera clase nueva en m√°s de 40 a√±os y comenzar√° el reemplazo gradual de los portaaviones de la clase Nimitz. Su tecnolog√≠a de √∫ltima generaci√≥n lo convierte en el m√°s moderno que surca los mares en la actualidad. Para empezar incluye una nueva planta nuclear con la capacidad de generar casi tres veces la cantidad de energ√≠a el√©ctrica que sus antecesores; adem√°s incorpora un innovador equipo de detenci√≥n avanzado y el sistema electromagn√©tico de lanzamiento de aeronaves denominado Emals. Este sistema es √∫nico y reemplaza el sistema de catapulta de vapor utilizado tradicionalmente. Ampl√≠a la envolvente de lanzamiento de aeronaves lo que permite lograr un 25 % m√°s de lanzamientos de aeronaves por d√≠a que el anterior portaaviones USS Nimitz (CVN-68). Adem√°s dispone de un 25 % menos de tripulaci√≥n

Los preparativos para el despliegue del barco han sido incesantes durante los √∫ltimos meses. Recientemente la tripulaci√≥n del portaaviones complet√≥ con √©xito el ejercicio de preparaci√≥n operativa de los sistemas de combate (CSORE) destinado a verificar la funcionalidad de los sistemas de combate. Se utiliz√≥ el CIWS (Close-in Weapon System sistema de armamento de proximidad). Se probaron en este punto los ca√±ones MK-38 para desactivar y hundir las embarcaciones de superficie ¬´hostiles¬ª que se acercaban al barco.

El portaaviones fue sometido adem√°s a las denominadas Full Ship Shock Trials pruebas para probar su resistencia. El 18 de junio de 2021 la Armada provoc√≥ una enorme explosi√≥n en el oc√©ano al paso del buque. Esta tremenda explosi√≥n fue registrada por el Servicio Geol√≥gico de EE.UU. y se equipar√≥ con un evento s√≠smico de magnitud 39.

At the conference IBM will showcase how technology and consulting can help business and government leaders align sustainability goals to organizational objectives responding to regulatory demands and without compromising profitability.

This collaboration with the Presidency of Egypt builds on IBM's history of environmental commitments and alliances such as establishing a goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 or being a founding member of the United Nations Environment Programme‚Äôs Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment. IBM also enables organizations and communities to tackle environmental issues through programs like the IBM Sustainability Accelerator.

‚ÄúIBM is honored to be technology partner in this year‚Äôs historic COP conference and to help address the existential challenge of climate change‚Äù said IBM‚Äôs Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna. ‚ÄúI believe that technology can turn sustainability ambition into action. At IBM we combine technology and expertise to help some of the world‚Äôs largest public and private organizations achieve their sustainability goals in addition to setting our own strong environmental commitments.‚Äù

That was the goal after all.

But nobody could have envisioned the pace of growth that certainly lies ahead for a county that will be home to Intel Corporation's $20 billion computer chip manufacturing facility on 1000 acres of Jersey Township land just south of Johnstown that has been annexed into New Albany.

It will be the largest commercial development in Ohio history employing 3000 Intel employees 7000 construction workers and thousands more employed throughout central Ohio by Intel suppliers. And the development could grow into a $100 billion facility with eight factories instead of the two under construction now.

The most recent meeting of Grow Licking County showed the challenges ahead that may not be growing pains but certainly qualify as growing strains.

Housing will be needed for all the workers coming to Licking County. Roads will need to be improved to get the new workers from their home to the job . And transit services will be needed to provide alternate transportation options.

Grow Licking County Executive Director Alexis Fitzsimmons said GLC is investigating the possibility of doing a housing study and may partner with the United Way of Licking County.

‚ÄúWe need housing for residents in every stage of their life‚Äù Fitzsimmons said. ‚ÄúYoung professionals young families starter homes condos single-family homes.‚Äù

Robert O'Neill president and owner of real estate development company Southgate Corporation and a GLC board member said the county's housing needs are great especially multi-family housing.

‚ÄúThere is a lack of apartments in the pipeline that I‚Äôm aware of"" O'Neill said. ""I think the study makes a lot of sense. Hopefully it will look not just at single-family but multi-family. Many times multi-family (residents) leave to invest in single family but there needs to be a starting point. And multi-family really serves as that. I think multi-family is clearly way behind.‚Äù

Jim Roberts a GLC board member and vice president of Hull and Associates civil engineering land surveying environmental and energy firm said multi-family housing is the despised by many.

‚ÄúI think developers are ready to just swarm into Licking County and are capable of doing that"" Roberts said. ""I think the water and sewer and roadway challenges while huge are surmountable. But I‚Äôve sat in a couple meetings where I‚Äôve just sort of heard some 1970s thinking about growth.

‚ÄúSome of the local governments are just horrified at the idea of apartments. They‚Äôre thinking of the old Section 8 housing. I don‚Äôt know how we impact that how we influence that how we make them understand that could be a real positive thing. I think that‚Äôs a huge challenge.""

Licking County Commissioner Duane Flowers a GLC board member said ""The housing study needs to be done just because we have no clue of the needs for water and sewer roads and bridges. It all fits together.""

Mark Johns mayor of Heath and a GLC board members said he has argued for years that Licking County needs housing of all types well before Intel's arrival.

Road improvements are another major issue for Licking County especially around the Intel development site. Some county officials were frustrated immediately after the Intel announcement when the state put the focus on improving roads in Franklin County not Licking County.

Roberts chairman of the GLC infrastructure committee said the state may be paying a little more attention to Licking County roads.

‚ÄúI think we made some positive strides with ODOT"" Roberts said. ""They‚Äôre now using the MORPC 20-minute drive-time (from Intel site) map as a basis for some decision-making. If you remember all their traffic studies basically talked about all the traffic to and from Intel was going to be from the west. We don‚Äôt agree with that even a little bit.‚Äù

Roberts said the 20-minute map includes much of Licking County including Heath and Hebron.

""While it‚Äôs a small step we feel like it was a giant step because now ODOT might look at directing some of their funding in places they hadn‚Äôt done before."" Roberts said.

Flowers said the county commissioners recently authorized $10 million for the county engineer to repair and rebuild roads and bridges and another $10 million for Licking County water and wastewater projects.

The results of a water and sewer study will be available next year Roberts said.

Matthew Allison interim general manager of Licking County Transit told GLC that staffing continues to be his biggest challenge. He said there were 50 drivers a few years ago and now it‚Äôs about half of that. Meanwhile trips are increasing.

‚ÄúWe struggle with meeting the demand as it continues to increase‚Äù Allison said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of challenges. The biggest challenge for us right now is staffing.‚Äù

Increasing the hourly wage and ending split shifts are two changes to boost employee morale he said.

‚ÄúThe first thing we had to do was work on the culture and morale internally‚Äù Allison said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs job one. We‚Äôve been working on that with employees.‚Äù

Eventually Allison said he would like to provide a fixed-route service or deviated route service instead of the on-demand curbside pickup.

Intel releases its NUC 12 Mini-PC equipped with latest mobile CPU and GPU series.

SimplyNUC is now taking preorders for the NUC 12 Pro a small form factor PC designed by Intel and equipped with all-Intel hardware. This system comes with up to Core i7-12700H Alder Lake 14-core processor and flagship Arc A770M discrete GPU from the Alchemist series.

This is a powerful system encapsulated into 2.5L (230√ó180√ó60 mm) chassis. It is equipped with modern connectivity including but not limited to USB 3.2 Gen2 Thunderbolt 4 DisplayPort 2.0 and HDMI 2.1. Powered by either integrated Iris Xe Graphics or discrete A770 GPU it can output up to five 4K streams.

Since Intel has many NUC products already here‚Äôs a quick reminder where does NUC 12 Enthusiast stacks up in the whole lineup:

Intel NUC 12 Extreme ‚ÄúDragon Canyon‚Äù (12th Gen Core-S & Arc A-series desktop)

Intel NUC 12 Enthusiast ‚ÄúSerpent Canyon‚Äù (12th Gen Core-H & Arc A-Series Mobile).

Intel NUC 12 Pro ‚ÄúWall Street Canyon‚Äù (12th Gen Core-P)

Intel NUC X15 ‚ÄúAlder County‚Äù (12th Gen Core-H & Arc A-Series Mobile) (laptop)

So this is not the most powerful NUC but definitely the smallest 12th Gen NUC for gaming. It is powered by 14-core i7-12700H CPU (a popular choice for gaming laptops) and Intel‚Äôs own Arc A770M GPU with 16GB of VRAM and full implementation of ACM-G10 GPU with 32 Xe-Cores. It supports up to 64GB of DDR4-3200 memory and has three M.2 slots for either PCIe Gen4 or Gen3 x4 storage.

The basic spec with 8GB of DDR4 memory and 256GB of storage is listed at 1699 USD. An upgrade to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage increases the price to 1944 USD. This is certainly not a cheap system but it was never meant to be. Intel NUC Enthusiast/Extreme product were always expensive and always targeted at very niche market. It is worth noting however that this system is eligible for ‚ÄúArc 7 System Bundle‚Äù worth 370 USD according to Intel.

Over the past year since launching Intel Alder Lake processors Intel engineers have made a number of improvements to the Linux kernel for better dealing with the hybrid processor approach mixing P and E cores. While Alder Lake is running great with recent kernels and the P vs. E core selection for tasks on Linux is better than it was at launch there still are areas for improvement as raised by Intel engineers this week.Last week was the big Linux kernel patch series working on ""classes of tasks"" for hybrid CPUs and properly implementing Thread Director support on Linux. This week at Linux Plumbers Conference it was also raised how Linux's Energy Aware Scheduling could be adapted for Intel hybrid CPUs as where right now EAS is just tailored to Arm big.LITTLE designs.Also at LPC 2022 this week Intel engineers Rui Zhang and Yu Chen raised the Intel hybrid Linux work still remaining. This additional talk was about how the Linux load balancer is less than ideal for Intel's hybrid processors. In particular the frequency max used for calculating the frequency scale is a global value and not something core-specific with P / E cores having different maximum frequency values. The frequency maximum value can also be incorrect based on turbo mode thermal/power throttling etc. Currently the frequency max value also can't be adjusted at run-time.

Those interested in the topic can find the complete slide deck outlining the current Linux load balancing problems for Intel hybrid CPUs and possible improvements that could be made. I'll certainly post as usual when any new patches materialize and are ready for testing/benchmarking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhZGdldG1hdGNoLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1wZW50aXVtLWNlbGVyb24tc2h1dC1kb3duL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel is shutting down Pentium and Celeron in 2023,"Back in the day Pentium meant class. Early PC building always came with a Pentium processor. Somewhere along the way Intel shuffled things around and replaced the old brand with the Core lineup. With that the original names sank straight into the depths of old and weaker PCs. Now years since making that change Intel is finally ready to see them ride off into the sunset.

Starting in 2023 Intel will stop using the Pentium and Celeron branding in any of its products. Instead the company will use the more standard ‚ÄúIntel Processor‚Äù to signify the old lineups.

In essence the new Intel Processor branding will not change anything but the name. If you see the name next year it will offer the same thing as products with the old name.

According to Intel the company will start putting in more focus towards its more premium lineups: Intel Core Evo and vPro. Over the years these three processors have taken over most of what the company offers. Even Chromebooks have started shifting more to using Core processors. (Some still use Celeron chipsets though.)

In any case when you see ‚ÄúIntel Processor‚Äù out in the wild next year it‚Äôs not an attempt to rip you off. It‚Äôs real. Pentium and Celeron are dead.

Intel's Arc A770 IBC Rocks A Stunning Shroud Design High-End Cooling & PCB Components & Can Hit Up To 2.7 GHz Clocks With Ease At A Whisper Quiet 39 dBA

Yesterday Intel gave us a small teaser of its Arc A770 Limited Edition overclocking and now they are giving us the full breakdown. The breakdown not just comprises overclocking but also the cooler and PCB too. This is our first good look at the premium design and high-end components that are featured on Intel's reference graphics cards also known as IBCs or Intel Branded Cards.

So starting with the juicy bits first TAP and Ryan Shrout went live to give us a full-on overclocking demonstration of their Arc A770 Limited Edition graphics card. The entirety of the overclocking is done on the Arc Control software which has lots of its bugs fixed over the recent driver updates & is more responsive than ever. For the Arc A770 the Arc Control will allow users to configure a total of six different metrics which include:

GPU Performance Boost (Shifts The Curve Up)

(Shifts The Curve Up) GPU Voltage Offset (Shifts The Voltage Up)

(Shifts The Voltage Up) GPU Power Limit (Raises/Lowers The Power Limit or TBP)

(Raises/Lowers The Power Limit or TBP) GPU Temperature Limit (Raises/Lowers The Target Temp)

(Raises/Lowers The Target Temp) Fan Speed Control (Sets Fan Mode To Fixed/Auto)

(Sets Fan Mode To Fixed/Auto) Fan Speed (Raises/Lowers Fan Speed)

The Arc Control Panel can be brought up in-game by pressing the Alt+I key (can be customized). The utility itself can be used as a real-time monitoring panel and also provides a very handy in-game overlay that gives users information on GPU Voltage GPU Clock GPU Temperature GPU Power and GPU Activity.

For this particular OC session TAP didn't go all-out and used minor adjustments that still led to a meaty 2.7 GHz clock speed versus the 2.4 GHz peak clock at stock. That's a 12.5% improvement in clock speeds and this led to a nice 6.6% gain in FPS in Hitman III. The GPU Power Limit and Temp Limits were raised to the max (228W / 90C) while the Voltage was pushed to +50mV and the GPU Performance Boost slider was moved to 37.

What's interesting is that the fan speed was kept at a fixed 50% (1872 RPM) which resulted in 80C peak temps. That's very impressive and with an auto profile we can definitely expect temps to hover under 80C or even 70C at peak load. The card is expected to run at 39 dBA in a closed chassis and 35 dBA in an open chassis which is whisper quiet. We have the settings used by TAP listed below if you want to try them out yourself once you are able to get the card:

GPU Performance Boost - +37

GPU Voltage Offset - +50mV

GPU Power Limit - 228W (Full)

GPU Temperature Limit - 90C (Full)

Fan Speed Control - Fixed Fan Target

Fan Speed - 50%

All of this is the result of the impeccable reference design that comes with a great cooling solution and an even better design. The reference models such as the Arc A770 and Arc A750 Limited Edition will feature a beautiful cooler and some of the main highlights include:

Die-cast aluminum frame

Thermal solution with a vapor chamber and extended heat pipes

Screwless shroud design

High-performance axial fans with 15 blades

Chamfered edges

Full backplate with matte accents

90 fully controllable diffused RGB LEDs

Stealth Black I/O bracket

4 Display Outs

The Arc A770 Limited Edition is the one that features the new diffused RGB module within the shroud that gets rid of the hot spots encountered on lower quality shroud designs with RGB. It provides a more uniform RGB lighting across the various RGB Zones (4 on the Arc A770: Fans Ring Back Logo). But that's all outside it's time we talk about the insides too.

2 of 9

We get our first look at the Copper Vapor Chamber which has four massive heat pipes running through it and a high-density aluminum fin stack that sits on top of it to dissipate heat from the GPU and other vital components on the PCB. The PCB itself is a 6-phase VRM design that gets power through an 8+6 pin connector configuration.

There are three DP 2.0 and a single HDMI 2.1 (through a 3rd party controller). The card utilizes a PCIe Gen 4.0 x16 interface and has 8 GDDR6 memory modules scattered around the Alchemist ACM-G10 GPU. These are 16Gb dies or 2 GB each for a total of 16 GB memory capacities. Board partners will have the option to either go 16 GB or 8 GB for their A770 designs.

Intel Arc A770 Graphics Card - 32 Xe Cores 16 GB Memory 2.1 GHz

The Intel Arc Alchemist lineup will include the flagship Arc A770 which will feature the full ACM-G10 GPU with 32 Xe-Cores and a 256-bit bus interface. The Intel Arc A770 will feature both 16 GB and 8 GB flavors across a 256-bit bus interface and a TDP of 225W. The clock speeds for the card will be rated at 2.1 GHz for the GPU (Graphics Clock) and up to 17.5 Gbps memory speeds for up to 560.0 GB/s of bandwidth (the 8 GB model comes with 16 Gbps pin speeds for 512 GB/s bandwidth).

It is expected to be positioned in the same performance category as the RTX 3060 Ti but will offer slightly better performance. We have seen several benchmarks of the Arc A770 here and here. The graphics card is expected to cost between the $349 to $399 US range. The Arc graphics cards are expected to launch in the coming weeks.

Stocks have taken a beating this year.

Since January 3 the S&P 500 is down more than 19%. And despite a summer rally that clawed back much of the losses seen through mid-June the market is down 10% over the last month as investor consensus becomes increasingly bearish amid the most aggressive monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve in decades.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Many see a Fed pivot to dovish policy as necessary for a market bottom. But according to Jeff Bierman the chief market technician at TheoTrade who held the same position at TD Ameritrade between 2007-2015 stocks will bottom before then when inflation comes down to around 4.5%. It's still unclear what level of inflation the Fed will deem acceptable before they are willing to ease policy again but their stated long-term goal is 2% (in August the consumer price index was 8.3%).

Until then stocks have further downside according to Bierman who's an adjunct finance professor at both DePaul University and Loyola University Chicago.

That's primarily because the biggest names in the market ‚Äî many of which are part of the so-called ""FAANG"" stocks ‚Äî are still overvalued he said.

Given that they collectively make up such a big part of the market ‚Äî the top five stocks in the S&P 500 make up 20% of the index ‚Äî they will drag down the rest of the market Bierman believes.

""You've got to break Apple Amazon Microsoft Tesla and Google"" Bierman told Insider on Friday. ""They're disconnected from their long-term valuations. Apple has a sequential drop in its sales and earnings and the stock just goes up. It makes absolutely no sense.""

""In a bear market growth dies"" he said.

While Bierman thinks these stocks have further to fall it's worth noting that the five stocks he listed have already dropped in no small way in 2022. Here is the year-to-date performance of each of the stocks: AAPL (-17.2%) AMZN (27.5%) MSFT (26.9%) TSLA (24.5%) and GOOG (28.5%). All except for Apple have underperformed the S&P 500 though they are more on par with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 which is down 28.1% this year.

Bierman said the market bottom would also be signaled by higher levels of capitulation.

The ongoing lack of capitulation is reflected in the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX he said. Bierman said the index would likely spike to ""well above"" 40 a level that indicates more extreme levels of bearishness. It currently sits at 27.54 and tends to rise when the S&P 500 falls.

Markets Insider

When all is said and done Bierman said he thinks the S&P 500 will bottom out somewhere between 3000-3300. It closed Friday at around 3873 meaning 3000 represents 22.5% further downside.

Bierman said he doesn't have a particular timeline for when the above will play out but pointed to the average bear market lasting 14-18 months.

The bigger picture

Bierman's call for a bottom between 3000-3300 falls in line with those from some major voices on Wall Street.

Goldman Sachs Global Markets Strategist Vickie Chang and Senior Markets Advisor Dominic Wilson said in a note to clients this week that the S&P 500 would fall to 3400 if a soft landing is achieved and the US economy doesn't enter a recession. If Fed tightening causes a recession then the index would fall to 2900 they said.

Morgan Stanley's Chief US Equity Strategist Mike Wilson also said the index could fall as low as 3000 (3400 by the end of this year) and Bank of America's Head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy Savita Subramanian has a 2022 S&P 500 price target of 3600.

Others are even more bearish like GMO's Jeremy Grantham who said in an August 31 commentary that ""every historical parallel suggests that the worst is yet to come"" for stocks. He characterized the current market as the fourth ""superbubble"" in the last century and pointed out that the prior three fell at least 50%.

Most other strategists on Wall Street remain more bullish with a soft-landing scenario being the most common base case right now.

But it still appears to be too early to tell how the current market moment plays out. Inflation stayed higher than economists had been anticipating in August and the US labor market is still too strong to cause the Fed to take a more cautious tone.

According to Bank of America analysis or corporate earnings calls companies are increasingly worried about a recession.

Below is the bank's corporate sentiment index based on the tone of the calls.

Bank of America

Here's mentions of layoffs on the calls for example.

Bank of America

The most recent example of negative corporate sentiment is FedEx which has dominated headlines in the latter half of this week. Raj Subramanian the firm's CEO told CNBC on Thursday that he sees a ""worldwide recession"" ahead and is taking cost-cutting measures.

To a degree FedEx is seen as a bellweather for the economy as its business model is closely tied to demand. Still some say fears about the overall economy's health stemming from Subramanian's guidance are overblown.

The Fed is expected to hike rates by 75 basis points at their September 26-27 meeting and then proceed with smaller hikes until sometime around the end of the year before pausing. The central bank has said they will then leave rates at their terminal rate instead of immediate easing.

How much these hikes begin to affect the labor market ‚Äî and how much inflation comes down ‚Äî will heavily dictate the Fed's policy moves going forward. With many expecting inflation to stay relatively elevated for an extended period of time stocks could pay the price.

""I think there are some real long-term inflationary pressures to be aware of"" said Tony DeSpirito the CIO of US fundamental equities at BlackRock this week. These pressures include a shrinking workforce a costly switch to green energy and deglobalization's impact on supply chains and rising labor costs.

""I don't see us going back to the ultra-low levels of inflation we saw post Global Financial Crisis"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzBmZDdiOTI5LWU4NmUtNDNlYy05NTJhLWZmMTRlYzJiOWRkYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fund managers pitch 'alts' to retail investors as institutions max out,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

With global equities having already lost US$23 trillion this year the US currency‚Äôs inverse relationship with risk assets makes it the only game in town for at least the rest of 2022 according to Citigroup Inc.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce says the dollar is set to keep rising while Brown Brothers Harriman & Co says the global backdrop continues to favour the US currency.

‚ÄúThe only place to hide is in US dollar cash‚Äù Citi strategists including Jamie Fahy and Adam Pickett wrote in a research note on Thursday.

It would take a ‚Äúdeep recession‚Äù to push US inflation significantly lower implying a prolonged drop in corporate profits and equities before the Federal Reserve pivots they said.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index which tracks the US currency against 10 global peers has surged more than 11 percent this year set for a record annual performance in data compiled by Bloomberg starting in 2004.

Evidence of the havoc caused by the appreciating dollar had been spelled out across currency markets last week.

The greenback powered ahead after quicker-than-expected US inflation data on Tuesday saw traders boost Fed rate-hike bets once again dragging down global risk sentiment.

The yen already languishing at a 24-year low tumbled to within a whisker of the closely watched 145 per dollar level while China‚Äôs yuan slid beyond 7 and the Canadian currency dropped to the weakest in almost two years. The Australian dollar is on the brink of a new multi-year low.

Strategists say there is unlikely to be any relief from the dollar‚Äôs dominance just yet.

‚ÄúThe repricing of Fed tightening risks is likely to keep the dollar bid across the board near-term‚Äù Win Thin head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York wrote in a note.

‚ÄúAs we said during this most recent dollar correction lower nothing has really changed fundamentally and the global backdrop continues to favour the dollar and US assets in general.‚Äù

CIBC agrees it is too soon to write off dollar strength.

‚ÄúThe real policy rate is still deeply negative and financial conditions are too loose‚Äù said Bipan Rai head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC in Toronto.

‚ÄúThe market has priced some of this in but there is enough of a question mark with respect to where the terminal rests that should keep the USD well supported.‚Äù

Citi forecasts the Intercontinental Exchange Inc.‚Äô s US dollar index which is already at a two-decade high will climb about another 2 percent in the next three months.

‚ÄúWe have outlined ad nauseam that the end of the USD bull-run will require either a Fed pivot evidenced via bull-steepening in the US rates curve or a bottoming in global growth expectations‚Äù the Citi strategists wrote. ‚ÄúThese could be themes for 2023 but not today.‚Äù ‚Äì Bloomberg",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNjI5Mzc2NzjSATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LTYyOTM3Njc4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IHG hack: 'Vindictive' couple deleted hotel chain data for fun,"Hackers have told the BBC they carried out a destructive cyber-attack against Holiday Inn owner Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) ""for fun"".

Describing themselves as a couple from Vietnam they say they first tried a ransomware attack then deleted large amounts of data when they were foiled.

They accessed the FTSE 100 firm's databases thanks to an easily found and weak password Qwerty1234.

An expert says the case highlights the vindictive side of criminal hackers.

UK-based IHG operates 6000 hotels around the world including the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza and Regent brands.

On Monday last week customers reported widespread problems with booking and check-in.

For 24 hours IHG responded to complaints on social media by saying that the company was ""undergoing system maintenance"".

Then on the Tuesday afternoon it told investors external that it had been hacked.

""Booking channels and other applications have been significantly disrupted since yesterday"" it said in an official notice lodged with the London Stock Exchange."

This compares to earnings of $1.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.65%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30 delivering a surprise of -19.25%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

International Flavors which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $1.27 billion for the quarter ended September 2019 missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.61%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $907.55 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have lost about 9.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.43 on $1.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.19 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Highland's Lockheed Martin and the other major defense manufacturers located there are constructing weapons key to turning around the war in Ukraine say military generals and other experts.

And Camden population 10300 is working to shore up a dwindling downtown and other amenities to maintain the area's most important industry -- the launchers missiles and defense weapons built by 2800 workers at Highland.

Lockheed's HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) made in Camden has ""been key to the turnaround in Ukraine no doubt about it"" said retired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark of Little Rock in an interview last week .

The former NATO Supreme Allied Commander now strategic adviser still has working ties to Ukraine. He had just returned from the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv.

HIMARS serves as ""a substitute for the Ukrainian Air Force"" Clark said. The missiles are satellite guided with a 200-pound explosive warhead that travels about 50 miles he said. It's accurate within about 10 feet military experts say.

""It's a very easy-to-use system usually mounted on a truck"" Clark said. ""It does what is called 'Shoot and Scoot.' It's very hard for the enemy to take out in advance. It's also able to get away after the rocket is fired.""

The artillery rocket system is built only at Lockheed's installation in south Arkansas according to Aaron Huckaby site director of Lockheed's Camden operations.

Military leaders including Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have appeared in international news reports in recent weeks applauding the HIMARS successes in Ukraine. HIMARS-launched missiles by last month had struck more than 400 Russian targets according to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Ukranian defense authorities have said the weapon has far exceeded expectations. It's been instrumental in reclaiming 1158 square miles of formerly Russian-occupied territory.

The attention has spilled over to HIMARS' builders in Arkansas and Camden as its city of origin.

A CBS ""Sunday Morning"" broadcast Sept. 4 talked about the weapon's production in rural south Arkansas. Politico a politics and policy news website on Sept. 9 examined Camden and Highland Industrial Park in a magazine-length article ""The Struggling Arkansas Town That Helped Stop Russia in Its Tracks.""

Two top military officials -- William LaPlante undersecretary for defense and Assistant Secretary of the Army Doug Bush -- visited Highland and Lockheed Martin late last month for an announcement regarding HIMARS and Lockheed's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS.

""We have received nearly $400 million to replenish HIMARS and GMLRS"" in defense department stockpiles LaPlante said according to a Camden News newspaper report. ""In addition we are planning nearly $200 million to expand and accelerate production...""

LaPlante and Bush also thanked Lockheed workers for the ""impact their efforts are having on the battlefield"" in Ukraine.

When Ramona Crain a real estate agent in Camden read the Politico article she was ""very pleased"" at the attention for the Camden area and its defense contractor industry.

""I had known by hearing around town that some of the industries were producing weapons for the fight in Ukraine"" she said. ""I am proud of their contribution. Many hard-working individuals are contributing to the success of these plants.""

Still Crain was surprised in some ways at all the recognition. The defense manufacturers don't get talked about a lot in Camden she said. And someone driving through the city wouldn't necessarily know the giant installation is a few miles outside.

""They're like a quiet group of defense industries that are doing a good job"" she said.

OUT OF THE CONVERSATION

Travel northeast from Camden on U.S. 79 Business cross the Ouachita River and rural countryside and -- at about East Camden population 798 -- turn onto U.S. 278 then Arkansas 274 to motor into Highland Industrial Park's 18780 acres.

At the entrance pass a hulking orange-and-tan billboard advertising the industrial park's 25-plus tenants.

Among the largest: Lockheed Martin -- ""We never forget who we're working for;"" Aerojet Rocketdyne; General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems; Raytheon Missiles and Defense.

A white-and-blue Lockheed building sits alongside the billboard across from the Highland Industrial Park administrative building.

The park also includes SAU Tech community college which trains workers including engineers and Arkansas' state fire and police training academies.

Most tenants according to John Schaffitzel the industrial park's president feed the defense industry.

Recent national attention on the Lockheed Martin Camden workforce ""has been nice"" site director Huckaby said in a digital interview .

His company which occupies more than 2000 acres at Highland has built more than 550 HIMARS ""from ground up -- truck chassis launcher that can fire various munitions"" he said. ""Some other sub-components are produced by our supply base. We have a number of suppliers across Arkansas and the nation.""

Ukraine has 16 HIMARS systems and wants more according to news accounts. The Pentagon announced plans last month to build 500. Lockheed doesn't divulge the HIMARS system's cost.

Huckaby said he like many employers worries about workforce development and retention. He wants to be more creative in identifying skilled and diverse talent while attracting and retaining the best.

Like many other companies at Highland Park Lockheed works four 10-hour days Monday through Thursday unless overtime is required. That helps workers who drive in from El Dorado Hot Springs Arkadelphia and other areas to work at the plants.

Pay and benefits are a big attraction.

Lockheed ranked the nation's largest defense contractor describes its pay only as ""competitive and fair."" Camden business leaders guess the lowest starting salary at $15 per hour with pay for engineers and other senior and highly trained staff climbing into ""six figures.""

Benefits surpass many Arkansas employers they say.

In addition to health insurance and a retirement plan Lockheed awards tuition assistance of $7500 to $12500 per year and up to four weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave according to a company spokesman.

Huckaby would like to see the Camden area offer workers better quality day care schools housing and other amenities which are issues his employees talk about ""on an ongoing basis.""

When he meets with state business and government leaders he sees ""a lot of momentum"" around growth in Northwest Arkansas and the Little Rock-Central Arkansas area. ""I think South Arkansas is missing from that conversation in a lot of ways"" he said.

Still Lockheed Camden has ""a healthy business and a healthy backlog"" Huckaby said. The company in June 2019 announced a $142 million investment in its Camden operation.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY

Defense contractors Lockheed Aerojet and others have built defense department weapons near Camden for decades.

Highland Industrial Park privately owned traces its history back to World War II as a U.S. Navy installation.

World-War-II era buildings still huddle close to high-tech factories. The site contains about 640 earth-covered munitions storage bunkers from its military days according to industrial park officials. They're handy for use by missile manufacturers.

After the Navy's Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot shut down in the late 1950s the Brown family of Texas bought 25000 acres Schaffitzel said. Highland Resources Inc. a subsidiary of Brown Engineering has operated the industrial park since 1968 he said.

Years ago Camden residents say it wasn't too difficult to get inside the defense industries at Highland Industrial Park if they had business there. But stepped-up security has made access more difficult. Lockheed and Aerojet declined Arkansas Democrat-Gazette requests to come inside their plants.

Defense manufacturing plants at Highland today sit behind individual wire-topped fences and guardhouses.

Lockheed and Aerojet are the largest tenants each with more than 1000 employees according to company spokesmen.

Aerojet's Camden operation on almost 2000 acres produces 75000 solid rocket motors a year to power defense systems including the Javelin Stinger Patriot Missile and other missile defense and tactical systems according to a company spokeswoman.

General Dynamics builds air-to-ground rockets and warheads. Raytheon constructs components for Navy missiles.

The Arkansas Economic Development Commission lists aerospace and aviation which includes defense industries as Arkansas' No. 1 export. The commission's website also describes Highland as one of the nation's ""fastest growing defense corridors.""

But unlike Walmart Tyson Foods JB Hunt Trucking and Dillard's Highland Industrial Park is hardly a familiar name across the state.

Asked how well-known is the Camden-area installation that builds launchers missiles and other military weapons Schaffitzel who has been on his job almost a year said he isn't sure.

""Is it highly known?"" he said. ""I don't know that they [defense contractors] want it to be highly known.""

Although state business and economic development officials know the industrial park well more widely it ""has been kind of a well-kept secret"" said James Lee Silliman executive director of the Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation.

""I don't know if that's by design.""

CAMDEN COMEBACK?

Decorative banners in downtown Camden recall the days of steamboats on the Quachita River.

Nearby a new mural on a renovated apartment building shouts rockets missiles and defense workers.

Camden settled in the early 1800s was a paper mill town for decades until International Paper Co. closed here in 2001. Now residents say it's a city that ""builds bombs.""

By all accounts the Camden area struggles with the same problems of other communities in the rural South and Midwest: declining population worries about access to education opportunities good-paying jobs medical care amenities.

Camden's defense workers are ""very important to the economy. They're transferring in buying homes settling in helping us build our community"" said Tammy George principal broker at Century 21 Campbell & Company.

She sees ""recent development and improvements in our downtown area new retail and restaurants. We're really pleased to see some growth.""

Still she doesn't know of any new homes currently under construction. And she remembers Camden in the 1970s nearly 50% larger with a population of about 15000 boasting stores such as Watts J.C. Penney Montgomery Ward Bealls and Gibson's that are gone now.

Lockheed's Huckaby said Camden's evolution may look better to those who have moved in more recently. The past 10 years have shown ""increases in the amenities and downtown"" residents tell him.

Highland Park's Schaffitzel said he pitches quality of life in the river city.

""The energy in downtown Camden is pretty amazing"" he said. ""They have First Friday events that draw 2000 or 3000 out in the streets."" He points to new restaurants like the Postmasters Grill in an historic renovated post office building.

'BOOM MODE'

Jim Golden who owns Jim Golden Ford in Camden counts on business from the defense companies and their workers. He also sees deeper inside the local military weapons industry than most residents as president of the Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development board.

In Golden's view ""the economy is fantastic in Camden right now due to the influx of aerospace jobs. It is very very good for Camden and very very good for this business. A lot of people work out there they buy vehicles from me I service their vehicles.""

""If it wasn't for these industrial plants this Ford place probably wouldn't be here"" he said. ""Or if it was it would be very small.""

Silliman Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation's executive director believes the area's military weapons builders are ""in a boom mode. The companies are all busy right now and have been. I can only speculate that a lot of the inventories will be replenished. It sounds like there's going to be steady production for a while"" he said.

Meanwhile attention on Camden's defense weapons industry and the city itself is mostly encouraging said many interviewed.

Clark whose family moved to Little Rock from Chicago when he was a child said defense industries chose Camden and Arkansas for good reasons.

After defense contractors were forced to shrink their operations at the end of the Cold War ""these companies decided where the best places were to concentrate their manufacturing. Camden fit the bill based on high-quality workforce and low cost"" he said.

""This is representative of the best of Arkansas"" Clark said. ""We have a lot of high-quality people here. They're stable love their families work hard and pay attention to what they're doing.""

Ford dealership owner Golden says that when foreign governments say they're grateful to Arkansas for life-saving weapons produced at Camden he's ""really proud"" of where he lives.

Defense plant workers and other area residents ""realize they're doing something special"" Golden said. ""They do.""

American civil rights attorney Ben Crump and his legal team visited Weed on Friday where he heard from fire victims at a town hall meeting at the Wayside Church of God in Christ.

Crump who was the attorney for the families after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor said he represents several dozen people who live in Lincoln Heights which was largely destroyed when the Mill Fire ripped through the neighborhood.

""We're here to make sure the Lincoln Heights community gets equal justice ‚Äî that's the most important thing here. Not just in the legal sense but in a real-life sense"" Crump said prior to the church gathering.

Aside from a loss of a sense of community victims lost family heirlooms such as wedding pictures baby shoes and family Bibles that Crump said ""chart our generational existence.""

""I was talking ... about how utterly devastating it is. Not just the loss of life for some but the loss of the homes but more importantly the contents of the homes"" he said.

Two women were killed in the blaze: 73-year-old Marilyn Hilliard and 65-year-old Lorenza Mondoc Glover both of Weed.

Earlier in the afternoon Crump accompanied Blenda Clark Long as she prayed with family members and placed a bouquet of flowers at the home of her aunt who perished Marilyn Hilliard and uncle Clardies Hilliard who was flown for treatment to UC Davis Medical Center's burn unit. The blaze also injured two other people.

Blenda said she contacted Crump's office and he flew from New York for Friday's appearance.

""It's devastating to see"" Long said of the fire's destruction. ""It's beyond devastation to see here in person ‚Äî everything that has transpired. We need some justice for this.""

Crump said Friday he wants to bring awareness of the Mill Fire's devastation to the highest levels of government noting how Black communities often are marginalized.

""That‚Äôs a common concern for many minorities that they won‚Äôt get equal treatment"" he said. ""We certainly will talk to federal authorities to say 'Don‚Äôt just sweep this under the rug. We want you to take a look at this. Lives were lost. People‚Äôs lives were devastated.'""

Crump said he'll tell authorities that ""however you would treat citizens in the most affluent community we want you to treat the citizens of Lincoln Heights the same way.""

Several dozen fire victims spoke at the town hall where Crump heard them say how tight-knit the Lincoln Heights community is. Residents would look after each other bringing firewood to those who were without and buying tires for people who couldn't afford them.

They also described harrowing escapes from the fast-moving blaze with one man crawling to safety and others barely getting out alive.

Also attending the town hall was Larry Olmstead president and CEO of United Way of Northern California.

Olmstead said United Way isn't involved in the litigation but instead will help residents in the recovery process.

""We are here ... for the needs in between to assist the community. We're not going to go away until the job is done"" he said.

The Mill Fire scorched 3935 acres and destroyed 118 buildings before it was fully contained on Sept. 13.

On Sept. 7 Roseburg Forest Products Co. of Oregon announced it was investigating claims that a water-spraying machine used to cool ash at its veneer mill in Weed ignited the inferno. Officially the fire remains under investigation by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

More than 100 people are suing the Roseburg for losses caused by the Mill Fire including Lorenza Glover's son. Others are suing for personal injuries or for loss or damage of their homes or other property by the fire.

One law firm ‚Äî Reiner Slaughter Mainzer & Frankel ‚Äî is representing 100 to 150 people suing Roseburg. As many as 50 of those clients lost homes mostly in Lincoln Heights and Lake Shastina. Many did not have homeowners insurance a representative for the firm said.

""People living in this community they were not people who could afford to pay for hotels and buy new cars and new phones just the basic things that were destroyed in this man-made catastrophe"" Florida-based Crump said.

Several at the town hall talked about how their grandfathers came to Weed at the invitation of mill founder Abner Weed and worked for International Paper.

A century ago the Black community in Weed numbered more than 1000 of the town's 6000 residents according to Blackpast.org. Black people came to the area to find jobs in the lumber industry. By the 1970s that number dwindled to 500 although the town's overall population dropped to 3600 by then.

As of 2020 11.5% of Weed's population was Black compared to 12.4% of United States residents according to Census.gov.

In this post Karishma Banga discusses the nature of India‚Äôs GVC integration primarily through forward participation; the sectors that fuel productive linkages; and the factors that have caused low integration ‚Äì lack of well-developed labour-intensive industries large domestic market labour market rigidities and low FDI. Finally she recommends strategies to maximise gains for domestic firms integrating into GVCs.

The Covid-19 pandemic has put the spotlight back on global value chains (GVCs) as a driver of economic growth industrial exports and job creation. GVC trade differs from traditional trade with the former involving intensive firm-to-firm interactions characterised by contracting and specialised products and investment (Antras 2016). Economies with advanced technologies and high wages tend to offshore manufacturing stages of the value chain to nearby developing countries with low wages leading to creation of regional supply chains (Baldwin 2006). One such regional supply chain is ‚ÄòFactory Asia‚Äô1. Despite its proximity to Factory Asia and its manufacturing capability in several sectors India has failed to integrate into GVCs (Baldwin 2011 Sen and Srivastava 2011 Athukorala 2019).

Nature of India‚Äôs GVC participation

India‚Äôs GVC participation is significantly lower than China Vietnam Korea and other Southeast Asian countries. Network products ‚Äì for which GVCs are the dominant mode of production ‚Äì such as electronics computers telecommunication equipment and vehicles account for only 10% of India‚Äôs total merchandise exports (as compared to about 50% of the exports of China Japan and Korea) (Veeramani and Dhir 2019).

Data from the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database demonstrates that India links into GVCs mainly through forward participation (domestic value added (DVA) in exports of intermediate goods as a share of gross exports) rather than backward participation2 (foreign value added (FVA) as a share of gross exports). This indicates its relatively higher engagement in upstream production activities3

The largest share of India‚Äôs forward linkages is made up of renting machinery and equipment followed by chemicals coke and petroleum basic and fabricated metals textiles and agriculture products (Mitra et al. 2020). Forward linkages in the manufacturing sector have been on the rise since 2012 while backward linkages have declined from 35% in 2012 to 23% in 2016 (Figure 1). Just six sectors account for nearly 60% of India‚Äôs manufacturing GVC exports ‚Äì coke and petroleum (18.3% of GVC exports) renting of machinery (14.9%) chemicals (11.2%) basic and fabricated metals (8.6%) and transport equipment (6.3%) (Mitra et al. 2020).

Notes: i) Forward linkages = DVA in exports of intermediate goods (as a share of gross exports). ii) Backward linkages = FVA in gross exports (as a share of gross exports)

Why did India miss the GVC boat?

Unlike East Asia India missed an important stage of promoting labour-intensive industries during its industrialisation. In 2020 the manufacturing value added share of India‚Äôs GDP was only 13% much lower than other Asian economies (Figure 2). Despite having comparative advantages in unskilled labour-intensive manufacturing activities India‚Äôs commodity composition of exports is biased towards capital- and skill-intensive products (Veeramani 2019). India‚Äôs manufacturing GVC trade both in terms of backward and forward linkages has also gradually shifted from the Global North to countries in the Global South (Banga 2021).

Figure 2. Value added by manufacturing as a share of total GDP for Asian countries in 2020

Source: World Development Indicators

Note: Medium and high tech manufacturing includes industries in which producers of goods incur relatively high expenditure on research and development. The two taken together indicate the share of labour-intensive manufacturing in the country.

Higher absolute and relative labour market rigidities are known to deter foreign investment and lead to reduced GVC spill overs (Javorcik and Spatareanu 2005). In labour-intensive production India‚Äôs archaic labour laws have created exit barriers disincentivising large firms from choosing labour-intensive activities and technologies (Krueger 2010). Stringent labour market regulations have further resulted in a slow growth of employment in the manufacturing sector and labour market frictions which have in turn led to the employment of inefficient labour (Panagariya 2008 Gupta and Kumar 2012).

Another reason for India‚Äôs low integration in labour-intensive chains (such as those of garments manufacturing) is the large size of the domestic market. In the presence of high export standards and strict delivery pressures Indian garments firms find it easier to supply to the domestic market and to neighbouring countries and the Middle East which have lower quality standards compared to the US and EU (Ray 2019). Moreover India‚Äôs forward participation is higher than backward participation in the textile wearing apparel and leather value chain (Figure 3) indicating that Indian firms tend to link into the garments value chain at the lower end exporting yarn and woven fabrics of cotton and of silk. This has been further confirmed using product-level analysis (see Gupta 2015).

Figure 3. Linkages in the textile wearing apparel and leather GVC

A third contributing factor to India‚Äôs low GVC participation is its inability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) into the manufacturing sector and subsequent weak links with lead firms (Hoda and Rai 2018 Ray and Miglani 2020). Empirical evidence suggests that openness to FDI is positively associated with backward GVC participation. Other Asian economies such Vietnam Bangladesh and Cambodia experienced growth in both FDI stock and GVC exports at more than 10% annually between 2010 and 2017 while India‚Äôs GVC participation witnessed a significant decline in the same period (Mitra et al. 2020).

A large part of Bangladesh‚Äôs success in the textile and apparel value chain lies in its successful lock-in of inward FDI from multinational corporations (MNCs) which relocated production units to Bangladesh to take advantage of the abundance of low-cost labour. FDI in the textile sector in Bangladesh also led to the growth of new domestic suppliers of buttons zippers and fabrics which increased the competitiveness of Bangladeshi textiles globally (Kee 2015).

Can Indian firms benefit from increasing GVC participation?

Manufacturing suppliers in emerging economies like India can benefit by exporting and importing through GVCs. The exposure to foreign competition and demands of international buyers can create new incentives for Indian firms to innovate while firms can also learn from the technology and knowledge embedded in capital imports. Simultaneously engaging in both activities further unlocks cost complementarities (Wagner 2012).

Firm-level GVC integration captured by vertical specialisation4 has followed a similar path to that of firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) in India over the period 2001-2015. In Figure 4 we observe that between 2001 and 2008 both the average level of GVC integration and firm productivity increased. However because of the financial crisis in 2008 there was a decline in average GVC integration and a fall in average productivity of Indian firms in the period 2008-2010 both of which recovered between 2010-2011 but thereafter continued to decline in the period 2011-2014.

Heterogenous productivity gains from GVC linkages

Empirical evidence from the Indian manufacturing sector suggests that Indian firms in GVCs have a productivity premium of 13 to 22% relative to non-GVC firms with the productivity premium from GVC linkages being higher in the automotive electronics and IT industries compared to textiles and chemicals (Manghnani et al. 2021). Examining the causal relationship between GVC participation and total factor productivity in a recent study (Banga 2022a) I find that participating in a GVC and increasing GVC embeddedness boosts manufacturing firm productivity in India. Moreover GVC linkages are evidenced to increase gross exports domestic value-added and employment in India (Veeramani and Dhir 2022).

However the gains from linking are not homogenous: both productivity gains and product sophistication gains are higher for Indian GVC firms that invest in digital capabilities and skilled labour (Banga 2022a 2022b). Increasing backward linkages have had a negative impact on employment growth in Indian industries while forward linkages have been found to have no significant impact (Banga 2016).

Conclusion: Industrial FDI and trade policy recommendations for job creation

The time for leveraging GVCs for economic growth in India is now: at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic and US-China tensions have led to a wave of MNC relocations away from China several policy initiatives are being rolled out by the Government of India to revitalise the manufacturing sector and to increase FDI. The subsequent realignment of GVCs could create new opportunities for India‚Äôs manufacturing sector (Baldwin and Tomiura 2020) particularly in sectors of ‚Äòtextiles wearing apparel leather and related products‚Äô and ‚Äòchemicals and non-metallic mineral products‚Äô industries where India could be an alternative to China when it comes to imports for the US (Bagaria 2021).

The discussion needs to shift from questions about how India can link into GVCs to how India can leverage GVCs for economic growth and job creation. There is an urgent need to reorient India‚Äôs trade specialisation towards labour-intensive sectors but this would require a targetted approach based on traditional sectors and sectors with high participation in GVCs (Veeramani and Aerath 2020).

In capital-intensive sectors where India has good GVC linkages (such as electronics and hardware) there is a need to promote exports and diversify into activities of assembling of final or network products (Athukorala 2014 Arora and Siddiqui 2020) and specialise in low-skill labour-intensive stages of production. Domestic firms in these sectors need to be incentivised to undertake research and development (R&D) activities while foreign-invested firms in such sectors need to be incentivised to create more backward linkages within the domestic economy. The domestic integration of manufacturing GVC firms specifically with the domestic technology/digital sector can facilitate large-scale employment gains in a fast-digitalising economy (Rodrik 2018).

India‚Äôs efforts to increase participation in free trade agreements (FTAs) have failed to attract export-oriented FDI from GVC lead firms and have ultimately benefitted MNCs (Francis and Kallummal 2021). For example deep and non-strategic trade liberalisation combined with a liberal FDI policy regime led to increasing import dependence in India‚Äôs electronics sector (Francis and Kallummal 2021). There is a need to develop a coherent industrial policy that aims at increasing DVA within the economy creating links between the foreign firms and domestic suppliers and facilitating technological upgrading and spillovers from FDI. A more targetted approach is also needed; the impact of FDI on productivity of an acquired Indian firm is higher when the FDI is from developed countries particularly from USA or Europe but spillovers on productivity from vertical forward linkages are higher when the FDI is from Asian countries (Goldar and Banga 2020).

A related point of action is to facilitate the ‚Äòservicification‚Äô of Indian manufacturing‚Äì services such as R&D design services branding and retail etc. play an essential role in manufacturing GVCs. While India lags other major economies in terms of the services content of its manufacturing exports the increased use of services input can positively and significantly boost firm-level export intensity5 (Golder et al. 2017) and also sustain their survival in GVCs (Reddy and Sasidharan 2022). Offering support to firms through incentives and subsidies in deploying digital services can significantly increase manufacturing export competitiveness (Banga and Banga 2020).

Lastly India needs to reorient its trade policy with emphasis on developing its own GVCs. A potential pathway through which India can accomplish this is by leveraging its growing trade with partners in the Global South to establish its own GVCs through outward FDI joint ventures that can supply intermediate inputs at competitive rates.

This post is the sixth in a six-part series on 'The good jobs challenge in India'.

Notes:

Factory Asia comprises of Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Philippines Thailand China South Korea Taiwan and Japan (Baldwin 2011). Forward participation of a country refers to producing and shipping raw materials and intermediate inputs (for example yarn) for further processing and exporting by other countries (fabric) while backward participation refers to using imported intermediate inputs ( imported fabrics) to produce goods that are exported (apparels). Upstream production refers to all the activities needed to gather the materials required to create a product. This will include raw material processing for example drilling and exploration in the oil industry. It is farthest from the end consumer. Downstream production on the other hand are activities that help the end-product get produced and distributed. Vertical specialisation occurs when a country relies on imports of intermediate goods and services to produce a good it later exports. The use of services for example can raise the total factor productivity of manufacturing firms which can in turn lead to improved export performance of firms.

Collaborating with one of the most esteemed institution of the world the Conference had a special emphasis on UN targeted Sustainable Development Goals. The theme of the Conference was ‚ÄúManaging Economic Development and Financial Stability: In the era of SDGs and ESGs.‚Äù The Conference received 450+ papers out of which 300+ were accepted and 253 papers were presented in 50 tracks by expert researchers scholars and industry specialists with spectacular insights on Retracing Carbon Footprint Strategic Sustainable Development Electric Vehicles and Sustainability and many more. The conference received paper from 25 states of India. International papers were received from the USA the Netherlands‚Äôs and Mauritius. The primary sponsor of the conference was Becker.

IIM Bodh Gaya through this Conference aimed towards training budding researchers of the country to adopt the right methodologies to address their research questions effectively. A good peer learning experience as well as training from world class researchers will increase presence of Indian researchers in globally recognized publications. For that a two-day pre-conference workshop was also conducted on 14th and 15th September and had sessions by Prof. Aviral Kumar Tiwari Assistant Professor Economics & Business Environment IIM Bodh Gaya. Accompanying him were Prof. Amine Lahiani Associate Professor chez Universit√© d‚ÄôOrl√©ans; Prof. Olaolu Olayeni Associate Professor of Economics Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife Nigeria; and Prof. Madan Lal Yadav Assistant Professor IT Systems and Analytics IIM Bodh Gaya.

After being kept away because of the COVID-19 pandemic the group met with local organizing officials over three days.

‚ÄúWe are well-positioned for an exceptional event‚Äù LA28 organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman said Thursday at a media briefing on the UCLA campus site of the future athletes‚Äô village.

He expressed optimism for the games‚Äô commercial outlook citing several corporate sponsors already on board with more to come in the fourth quarter.

‚ÄúWe sit in a very strong position‚Äù Wasserman said. ‚ÄúThe appetite for the games coming back to this country is very strong.‚Äù

The coordination commission members visited several venues across the city including Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum site of the 1932 and 1984 games and SoFi Stadium home of the NFL‚Äôs Rams and Chargers in nearby Inglewood.

‚ÄúThe venues that are going to be used are a mix of the historic used for the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games and of course we have world-class modern venues that have been built since the Games took place in 1984‚Äù said commission chair Nicole Hoevertsz. ‚ÄúWe have this beautiful mix of the old and the new.‚Äù

The Intuit Dome will be up and running by the time the games occur. Wasserman noted the future home of the NBA‚Äôs Los Angeles Clippers is set to open in 2024 down the street from SoFi Stadium although at this time it doesn‚Äôt figure in any venue plans.

The commission visited the Obama Sports Complex to see the PlayLA youth sports program in action. LA28 and the IOC have invested $160 million to make sports more accessible to young people across the city.

Hoevertsz called it an example of the games ‚Äúcreating a legacy now today for these kids.‚Äù

Some have compared the new home-swapping app Kindred to Raya the exclusive members-only dating app.

With homes that are largely luxurious the average length of a Kindred stay is six days.

Members do not exchange money but pay an annual fee as well as cleaning costs and there is a waiting list.

Those with an eye on real estate and tech savvy websites might have read a bit about Kindred a new and very exclusive home-swapping app.

Home-swapping defined as trading homes with another person a l√° Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz in ""The Holiday"" is only a few decades older than the internet. But until recently it was relatively low-tech facilitated by dedicated groups Craigslist or sites like HomeExchange.com.

Kindred gives home-swapping the (fancy) app treatment. Like competitor Behomm (and similar to Raya the exclusive dating app) it is a members-only club; the easiest way to join is by invite from another member. And Kindred has a waitlist that it pulls from to build its housing inventory in locations popular with its members.

Kindred also takes a more active approach than Behomm which is invitation only but is focused on creative and design-oriented people. Kindred serves as a type of matchmaker and pairs members based on what they have in common like mutual friends pets or alma mater.

""We also help people find others who have similar interests or jobs so designers or founders or a popular one is actually people with dogs who want to swap homes with other dog-friendly homes"" Kindred co-Founder Justine Palefsky said.

A ""give a night to get a night model""

Membership is $300 a year. After that swaps only require a $30 service fee and a cleaning fee that varies by home.

Everything else is paid for with participation. In order to stay in someone else's home you must offer your home for the equivalent number of nights to another Kindred member. Palefsky called it the ""give a night to get a night model.""

""We're one of the few products where people who give more are the ones who get more vs. the people who pay more"" Palefsky said. ""It also means that no one can be a freeloader ‚Äì you all have skin in the game.""

There is no minimum or maximum duration for a swap but the average length of a swap is about six days.

Kindred takes care of the logistics from having the house cleaned and ensuring toiletries are provided to providing protection for hosts should anything go wrong.

A gifting culture has emerged between swappers with members leaving handwritten notes bottles of wine dog toys Polaroid pictures or crystals for their guests. One guest recorded a song using the sounds of the house and left it as a gift for their host.

""It was absolutely gorgeous and incorporated the sound of kitchen cupboards shutting the birds chirping and doors creaking"" Palefsky said. ""The whole company listened to the song on repeat when that happened. It's actually on Spotify now.""







Kindred doesn't look for luxury but still‚Ä¶

Both renters and homeowners can join Kindred. As far as the home interiors go Kindred has claimed time and again that it doesn't necessarily look for luxury.

After all there is no minimum home value ‚Äî but judging by photos provided by Kindred of actual homes on the site these are far from shacks.

""Where we have a long waiting list we do give preference to places that have character and really feel like home"" Palefsky said. ""We love accepting homes with soul that make for comfortable stays and have a unique style.""

Kindred vets and personally photographs each of the homes on the app to ensure residences look like pictures.

Geography Palefsky said is now the most important criteria for new members. Kindred prioritizes homes in locations its members want to travel to.

So who is using Kindred so far? The only demographic information Palefsky revealed is that users are mostly ""remote workers who have a tremendous amount of flexibility and are looking to travel frequently.""

'I felt like I discovered a cheat code'

Palefsky got the idea for Kindred after participating in an ad hoc home exchange. She swapped her San Francisco apartment for a place in Lake Tahoe occupied by a couple she had never met but who also also attended Brown University.

""When I got back home to San Francisco my plants were watered my packages were taken in and there was a lovely thank you note on my dining room table"" Palefsky said. ""I felt like I had discovered a cheat code ‚Äî I had the most amazing stay in accommodations that were nicer than anything I could have afforded on Airbnb and I only paid for house cleaning.""

Kindred recently raised $7.75 million from big name venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz. Opendoor CEO and co-founder Eric Wu is among their backers.

In a July story Curbed's Clio Chang called Kindred ""Raya for Home-Swapping."" When asked how she felt about the title Palefsky commented instead that the company prioritizes ""reviewing applicants"" and trust.

""We want to scale our product thoughtfully to ensure we can provide the best possible service for all community members and balance the supply and demand"" she said.

Kindred only operates in select parts of the United States but plans to expand. In the future it hopes that home exchange can reduce more controversial lodging like Airbnb which has been blamed for tax and home price hikes in some cities.

""In the future we see a world where people don't have to pay double rent in order to travel and don't have to buy multiple homes in order to split their time between cities"" Palefsky said.

The retrospective claims database analysis looked at patients in the United States where it is estimated that costs related to asthma are more than $80 billion annually.

About 10% of people with asthma do not respond to standard treatments and are considered to have severe asthma. The researchers acknowledged that for patients with severe asthma biologics although costly have been life-changing. In addition they noted that there are many reasons why patients may not be adherent to their medication including issues of cost and affordability inhaler technique beliefs about health or the ability to understand complex regimens.

The study published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice examined an IQVIA claims database for adults with asthma who were escalated to biologics (omalizumab mepolizumab reslizumab benralizumab and dupilumab) between January 2016 and June 2020. They were excluded from the analysis if they had 2 or more claims separated by at least 60 days with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) chronic idiopathic urticaria eczema or nasal polyps at any time during the study period.

Researchers analyzed exacerbations and control status as well as maintenance medication adherence during the 12 months before biologics were started. Adherence was defined as the proportion of days covered (PDC) by maintenance medication claims.

Current Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma treatment beginning at the lowest step that both prevents and controls symptoms and it defines severe asthma as asthma that is not controlled by correct use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists or that worsens when high doses are lowered. The GINA step was inferred by using recorded prescription claims before biologics began.

Asthma control was assessed using both the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) and Stempel criteria.

Of 1786 patients escalated to biologics 506 were included for analysis. During the 12 months before escalation 346 patients had confirmed exacerbations. A majority of the patients had uncontrolled asthma: 55% using ERS/ATS criteria and 70% using Stempel criteria.

Furthermore most of the patients were on the lower GINA step levels according to the inferred data and had not progressed through them before starting a biologic: 154 were at step 2 11 at step 3 104 at step 4 and 126 at step 5.

In addition 63% of 403 patients with maintenance medication claims had poor medication adherence (PDC <80%).

These results suggest that many patients are being escalated to biologic therapy inappropriately said the authors who noted that a 2018 report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review suggested a 50% price decrease would be needed in order to make the treatments cost effective for severe asthma.

""Because of the high cost of biologic therapy inappropriate escalation to biologics may have tremendous economic consequences at the population health level particularly due to the high prevalence of asthma"" they wrote.

Electronic monitoring of inhaled therapies could assist clinicians with understanding how patients are using asthma treatments at home before deciding whether a move to a biologic is needed the authors noted.

Michigan boasts a healthy share of influential golf architects - from Tom Doak and Mike DeVries to Arthur Hills - but none of those big names designed as many local courses as Matthews who passed away Sept. 15 at age 88.

Jerry Matthews designed and renovated more than 200 courses in Michigan. Courtesy photo

Of the roughly 200 courses Matthews designed or renovated 95 percent of them were in Michigan. He learned the business from his father W. Bruce. Jerry's nephew W. Bruce III also designed a handful of courses in their home state.

‚ÄúThe Matthews family is known as the ‚ÄòJohnny Appleseed‚Äô of golf in Michigan bringing the game and golf course architecture to so many people across the state‚Äù American Society of Golf Course Architects President Jason Straka said in a statement. ‚ÄúJerry‚Äôs legacy of course design and the impact of his service to ASGCA will carry on.‚Äù

Even though I've played more than 200 courses in Michigan I've still not come close to teeing up all those touched by Matthews. After earning bachelor‚Äôs degrees in Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning at Michigan State University he teamed with his father in 1960 to form the golf course architecture firm of W. Bruce Matthews & Son. In 1979 he took over as president. He was at the right place at the right time during the golf boom of the late 1990s. Michigan led the nation in new course openings for five straight years from 1995 to 1999 and in that span Matthews designed 17 of them.

None of his courses have cracked any sort of national Top 100 list. They're more solid to strong than spectacular. Sadly one of his best courses - Elk Ridge in Atlanta - closed in 2016. He was fortunate enough to work on unique sites such as ski hills quarries and the beautiful topography of northern Michigan. His Michigan golf legacy will live on forever especially with these 10 public courses I consider his best work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cHJlc3MubmV0L25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA5L2Vza3ltby1ob21lY29taW5nLXBhcmFkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eskymo Homecoming Parade | News Sports Jobs,"U.P. mail delivery changes paused by postal service The U.S. Postal Service has agreed to pause planned changes to mail delivery in the Upper Peninsula.

Please Note: Sadly the flying car does not turn into a briefcase. That's still going to be a while.

Meet George Jetson

Hold on just a moment. If you don't know who George Jetson is you need to go do some homework - and I mean right now. (Select seasons are available for streaming on HBO Max Amazon and other services.) Technically 'The Jetsons' was before my time airing origianlly in primetime from 1962 to 1963 and then becoming even more popular as reruns aired in syndication. The show was set 100 years in the future so it was a prediction of life in 2062.

And it had a very catchy theme song!

The flying car wasn't the only thing predicted by The Jetsons. Anyone else have a robot vacuum named Rosie? Sure enough The Jetsons' robot maid has plenty of little namesakes out there with irobot reporting that Rosie is by far the most popular nickname given to its robot vacuums.

Now Back to the Auto Show

Sean Borman runs Aero Auto and spoke with WDIV-TV at the North American International Auto Show about the company's XTURISMO.

‚ÄúEither at a personal use machine or a vehicle like this that has so much functional applications like police fire medical rescue public works and public service‚Äù Borman said.

He demonstrated the hoverbike at Detroit City Airport allowing Detroit Fire Captain James Davis to take it for a spin er a ride.

Davis noted that it was similar to riding a motorcycle only up in the air.

Borman guessed that some version of his company's flying car could be available as early as 2024 or 2025.

Given the fact that George Jetson's date of birth is estimated to be July 31 2022 we're hoping that by the time he's old enough to drive flying cars will indeed be part of our world.

This past March the actor was arrested in a tiki bar called Margarita Village in Hilo Hawaii after shouting profanities spitting in a patron‚Äôs face and grabbing a microphone from a woman singing karaoke to ‚ÄúShallow‚Äù from A Star Is Born. Miller claimed to have been accosted by a Nazi and to have evidence. In fact one of the first things you hear the actor say in the three-minute police body-cam video that circulated after the arrest is something the officers had likely never heard from a disorderly dive bar patron before: ‚ÄúI film myself when I get assaulted for NFT crypto art.‚Äù

But you wanted to play the game.‚Äù

Sources say the actor verbally and emotionally abused those around them and referred to themself alternately as Jesus and the devil.

When the police empty Miller‚Äôs pockets they find styrofoam Nerf bullets and place them in a plastic bag along with the single accessory linking the person in cuffs to the movie that their acclaimed career as well as $200 million of Warner Bros.‚Äôs money is riding on: a ring emblazoned with their DC Comics superhero character. By now Miller seems to have burned out their rage. ‚ÄúThe Flash ring means a lot to me‚Äù the actor says quietly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very valuable.‚Äù

That arrest was just one turn in a downward spiral so confusing and troubling that even old friends have difficulty parsing the chaos. What‚Äôs clear is that Miller has been endangering not just their career but also their safety‚Äîand allegedly that of others‚Äîin increasingly plain sight for the last two years. Since 2020 the actor has been accused of crimes and abuses spanning 6000 miles and two oceans: throwing a chair that hit a woman in the forehead threatening a couple in their bedroom and stealing a wallet and a passport in Hawaii on top of the incident at Margarita Village; choking two strangers in Iceland; and breaking into a neighbor‚Äôs home in Vermont to steal alcohol which resulted in a felony charge.

In June two protection orders were issued against Miller. The first was filed in tribal court in North Dakota by Chase Iron Eyes a Native American businessman and his wife Sara Jumping Eagle on behalf of their 18-year-old Tokata Iron Eyes who goes by Gibson. They accuse Miller of grooming brainwashing and emotionally abusing the teenager a nonbinary Indigenous activist Miller met when Iron Eyes was just 12. The tribal court put a temporary order in place but ultimately dismissed the request for a permanent one and the parents say they withdrew their request for custody believing the odds were stacked against them. The second order was requested by a mother in Massachusetts claiming that Miller‚Äôs interest in her own nonbinary 12-year-old made her and the child uncomfortable in incidents between February and June of this year. The actor denies the allegations.

Most recently Vermont State Police were dispatched to Miller‚Äôs farm with an emergency order from the Department for Children and Families. A 25-year-old woman named Ana had moved her three young children into the household. Though the woman has said that Ezra saved her family from an abusive situation Miller‚Äôs farm was said to be gun-ridden and unsafe for children. ‚ÄúI saw more guns than ever and three little kids running around among them‚Äù a longtime friend who visited in May tells VF. ‚ÄúThe youngest girl picked up a bullet and put it in her mouth.‚Äù The order issued on August 5 demanded that custody of Ana‚Äôs kids immediately be transferred to the state. But when police arrived at the movie star‚Äôs farm Ana and the children were gone. The children‚Äôs father tells VF that he has not spoken to his kids since April. A court date concerning custody has been set for October in Hawaii.

Warner Bros. has not commented on its marquee superhero and declined to speak for this story. But a source close to the situation says the studio and the actor‚Äôs agency CAA suggested Miller work with someone in crisis PR. On August 15 Miller finally admitted that they were in the midst of ‚Äúan intense crisis‚Äù and said in a statement: ‚ÄúI now understand that I am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment. I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior. I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy safe and productive stage in my life.‚Äù A source with knowledge of the situation tells Vanity Fair that the work currently consists of undergoing therapy.

‚ÄúI hope Ezra finds the light that they shined so brightly because the kid I met was a remarkably magical person.‚Äù

Over the last six weeks VF has spoken to more than a dozen people who crossed paths with Miller in recent years some of whom worked closely or lived with the actor on the 95-acre farm in Vermont. Most sources described Miller‚Äôs spiral as a conflagration of the mental health issues the actor has acknowledged along with drugs guns and outlandish claims that has raged for more than two years. They say the actor verbally and emotionally abused those around them and referred to themself alternately as Jesus and the devil. Three people say Miller has also wrapped the superhero they play into their grandiose speechifying. The actor says one source was ‚Äúclaiming that the Flash is the one who brings the multiverses together just like Jesus.‚Äù

All this has been a disturbing trajectory for Miller whose critical breakthrough came at 19 with their deeply unnerving performance in the 2011 school-massacre drama We Need to Talk About Kevin. The following year Miller proved their range with a charismatic turn in the coming-of-age story The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Since then the actor has hopscotched from indies like The Stanford Prison Experiment to full-blown franchise stardom appearing opposite Johnny Depp in the Harry Potter spin-off series Fantastic Beasts which has grossed about $1.8 billion. The Flash is due out in June of next year."

Highland's Lockheed Martin and the other major defense manufacturers located there are constructing weapons key to turning around the war in Ukraine say military generals and other experts.

And Camden population 10300 is working to shore up a dwindling downtown and other amenities to maintain the area's most important industry -- the launchers missiles and defense weapons built by 2800 workers at Highland.

Lockheed's HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) made in Camden has ""been key to the turnaround in Ukraine no doubt about it"" said retired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark of Little Rock in an interview last week .

The former NATO Supreme Allied Commander now strategic adviser still has working ties to Ukraine. He had just returned from the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv.

HIMARS serves as ""a substitute for the Ukrainian Air Force"" Clark said. The missiles are satellite guided with a 200-pound explosive warhead that travels about 50 miles he said. It's accurate within about 10 feet military experts say.

""It's a very easy-to-use system usually mounted on a truck"" Clark said. ""It does what is called 'Shoot and Scoot.' It's very hard for the enemy to take out in advance. It's also able to get away after the rocket is fired.""

The artillery rocket system is built only at Lockheed's installation in south Arkansas according to Aaron Huckaby site director of Lockheed's Camden operations.

Military leaders including Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have appeared in international news reports in recent weeks applauding the HIMARS successes in Ukraine. HIMARS-launched missiles by last month had struck more than 400 Russian targets according to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Ukranian defense authorities have said the weapon has far exceeded expectations. It's been instrumental in reclaiming 1158 square miles of formerly Russian-occupied territory.

The attention has spilled over to HIMARS' builders in Arkansas and Camden as its city of origin.

A CBS ""Sunday Morning"" broadcast Sept. 4 talked about the weapon's production in rural south Arkansas. Politico a politics and policy news website on Sept. 9 examined Camden and Highland Industrial Park in a magazine-length article ""The Struggling Arkansas Town That Helped Stop Russia in Its Tracks.""

Two top military officials -- William LaPlante undersecretary for defense and Assistant Secretary of the Army Doug Bush -- visited Highland and Lockheed Martin late last month for an announcement regarding HIMARS and Lockheed's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS.

""We have received nearly $400 million to replenish HIMARS and GMLRS"" in defense department stockpiles LaPlante said according to a Camden News newspaper report. ""In addition we are planning nearly $200 million to expand and accelerate production...""

LaPlante and Bush also thanked Lockheed workers for the ""impact their efforts are having on the battlefield"" in Ukraine.

When Ramona Crain a real estate agent in Camden read the Politico article she was ""very pleased"" at the attention for the Camden area and its defense contractor industry.

""I had known by hearing around town that some of the industries were producing weapons for the fight in Ukraine"" she said. ""I am proud of their contribution. Many hard-working individuals are contributing to the success of these plants.""

Still Crain was surprised in some ways at all the recognition. The defense manufacturers don't get talked about a lot in Camden she said. And someone driving through the city wouldn't necessarily know the giant installation is a few miles outside.

""They're like a quiet group of defense industries that are doing a good job"" she said.

OUT OF THE CONVERSATION

Travel northeast from Camden on U.S. 79 Business cross the Ouachita River and rural countryside and -- at about East Camden population 798 -- turn onto U.S. 278 then Arkansas 274 to motor into Highland Industrial Park's 18780 acres.

At the entrance pass a hulking orange-and-tan billboard advertising the industrial park's 25-plus tenants.

Among the largest: Lockheed Martin -- ""We never forget who we're working for;"" Aerojet Rocketdyne; General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems; Raytheon Missiles and Defense.

A white-and-blue Lockheed building sits alongside the billboard across from the Highland Industrial Park administrative building.

The park also includes SAU Tech community college which trains workers including engineers and Arkansas' state fire and police training academies.

Most tenants according to John Schaffitzel the industrial park's president feed the defense industry.

Recent national attention on the Lockheed Martin Camden workforce ""has been nice"" site director Huckaby said in a digital interview .

His company which occupies more than 2000 acres at Highland has built more than 550 HIMARS ""from ground up -- truck chassis launcher that can fire various munitions"" he said. ""Some other sub-components are produced by our supply base. We have a number of suppliers across Arkansas and the nation.""

Ukraine has 16 HIMARS systems and wants more according to news accounts. The Pentagon announced plans last month to build 500. Lockheed doesn't divulge the HIMARS system's cost.

Huckaby said he like many employers worries about workforce development and retention. He wants to be more creative in identifying skilled and diverse talent while attracting and retaining the best.

Like many other companies at Highland Park Lockheed works four 10-hour days Monday through Thursday unless overtime is required. That helps workers who drive in from El Dorado Hot Springs Arkadelphia and other areas to work at the plants.

Pay and benefits are a big attraction.

Lockheed ranked the nation's largest defense contractor describes its pay only as ""competitive and fair."" Camden business leaders guess the lowest starting salary at $15 per hour with pay for engineers and other senior and highly trained staff climbing into ""six figures.""

Benefits surpass many Arkansas employers they say.

In addition to health insurance and a retirement plan Lockheed awards tuition assistance of $7500 to $12500 per year and up to four weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave according to a company spokesman.

Huckaby would like to see the Camden area offer workers better quality day care schools housing and other amenities which are issues his employees talk about ""on an ongoing basis.""

When he meets with state business and government leaders he sees ""a lot of momentum"" around growth in Northwest Arkansas and the Little Rock-Central Arkansas area. ""I think South Arkansas is missing from that conversation in a lot of ways"" he said.

Still Lockheed Camden has ""a healthy business and a healthy backlog"" Huckaby said. The company in June 2019 announced a $142 million investment in its Camden operation.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY

Defense contractors Lockheed Aerojet and others have built defense department weapons near Camden for decades.

Highland Industrial Park privately owned traces its history back to World War II as a U.S. Navy installation.

World-War-II era buildings still huddle close to high-tech factories. The site contains about 640 earth-covered munitions storage bunkers from its military days according to industrial park officials. They're handy for use by missile manufacturers.

After the Navy's Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot shut down in the late 1950s the Brown family of Texas bought 25000 acres Schaffitzel said. Highland Resources Inc. a subsidiary of Brown Engineering has operated the industrial park since 1968 he said.

Years ago Camden residents say it wasn't too difficult to get inside the defense industries at Highland Industrial Park if they had business there. But stepped-up security has made access more difficult. Lockheed and Aerojet declined Arkansas Democrat-Gazette requests to come inside their plants.

Defense manufacturing plants at Highland today sit behind individual wire-topped fences and guardhouses.

Lockheed and Aerojet are the largest tenants each with more than 1000 employees according to company spokesmen.

Aerojet's Camden operation on almost 2000 acres produces 75000 solid rocket motors a year to power defense systems including the Javelin Stinger Patriot Missile and other missile defense and tactical systems according to a company spokeswoman.

General Dynamics builds air-to-ground rockets and warheads. Raytheon constructs components for Navy missiles.

The Arkansas Economic Development Commission lists aerospace and aviation which includes defense industries as Arkansas' No. 1 export. The commission's website also describes Highland as one of the nation's ""fastest growing defense corridors.""

But unlike Walmart Tyson Foods JB Hunt Trucking and Dillard's Highland Industrial Park is hardly a familiar name across the state.

Asked how well-known is the Camden-area installation that builds launchers missiles and other military weapons Schaffitzel who has been on his job almost a year said he isn't sure.

""Is it highly known?"" he said. ""I don't know that they [defense contractors] want it to be highly known.""

Although state business and economic development officials know the industrial park well more widely it ""has been kind of a well-kept secret"" said James Lee Silliman executive director of the Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation.

""I don't know if that's by design.""

CAMDEN COMEBACK?

Decorative banners in downtown Camden recall the days of steamboats on the Quachita River.

Nearby a new mural on a renovated apartment building shouts rockets missiles and defense workers.

Camden settled in the early 1800s was a paper mill town for decades until International Paper Co. closed here in 2001. Now residents say it's a city that ""builds bombs.""

By all accounts the Camden area struggles with the same problems of other communities in the rural South and Midwest: declining population worries about access to education opportunities good-paying jobs medical care amenities.

Camden's defense workers are ""very important to the economy. They're transferring in buying homes settling in helping us build our community"" said Tammy George principal broker at Century 21 Campbell & Company.

She sees ""recent development and improvements in our downtown area new retail and restaurants. We're really pleased to see some growth.""

Still she doesn't know of any new homes currently under construction. And she remembers Camden in the 1970s nearly 50% larger with a population of about 15000 boasting stores such as Watts J.C. Penney Montgomery Ward Bealls and Gibson's that are gone now.

Lockheed's Huckaby said Camden's evolution may look better to those who have moved in more recently. The past 10 years have shown ""increases in the amenities and downtown"" residents tell him.

Highland Park's Schaffitzel said he pitches quality of life in the river city.

""The energy in downtown Camden is pretty amazing"" he said. ""They have First Friday events that draw 2000 or 3000 out in the streets."" He points to new restaurants like the Postmasters Grill in an historic renovated post office building.

'BOOM MODE'

Jim Golden who owns Jim Golden Ford in Camden counts on business from the defense companies and their workers. He also sees deeper inside the local military weapons industry than most residents as president of the Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development board.

In Golden's view ""the economy is fantastic in Camden right now due to the influx of aerospace jobs. It is very very good for Camden and very very good for this business. A lot of people work out there they buy vehicles from me I service their vehicles.""

""If it wasn't for these industrial plants this Ford place probably wouldn't be here"" he said. ""Or if it was it would be very small.""

Silliman Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation's executive director believes the area's military weapons builders are ""in a boom mode. The companies are all busy right now and have been. I can only speculate that a lot of the inventories will be replenished. It sounds like there's going to be steady production for a while"" he said.

Meanwhile attention on Camden's defense weapons industry and the city itself is mostly encouraging said many interviewed.

Clark whose family moved to Little Rock from Chicago when he was a child said defense industries chose Camden and Arkansas for good reasons.

After defense contractors were forced to shrink their operations at the end of the Cold War ""these companies decided where the best places were to concentrate their manufacturing. Camden fit the bill based on high-quality workforce and low cost"" he said.

""This is representative of the best of Arkansas"" Clark said. ""We have a lot of high-quality people here. They're stable love their families work hard and pay attention to what they're doing.""

Ford dealership owner Golden says that when foreign governments say they're grateful to Arkansas for life-saving weapons produced at Camden he's ""really proud"" of where he lives.

Defense plant workers and other area residents ""realize they're doing something special"" Golden said. ""They do.""

Jack Henry & Associates' Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings

If the payments aren't sustainable a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment Jack Henry & Associates was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.

The next year is set to see EPS grow by 40.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends we think the payout ratio could be 32% by next year which is in a pretty sustainable range.

Jack Henry & Associates Has A Solid Track Record

The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.80 in 2014 and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. So dividends have been growing pretty quickly and even more impressively they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.

Demetriou will continue as executive chair of the board.

The changes are effective Jan. 24 the date of the company‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting.

‚ÄúIt has been the highlight of my career to lead Jacobs over these past seven years‚Äù Demetriou said. ‚ÄúWith a strong foundation and clear trajectory in place now is the right time to implement our succession plan.

Pragada joined Jacobs in 2006 holding several senior management positions over nine years. He returned to Jacobs in 2016 as president of the global industrial and buildings and infrastructure lines of business. In 2019 he was president and COO.

‚ÄúIt is an exciting time for Jacobs‚Äù Pragada said. ‚ÄúWe have just launched our bold new strategy and are at the forefront of our industry ‚è§ anticipating the global trends most important to our clients and developing differentiated data-enabled solutions that meet their needs. I am honored to take on the role of CEO early next year and advance the exciting work underway.‚Äù

Levine who cared for her during the final weeks by her side.

Susan was born in Milwaukee on Nov. 19 1934 the daughter of sculptor and architect expert Katherine F. (Wescott) Jacobs and her husband Herbert Austin Jacobs a former Milwaukee Journal and then Capital Times newspaper journalist. Susan dedicated herself to living enriching and preserving the legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright. For many she embodied it and its values. Her involvement with Wright began at an early age.

Her childhood was spent in Madison where her parents built the first of two Frank Lloyd Wright homes. The Jacobs House of 1936-37 441 Toepfer Ave. in Madison was the first of Wright‚Äôs Usonian houses and is now on the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization‚Äôs (UNESCO) World Heritage list.

The equally innovative second Jacobs House where Susan spent her teenage years was built on a circular plan around a sunken garden at 3995 Shawn Trail in the Town of Middleton in 1946-49 and is considered a precursor of sustainable design.

Upon graduating in 1953 with a degree in art education from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where she was president of Gamma Phi Beta sorority Susan moved to New York City NY to study music and work for Atheneum Books publisher Alfred A. Knopf.

Wright invited Susan and her then-husband David Coe Wheatley (a St. Louis Missouri native and former Taliesin apprentice who she married on March 30 1957 in Madison.) to join the Fellowship in 1957. From 1958 until 2002 Susan actively participated in Fellowship life in both Wisconsin and Arizona where she and her second husband Kenneth Burton Lockhart (an Iowa native who she married on Sept. 29. 1961 in Phoenix AZ.) built a cottage in the desert above Taliesin West in Scottsdale AZ. Susan served on the Fellowship‚Äôs senior teaching faculty directed the bi-annual Taliesin Day Symposium and was Program Coordinator for arts and cultural events pianist for the Taliesin chamber group and lead dancer in the Taliesin Festival of Music and Dance.

She was arguably the most prominent face of Taliesin to the outside world connecting people to the community and vice versa. Susan served on the board of Jazz in Arizona and the Scottsdale Arts & Culture Visiting Committee. In the 1980s she became senior graphic designer for Taliesin Architects and was responsible for a remarkable suite of designs for Phoenix‚Äôs Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Her own art including sculpture and architectural glass both leaded and sandblasted and porcelain and stoneware place settings for Edith Heath and Tampopo featured abstract geometric patterns based on nature.

Susan joined the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy board in 1996 and left the Fellowship in 2003 to live in France and in Cambridge MA with her third husband Neil Levine. She served as president of the F.L.W. Conservancy from 2009 to 2011 and became the first executive editor of the Save Wright magazine which she revamped and expanded into new territories. She also designed the Conservancy‚Äôs glass Wright Spirit Award given annually to recognize individuals and organizations that have worked to preserve Wright‚Äôs legacy. Most recently Susan co-authored a book to appear later this year titled ‚ÄúWright‚Äôs Jacobs Houses: Experiments in Modern Living.‚Äù

Susan and Neil got together in 2002 and in the following year she left Taliesin and moved to Cambridge MA to join him. They were married in 2007 and up until her death last month they spent much of the year in France either in their apartment in Paris or their country house in the western part of Burgundy known as the Morvan.

She is survived by her husband Neil Levine; her stepdaughter Leslie L. Bisharat of Granite Bay CA; her stepson Brian Lockhart of Tucson AZ. and two younger siblings her sister Elizabeth Jacobs Aitken and her brother William W. Jacobs. She was preceded in death by her parents Herb (May 20 1987) and Katherine (Sept. 16 1995).

‚ÄúSusan was a joyful forward-thinking Trustee of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation‚Äù said the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation in a statement. ‚ÄúShe brought her enthusiasm for creativity to numerous programs at Taliesin and Taliesin West and in separate pursuits like the Bach Dancing and Dynamite Society a first-class annual music festival held in Madison.‚Äù

'It's a very intricate ...,"Being a quarterback in South Elgin‚Äôs triple-option scheme demands toughness because that player is going to get hit.

Jacob Sullivan a 6-foot 191-pound junior likes to take on that challenge head-on. What he adds to the mix however is a strong arm to keep defenses honest.

‚ÄúYou have to respect the triple option‚Äù Sullivan said. ‚ÄúWhen you don‚Äôt we just run it hard. When you do people are open. It‚Äôs a very intricate offense.‚Äù

The Storm dominated on the ground as they usually do during Friday‚Äôs 47-12 Upstate Eight Conference victory over Larkin but Sullivan also threw four touchdown passes.

South Elgin‚Äôs Jacob Sullivan (4) escapes the grasp of Larkin‚Äôs Hector Flores (46) during an Upstate Eight Conference game in South Elgin on Friday Sept. 16 2022.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such an advantage because when it‚Äôs executing on all cylinders like it was at times (Friday) the defense will suck in‚Äù Sullivan said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I threw four touchdowns.‚Äù

South Elgin coach Dragan Teonic doesn‚Äôt take the advantage he has for granted.

‚ÄúIn this instance Larkin was using their safeties to fill up on the run with the option game‚Äù Teonic said. ‚ÄúThat opens up some opportunities down the field and Jake hit them.‚Äù

South Elgin (4-0 4-0) took a 14-6 lead in the first quarter on a 14-yard TD run by Mason Montgomery and a 1-yard TD run by Ari Kravis. The Storm then started looking to the air.

Sullivan hit Kyle Steinhofer with a 14-yard strike for his first TD with 9:57 left in the second quarter.

South Elgin‚Äôs Kyle Steinhofer (6) grabs a touchdown pass in the second quarter touchdown against Larkin during an Upstate Eight Conference game in South Elgin on Friday Sept. 16 2022.

The Storm‚Äôs next three TDs all came through the air. Sullivan sandwiched TD passes of 10 and 19 yards to Montgomery around a 40-yard scoring strike to Steinhofer.

Sullivan ended up completing 8 of 15 passes for 122 yards.

‚ÄúA lot of triple-option teams will focus so much on the run‚Äù Sullivan said. ‚ÄúWe really focus on having an open game.

‚ÄúIf we get stopped on the triple option we know we can go wide and throw the ball. It adds so much to our offense.‚Äù

South Elgin did dominate on the ground however.

The Storm ran for 365 yards and three TDs on 51 carries. Lucas Norowol and Montgomery each went for over 100 yards ‚Äî Norowol with 123 and Montgomery with 107.

Jordan Green added a 1-yard TD run.

South Elgin‚Äôs Mason Montgomery (8) scores a touchdown in front of Larkin‚Äôs Kevin Malone (22) during an Upstate Eight Conference game in South Elgin on Friday Sept. 16 2022.

Larkin (1-3 1-3) made it a game early on though.

The Royals forced a 6-6 tie in the first on a 15-yard TD run from Jalen Miller. Miller struck again in the quarter this time on a 4-yard run to cut Larkin‚Äôs lead to 20-12.

The Royals had a few big plays the rest of the way but weren‚Äôt able to slow down South Elgin‚Äôs offense to stay in the game.

Tizairan Johnson-Williams threw for 157 yards. Chevelle Clements caught four passes for 107 yards.

Teonic a former head coach for Larkin likes what he sees from coach Grant Dietz‚Äôs program.

Larkin‚Äôs Chevelle Clements (6) avoids South Elgin‚Äôs Shawn Clausen (11) to gain extra yardage during an Upstate Eight Conference game in South Elgin on Friday Sept. 16 2022.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing an awesome job putting their guys in position‚Äù Teonic said. ‚ÄúI said ‚Äî keep your chin up because they‚Äôre in games. You can see improvement. It‚Äôs a team on the rise.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there before. I know what it looks like. He‚Äôs doing stuff right and those kids have to continue to believe in what he‚Äôs doing because you can see the improvement. It‚Äôs tangible.‚Äù

South Elgin rolls into homecoming next week against East Aurora with 16 straight home wins.

Teonic will be leaning on Sullivan to continue to add to that total.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not even come close to his ceiling‚Äù Teonic said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we coach him so hard. He craves to be coached hard. He wants to be the best that he can be.

‚ÄúJake is so much better than he was as a sophomore but he‚Äôs got a long way to go. That‚Äôs what I mean with his ceiling. How good can he get?‚Äù

On Sunday the New York Mets ace had his 40th straight start of allowing three or less earned runs setting a new MLB record.

Excluding openers deGrom now has the most consecutive starts allowing no more than four earned runs since earned runs became a stat in 1913.

Jim Scott previously held the record for more than 100 years as he accomplished the feat from June 1 1913 to June 4 1914.

The last time deGrom allowed at least four earned runs in a game was back on Sept. 3 2019. After that he allowed just one earned run in his next 28 innings to clinch his second consecutive Cy Young Award.

DeGrom has numbers that have hardly ever been duplicated. In his last 103 starts (dating back to 2017) he has a 1.98 ERA and 888 strikeouts. He and Clayton Kershaw are the only pitchers in baseball history with a span of such numbers.

He has not had a season ERA over 2.50 since 2017.

The Mets earned their 93rd win of the season on Sunday behind deGrom's 13 strikeouts and two-RBI days from Jeff McNeil and Daniel Vogelbach. It's their most wins since their NL East-winning 97 wins in 2006.

COLORADO SPRINGS Colo. -- Downhill skier Breezy Johnson has been banned for 14 months for three violations of anti-doping rules and can't race until December.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency published its decision late Monday for Johnson‚Äôs failure to comply with the whereabouts rules. They oblige athletes to detail where they can be found for one hour each day to give a sample with no advance notice.

Athletes have been banned for up to two years if they have three violations in a 12-month period such as missed tests or failures to update accurate details of their location.

Johnson‚Äôs whereabouts failures were on Oct. 29 2022 then June 13 2023 and Oct. 10 2023 USADA said. A seven-time podium finisher in World Cup races she left the circuit in December while under investigation.

USADA said 14 months was an appropriate ban for the 28-year-old Johnson because her ‚Äúdegree of fault was relatively low given the circumstances of the case.‚Äù

Johnson did not race in the World Cup last season and is not scheduled to miss any races next season in her specialist downhill and super-G events before the ban expires on Dec. 9.

‚ÄúI apologize to my fans for letting them down and being unable to race this past season‚Äù Johnson wrote on social media adding ‚ÄúI made a human error and am paying those consequences.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you at Birds of Prey‚Äù she wrote referencing her scheduled return to racing at Beaver Creek Colorado on Dec. 14-15.

The USADA ruling can be challenged by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Johnson‚Äôs race career peaked in a one-year period through December 2021 when she had three runner-up finishes and four third-places in World Cup downhills.

She missed the 2022 Beijing Olympics due to a knee injury she picked up three weeks before the games.

Dan Lewis and Kathi Goertzen delivered the main course - the news. Steve Pool served up a side of the weather and sports were a treat in the end.

Eric was perfectly happy with his place at the table. But Dan Lewis was preparing to retire and KOMO News' general manager at the time suggested Eric switch from sports to news.

""Don't answer me now"" Lewis said to Eric.

""So I went home and thought about it. I came back the next day and I said thank you. That's very sweet. The answer is no"" Eric remembered.

General manager Jim Clayton didn't take a no for an answer.

RELATED:



""It was just one of those things I could easily see"" Clayton said. ""You could just see from the talent that he had. His presence on the set and the way he conducted himself in front of the camera. It was pretty obvious to me that he had all the abilities to do that.""

And in November of 2006 Eric slid his chair to the center of the set. Dan hadn't retired yet and the two of them co-anchored KOMO News' 5 o'clock news. Eric's wife Monique remembers watching on day one in November of 2006.

""The first night he anchored I was very excited"" Monique said. ""I‚Äôm cooking dinner and I‚Äôm in the kitchen. I‚Äôve got a little TV there and there was a story about a person who had a botched plastic surgery on their stomach. For some reason the reporter said 'Do you want to show us?' And the person lifted their shirt.""

Eric remembers this too. ""They were showing their stomach and there was an infection and it wasn't pretty"" Eric said. ""I made a face and they came out to us unexpectedly and there I was making this face.""

""It was like a 10th of a second and I was like did he just make a face on TV?"" Monique said.

""The face"" was a classic Eric grimace. An editor at KOMO News got a freeze frame of the moment and the Johnsons have had it on their refrigerator ever since.

And so that's how it began. Things of course got better from there.

For four years Eric anchored the news at 5 o'clock but still anchored sports at 6 and 11 o'clock. He treasured that time - doing what he loved while learning something new.

""It's okay to change. It's okay to grow up and do different things and I felt like I matured as a communicator"" Eric said.

By 2010 Eric left sports and was anchoring news only. But that title of ""news anchor"" never defined his role at KOMO News.

""Eric would never just be a sports person. He would never just be a news anchor"" Monique said. ""His passion as you know as everyone knows is writing stories getting to know people finding the little joys in life. That is really what drives him.""

I think of myself as someone who communicates by telling stories"" Eric said. ""And the best sports stories are just people's stories. They just happen to be around the world of sports so that part of it was an easy transition. I'm still telling stories about human beings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MTEyMzEyMS9waGlsaXAtam9obnNvbnMtaWNvbmljLWJyaWNrLWhvdXNlLWlzLW9wZW4tYWdhaW4tYWZ0ZXItMTUteWVhcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philip Johnson's iconic Brick House is open again after 15 years,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/91123121/philip-johnsons-iconic-brick-house-is-open-again-after-15-years on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MTEyMzEyMS9waGlsaXAtam9obnNvbnMtaWNvbmljLWJyaWNrLWhvdXNlLWlzLW9wZW4tYWdhaW4tYWZ0ZXItMTUteWVhcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Getty Images

26-year-old Elaine Lee quit her first job after realizing it wasn't the right fit for her.

The Great Resignation and ""quiet quitting"" made her realize work should serve her lifestyle not the other way around.

She currently works at JPMorgan Chase in user experience design where she makes nearly twice her old salary.

Elaine Lee 26 said her workplace environment at retail chain Ross was good and she felt valued by her team ‚Äî but she just wasn't happy.

""I was getting stressed out every day"" she told Insider. ""I would go to sleep with anxiety and it got to the point where I realized that I needed to make a change somehow.""

She realized the pressure she was experiencing was internal.

""I sort of realized that I didn't have a strong desire to improve like I wasn't really looking to get better at it even though I wanted to be good at my job"" she said.

The pandemic was the final straw.

""Just working at home all the time and not being able to go out and not being able to do the other things that came with living in a city ‚Äî work suddenly seemed like a much bigger part of life and that's when I sort of realized that I wasn't super enjoying what I was doing"" she said.

Lee decided to make a change and moved out of New York City to live with her parents in New Jersey where she thought about her career her mental health and her relationship with work broadly. Amid the old-but-newly-named trends of ""quiet quitting"" or ""acting your wage"" in which workers do their jobs as written and no more Lee wanted more. Her unhappiness at work stemmed from a realization that she was not passionate about her current position and she dreaded work because she was not excelling like she want to be.

The Great Resignation ‚Äî sometimes called the ""Great Reshuffle"" ‚Äî was the exodus of millions of workers from their jobs over the past two years. It revealed that a lot of Americans are fed up with lower salaries poor working conditions and an unsatisfying work-life balance. That unrest also includes a surge in union activism. Whatever the motivation many workers are quitting to pursue work they're passionate about. A record number of people are starting their own businesses for instance. Millennials like Lee who are between the ages of 26 and 41 have been a major force during the Great Resignation.

The fact that she wasn't alone in her desire for more eased Lee's guilt around her work performance and sense of self worth about it.

""The Great Resignation and quiet quitting environment has helped me let go of perfectionism"" she said. ""Work is supposed to support me in the lifestyle I want and not the other way around.""

""I want to do a job that I don't mind waking up to""

Although Lee spent two years while living at home with her parents anxious about employment and reflecting on why she left her last company she told Insider that time spent away from the workplace proved to be incredibly valuable for her.

""I sort of needed to find a new direction"" she said.







She realized that she wanted to pursue work that was more creative and settled on user experience design. While not working a 9 to 5 she took the time to do some research on the field spoke to designers she met in a Facebook group and attended design competitions.

User experience designers look at branding design usability and function of a tech products with the mandate of making them easy to use. Companies that range from music streaming services to insurance companies hire user experience researchers writers and designers and the field has been growing more popular in recent years. In 2020 Linkedin said UX design was the fifth most sought after hard skill by companies.

And it's a profitable one ‚Äî the average base salary for UX designers is nearly $100000 according to Indeed.

When she decided to enter the field two years later she was well-equipped to join it and landed a job at JPMorgan Chase. She makes $95000 annually there a major jump from the $57000 she earned at Ross Insider verified via pay stubs.

She attributed much of that good fortune to the time she took to consider her interests self-study and let go of some of the pressure she felt about succeeding at work. Part of it she acknowledged is having a family to lean on and savings to draw from ‚Äî an opportunity she thinks that more workers should get.

""I want to do a job that I don't mind waking up to that I have things at work I'm excited about"" she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JhbmR5YmVhbi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L21vbmV5YmFsbC0yMC15ZWFycy1sYXRlci1hLXByb2dyZXNzLXJlcG9ydC1vbi1kYXRhLWFuZC1hbmFseXRpY3MtaW4tcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsLXNwb3J0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moneyball 20 Years Later: A Progress Report On Data And Analytics In Professional Sports,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/randybean/2022/09/18/moneyball-20-years-later-a-progress-report-on-data-and-analytics-in-professional-sports/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3JhbmR5YmVhbi8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L21vbmV5YmFsbC0yMC15ZWFycy1sYXRlci1hLXByb2dyZXNzLXJlcG9ydC1vbi1kYXRhLWFuZC1hbmFseXRpY3MtaW4tcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsLXNwb3J0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xOC9maW50ZWNoLXZhcm8tY29ycG9yYXRlLWNhcmRzLWJucGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Varo's bank charter milestone more corporate cards and BNPL under a microscope,"Welcome to The Interchange! If you received this in your inbox thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you‚Äôre reading this as a post on our site sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week I‚Äôll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There‚Äôs a lot of fintech news out there and it‚Äôs my job to stay on top of it ‚Äî and make sense of it ‚Äî so you can stay in the know. ‚Äî Mary Ann

First off I have to say that this past week was one of the busiest fintech news weeks I have experienced in a long while. Whoa. So.much.going.on. While I couldn‚Äôt obviously cover it all I attempted to fit as much of it as I could into this newsletter.

Before we get into the various news items from the past week let‚Äôs talk about bank charters.

For the unacquainted according to Investopedia: ‚ÄúA chartered bank is a financial institution (FI) whose primary roles are to accept and safeguard monetary deposits from individuals and organizations as well as to lend money out. Chartered bank specifics vary from country to country. However in general a chartered bank in operation has obtained a form of government permission to do business in the financial services industry. A chartered bank is often associated with a commercial bank.‚Äù

In 2020 digital bank Varo became the first-ever all-digital nationally chartered U.S. consumer bank ‚Äî meaning it received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to become an actual bank as opposed to partnering with one as most digital banks do.

It was a bold and risky move. So I talked to Varo CEO and founder Colin Walsh to find out if it was worth it. His answer? 100%.

To read my full interview with Walsh on just how things have been going since head here.

The corporate cards just keep on coming

Mercury announced last week that it launched a new corporate credit card. Via email a spokesperson told me that the IO Mastercard is designed to help startups scale their business. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs straightforward 1.5% cashback on everything no personal credit check and the first step to qualifying for the card is having just $50000 in a Mercury account.‚Äù

The company added that a corporate credit card has been one of the most requested features from customers since Mercury launched in 2019. In fact Mercury actually considered launching with a credit card as its first product but instead chose to start with creating a bank account instead since ‚Äúevery founder needs a bank account to run their business‚Ä¶and [they] are the ideal foundation from which to build additional financial features.‚Äù The move is admittedly an effort to carve out its own space against the likes of Brex and Ramp.

Meanwhile European fintech Payhawk announced that it is launching in the U.S. with a focus on enterprise customers. As part of that move it is also launching its ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî first credit card product in the U.S. The move follows what a spokesperson describes as ‚Äúa huge year‚Äù for the company: Over the last 12 months it grew revenue by over 520%. The company achieved unicorn status after extending its Series B round to $215 million.

We‚Äôre not done yet! Center which was co-founded by former Concur CEO and co-founder Steve Singh and launched its own corporate card and expense software offering aimed at small- and medium-sized enterprises recently shared that in the last year it tripled its customer base ‚Äúwhile retaining 94% of existing customers‚Äù and doubled the company size. This is particularly interesting because many of the existing corporate card players often point to Concur as an incumbent that they are trying to replace.

These companies of course join a plethora of others in the U.S. already offering corporate cards including ‚Äî but not limited to ‚Äî Brex Ramp Airbase Mesh Payments and Rho.

Weekly News

Adyen announced on September 15 that it has become the first fintech to partner with Cash App (Block) to offer Cash App Pay a mobile payment method to its U.S. customers. Adyen said its businesses will be giving customers a way to pay using their Cash App balance or linked debit card. Cash App COO Owen Jennings said in a written statement: ‚ÄúAs the first financial technology platform outside of the Square ecosystem to launch Cash App Pay we look forward to seeing the value this partnership brings to our customers and Adyen‚Äôs businesses.‚Äù An Adyen spokesperson told me via email: ‚ÄúThe partnership will provide Adyen business customers access to over 80 million active customers that make up a third of Millennial and Gen Z consumers in the U.S. Their customers in turn will be provided with another convenient seamless way to pay at checkout that fits their unique financial needs and habits.‚Äù

Speaking of Block the company formerly known as (and still goes by sometimes) Square announced last week that its entire ecosystem of more than 35 products and services is now available in Spanish to sellers in the United States. This means that millions of Hispanic-owned businesses in the U.S. will have the ability to use Square in English or Spanish ‚Äúincluding key products like Square Banking to unlock access to financial services and Square for Restaurants to enable seamless bilingual communication between front- and back-of-house staff.‚Äù

While we‚Äôre on the topic of payments Goldman Sachs and Modern Treasury announced they are partnering ‚Äúto accelerate the shift to embedded payments helping joint customers embed and scale payments into products.‚Äù Via email a Goldman Sachs spokesperson told me that the partnership furthers ‚ÄúGoldman‚Äôs push to better serve mid-market companies that have long wanted to bank with Goldman.‚Äù In a written statement Eduardo Vergara head of product and sales at Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking said ‚ÄúEmbedding payments into software products is increasingly the trajectory of commerce and by partnering with Modern Treasury we are creating new opportunities for clients to seamlessly leverage our payments capabilities within their own platforms.‚Äù

In other Goldman Sachs news Bloomberg reported that the investment banking and financial services giant is ‚Äúembarking on its biggest round of jobs cuts since the start of the pandemic.‚Äù The publication cited people with knowledge of the matter who said that Goldman ‚Äúplans to eliminate several hundred roles starting this month.‚Äù

Buy now pay later made headlines several times last week. First the Associated Press reported that (unsurprisingly and sadly) while ‚ÄúAmericans have grown fond of ‚Äòbuy now pay later‚Äô services‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúpay later‚Äù part is becoming increasingly difficult for some borrowers.‚Äù Meanwhile TechCrunch‚Äôs Kyle Wiggers reported that the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on September 15 ‚Äúissued a report suggesting that companies like Klarna and Afterpay which allow customers to pay for products and services in installments must be subjected to stricter oversight.‚Äù Meanwhile Affirm CEO Max Levchin told Bloomberg Law in an interview: ‚ÄúA fair amount of what the report has called for we have chosen to do. We have always seen this as a lending activity subject to all the lending rules and regulations.‚Äù

Proptechs continue to take a hit. Residential real estate marketplace Sundae last week conducted its second layoff this year. About 28% of the team ‚Äî mostly sales and support staff ‚Äî were laid off. Specifically about 106 employees were let go. I reached out to the company for confirmation and a spokesperson told me via email that ‚ÄúSundae is focusing on creating a more streamlined customer experience so that we can get offers to sellers even faster. The market remains volatile and we saw layoffs as an opportunity to use data and technology to streamline our approach and improve our customer experience. We also saw these decisions as an opportunity to build a longer runway.‚Äù I covered the company‚Äôs 2021 raise here.

In more uplifting personnel news Forage ‚Äî a payments processor that aims to make it easier for grocers to accept SNAP EBT payments online ‚Äî revealed that Kristina Herrmann is joining the company in the new role of chief business officer. She comes to Forage after nearly 16 years at Amazon where she most recently built out and led the company‚Äôs underserved populations team as its founder and general manager. Earlier this year I wrote about how Ofek Lavian left his role as Instacart‚Äôs head of payments to join Forage. Today he serves as the startup‚Äôs CEO.

FIS has launched Worldpay for Platforms an embedded finance solution aimed at SMBs. Businesses that use the offering FIS told me via email ‚Äúeliminate the need for SMBs to pay separate partners to help with card issuance cash advances or faster access to cash flow.‚Äù Obviously this has implications for companies such as Stripe or Plaid or other embeddable products that target the small business marketplace.

ICYMI: Revolut recently announced a new online checkout feature Revolut Pay that ‚Äúlets consumers pay at an online checkout with just one click.‚Äù

Nearly two-thirds of that came from the Republican Party of Florida.

Lopez‚Äôs campaign account received a $49000 cash infusion from the Florida GOP her largest single contribution between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 plus another $20000 from various donors.

Her political committee Common Sense Government took $10000 from the Law Offices of Fernando Pomares a Miami-based firm specializing in real estate personal injury and medical malpractice.

Also from the real estate sector Lopez accepted $1000 apiece from Miami-based building supplies company DC-SOFL and Suncoast PAC a political committee whose chair Kendra Gaugush is a real estate lawyer for Miami firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.

Several health care organizations and businesses chipped in as well. The Florida Medical Association Citizens for Cancer Awareness Florida Assisted Living PAC and Florida Osteopathic Medical Association each gave $1000.

Other donations included $2000 from Florida CPA PAC and $1000 from Associated Industries of Florida Wren PC and Florida Free Enterprise Fund a political committee run by Nick Catroppo vice president of political operations for the Florida Chamber of Commerce.

Lopez spent about $13500 from Aug. 1 to Sept. 9. That included more than $11000 paid to Hialeah-based Front Runner‚Äôs Services for canvassing and poll worker costs plus another $1750 for accounting and reporting services.

The rest covered fundraising service charges.

Since she filed to run for state office in March Lopez has raised more than $321000. She had just short of $195000 left as of Sept. 9.

Meanwhile her Democratic opponent lawyer A.J. D‚ÄôAmico had just $33000 remaining.

Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9 D‚ÄôAmico collected more than $24000. While close to 30 people gave him checks of between $1 and $1000 ‚Äî most were for $100 or less ‚Äî the preponderance of his gains came from organizational and corporate contributions.

From the real estate sector several groups linked to the Florida Association of Realtors collectively gave $3000. D‚ÄôAmico also received $2000 from real estate companies tied to Miami-based Southern Glazer‚Äôs Wine & Spirits the largest wine and spirits distributor in the country and $1000 from the Florida arm of commercial development association NAIOP.

Donations from D‚ÄôAmico‚Äôs profession came in too. Florida Justice PC South Florida Citizens for Justice and Central Florida Citizens for Justice ‚Äî which shared a Tallahassee address on D‚ÄôAmico‚Äôs ledger ‚Äî gave a combined $3000.

McGuireWoods and RSA Consulting gave $1000 each.

From the health care sector D‚ÄôAmico took $1000 from Florida Doctors for Private Practice Florida Medical Practitioners and Florida Physicians for Private Practice ‚Äî which similarly shared a Tallahassee address ‚Äî as well as the National Provider Alliance a network of independent surgical assistants.

Other contributions to D‚ÄôAmico included $1000 from New Jersey-based waste management company Covant Energy JPMorgan Chase and the Committee of Florida Agents a political committee whose chair Craig Dewhurst works as an insurance agent for State Farm in St. Augustine.

The Florida Democratic Party also gave D‚ÄôAmico $3250 worth of in-kind aid to help with research costs.

D‚ÄôAmico spent more than $19000 between Aug. 1 and Sept. 9. Nearly 90% of that paid for campaign mailers design and printing services from Connecticut-based Mission Control Inc. and Impact Politics LLC in California.

He also paid $1500 to GW Strategies in Miami Shores for consulting.

HD 113 covers a central portion of Miami-Dade County including parts of Coral Gables Key Biscayne and Miami.

Last month Lopez easily dispatched of entrepreneur and Venezuelan American Republican Alliance member Alberto Perosch with about 67% of the vote in the Republican Primary to win her party‚Äôs nod for the race.

D‚ÄôAmico performed similarly outpacing Biscayne Neighbors Association President Andres Althabe in the Democratic Primary with 68% of ballots cast for him.

Just two years ago at the height of the coronavirus pandemic the firm profited from a stampede of consumers rushing to stock up on essentials.

But with the health crisis abating Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine has sparked skyrocketing energy costs forcing Hakle to file for insolvency recently.

Innovation could now be the key to survival.

Huge quantities of coffee grounds are produced every year by the European food industry and Hakle has found a way to transform the waste into material to make loo roll.

The first rolls using the new process were produced at the Duesseldorf-based company‚Äôs factory last week Hakle‚Äôs chief marketing officer Karen Jung told AFP.

‚ÄúThe goal is 20 to 25 percent‚Äù of coffee grounds constituting the material for making the paper replacing wood pulp said Jung adding the company was working towards reaching those levels.

‚ÄúThat does not sound like a lot ‚Äî but it means that a quarter fewer trees have to be used‚Äù added Jung whose company entered insolvency proceedings in September due to surging energy costs.

Hakle sees a strong economic case. The price of wood pulp ‚Äî which is in high demand in China the world‚Äôs biggest consumer ‚Äî has risen rapidly since 2020.

It is not the first time that the firm has taken an unusual approach to producing loo paper.

Two years ago it used grass grown in the Rhineland to make toilet paper said Jung who runs the business with her husband.

‚Äì Roller-coaster ride ‚Äì

The company has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent times.

After 2020 when it raked in close to 80 million euros ($80.2 million) in sales and made a profit of about 700000 euros it is now seeing its fortunes reverse as costs explode.

‚ÄúThe cost of a roll of toilet paper depends 80 percent on pulp energy and logistics ‚Äî and all three of these factors are driven by world markets‚Äù said Jung.

The price of gas rose up to 400 euros per megawatt hour and up to 1000 euros for electricity a heavy blow for the firm‚Äôs Duesseldorf factory which consumes about 100 gigawatt hours a year.

With costs that ‚Äúincrease tenfold in the short term‚Äù that ‚Äúreally becomes a problem‚Äù said Jung.

The survival of Hakle which is nearly a century old is now at stake.

‚Äì ‚ÄòFormula 1 race‚Äô ‚Äì

It has had several different owners over the past 40 years including US consumer goods giant Kimberly-Clark and a Luxembourg private equity firm before Volker Jung acquired 50 percent of the shares in 2019 with a new entrepreneurial approach that favours innovation.

The preliminary insolvency proceedings of three months have given some breathing space to the company as it seeks to fulfil a flood of orders said Jung.

‚ÄúAfter a short total halt of activities (at the start of September) now we really have to put our foot on the accelerator like in a Formula 1 race‚Äù said Jung.

The company wants to continue investing at its site in Duesseldorf where more than 220 workers are employed.

Hakle has already stopped using gas replacing it with petrol in its paper production processes. For the electricity used to transform it into rolls the eventual aim is to cover half of its needs with solar power.

Rylan Clark has explained that he was so devastated by the collapse of his marriage that he broke down to a point that his mother feared he had suffered a stroke.

The 33-year-old reality star was married to ex-Big Brother contestant Dan Neal 43 in 2015 but their relationship came to an abrupt end last year.

The breakdown of the marriage had a brutal impact on Rylan - whose fans grew concerned when he pulled out of work commitments as he dealt with his personal life issues.

Now Rylan has explained just how rocked he was by the end of his marriage - saying he was so distraught he was left unable to eat or even speak as he struggled with his grief.

He told the Happy Place podcast: ‚ÄúMy body did completely shut down. I wouldn't eat. I went through a stage where I couldn't even talk which for some people might be quite handy.

‚ÄúMy speech was just slurred. My mum thought I was having a stroke. My body just went. I went down to 9st and I am six-foot-four.‚Äù

Fans family and friends were all worried for the star when he started pulling out of work events as he dealt with the end of his marriage.

He said: ‚ÄúTwo days before I was due to do Eurovision everyone knew when I wasn't at Eurovision something was wrong.‚Äù

However Rylan now says he thinks stepping back from work was a bad idea.

He said: ‚ÄúIf I had done it I may not have gone on such a quick decline. And when I say quick decline it felt like minutes. I felt like I'd had the jab and I was shutting down.‚Äù

He went on to explain that he realised he did need a break - having been working in the public eye almost non stop since he burst onto screens as a contestant on The X Factor back in 2012.

He said: ‚ÄúIt was hard but on reflection yes I needed to stop. Maybe it was an amalgamation of 10 years. I didn't stop since the day I went on The X Factor.

‚ÄúNothing stopped. I don't regret stopping. I do feel if I try to carry on maybe I could have dealt with things better from a personal point of view. I don't regret that I stopped.‚Äù

The star went on to explain that he has been on a journey of self discovery as he recently enjoyed a trip to Spain on his own.

He advised: ""Doing what I did last week with Barcelona is a stop for me. That is how I am going to manage going forward.

""If I feel I need a stop have a stop but have an enjoyable stop with yourself. And don't be frightened of your own company.

""I have never been on my own my entire life ever. I would always live with my mum. Then I went on The X Factor. Then I met my ex partner and we moved straight in together.

""I had never lived on my own at 32. I was so frightened. That is what I was frightened of being on my own. I was frightened of not having someone there.""

Hiring efforts will ramp up in November as the plant prepares for a start date of Jan. 1 officials said Thursday.

Swift aims to have at least 200 employees at the facility.

""This will be one of Swift's largest plants at 325000 square feet and also the first of its kind producing charcuterie and Italian meats"" said Garrett Fortune plant engineer. ""Everything you see at stores at the deli counter.""

Output is expected at 40 million pounds of meat products per year Fortune said.

Swift plans to be one of the employers available at a job fair 1-4 p.m. Thursday at Armory Sports and Recreation Center 701 E. Ash St.

""As far as construction the plant is at about 80% right now and 90% to schedule. We are maintaining schedule. We got our last transformers last week"" Fortune said adding the plant will now be able to start installing equipment.

The company purchased construction materials before issues related to the supply chain increasingly impacted the globe but there still were snags Fortune said. While Stellar the plant's construction contractor brought in some of its own subcontractors local subcontractors were used as well he said.

Most senior staff positions already have been hired coming either from the mid-Missouri community or a few who have relocated to Columbia.

""We have hired some highly skilled individuals in this area"" Fortune said. ""Also the trade schools ‚Äî we have talked to a lot. And there are a lot of robotics programs in the area and a lot of colleges investing in that. As a business that helps us quite a bit.""

Human resources staff is hard at work not only preparing to hire but coordinating with other businesses along the Paris Road/Route B corridor on solutions for getting people to and from work said Tony Clark controller for the Italian food meats division of Swift.

Swift is looking into housing investments as well he said.

How Swift chose Columbia

Swift selected Columbia last year for its Italian meats plant at an 80-acre location along Paris Road next to Schneider Electric and 3M and near Kraft Heinz Aurora Organic Dairy and Quaker.

The plant will produce dry-cured meats including salami pepperoni prosciutto and pancetta.

More: These companies received Boone County Chapter 100 tax breaks. EquipmentShare could be next

Swift was approved to receive Chapter 100 tax incentive bonds from Boone County. As of last month Swift had not yet started its 10-year tax abatement period.

The $200 million facility will be the company's headquarters for Italian meat products including research and development Clark said. A second phase could bring an additional 50000-square-foot building costing $35 million.

The Chapter 100 incentive abates 75% of the company's property taxes on the new build. Property taxes of $3.7 million still are expected to be collected over the period.

Swift has received incentives from the state for its expansion in Columbia through the Missouri Works program. This incentive tool helps companies expand and retain workers by providing access to capital through withholdings or tax credits for job creation.

The company is also partnering with Missouri One Start to provide tailored recruitment assistance to meet its workforce needs.

Prior to all this Swift worked with Missouri Partnership and Austin Consulting to narrow down site selection. Missouri Partnership was the organization to make the case for Missouri said CEO Subash Alias.

The initial process was secret including with Chapter 100 using project code words before they were announced publicly. The Swift project was known as Project Silver.

Site selection ""is a very calculated scientific process"" Alias said. Considerations such as logistics workforce business climate and taxes go into the models created by Austin Consulting he said adding that company provided site possibilities in Missouri Kansas and Iowa down from a national list of 90 possible locations.

The Swift plant that already exists in Moberly helped boost the argument for Columbia Alias said. Another aspect that aided Swift's decision was that the Columbia location was a Missouri Certified Site.

Selection of Columbia ultimately came down to ""what was offered from an operational cost perspective an economic perspective and (Regional Economic Development Inc.) put us in contact with local governments"" Clark said.

""After that full bid process was done it was clear Columbia was the right choice for us.""

Community programs from Swift

Swift has at least two community investment programs one of which is known as Hometown Strong through Swift's parent company JBS.

""Right now we are looking to invest $300000 and it can be for different projects"" Clark said.

The other program is Better Futures which is for employees to continue their education whether at a technical or trade school or some other program Clark said.

By the time the plant is up and running the Better Futures program will be active. Swift HR staff is coordinating communications with local colleges and universities Clark said.

Employee community involvement such as with volunteerism or other community projects is determined on a plant-by-plant basis Clark said. One program already being explored is a donation avenue for the Food Bank for Central & Northeast Missouri Fortune said.

Not so much in 2022.

Not with Ben Roethlisberger in retirement Tom Brady in Tampa and the two teams that defined excellence in the AFC throughout the 2000s and 2010s undergoing transitions.

When the Patriots (0-1) walk onto the Acrisure Stadium turf on Sunday to face the Steelers (1-0) it will mark the first time since 1998 that the two marquee NFL franchises face off without either Brady or Roethlisberger (or both) in the huddle.

(Or you know three months after New England quarterback Mac Jones was born. Weird right?)

""It's going to be funny the first couple plays not seeing (Brady) out there"" longtime Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward said.

And maybe a relief too. Brady typically toyed with Pittsburgh beating the Steelers in the AFC championship game three times or swatting them aside during the regular season with startling regularity.

Yet the near-constant churn that embodies the modern NFL finally has shaken two teams that have long used the other as a measuring stick.

""I can't remember the last time we've gone three years without playing the Steelers"" New England coach Bill Belichick said. ""It seems like it's been a team we've usually played every year. Obviously it's been a little while. Some definite changes since the last time we saw them.""

The Steelers have just three players ‚Äî Heyward linebacker Devin Bush and safety Terrell Edmunds ‚Äî who were in the starting lineup the last time New England and Pittsburgh met a 33-3 clinic by the Patriots in the 2019 season opener.

The turnover is just as stark in New England where Belichick is in Year 3 of the post-Brady Era trying to keep his team afloat in an AFC where the swagger that long seemed the Patriots' birthright has shifted to places like Kansas City and Buffalo.

Not so long ago Pittsburgh vs. New England forced the league to stop and watch. This is the first time since that 1998 game ‚Äî a 23-9 Patriots win ‚Äî that a regular-season contest won't be played in the late afternoon showcase window or in prime time.

New England is hoping to avoid its first 0-2 start since 2001 months before Brady took over for an injured Drew Bledsoe and began the nascent stages of what became the greatest dynasty in NFL history. The Steelers began life after Roethlisberger with a dramatic victory in Cincinnati. If they can back it up against a team and a coach that's long had their number they'd offer tangible evidence their retooling after Roethlisberger may be well ahead of schedule.

""(A win) would set us up for things to come"" Edmunds said.

NO WATT

The Steelers will be without reigning NFL defensive player of the year T.J. Watt. The perennial All-Pro linebacker went on injured reserve Thursday with a left pectoral injury. Newcomers Malik Reed acquired in a trade with Denver in late August and Jamir Jones now in his second stint with Pittsburgh after being claimed off waivers on Sept. 1 will be given a chance to fill in.

""Those guys are not going to be T.J.; it's not realistic to think that they're going to be T.J."" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. ""But we expect them to be varsity.""

Reed is used to replacing generational players. He made the Broncos' roster as an undrafted rookie free agent in 2019 and in 2020 found himself taking over for injured Denver edge rusher Von Miller.

""I feel like being me you know what I mean?"" said Reed who had 15 sacks in three seasons with the Broncos. ""I feel like I've been able to play the game at a high level when my number was called.""

THE BOURNE IDENTITY

The glow from New England wide receiver Kendrick Bourne's dynamic rookie year in 2021 has faded quickly. Bournce slipped down the depth chart after a less than productive preseason that included him getting kicked out of a joint practice with Carolina for fighting.

Bourne was targeted just twice in last week's loss to Miami though he did haul in a 41-yard reception. Jones expects Bourne's role to grow in the coming weeks.

""He just has to continue to be himself"" Jones said. ""He's done a good job. He's a great teammate and we have a lot of guys on our team like that. I hope he can contribute more and he will and his time will come.""

SLIM PICKENS?

Pittsburgh second-round pick George Pickens was the breakout star of training camp looking every bit the downfield threat the Steelers desperately needed after struggling to go deep in Roethlisberger's final seasons.

Yet Pickens had just one catch for three yards in the opener a game in which Mitch Trubisky's two longest completions came on catch-and-run tosses to tight ends Pat Freiermuth and Zach Gentry. Trubisky said he ""definitely"" is going to look for Pickens more regularly and thinks the deep balls will come more frequently as he settles into offensive coordinator Matt Canada's system.

""We're just going to continue to take those shots and continue to work the timing in practice"" Trubisky said. ""We would like to come up with those big plays.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzA5MDUzMjFlLTdhZDYtNDA4MS1hOTVkLTZiNWIxOGFlYjI0M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McVitie's owner warns of more price rises for biscuit lovers,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

KROGER customers who use in-store Starbucks kiosks will now be able to take advantage of the coffee chain's reward system.

Starbucks has become a staple in Kroger stores over the past two decades with customers enjoying the perk of grabbing a cup of coffee while they shop.

The in-store Starbucks locations are licensed to be run by the shops which pay a percentage back to Starbucks.

But this means that customers were not able to collect Starbucks rewards points for My Starbucks Rewards - and would miss out on the chance of free drinks add-ons or food items.

This is because coffee drinkers would pay through the retailers' checkout systems meaning they couldn't earn Starbucks points.

While customers can earn points at any Starbucks stand-alone location their experiences at the retailer locations have been different depending on each store.

Customers might also not have been able to place orders in advance on the Starbucks app.

This issue was addressed at Starbucks Investor Day in Seattle on Tuesday.

Starbucks chief marketing officer Brady Brewer said that customers' experiences at retailer locations were ""inconsistent"".

To fix the problem the company created a new program called Starbucks Connect where customers at retailer locations will be able to receive their reward benefits.

""Both rewards and mobile ordering have become key to the business in recent years with accelerated growth during the pandemic"" Brewer said.

These benefits go beyond the point system.

Starbucks reward members also get free refills on brewed coffee and tea after purchasing a drink as well as a free birthday treat each year.

The Starbucks Stars system is simple; you earn two stars for each dollar you spend either through the Starbucks app or with a Starbucks gift card.

A majority rejected the most recent ‚Äúlast chance offer‚Äù that the company brought to the bargaining table. The biggest hang-up is wages. The vote from the members also included the authorization for the union and its members to go on strike if a satisfactory agreement cannot be negotiated.

Approval of a strike vote doesn‚Äôt mean that Kroger employees will immediately strike but gives the Union more bargaining power when they come back to the table for the possibility of a new offer from the company.

Local Kroger employees are represented by UFCW who after the vote this week has asked Kroger to come back to the negotiation table and says that the next move is for the company to make.

Kroger sent out a letter to its employees reminding them that no one wins in a strike that associates will miss out on paychecks and possible benefits and customers may stop shopping at Kroger and shop at other grocery stores that are non-union The stores could lose business and those customers may not return.

The strike vote could affect 82 stores in Ohio and 12500 employees.

Oregon State University is collaborating with the University of Idaho and Washington State University Tribal nations commodity groups and potato processing businesses on the five-year project that funded under the USDA‚Äôs Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program.

It is one of 70 projects totaling up to $2.8 billion funded by the USDA to support America‚Äôs farmers ranchers and forest owners and to strengthen U.S. rural and agricultural communities by building markets for what the USDA is calling climate-smart commodities meaning implanting green and climate resilient practices in food and agriculture.

‚ÄúOregon State University is privileged to take part in this once in a lifetime opportunity to help the potato industry Native American tribes and other crop producers of all sizes and kinds be part of a national solution to climate challenges‚Äù said Jeffrey Steiner project leader and associate director of the OSU Global Hemp Innovation Center.

More than 62% of U.S. potatoes are grown in Oregon Washington and Idaho and they have an economic value of $2.2 billion annually according to USDA statistics. Nearly 500000 acres of potatoes are grown in the three-state region.

Potato production typically uses practices that greatly disturb the soil particularly at harvest so organic matter does not build up and greenhouse gases are lost to the atmosphere project leaders said. This project is designed to assist farmers who want to use soil health building practices that result in climate-smart outcomes.

Oregon State and collaborators at universities and the Soil Health Institute a nonprofit based in North Carolina will focus on how climate-smart practices and rotation crops grown with potatoes those crops produced in the three years between potato crop production years can offset the effects of the soil-disturbing practices. Rotation crops include cereal grains alfalfa corn hemp and onions. Climate-smart practices include reduced tillage seedings use of cover crops and mulching residues.

The researchers believe using the proper combinations of these techniques could significantly increase soil organic matter reduce soil nutrient losses and improve the water holding capacity of the soil ‚Äì improvements that increase soil health save water and lead to climate-smart outcomes.

The project team will assess how potatoes and rotation crops are currently being grown on conventional and organic farms and Native Americans lands. By studying what is presently being done and measuring the soil conditions of fields at the beginning of the project the team will then work with the farmers and Tribal leaders will work to identify soil health building practices and rotation options that work for their farms and land conditions.

The effects of the changes will be monitored by measuring soil data. The data will be used in models to verify the approaches are working. Participating farmers and Native American Tribes will receive incentive payments to offset the initial costs of adopting climate-smart practices and to reduce the risks of early-adoption expenses.

‚ÄúWe want to provide potato and other farmers incentives for finding climate-smart practices that make sense for them and their farm conditions‚Äù Steiner said.

The project will also help develop ways to market and promote climate-smart potatoes and other crops. Some of the producers envision selling branded consumer products that could provide a climate-smart premium to participating farmers and processors.

Ambas novelas ya est√°n disponibles en formato digital y f√≠sico.

Por √ìscar Orellana | Sep 18 2022- 15:44

Augusto Borja es el autor de ‚ÄúLa hora no marcada‚Äù novela hist√≥rica con la que debut√≥ como escritor salvadore√±o en 2016 la cual durante mucho tiempo fue considerada por Amazon uno de los 100 textos m√°s le√≠dos de dicha plataforma.

Seis a√±os despu√©s el novelita cuscatleco regresa con un relanzamiento en forma de ‚Äúd√∫o pack‚Äù de esta ic√≥nica obra. Se trata de su segunda parte titulada ‚ÄúFugitivo‚Äù.

Y es que Augusto se ha destacado por retratar la vida de un El Salvador en su √©poca de esplendor ubicando al lector en las d√©cadas de los 50 y 60. Adem√°s en su amplia carrera como escritor ya cuenta con cinco libros en su mayor√≠a dentro del g√©nero de la novela hist√≥rica.

Con reconocidos personajes de la sociedad salvadore√±a como Maribel Arrieta virreina en Miss Universo 1955; Enrique √Ålvarez C√≥rdova o Lilian D√≠az Sol ‚ÄúLa hora no marcada‚Äù revive la arquitectura el glamour las costumbres y el estilo de vida imperante de un pa√≠s que despierta la nostalgia.

El texto est√° basado en un hecho real sucedido en la capital salvadore√±a en la d√©cada de los 60s. Con algunos elementos de ficci√≥n y otros de un minucioso cuido hist√≥rico la obra se centra en la historia de Mar√≠a Rene√© Mel√©ndez Bengoa hija de un alto militar salvadore√±o a quien la vida le lleva a encontrarse con su antagonista el cadete guatemalteco Ruiz Trevi√±o.

Por lo tanto el amor las traiciones el espionaje y la sombra de la guerra fr√≠a son parte de los temas que hacen que la novela capte la atenci√≥n del lector y los introduzca en un mundo lleno de contrastes.

Mientras que con el surgimiento de su segunda parte ‚ÄúFugitivo‚Äù la novela se vuelve a√∫n m√°s interesante y cautivadora ya que el personaje de Ruiz Trevi√±o pasa de ser el antagonista para convertirse en el actor principal de una red de intrigas secretos y espionaje en el fragor de la guerra fr√≠a en Europa.

‚ÄúCon esta novela Augusto Borja pretende cerrar el ciclo que inici√≥ con ""La hora no marcada"" su √≥pera prima en 2016 esta vez cae el tel√≥n y todo el sigilo y las interrogantes quedan develadas‚Äù revela el comunicado de prensa.

Aqu√≠ Diana Glez nos demuestra que si bien existe el riesgo de perder cuando se ama ninguna p√©rdida est√° exenta de proezas y menos cuando se tiene un talento que convierte al dolor y a la ausencia en vertientes de palabras llenas de una carga ingente de sentimientos y belleza l√≠rica. Eso es en esencia de lo que se trata la relatividad en el hecho de perder: cuando el amor se va llegan los poemas llega el arte a embellecer las ruinas y ponerles ung√ºento a las heridas. Porque Diana sabe que no siempre se trata de sanar sino de convertir el dolor en una oportunidad para tocar almas y decirles que no est√°n solas que a√∫n hay esperanza de resurgir m√°s fuertes con una luz de sabidur√≠a en la mirada. Y es que cuando una poeta pierde en el amor siempre gana la poes√≠a y el perder entonces se convierte en triunfo. Este libro es prueba de ello.

Aqu√≠ nuestras 6 particulares recomendaciones de los que consideramos que todo fan deber√≠a leer

Batman es uno de los personajes m√°s ic√≥nicos del mundo del c√≥mic y uno de los superh√©roes bandera de la editorial DC Comics desde el nacimiento del personaje hace nada menos que 76 a√±os en todo este tiempo se han publicado obras excepcionales en las que han participado una infinidad de artistas y guionistas y aunque es imposible enumerarlas todas aqu√≠ os dejo mis cinco c√≥mics favoritos del murci√©lago y que de alguna manera estas historias han servido para definir la personalidad del personaje y han sido determinante en las siguientes historias que se publicaron a partir de ellas.

N√∫mero 27 de Detective comics

Empezamos como no con la primera aparici√≥n del murci√©lago en mayo de 1939 en el n√∫mero 27 de Detective comics lo que hoy conocemos como DC. El personaje fue creado por Bob Kane y Bill Finger aunque a este √∫ltimo nunca se le reconoci√≥ como creador del mismo.

De la primera historia de Batman El Caso del Sindicato Qu√≠mico Finger declar√≥ que el argumento pertenece al g√©nero pulp de las revistas populares una evidente influencia que se halla impl√≠cita en la personalidad del personaje: sentir poco remordimiento a causa de sus asesinatos cometidos sin involucrar ning√∫n arma de fuego. El √©xito de su publicaci√≥n le report√≥ la creaci√≥n de su propia revista (Batman) en 1940 mientras segu√≠a apareciendo en Detective Comics. En ese entonces National Publications era la empresa l√≠der en las ventas de historietas siendo considerada como la m√°s popular y reconocida en la industria; Batman y Superman se hab√≠an convertido en sus ¬´h√©roes estelares¬ª. A finales de 1940 se introdujo a ambos personajes en la nueva serie World‚Äôs Finest Comics en la que Jerry Robinson y Dick Sprang trabajaban como colaboradores.

El regreso del caballero Oscuro (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns)

Seguimos con nuestro repaso con El regreso del caballero Oscuro (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns) de Frank Miller toda una obra de culto en el mundo del c√≥mic esta genial obra maestra supuso el resurgimiento del personaje tras a√±os de declive y no solo ha sido adaptada en forma de pel√≠cula animada (Tambi√©n muy recomendable) sino que tambi√©n ha servido a Zack Snyder como inspiraci√≥n para su ‚ÄòBatman v Superman: El amanecer de la justicia‚Äô.

El maestro Miller describe un futuro alternativo de Batman donde Bruce Wayne ha abandonado el manto del murci√©lago tras vivir varias desgracias personales. El regreso del Caballero Oscuro ahonda en los motivos que llevan a Bruce a volver a enfundarse el traje que tanto le cost√≥ dejar ayudado por una nueva Robin que interrumpe en su vida. A su vuelta le sigue de forma inevitable el regreso de villanos como Joker y Dos Caras que sirven como antesala al enfrentamiento final contra el propio gobierno de Estados Unidos y hasta el mism√≠simo Superman.

Batman A√±o: Uno

Batman A√±o: Uno. En 1987 y tras el enorme √©xito de The Dark Knight Returns de nuevo Frank Miller junto al dibujante David Mazzucchelli nos trae otro de los t√≠tulos imprescindibles del personaje una reinterpretaci√≥n del origen de Batman: qui√©n es y c√≥mo lleg√≥ a serlo. A√±o Uno establece el escenario para una nueva versi√≥n de un personaje legendario. El c√≥mic tambi√©n lleg√≥ en forma de pel√≠cula animada producida por Bruce Timm y dirigida por Lauren Montgomery y Sam Liu. Christopher Nolan se inspir√≥ en Batman A√±o: Uno para su primera pel√≠cula del murci√©lago.

El largo Halloween

Una obra maestra a los l√°pices del recientemente fallecido Tim Sale con guion de Jeph Loeb. En El largo Halloween no encontramos al cruzado de la capa mostrando sus habilidades detectivescas tratando de descubrir la identidad de Festivo un misterioso homicida que aprovechando fechas se√±aladas del calendario para cometer sus asesinatos. Con las familias criminales de Gotham en pie de guerra Batman tan solo contar√° con la ayuda de James Gordon y Harvey Dent para resolver este caso.

Esta serie de c√≥mics fue utilizada como fuente de inspiraci√≥n por el director y guionista Matt Reeves para escribir su pel√≠cula The Batman con Robert Pattinson como protagonista. Tambi√©n podemos encontrar una adaptaci√≥n de El largo Halloween en forma de pel√≠cula animada dividida en dos partes. Tambi√©n muy recomendable.

La broma asesina (The Killing Joke)

La broma asesina (The Killing Joke). Publicado en 1988 con guion de Alan Moore y dibujos de Brian Bolland es sin duda y a pesar de ser una historia dedicada al archi enemigo de Batman uno de los comics imprescindibles de toda biblioteca y por ende de cualquier seguidor del universo Batman. En √©l Alan Moore cuenta a modo de flashbacks un posible origen del Joker como un triste ingeniero/comediante y padre de familia que perdi√≥ todo en unas pocas horas llev√°ndolo a enloquecer. Este origen est√° basado en el c√≥mic El hombre de la capucha roja (Detective Comics N¬∫ 168 febrero de 1951). A√±adir que La broma asesina tambi√©n conocer√° una adaptaci√≥n en forma de pel√≠cula animada y que Jared Leto que interpreta a Joker ha hecho una infinidad de gui√±os al c√≥mic durante el rodaje de la pel√≠cula Suicide Squad de David Ayer.

Batman a Death in the Family (Una muerte en la familia)

Sin duda los 80 fueron una de las mejores etapas que ha conocido el personaje de Batman a lo largo de su historia. En 1988 DC comics avalada por los enormes √©xitos cosechados p√∫blica Una muerte en la familia y decide realizar un experimento donde los lectores deb√≠an decidir la suerte de Jason Todd (el segundo Robin) tras un encuentro con el Joker. En ella deb√≠an decidir nada m√°s ni nada menos si Jason Todd viv√≠a o por el contrario morir√≠a en manos del JOKER; la suerte no estuvo del lado de Todd donde 5.343 lectores bajaron el dedo cual circo romano decidiendo as√≠ su destino. Este hecho tuvo un gran impacto en el personaje de Batman tanto como la muerte de sus padres.

En 2005 el personaje de Jason Todd regresar√≠a al universo de DC como h√©roe que combate el crimen de forma violenta convertido en Capucha Roja (curiosamente la identidad que tuvo su verdugo antes de convertirse en JOKER). Una recomendaci√≥n no dej√©is de ver el largometraje de animaci√≥n Batman: Under the Red Hood.

El c√≥mic cont√≥ con el guion de Jim Starlin y dibujo de Jim Aparo. En la trama Jason descubre que su verdadera madre est√° viva y comienza su b√∫squeda por el Medio Oriente donde se re√∫ne con Batman quien est√° tras la pista del Joker. Jason conoce a su madre quien est√° involucrada en negocios con el Joker pero √©ste finalmente la traiciona golpea a Jason hasta dejarlo moribundo y los deja a ambos encerrados con explosivos.

Batman: Knightfall

Y para finalizar este repaso no podemos dejarnos en el tintero Batman: Knightfall publicado en 1993 con guion de Chuck Dixon y Doug Moench con las ilustraciones de Jim Aparo Norm Breyfogle Graham Nolan y Jim Balent. En El Caballero Oscuro: La leyenda renace no solo podemos ver a Bane sino que Christopher Nolan hace gui√±o a este c√≥mic incluyendo la famosa escena de Bane quebrando al murci√©lago.

En Batman: Knightfall (La Ca√≠da del Murci√©lago) Batman termina paralitico tras su enfrentamiento con Bane. Un nuevo personaje Azrael sustituye a nuestro h√©roe durante su recuperaci√≥n para combatir el crimen pero este atra√≠do por el poder de Batman termina convirti√©ndose en una amenaza. Una vez recuperado Bruce Wayne debe enfrentarse a Azrael y volver a ocupar el sitio que le pertenece.

Hartman Capital a real estate investment firm in Champaign Illinois is pursuing a development called Meridian Homes at Sycamore Drive on over 68 acres south of CR 650N and east of CR 700W. Plans call for a fully managed community of 153 single-family rental homes. Lennar is the builder. Homes will have three to four bedrooms two to two and a half bathrooms and two-car attached garages. Exterior materials will be masonry and fiber cement siding.

Town council members earlier this month approved annexing the land into town and rezoning the site to a planned unit development.

The council also approved an annexation on first reading for Alexander Ridge which St. John-based Olthof Homes is planning on about 48 acres on the south side of CR 900N about a half-mile east of Mt. Comfort Road. It would have 61 single-family homes and 66 villas. It would not be a rental community. The town‚Äôs plan commission is slated to have a public hearing and consider zoning for the site during its meeting at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 18 at Town Hall 6280 W. 800N McCordsville.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Watlington described the initiative as a key part of achieving his goal to make Philadelphia the fastest-improving large school district in the nation regarding student achievement. Watlington noted that the district‚Äôs open enrollment policy allows students outside the schools‚Äô catchment to enroll if this pathway interests them.

‚ÄúSchools share the responsibility to help companies recruit onboard support and develop the talent namely our students‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn order to build a healthy diverse and more equitable pipeline of skilled labor that supports both our local economy and economy of the future we need pipelines like this that provide our young people with the instruction awareness exposure and experience to support whatever pathway they choose when they graduate.‚Äù

However he added while he believes that talent is equally distributed among Philadelphia students ‚Äúaccess and exposure to resources are not equitably distributed.‚Äù

The district also wants to eventually expand the program to other neighborhood high schools in the city he said.

Officials at Thursday‚Äôs press conference did not provide a price tag for the 21st Century Schools Model. They also stressed that students participating in the new model will still need to accumulate the 23.5 credits required for high school graduation and the goal is for all of them to be ready for college as well as careers.

Ali Robinson-Roberts the district‚Äôs deputy chief of postsecondary readiness said the program allows students to make a closer connection between the work they do in school and their future careers combining ‚Äústudent engagement with academic rigor.‚Äù

Overbrook Principal Kahlila Johnson herself a 1989 graduate of the school said that Overbrook ‚Äî the actor Will Smith‚Äôs alma mater ‚Äî already has partnerships with several local companies and organizations. These include DASH a nonprofit that exposes students to the entertainment industry; Live Nation and Live Nation Urban which run entertainment venues; and the Mann Center for the Performing Arts.

The new model she said would help the school seek out and develop more such partnerships.

Johnson said experiences Overbrook already provides also increase students‚Äô desire to attend school which has a ‚Äúrich history‚Äù in music and the arts and is a beacon for the community looking to provide students access to those fields.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL2xvd3J5LW1heXMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1MzMwNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lowry Mays Obituary (1935 - 2022) - Dallas TX - Dallas Morning News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.dallasnews.com/us/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/name/lowry-mays-obituary?id=36533073 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWxsYXNtb3JuaW5nbmV3cy9uYW1lL2xvd3J5LW1heXMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1MzMwNzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvc3RldmllLW5pY2tzLXJldmVhbHMtZ3JlYXQtZGFyay13aW5nLWZsZWV0d29vZC1tYWMtc29uZy1zYXJhLmh0bWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stevie Nicks Reveals Who the 'Great Dark Wing' Is in The Fleetwood Mac Song 'Sara',"Stevie Nicks has written many songs for Fleetwood Mac and she revealed the secret meaning behind the track ‚ÄúSara‚Äù from the 1979 album Tusk. Here‚Äôs who Nicks called the ‚Äúgreat dark wing‚Äù in her famous song.

Stevie Nicks had an affair with her Fleetwood Mac bandmate

Most Fleetwood Mac fans know that singer Stevie Nicks had a turbulent romance with the band‚Äôs guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. But he wasn‚Äôt the only Fleetwood Mac member the ‚ÄúRhiannon‚Äù singer dated. She also had an affair with drummer Mick Fleetwood while he was married to Jenny Boyd and Nicks was dating someone else.

‚ÄúOne night we had a party and everybody was drunk and everybody was gone and it was just me and Mick and we ended up spending the night together‚Äù Nicks told Q Magazine in 2008. ‚ÄúAnd I fell in love with Mick and I think Mick fell in love with me.‚Äù

The singer has said that she regrets her romance with Fleetwood. ‚ÄúMick and I would never have had an affair had we not had a party and all been completely drunk and messed up and coked out and you know ended up being the last two people at the party‚Äù Nicks said for Oprah‚Äôs Master Class. ‚ÄúSo guess what? It‚Äôs not hard to figure out what happened ‚Äì and what happened wasn‚Äôt a good thing. It was doomed. It was a doomed thing caused a lot of pain for everybody led to nothing.‚Äù

Their fling ended when Fleetwood started dating Nicks‚Äô close friend Sara Recor who partially inspired the song ‚ÄúSara.‚Äù

Stevie Nicks revealed who the ‚Äòdark wing‚Äô is in the Fleetwood Mac song ‚ÄòSara‚Äô

In the Fleetwood Mac song ‚ÄúSara‚Äù Stevie Nicks sings about a man referred to only as a ‚Äúgreat dark wing.‚Äù The lyrics include: ‚ÄúAnd he was just like/A great dark wing/Within the wings of a storm/I think I had met my match.‚Äù

Nicks revealed that her affair with Mick Fleetwood inspired the song. ‚ÄúSara was pretty much about Mick. So he was the ‚Äògreat dark wing‚Äô‚Äù she told MTV Fanatic (via In Her Own Words) in 1998. ‚ÄúAnd ah it was about everything that was going on at that particular time too but he was the the reason for the you know the beginning of it.‚Äù

Nicks has also said there are more lyrics that fans have never heard. ‚ÄúThe original Sara was 16 minutes long. Like about nine more verses than what you hear on the record ‚Äú she reportedly said on the Tommy Vance show in 1994. ‚ÄúIt got edited down to 14 minutes down to 11 minutes down to 9 minutes down to 7 minutes down to 4 minutes and 40 seconds. I was to the point where I went ‚ÄòIs the word Sara even going to be left in the song?‚Äô‚Äù

The singer wrote another song with ‚ÄòSara‚Äô in the title

The name Sara has a special meaning to Stevie Nicks. The ‚ÄúGypsy‚Äù singer has said that if she ever had a little girl she would name her Sara. She also used the moniker as a pseudonym when she checked into the Betty Ford Center for her cocaine addiction in 1986.

The Fleetwood Mac song ‚ÄúWelcome to the Room‚Ä¶ Sara‚Äù was inspired by Nicks‚Äô 30-day stay at the rehabilitation facility. It includes the lyrics: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not home/And it‚Äôs not Tara/In fact do I know you?/Have I been here before?/This is a dream right?/D√©j√† vu/Did I come here on my own?‚Äù",,,,,,

Following the first phase of the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program Lockheed Martin was notified by DARPA that we won the contract to develop and demonstrate a nuclear-powered spacecraft. The project will represent a rapid advancement in propulsion technology to benefit exploration and national defense.

DARPA partnered with NASA‚Äôs Space Technology Mission Directorate on the DRACO project as both agencies will benefit from this leading edge technology.

‚ÄúThis is a prime technology that can be used to transport humans and materials to the Moon‚Äù said Kirk Shireman vice president of Lunar Exploration Campaigns at Lockheed Martin Space. ‚ÄúA safe reusable nuclear tug spacecraft would revolutionize cislunar operations. With more speed agility and maneuverability nuclear thermal propulsion also has many national security applications for cislunar space.‚Äù

In addition to our long history and expertise in nuclear controls Lockheed Martin is excited to partner with BWX Technologies on DRACO to develop the nuclear reactor and produce the special high-assay low-enriched uranium or HALEU fuel. The in-space flight demo of the nuclear thermal rocket engine vehicle is slated to launch no later than 2027.

As the 2020s proceed laser weapons are rapidly evolving from a promising concept to practical battlefield weapons. However this isn't a simple linear progression. Laser weapons are extremely complex systems that are often sent back to square one when some concept in the design proves to be no longer practical.

Each of these subsystems which includes power units laser generators beam combiners focusing units targeting systems and many others must all move forward and properly integrate in a form that is not only functional but robust and reliable enough to be a practical weapon at sea on land in the air and in space.

Obviously the most important subsystem is the solid-state laser itself. In this case Lockheed Martin has boosted the power into the 300-kW class. This is five times the power of the HELIOS tactical laser that the company delivered to the US Navy in August for integration into existing warships.

The new 300-kW laser will be used in several demonstration projects including the US Army's Indirect Fires Protection Capability-High Energy Laser (IFPC-HEL) Demonstrator laser weapon system. Laboratory and field testing is expected later this year.

By upping the power on the laser future weapons will be able to engage a wider variety of larger targets at longer ranges and neutralize them more quickly.

""Lockheed Martin increased the power and efficiency and reduced the weight and volume of continuous-wave high energy lasers which reduces risk for future fielding efforts of high power laser weapon systems"" said Rick Cordaro vice president Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions.

With more than 3700 such trades in those three years alone the investigation reveals potential conflicts of interest in nearly every area of policymaking.

Defense policy is no different. At least 25 members sat on committees that shape national security policy while simultaneously trading financial assets in companies that could create competing interests with their work such as defense stock. With a near-even party split Democrats and Republicans may have found a rare instance of common ground.

The majority of these members sat on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees ‚Äî the committees responsible for the budget and oversight of the Department of Defense.

The list includes the former chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee James Inhofe (R-Okla.) who bought and sold shares of technology companies as they fought over a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon which eventually went to Microsoft. When the Pentagon later decided to cancel the contract House Armed Services Committee member Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) sold up to $250000 worth of Microsoft stock two weeks before it was publically announced. Fallon served on the subcommittee which oversaw the deal though a spokesperson said at the time that he had ‚Äúabsolutely no prior knowledge the Pentagon intended to cancel‚Äù the contract.

It also includes Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) who reported more trades than any other member of Congress. Though they were ‚Äúmade by trusts in the name of his wife and young children‚Äù these trades spanned all of the top five weapons contractors ‚Äî Lockheed Martin Raytheon Boeing General Dynamics Northrop Grumman ‚Äî which could conflict with his role as a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Khanna has been an opponent of overspending on the Pentagon an indication that there is not always a straight line between stock ownership and votes on the budget. But that is decidedly not the case with many other members who cash in on defense stocks while wielding power in favor of bigger defense spending.

Members of the Foreign Affairs Homeland Security Intelligence and Appropriations committees also reported trades that could constitute a conflict of interest.

John Rutherford (R-Fla.) for instance traded Lockheed Martin Microsoft and BAE Systems stock while sitting on the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for determining the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs funding. All three of those companies have been awarded contracts with the Department of Homeland Security. Rutherford then bought Raytheon stock the day that Russia invaded Ukraine a company that has also been awarded contracts by the Department of Homeland Security.

The New York Times analysis defines a potential conflict of interest fairly narrowly only focusing on stock trades in companies relevant to committee assignments. Given the daunting task of assembling such a comprehensive list it is also limited to that three-year span. As a result it doesn‚Äôt include instances like Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) picking up Raytheon stock the day of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine or Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) buying Lockheed Martin stock the day before. By the Times‚Äô own admission ‚Äúthe analysis is surely an undercount.‚Äù

Though all of these lawmakers deny any impropriety the capacity for competing interests is clear; Congress continues to approve defense budgets beyond what even the Pentagon even asks for more than half of which goes to private contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon which could in turn privately benefit members of Congress invested in those stocks.

This could create a perverse incentive structure when taking into account that when global tensions rise defense stocks tend to follow suit. War is often good for defense companies‚Äô bottom line; Jon Schwartz noted in the Intercept last year that ‚Äúdefense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by 58 percent during the Afghanistan War.‚Äù Some members of the defense industry even acknowledge this connection as Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes did during an earnings call earlier this year:

‚ÄúWe are seeing I would say opportunities for international sales. We just have to look to last week where we saw the drone attack in the UAE which have attacked some of their other facilities. And of course the tensions in Eastern Europe the tensions in the South China Sea all of those things are putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully expect we‚Äôre going to see some benefit from it.‚Äù

Pressure is mounting for Congress to seriously consider self-regulation of stock trading. Seventy percent of Americans support banning lawmakers from trading stocks including a majority of both Democratic and Republican voters. To date at least six different bills have been proposed to limit the ability of members of Congress to trade stock.

Despite the popularity of these measures self-regulation is always a tall order. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) went on record saying that limiting lawmakers‚Äô ability to trade stocks would be ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and that ‚Äúit would really cut back on the amount of people that would want to come up here and serve.‚Äù Tuberville himself traded stock of major defense contractors such as Honeywell and General Dynamics while sitting on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Confidence in Congress sits in the single digits as overinvestment in the Pentagon has come at the underinvestment in healthcare education and addressing the climate crisis. Even if lawmakers defend their trades as routine the goal should be to eliminate both the appearance and reality of conflict in setting national security priorities.

Sikorsky Aircraft a Lockheed Martin subsidiary has delivered 23 of 65 HH-60Ws on order. The Air Force‚Äôs fiscal 2023 budget request would fund 10 more but that would close out the service‚Äôs planned purchases well short of the 113 Jolly Green IIs originally planned.

David Morgan a former HH-60G Pave Hawk pilot who is now the Air Force business development manager at Sikorsky said the Jolly Green II while still carrying the HH-60 designator is not just a spiffed up Pave Hawk.

‚ÄúA lot of people think it‚Äôs just more of the same but it is a completely new generation of aircraft‚Äù Morgan said. Among the changes: A bigger internal main fuel tank that holds almost 300 more gallons eliminating auxiliary tanks from from inside the cabin; seats for pararescue jumpers that fold up into the ceiling; and ‚Äúall kinds of sensors and communications‚Äù that enable survivors‚Äô signals to go ‚Äúright to the aircraft digitally.‚Äù

Those features will keep it relevant in the Pacific he argued. And without an alternative in hand cutting the purchase now may not make sense.

Congress could still increase the Jolly Green II purchase. Both the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations committees support taking the total to 85 aircraft in the 2023 National Defense Authorization bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup questioned ‚Äúthe strategic underpinning of these and other acquisition decisions‚Äù and both the House and Senate Armed Services committees have called for a review.

Military planners say the transition from a focus on counter-insurgency to peer power competition particularly in the Pacific where distances are far greater changes requirements. They question the value of a helicopter to conduct long-range rescues in case of combat with China. Air Combat Command boss Gen. Mark D. Kelly has said he does not see how the Jolly Green II would be able to recover survivors behind enemy lines in Asia.

Reducing the fleet to 75 helicopters ‚Äúis really going to put a strain on this fleet for the Air Force‚Äù Morgan contended. With a fleet of 112 the Pave Hawk ‚Äúhas always been considered a low density high demand aircraft. They‚Äôre always over deployed with very little time to reset and train.‚Äù

He thinks the Air Force‚Äôs worries about survivability in the Pacific could be soothed as the Jolly Green II enters service.

‚ÄúI think the concern is with the Air Force about survivability and some of the speed and the range in the near-peer fight‚Äù Morgan said. ‚ÄúBut you know this aircraft does have a refueling probe air refueling so it should have unlimited range. They can preposition the aircraft in support of any anticipated operations.‚Äù He suspects it won‚Äôt fly ‚Äúsingle-aircraft alone unafraid into some of these fights‚Äù but instead ‚Äúgo with packages. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre going to provide air superiority. They‚Äôre going to provide ‚Ä¶ support for the aircraft. So it‚Äôs not going to be the only aircraft on the search and rescue.‚Äù

And for now ‚Äúit‚Äôs still being tested and we don‚Äôt understand the full capabilities of this aircraft. So I think making assumptions before all that‚Äôs figured out could be premature.‚Äù

Edward Stanhouse deputy program executive officer for intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and special operations forces has said that in terms of an alternative a team ‚Äúis looking at a variety of technologies in that exploration mode right now from ‚Ä¶ [amphibious to] potential applications of some of those unmanned applications. A lot of work a lot of conceptual work I think has to be done in that area to do the proof of concepts.‚Äù

So far Sikorsky has trained about 200 pilots and crew members on the Jolly Green II. The HH-60W program director for Sikorsky Steven Hill said he‚Äôd recently met and flown with some of the crews ‚Äúand what you hear is they just love the aircraft‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt just gives them a lot more capability than they‚Äôve ever had before. They‚Äôre just excited about getting it into their hands and getting out and getting deployed eventually.‚Äù

The U.S. may not have the only military with the Jolly Green II in the long run.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had international interest for the last several years‚Äù Morgan confirmed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had several countries following the development and asking for pricing and availability. We‚Äôve provided that as best we can based on the development stage. We‚Äôve got a couple countries right now that are very interested so we‚Äôre working through options and potential with the Air Force for export.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbWlsLmluLnVhL2VuL25ld3MvbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWRlbGl2ZXJzLTMwMC1rdy1sYXNlci10by11cy1kZXBhcnRtZW50LW9mLWRlZmVuc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin delivers 300 kW laser to US Department of Defense,"Laser installation.

Lockheed Martin delivers 300 kW laser to US Department of Defense

Lockheed Martin Corporation has delivered its most powerful laser to date to the United States Department of Defense for testing.

Lockheed Martin stated in a press release that the laser had been transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering OUSD (R&E).

The laser belongs to the 300 kW class of lasers.

This 300 kW laser is ready for integration with US Department of Defense projects including the US Army‚Äôs demonstration laser weapon system with the ability to protect against indirect fire.

The Pentagon selected Lockheed Martin in 2019 to scale its combined spectral beam high energy laser architecture.

Lockheed Martin increased power and efficiency and reduced the weight and volume of high-energy continuous lasers.

Laboratory and field tests of the laser are scheduled for this year.

The development and creation of a 300 kW high-energy laser by Lockheed Martin was made possible by significant investments in directed energy technology.

Lockheed Martin stated that its team uses more than 40 years of research design and development experience to create innovative 21st century security solutions.

The latest directed energy weapons are designed to protect stationary and semi-stationary objects from missiles artillery mortars drones and helicopters.

Directional energy systems which use lasers or microwave radiators to destroy the system or disrupt the operation of electronics are also a potential option for protection against hypersonic weapons.

Recently the US military installed Lockheed Martin‚Äôs HELIOS laser system on the Preble destroyer (DDG-88)."

And that change was celebrated Thursday with a grand opening and ribbon-cutting of the school‚Äôs new rubber surface on all of the playgrounds thus making all the school campus fully inclusive for the students.

This project began last year with a discussion about the various problems with the mulch which was on the playgrounds noted Monica Donaldson who has served as the project manager and PIT Crew (Parent Involvement Team) PTO co-treasurer at the school located in Mooresville at 483 Rocky River Road.

One such issue she shared centered on access for some of the students who have disabilities. With the mulch they had a raised wall around it to keep it contained and therefore allowing only one way to enter for those needing wheelchairs or the use of braces. Maneuvering on the mulch was difficult especially in the wheelchair Donaldson said.

Thus they began to research the project and found out that rubber surfaces are ‚Äúsafer and more inclusive for everybody involved. Then came the price tag which was expensive‚Äù she said but this didn‚Äôt stop them. They just figured it would take them several years of fundraising through the school.

Through the efforts of the students and staff half the funds were raised as a result of their Booster-thon event last spring but as the principal Dr. Chuck LaRusso shared ‚Äúwe still weren‚Äôt there yet so we reached out to some partners.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were on a mission to find the funds to get it done this year‚Äù Donaldson said.

With a team effort of the PIT Crew and Kaylor Kaemba who was at that time interim assistant principal and is now an assistant principal at the high school they shared their vision with others in the community. Secretary Katie Pettigrew wrote up a grant proposal which was submitted to Lowe‚Äôs and the school became a recipient of a Lowe‚Äôs Home Town grant.

In addition to the help from Lowe‚Äôs local construction company Pedulla Excavation came onboard did the excavation work and provided new sidewalks thus allowing easy access to the school‚Äôs three playgrounds ‚Äî which includes the main one the pre-K and the third grade playgrounds. They also placed a new 16x20 pad for children to do sidewalk chalk art.

Jake Rollings store manager for the Troutman Lowe‚Äôs along with Adam Bauernschub assistant manager of the store were there for the celebration. Rollings reflected on the occasion by sharing that the Lowe‚Äôs Home Town Project is all about home town for Lowe‚Äôs.

‚ÄúLast year we celebrated out 100 year anniversary‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo we started selecting 100 home towns that we would decide to give back every year. It was so successful last year we said we are going to do it again every year now.‚Äù

Having grown up in Mooresville literally just around the corner from Rocky River Elementary just off Shearers and Pandora roads Rollings said ‚Äúit was really cool when they asked me to do it and they didn‚Äôt know I grew up right there right around the corner from Rocky River. So it‚Äôs a really cool opportunity to support connect with the folks at the school and give back to the community the kids.‚Äù

Mickey and Terri Pedulla likewise shared the importance of supporting and giving back to help the schools and the children and donating as much as they can.

Noting that they have 10 grandchildren three of whom are at the school Mickey said that ‚Äúeverybody‚Äôs got to help everybody to make it work. And that‚Äôs basically what it‚Äôs all about helping everybody.‚Äù

Once the finances were secured the actual work of pouring the rubber surfaces which was done by a Denver company took about 2-1/2 weeks Donaldson said thus providing a safe inclusive place for all of the little Rocky Racers.

While not a sponsor of the playground Lineberger Orthodontics wanted to come and help make the event even more festive by providing free popcorn and cotton candy Donaldson said ‚Äúand we more than welcomed them.‚Äù

Music filled the air courtesy of DJ Scott Vaughn as the children played on the playground before the official ribbon-cutting thus making it even more of a celebratory occasion.

Dr. Jason Gardner Mooresville Graded School District superintendent commented that this was ‚Äúan exciting day a lot of collaboration with our Parent Teacher Organization the school system and local businesses with Lowe‚Äôs to make this happen. And we‚Äôre just excited to provide something that our kids will enjoy for years to come.‚Äù

Roger Hyatt chair of the MGSD Board of Education said he would echo what Gardner said and noted the old saying ‚Äòit takes a village to raise a child.‚Äô

‚ÄúIt in fact does. What you see today is physical evidence of that‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd you can also see how excited the children are to have this opportunity. It‚Äôs designed for fun physical activity and safety which we always look at safety. And you can tell by the turnout of moms and dads that it‚Äôs an exciting time for them too.‚Äù

As for LaRusso when asked what it meant to have this area where all the children can be out there he said ‚ÄúI think we always think about schools being a place where kids come and they learn their academics but the playground is the place that they learn how to cooperate how to play how to get along how to share and so our playground is kind of our classroom so to speak for those skills. So it‚Äôs invaluable. It‚Äôs worth every investment that we make. I think that‚Äôs why everybody is so interested in contributing.‚Äù

As they prepared to cut the ribbon at the ceremony Donaldson again thanked everyone for their part in getting them to this point including the parents school staff and all of the PIT Crew. LaRusso echoed his thanks to the PIT Crews from last year and the incoming board who as he said ‚Äúwere integral to make this happen‚Äù along with Lowe‚Äôs and the Pedulla family.

Following the shout of ‚ÄúOne two three‚Äù LaRusso and Assistant Principal Lani Earnhardt cut the ribbon as confetti filled the air along with cheers and the excited squeals of the many children as they waved their racing flags thus officially opening up the playgrounds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vcmF6emJhbGwuY29tL2FtYnVsYW5jZS1jaGFzZXJzLWJyYW5kb24tbG93ZXMtYmlnLW93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ambulance Chasers: Brandon Lowe's Big Ow,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://razzball.com/ambulance-chasers-brandon-lowes-big-ow/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vcmF6emJhbGwuY29tL2FtYnVsYW5jZS1jaGFzZXJzLWJyYW5kb24tbG93ZXMtYmlnLW93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc3Rwcm9kdWN0cy5jb20vYXBwbGlhbmNlcy9sYXJnZS1hcHBsaWFuY2VzL2c0MTExODE1My9iZXN0LWJvdHRvbS1mcmVlemVyLXJlZnJpZ2VyYXRvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Best Bottom Freezer Refrigerators of 2023,"If you buy something from the links on this page we may earn a commission. Why Trust Us?

We know fridge shopping isn‚Äôt the most fun thing ever but considering that you use your refrigerator several times each day it‚Äôs one of those purchases you should really think about carefully.

Unlike top freezer models a bottom-freezer refrigerator typically has more storage options in a convenient eye-level design making it great for families that need more space and organization. It also fits in well with many modern home aesthetics and is capable of being equipped with more smart capabilities and other features like water dispensers. And yes let‚Äôs not forget about pull-out freezer drawers!

The Best Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators

What to Consider

Cost: First things first: Buying a fridge can cost a pretty penny. Some customized and upmarket models can run upwards of $3000 so establishing a clear budget from the outset is always a good idea.

Size: When it comes to major appliances you also want to think about how much real estate it will take up in your kitchen (or basement if that‚Äôs your thing). Bottom-freezer refrigerators can range in size from about 11 to 28 cubic feet so consider what makes the most sense for your space and kitchen‚Äôs layout.

Style: When buying a bottom-freezer refrigerator (also called a bottom-mount refrigerator) aesthetic considerations matter. For a modern clean look stainless steel is a great choice. Colored glass with a high-gloss finish can be a fun element but may show fingerprints more easily.

Energy Star Rating: We also recommend looking for bottom-freezer refrigerators with an Energy Star rating. This will not only help you save on your electricity bill but is also a win for your environmental footprint.

Thankfully we did the careful perusing for you ‚Äî poring over countless refrigerator reviews and searching the internet for the best bottom fridges available ‚Äî so you can just think about what you prioritize: a slim footprint ice maker or multiple freezer drawers. Our favorite bottom-freezer refrigerators are all best-in-class picks and available for online purchase so you can rest assured your frozen goods are in well good hands. Happy shopping!

Authorities found multiple firearms body armor and ammunition inside the couple's home while executing a search warrant on Thursday.

Detectives immediately alerted the Donley County Sheriff's Office in Texas and Texas Department of Public Safety about the couple.

When deputies in Donley County tried to pull over the semi-truck the couple continued to drive for several miles before coming to a stop officials said.

Edward and Elizabeth then exited the vehicle and opened fire on deputies and troopers the sheriff's office said. The Stevensons were killed in the ensuing shootout.

Authorities found drugs inside the couple's residence and the semi-truck they were driving through Texas the sheriff's office said.

Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris blamed open border policies that are making it ""much easier for Mexican cartel members and their associates"" to traffic illegal drugs into smaller communities.

Farris said the cocaine seized from the Stevensons would likely have been mixed with fentanyl before being sold to individuals.

The sheriff thanked community members for calling in anonymous tips about the couple.

(0:55)

Open Extended Reactions

The Detroit Lions are signing quarterback Jared Goff to a four-year $212 million contract extension that includes $170 million guaranteed sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.

The deal makes the 2016 No. 1 pick the highest-paid player in franchise history.

The $53 million average annual salary in Goff's new deal makes him the second-highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind only the Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow ($55 million).

Jared Goff past two seasons Over the past two seasons Jared Goff ranks top four in the NFL in passing yards passing touchdowns TD-to-interception ratio and first-down rate. NFL RANK Pass yards 9013 2nd Pass TD 59 T-3rd TD/INT 3.1 2nd 1st-down pct. 38% 4th -- ESPN Stats & Information

Detroit has now rewarded three of its star players this offseason with over $444 million in contract extensions to Goff wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell.

St. Brown received a four-year $120.01 million deal and Sewell signed for $112 million over four years. With those massive deals in place the Lions are aware that the standards in Detroit have been raised.

""We've got a lot of work to do"" Goff told ESPN in April. ""The expectations are high but internally our standards are raising and our expectations are raising and we've got goals and things we want to do. It's not like we're going to show up and start winning again.""

Goff 29 has flourished in three seasons with the Lions since he was acquired in a trade that sent quarterback Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams.

Last season he threw for 4575 yards with 30 touchdowns and 12 interceptions as he led the Lions to two playoff victories in a single postseason for the first time since 1957 and Detroit collected its first division title in more than three decades. The Lions reached the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991.

Over the past two seasons Goff has helped the Lions win 21 games a franchise record for most victories in any two-season span. Their 12 wins in 2023 also tied for the most wins in a season in franchise history which was set in 1991.

In three seasons in Detroit Goff has passed for 12258 yards and 78 touchdowns with just 27 interceptions.

As Goff was preparing to enter the final year of his current contract he repeatedly expressed his interest in remaining in Detroit and kept a businesslike approach while trusting his agent to reach the deal.

""I've been doing it for nine years now and I'm kind of used to it. I obviously appreciate my teammates' support but it's been easy"" Goff told ESPN in April.

This is after Disney‚Äôs overperformance with 20th Century Studios‚Äô Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes which posted a $58.4M opening.

IF‚Äòs m.o. is to be a five-quad movie appealing to everyone from 2 to 80. It‚Äôs been awhile since the marketplace has had a PG-rated live-action original movie hence if the studio hits $40M on this $110M production celebrate it.

Paramount has IF booked in 4000-plus theaters boosted by premium large format screens. Scripted by Krasinski the pic is about a girl who discovers that she can see everyone‚Äôs imaginary friends ‚Äî and what she does with that superpower ‚Äî as she embarks on a magical adventure to reconnect forgotten IFs with their kids.

Previews start at 5 p.m. Thursday. The movie already has collected around $4M to date from its release last weekend in France and Belgium. IF hits 56 markets this week including Australia Brazil Germany Italy Korea Mexico Spain Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

In regards to access to a summer audience the marketplace has 3% K-12 schools off and 75% colleges on break.

‚ÄòKingdom of the Planet of the Apes‚Äô 20th Century Studios

Meanwhile Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes after a $4.4M Monday and a running total of $62.8M looks to decline by 55%-60% for a $23M-$26M second weekend. The Wes Ball-directed sequel will keep its 400 Imax screens this weekend.

But there‚Äôs more depth to the weekend and hopefully it‚Äôs a case of all boats rising.

Lionsgate has the R-rated horror reboot The Strangers ‚Äì Chapter 1 which is in play at 2800 locations. Tracking has the $8.5M feature production at $7M-$9M. Previews start at 5 p.m. Thursday. The Renny Harlin-directed movie follows a young couple (Madelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez) after their car breaks down in a spooky town. They‚Äôre forced to spend the night in a remote cabin and panic ensues as they are terrorized by three masked strangers who strike with no mercy and seemingly no motive. The Strangers franchise through two movies counts some $113.4M. The first movie was released in 2008 and starred Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman and was written and directed by Bryan Bertino.

No Rotten Tomatoes reviews for Strangers-Chapter 1 or IF yet.

Sale,"Francis Bacon's Portrait of George Dyer Crouching (1966) was expected to be the night's top lot. It sold for just $27.7 million failing even to reach its low estimate.

Sotheby‚Äôs kicked off this month‚Äôs marquee New York auctions with two sales on Monday evening one devoted to established contemporary artists the other to emerging ones. Together the two auctions brought in $267.3 million for a total squarely within its presale estimate of $241.8 million to $350.4 million.

These were the first two big auctions to take place during the annual May New York sales with others to follow at Christie‚Äôs and Phillips. All these sales are happening against the backdrop of concerns of a weakening market and fewer estates coming to the block than in previous years. Based simply on estimates alone the sales at Christie‚Äôs Sotheby‚Äôs and Phillips are down by around 18 percent compared to those held at this time in 2023.

Going into the sale Sotheby‚Äôs at least had a leg up on Christie‚Äôs whose website was still down on Monday reportedly following a cyberattack. But the action at Sotheby‚Äôs this evening was relatively sluggish doing little to dispel fears of a market slowdown.

Monday evening‚Äôs most expensive lot was Francis Bacon‚Äôs 1966 painting Portrait of George Dyer Crouching the first of 10 full-scale portraits by Bacon depicting his lover George Dyer. The work on offer had been in the same collection for 54 years having sold to its consignor in 1970 just four years after Bacon finished it. It came to auction with a $50 million high estimate a number that seemed poised to put the painting among the most expensive ones by Bacon ever sold publicly.

Unfortunately for Sotheby‚Äôs it was a big flop failing even to meet its low estimate; it ended up selling for $27.7 million. (All figures reported here include premium unless noted otherwise.) Murmurs abounded; many seemed awed by this hyped work‚Äôs implosion on the block.

Highs and Lows in ‚ÄúNow‚Äù Sale

The evening started out with more modest sums in the Sotheby‚Äôs 18-lot ‚ÄúThe Now‚Äù sale devoted to the ultra-contemporary category referring to emerging artists and ones just gaining momentum at auction.

Eighteen lots were due to be offered but one a Cecily Brown painting was withdrawn before the sale‚Äôs start. Sixteen of the lots sold most of them performing respectably and about half selling above their estimates with premium.

Kerry James Marshall‚Äôs 2005 painting Vignette #6 achieved the top price in the sale in its first time at auction. The consignor had acquired the piece at Jack Shainman Gallery in 2005.

Expectations for this painting ran high since another from Marshall‚Äôs ‚ÄúVignette‚Äù series had sold in 2019 for $18.5 million at Sotheby‚Äôs to become his second-most-expensive painting at auction. This painting which came to auction with a guarantee didn‚Äôt perform quite so well hammering at $6.5 million $500000 below its $7 million low estimate. With premium however that sum rose to $7.48 million.

The other major disappointment was Jeffrey Gibson‚Äôs evening sale debut which came following the inauguration of the artist‚Äôs US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale last month. That should‚Äôve provided ballast for his market‚ÄîSimone Leigh‚Äôs 2022 pavilion certainly did for hers that year‚Äîbut when Gibson‚Äôs 2014 sculpture Always After Now came up for sale at Sotheby‚Äôs it failed to garner a single bid. It was the only work that went unsold in tonight‚Äôs ‚ÄúNow‚Äù sale.

The big story of the evening was a 2019 Justin Caguiat painting called The saint is never busy. This young New York‚Äìbased painter‚Äôs abstractions had only ever appeared at auction twice in the past and Sotheby‚Äôs clearly thought this one would do well awarding it the primo Lot 1 slot. The house‚Äôs expectations were not wrong: a six-minute bidding war pushed the painting far beyond its $300000 estimate more than tripling that sum to sell for $1.09 million a new record for Caguiat.

The other big record in this sale was that for Lucy Bull whose abstractions have already done well at auction. Her 2020 painting 16:10 quickly zoomed past its $700000 high estimate‚Äîwhich was admittedly a conservative number given that her work had already sold for $1.76 at Sotheby‚Äôs Hong Kong this past October. It seemed at times as though auctioneer Phyllis Kao could barely keep up. ‚ÄúEverybody gets a turn‚Äù she said smiling as the painting surpassed the $1 million mark. It sold for $1.81 million more than doubling its estimate to set a new benchmark for the 34-year-old artist.

A Low-Risk Contemporary Sale Sees Many Disappointments

Even though the ‚ÄúNow‚Äù sale generated some momentum the contemporary sale couldn‚Äôt quite sustain the excitement of the evening‚Äôs first hour.

Even discounting the underwhelming Bacon sale other star lots also failed to deliver. A Richard Diebenkorn abstraction from his ‚ÄúOcean Park‚Äù series initially pegged to sell for as much as $25 million failed to find a buyer altogether. The consignor according to Artnet News was Lorenzo Fertitta who bought it at Christie‚Äôs New York in 2018 for $23.9 million at the time an auction record for the artist. On Monday auctioneer Oliver Barker had to fish for bids even to bring it above its $14.8 million low estimate.

A 1964 Lucio Fontana ‚ÄúConcetto Spaziale‚Äù painting from the Rachofsky Collection threatened to topple the artist‚Äôs record altogether; with a $30 million high estimate it didn‚Äôt even hammer at its $20 million low (though it met that sum with premium). The hammer price $19.7 million rose to just under $23 million‚Äîa respectable figure since it still makes the painting one of Fontana‚Äôs most expensive works but one lower than the house had hoped for.

A shaped canvas by Frank Stella Ifafa I (1964) appeared on the block shortly after another big Stella sale. This past November a Stella from the collection of the late Chara Schreyer Honduras Lottery Co. (1962) sold for $18.7 million‚Äîat the time Stella‚Äôs second-highest price at auction. Artnet News‚Äôs Katya Kazakina reported that Ifafa I came to the block from none other than dealer Irving Blum whose Ferus Gallery showed Stella during the ‚Äô60s just as he had achieved renown. The painting hit the block with a $14 million low estimate and hammered right at that amount. Not even the artist‚Äôs death earlier this month did much to raise interest.

This was a low-risk sale with 25 of the 35 lots coming to auction with guarantees meaning that many of the works had been presold. But even by that measure this sale left something to be desired.

There were some successes. A collaborative 1984 painting by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat set a new record for the duo‚Äôs series $19.4 million squarely within the work‚Äôs $15 million‚Äì$20 million estimate. On the Nota Bene podcast earlier this week art adviser Lock Kresler a director at Helly Nahmad gallery in London said this one is considered to be among the best in the series; the highest price paid for a painting in the series at auction is $11.4 million achieved in 2014. The consignor bought this one at Sotheby‚Äôs in 2010 for just $2.7 million.

Four guaranteed Joan Mitchell paintings headed to auction at Sotheby‚Äôs on Monday with three of them selling above estimate. The priciest of them her abstraction Noon (ca. 1969) sold for $22.6 million. The consignor bought the painting just eight years ago at Christie‚Äôs for less than half that.

Faith Ringgold who died this past April saw a new record when Dinner at Gertrude Stein‚Äôs: The French Collection Part II #10 (1991) a quilted painting from the artist‚Äôs prized ‚ÄúFrench Collection‚Äù series came up for sale as the auction‚Äôs first lot. It came from the collection of Stanley and Mikki Weithorn who lent it to a recent Ringgold retrospective. The painting was given a $700000‚Äì$1 million estimate‚Äîdouble the artist‚Äôs $461000 auction record set at Swann Auction Galleries in 2015. Clearly Sotheby‚Äôs expected Dinner at Gertrude Stein‚Äôs to reset the artist‚Äôs record and it did selling for $1.57 million.

The flurry of bids for Ringgold‚Äôs painting made this work a rarity in this sale where the buying activity seemed depressed. By the time an Alice Neel portrait of poet and photographer Gerard Malanga came up for sale Barker was doing his best to stoke any energy at all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like extracting teeth my goodness‚Äù he said before the work sold for a within-estimate $2.24 million. That remark might have been said at many different points tonight.

Still the evening ended on a positive note when Yayoi Kusama‚Äôs 1958 painting The Pacific Ocean sold for $4.66 million triple its high estimate. The work came to sale after its owner curator Alice Denney died last year at 101; seven minutes of bidding preceded that sale. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to forever put Kusama for the last lot!‚Äù Barker yelped. By that point however a good number of attendees had left for the evening missing this rare moment of excitement.

After three hours anyone who stayed until the end of the sale was probably hungry. But instead of the usual assortment of cheese crackers and charcuterie offered to guests there were only empty champagne glasses.

When ARTnews asked a Sotheby‚Äôs staffer about the change they simply replied ‚Äúthe market has changed.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9mb3J0LXdvcnRocy10YWxsZXN0LWJ1aWxkaW5nLXNlbGxzLWp1c3QtMTItM20tYXVjdGlvbi1zdHVubmluZy1wcmljZS1kcm9w0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2ZvcnQtd29ydGhzLXRhbGxlc3QtYnVpbGRpbmctc2VsbHMtanVzdC0xMi0zbS1hdWN0aW9uLXN0dW5uaW5nLXByaWNlLWRyb3AuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Worth's tallest building sells for just $12.3M at auction in stunning price drop,"Bargain buy?

The collaboration was made official with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 2nd September 2022 at The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta Pacific Place represented by Vice President of Marriott International Indonesia Ramesh Jackson and Director of Finance of Solar Chapter Edbert Mulia. This charitable initiative reflects Marriott‚Äôs commitment to creating a positive and sustainable impact across its global operations.

Residents of Tafuli live far from clean water forcing them to hike two to three hours a day carrying 20 litres of jerry cans over three to five kilometres of extreme terrain just to obtain water. This issue triggers other problems such as malnutrition poverty and lack of education among young children.

‚ÄúWe are very honoured and excited for this upcoming collaboration with Marriott. To improve quality of life in aspects that are often neglected by the public with sustainable methods has always been our mission as walking hours for water should not be passed down from generation to generation‚Äù expressed Mulia.

‚ÄúSolar Chapter strives to break this cycle by providing basic needs such as water education and community development. Marriott‚Äôs ‚ÄòRoad To Give‚Äô event is an amazing platform to raise awareness on how much we take necessities such as water for granted and witness how it can significantly improve the lives of some rural villagers in Indonesia.‚Äù

Among the activities devised to contribute to this fundraiser is the annual charity run Road to Give 2022 which will be held on 23rd October 2022 in Jakarta. This collaborative effort by Marriott Business Council Indonesia and Solar Chapter will see participation by the associates and guests of Marriott‚Äôs portfolio of hotels and resorts. Proceeds of the charity run will go towards building water stops and improving access to clean water in Tafuli.

The Marriott Business Council Indonesia comprises key hotel General Managers across Indonesia who advocate for the hospitality industry and hotel-specific issues preserve the company culture and serve the local community. Together leaders within the Council have adopted Marriott‚Äôs culture of ‚Äúputting people first‚Äù as the foundation for everything they do. Putting people first is at the heart of Marriott International‚Äôs company culture and foundation.

Marriott Bonvoy Marriott International‚Äôs portfolio of 19 extraordinary hotel brands across Indonesia and highly awarded travel program has been going above and beyond to demonstrate the extraordinary collective power of people to help others. Marriott‚Äôs portfolio of hotels and resorts in Indonesia along with the associates move in different ways to contribute to this fundraising event.

‚ÄúAs we continue to thrive in this brave new world we pause every now and again to remember our purpose and humanity. With a diverse and sizeable portfolio we carry a global responsibility and a unique opportunity to be a force for good‚Äù said Jackson.

The general public can also join the run and support the cause. This event has a registration fee of Rp200000 and as part of the registration participants will receive an e-Certificate. Open donations are also available through bank transfer to 1030010208888 (Bank Mandiri/MENTENG HERITAGE REALTY).

Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in Russia following the Ukraine offensive meaning foreign-issued cards no longer worked there and cards issued in Russia no longer worked abroad.

Bank transfers between Europe and Russia have become difficult too.

Russia began developing its own domestic payments system in 2015 following a first round of Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea the previous year.

It resulted in the creation of a card payment system called Mir or World but it fact the cards are not accepted around the world.

Russian authorities would like the cards to be accepted abroad which would ease the financial difficulties Russians now face while traveling.

""We are working with many regulators from many countries to extend the use of Mir bank cards but we are running into difficulties"" Russian Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said Friday.

She added that foreign banks were reluctant to join the Mir system as they are ""trying to minimize the risk of (potential) sanctions against them.""

More than 100 million Mir cards have been issued over the past seven years meaning over half of the Russian population has one according to figures from the card's issuing company.

Some of the population does not have a choice: public sector employees and pensioners need a Mir card to receive state funds and benefits.

The Mir payment system is currently only available in a handful of countries including Belarus and Kazakhstan.

Several Russian banks said they are working on issuing cards with China's Union Pay as a substitute.

Russia has been reducing its dependency on the dollar and the U.S.-dominated global financial system after being hit by unprecedented sanctions since it launched the Ukraine offensive in February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZXRhaWwvc2VuYXRlLXJlcHVibGljYW5zLWRlbWFuZC1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZC1jb21wYW5pZXMtcmV2ZXJzZS1kZWNpc2lvbi10cmFjay1ndW4tc3RvcmUtc2FsZXPSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vcmV0YWlsL3NlbmF0ZS1yZXB1YmxpY2Fucy1kZW1hbmQtY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtY29tcGFuaWVzLXJldmVyc2UtZGVjaXNpb24tdHJhY2stZ3VuLXN0b3JlLXNhbGVzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senate Republicans demand credit card companies reverse decision to track gun store sales,"Senate Republicans are urging major credit card companies to reverse the decision to categorize gun shop purchases separately.

Sen. Roger Marshall Kansas is leading a group of 12 GOP senators in demanding that the CEOs of Visa Mastercard and American Express scrap plans to track gun store sales. The companies recently announced they would apply the International Organization for Standardization‚Äôs new merchant category code to gun shop sales. Transactions at firearm stores were previously labeled as ""general merchandise.""

In a letter obtained exclusively by FOX Business the Republican lawmakers argue that compliance with the merchant code could open a backdoor gun control registry impacting law-abiding firearm owners.

""This decision which is already being hailed by radical anti-gun activists is the first step towards backdoor gun control on law abiding Americans"" the senators wrote to the CEOs. ""Any change that seeks to impact a United States citizen's ability to legally purchase a firearm belongs with Congress not payment networks international standard setting organizations or the financial institutions that some of you serve.""

VISA MASTERCARD AMEX TO CATEGORIZE GUN STORE SALES SEPARATELY

Merchant category codes are not exclusive to gun store sales as the codes exist for nearly every type of purchase including those at supermarkets clothing stores coffee shops and other retailers .

But the codes only label the type of merchant where the credit or debit card is used not the specific items. This means an item like a gun safe for example could be flagged as a large purchase at a gun store since one can be purchased for thousands of dollars.

""Due to the nature of the information collected from merchants when processing a transaction you will have no ability to know what is being purchased; as such the purported benefits for detecting suspicious purchases falls flat on face value"" the Republicans wrote. ""Given that it is clear that these changes are being pushed for much more nefarious reasons and is likely only step one with calls for declining to process gun sales altogether coming in the near future.""

According to the letter the ISO is a voluntary organization that cannot unilaterally prescribe the way in which business is carried out.

""To be perfectly clear your hand is not being forced"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Creating a new merchant code for gun transactions is a choice being made by each of your companies. You are choosing the side of gun control advocates over the privacy and Second Amendment rights of millions of law abiding Americans.""

""You are choosing to insert yourselves into this political debate ‚Äì which should only be fought at the ballot box and in Congress ‚Äì and in doing so you are making clear that you are more than unbiased network operators seeking to maximize value for your customers and shareholders. You have become antigun activists yourselves wittingly or not"" they continued.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS AS CREDIT CARD COMPANIES PRESSURED TO TRACK GUN PURCHASES

The Republicans told the CEOs that Congress will have no choice but to intercede on behalf of law-abiding American gun owners if their companies insist on tracking gun shop sales.

The senators also demanded answers from the credit card companies on a number of issues surrounding the new labeling of gun store purchases including their understanding of the ISO process what input they gave the ISO coordination with outside entities such as activist organizations or politicians how the information will be used to curb suspicious firearm sales and how the financial privacy of law-abiding customers will be ensured.

Gun control activists have argued that a separate category for sales at gun shops will help track suspicious quantities of firearm sales that could potentially lead to a mass shooting. A week before the 2016 Pulse Nightclub mass shooting in Orlando Florida the gunman purchased more than $26000 worth of guns and ammunition using credit cards.

New York City officials had put pressure on the ISO and banks to adopt the new code on gun shop sales.

""These credit card companies must now take the next step and flag suspicious transactions on gun and ammunition sales like they do for fraud and money laundering"" New York State Attorney General Letitia James said in a recent tweet. ""By working together and using the tools at our disposal we will help protect our communities and save lives.""

The senators' letter comes just days after House Republicans sent the credit card companies a similar request for answers on tracking gun store sales.

""A gun control advocate could view any desire to own or obtain a firearm as per se suspicious"" the House members wrote at the time. ""Instead this is a transparent attempt to chill the exercise of constitutionally protected rights and to circumvent existing legal restrictions on the creation of firearm registries by the government.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3VuLm15L2hvbWVfbmV3cy9pbXBhY3Qtb2YtZ2lnLWVjb25vbXktQ0g5ODIzMTM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Impact of gig economy,"OVER the past decade gig economy and freelance work have transformed the global employment landscape. The Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated the growth of the gig economy as people who stayed at home to minimise contact opted for online delivery services for their daily needs and consumer necessities.

According to a report by Mastercard global transactions associated with the gig economy will grow by 17% per year to approximately US$455 billion (RM2.05 trillion) by 2023. Due to the rapid growth of the gig economy in recent years the term ‚Äúgig worker‚Äù ‚Äì which is generally associated with blue-collar workers ‚Äì has moved beyond its original definition.

A growing number of white-collar workers today are making the switch away from

nine-to-five office jobs in favour of freelancing. In Malaysia more than 26% of the workforce or about four million freelancers are now part of the gig economy.

It is also worth noting that based on the results of a study in 2020 conducted by Zurich Insurance Group and the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford 38% of Malaysians currently employed full-time are considering joining the gig economy within the next year. It was also found that this percentage was considerably higher than the global average

of 20%.

Growing trend

The employment models available to people in the modern world have become more flexible than before. People no longer need to rely on traditional nine-to-five employment to make ends meet and provide for themselves. Rather than work in a traditional-scheduled work day they are embracing a more creative efficient and flexible work life taking on

short-term assignments as they deem necessary.

The use of e-mail and telecommunication has also enabled work to be more flexible as people are able to work remotely ‚Äútogether‚Äù regardless of where they are geographically located. This has allowed the gig economy to flourish over the past few years.

There is also growing evidence that the gig economy is gradually becoming more attractive to students parents with young children and people who otherwise work as home health aides and those looking for new employment opportunities.

Gig economy on a global scale is also being driven by a generational shift in the workforce that is occurring at this particular point in time. It is estimated that as Baby Boomers and Gen X retire we will see Millennials taking over the workforce and they are known

to value independence and a balanced

work-and-home life considerably more than their predecessors.

To meet their financial obligations this generation has begun to turn to gig work as flexibility and independence play an increasingly prominent role in how they structure their working lives.

The work landscape has also been affected by the emergence of a new phenomenon known as ‚ÄúQuiet Quitting‚Äù. This phenomenon has been generating millions of views on TikTok in recent months as increasingly young professionals reject the idea of advancing in their careers describing their lack of enthusiasm as a form of quitting to avoid burnout in the workplace.

Consequently many of these professionals have turned to working a second job or becoming freelancers to pursue their passions.

Implications of ‚ÄúQuiet Quitting‚Äù phenomenon

Companies should take steps to prevent this kind of disengagement from occurring and speak to all employees on how they are valued and appreciated at work.

There is no doubt the gig economy

provides companies with an unprecedented opportunity to redefine their workforce structure. Taking advantage of it and relying more on a contingent workforce may not be such a bad idea for employers.

Additionally this would allow companies to scale teams as the need evolves especially for jobs that cannot be performed remotely.

The gig economy is expected to provide Malaysia with sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It has been included in the 12th Malaysia Plan for 2021 to 2025 and the government is taking steps to regulate the sector to ensure workers‚Äô welfare.

As part of our mission at FastGig we are dedicated to connecting gig workers and freelancers with forward-looking employers and businesses to facilitate the growth and success of this new segment of the economy.

‚ÄúWe cannot afford to ignore the large positive force which this segment can bring about in the rural landscape in India‚Äù said founder & CEO of LEAF Palat Vijayaraghavan in an interview.

According to him the marginalised farming community constituting about 85% of the agriculture sector can substantially spur the consumption of multiple services in India to help the country to reach its GDP target of $5 trillion.

To achieve this goal LEAF is implementing an aggressive go-to-market strategy through its technology platform LEAF Farmer Network (LFN) powered by Mastercard and has aligned with multiple stakeholders in the agriculture ecosystem.

Mr. Vijayaraghavan said a farmer does multiple transactions right from harvest to realisation of it. There are numerous transactions mostly done through cash and as a result there are no records. The biggest problem for multiple service providers is lack of actual transparent actionable data.

LFN is a differentiated platform floated to solve multiple challenges of farmers in a transparent manner. The entire process is managed by farmers with support from on ground teams from LEAF.

LFN solves that specific issue by harnessing the power of technology to route all transactions through the digital platform. This would help the ecosystem partners to analyse and take crucial business and commercial decisions based on transaction data of farmers on a daily basis.

‚ÄúThe scale with which we are enabling transactions is enormous. The core of LFN is that it enables transparency of all transactions in the entire agriculture lifecycle‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThis initiative will also support the farmers through comprehensive training and capacity building in entire lifecycle of the harvest including post-harvest management to reduce wastage‚Äù he said."

Only when 1991 came around and Dave Stockton the U.S. captain brought a military theme to the Cup that became known as ""The War By the Shore"" had the American fans caught on.

Great Britain have gone out of the 2022 Davis Cup Finals in the group stages ‚Äì finishing third in Group D.

The Brits‚Äô chances of qualification for the Finals came to an end after two close losses to USA and Netherlands in deciding doubles matches. Returning on Sunday and playing for pride the Brits finished their campaign in Glasgow with a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan.

""It‚Äôs been tough ‚Äì I think everyone here would have loved a trip to Malaga in November"" said Britain's captain Leon Smith.

""We‚Äôve had chances in every match and it just felt like it wasn‚Äôt going our way this week but I think it‚Äôs great to finish with a win. I‚Äôm really glad we bought the Davis Cup to Glasgow and I have to say a big thank you to the fans.""

Netherlands and USA both progress as the top two teams in the group and will have the chance to compete for the title later this year at the Finals in Malaga. They will be joined by Italy Croatia Australia Germany Canada and Spain as the best performing teams from the other three groups.

Britain‚Äôs singles stars enjoyed mixed success throughout the week. Cam Norrie kicked off with an impressive comeback win over world No.12 Taylor Fritz but lost out to strong performances from Botic van de Zandschlup and Alexander Bublik.

Dan Evans narrowly lost in three-sets to Tommy Paul in the Brits opener but bounced back with a comfortable 6-4 6-4 victory over Tallon Griekspoor. Andy Murray came in for the third tie against Kazakhstan and clinched his 41st Davis Cup win up against Dmitry Popko.

Murray and world No.1 Joe Salisbury suffered devastating losses in two high-quality deciding rubbers against USA and Netherlands. Rajeev Ram and Jack Sock came from a set down to defeat the Brits 5-7 6-4 7-5 while Wesley Koolhof and Matwe Middelkoop won arguably the match of the group 7-6(0) 6-7(6) 6-3.

However teaming up with Neal Skupski Salisbury made it third time lucky as the Brits secured the Brits their first tie win of the tournament against Bublik and Aleksandr Nedovysev - coming through 7-6(2) 6-7(9) 7-6(4)."

Bob Casey narrowly leads Republican challenger Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania‚Äôs U.S. Senate race with six months until the election a new Inquirer/New York Times/Siena College poll shows.

Casey leads McCormick 46% to 41% among Pennsylvania registered voters just inside the survey‚Äôs margin of error. An additional 13% of voters were undecided. The poll was conducted from April 28 to May 7.

Casey who has represented the state in the Senate since 2007 had a similar lead on McCormick in an April poll from Emerson College.

The race which the nonpartisan Cook Political Report says ‚Äúleans Democratic‚Äù is one of several that could determine which party controls the Senate.

Bob Casey is outperforming Joe Biden

While Casey and McCormick are running closely in the state Casey is also outrunning his party‚Äôs presidential nominee President Joe Biden.

Casey outruns President Joe Biden by 2 percentage points when voters are asked about a two-person race between Biden and former President Donald Trump. When third-party presidential candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included in the mix Casey outruns Biden by a much larger 10 points.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know a lot about Bob Casey but I haven‚Äôt heard anything bad about Bob Casey‚Äù said Charles Kestener 41 a registered independent from Allentown who plans to vote for Casey but not Biden.

Kestener a truck driver criticized Biden‚Äôs handling of the economy and the military withdrawal from Afghanistan. He said he would support Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the presidential race over either major party candidate.

Casey leads McCormick with women and voters who identify as independents as well as young voters and non-white voters two groups that have drifted away from Biden in the state.

‚ÄúPeople know the Casey family‚Äù said Eric Stern former deputy campaign manager for Sen. John Fetterman. ‚ÄúThey know Sen. Casey extremely well and even if their feelings about national Democrats gets colder ‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt necessarily hold the senator responsible for their feelings on the economy or national issues or inflation.‚Äù

Still Stern said he expects the gap to shrink between Casey and Biden two longtime political allies. ‚ÄúThere just aren‚Äôt enough swing voters anymore. Even if Casey runs the best campaign in the world he‚Äôs not gonna outpace Biden by 10 points.‚Äù

Trump outruns McCormick in a head-to-head presidential matchup and pulls in similar support when voters are asked about third-party candidates.

GOP political consultant Vince Galko who worked on both of former Sen. Pat Toomey‚Äôs reelection campaigns said if McCormick can outrun Trump in more suburban areas where he currently trails Casey by a large margin that could pay dividends.

‚ÄúHe can go after independents and swing voters in the suburbs that Trump‚Äôs not gonna get‚Äù Galko said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got his military background and economic message so it doesn‚Äôt even have to be big numbers but a point and a half could be huge in the Philly suburbs.‚Äù

Biden and Trump remain unpopular candidates in the state with 55% of registered voters disapproving of Trump and 57% unhappy with Biden.

Casey is polling favorably with 49% of voters compared to Biden who is favorable among 41% of voters. McCormick and Trump are even on favorability with 41% and 42% of voters considering them favorable candidates.

Mike Mikus a Democratic political consultant who has worked on Senate campaigns in the state said 49% favorability is a good sign for Casey.

‚ÄúThose are really strong numbers in an environment like this for Democrats‚Äù Mikus said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna take a lot of money and effort to try to make Bob Casey an unfavorable figure in Pennsylvania That‚Äôs one of McCormick‚Äôs biggest challenges.‚Äù

McCormick remains relatively unknown by 34% of Pennsylvania voters

More Pennsylvanians view McCormick favorably (42%) than unfavorably (24%) but 34% either had not heard of him or had no opinion of him. That‚Äôs about 14 points higher than the 20% who did not know how they felt about Casey or said they had not heard of him.

It‚Äôs a sign that McCormick is still introducing himself to voters who may not remember him from the bruising 2022 GOP primary two years ago when even Trump was criticizing him.

And while Democrats have for months accused McCormick of being a carpetbagger who primarily lives in Connecticut it‚Äôs not clear by McCormick‚Äôs favorability numbers that those attacks have resonated.

It‚Äôs early in the campaign cycle and both campaigns are eventually expected to pour millions into ads to get their names and messages out in the state.

John Fetterman maintains support

Fetterman a Pennsylvania Democrat is not up for reelection but he‚Äôs frequently in the headlines for his boldly casual political style and staunch support for Israel.

The senator isn‚Äôt afraid to make waves and voters seem split on how they feel about that. Fetterman‚Äôs overall favorability rating was at 48% just 1 percentage point lower than Casey his quieter U.S. Senate counterpart. An additional 41% of registered voters had unfavorable views of Fetterman.

Fetterman a freshman senator is slightly better known than Casey with just 6% of voters saying they haven‚Äôt heard of him.

Stern Fetterman‚Äôs former campaign manager said that‚Äôs no surprise for the heavily covered Democrat:

‚ÄúJohn Fetterman takes out the trash and there‚Äôs three news articles about it.‚Äù

Life for the Coachella Valley Firebirds feels quite familiar these days.

It‚Äôs the middle of May and they‚Äôre still playing hockey in the southern California desert. They just survived a challenge from the stubborn Calgary Wranglers. Their faithful fans are packing Acrisure Arena. And captain Max McCormick is helping to lead the way.

Last year McCormick piled up 27 points including 14 goals in 26 postseason contests as the Firebirds went all the way to Game 7 of the Calder Cup Finals before a heartbreaking overtime loss to Hershey. McCormick a 10th-year pro came back this season ready to make another run at a championship scoring a career-best 32 goals and ranking second on the club with 60 points.

Coming off last year‚Äôs conference championship and after winning the Pacific Division title in 2023-24 postseason expectations were understandably high as the team prepared to face Calgary in the division semifinals.

But the Firebirds might not still be playing if not for McCormick. Down 1-0 in the series and trailing 3-2 late in Game 2 McCormick scored the tying goal with 5:27 left in regulation to force overtime where Devin Shore‚Äôs winning goal gave Coachella Valley a much-needed win. The captain came through again in Game 3 with a pair of third-period goals in a 7-5 win and the Firebirds went on to close out the series in four games.

Head coach Dan Bylsma has leaned heavily on McCormick for leadership through the franchise‚Äôs first two seasons beginning when the team had to spend the first two months of its inaugural season on the road while Acrisure Arena completed construction.

But the relationship between the two formed even before the Firebirds ever took the ice. In 2021-22 the first season for the Seattle Kraken the organization sent its AHL personnel to the Charlotte Checkers in a one-year arrangement with the Florida Panthers. Bylsma was hired to represent the Kraken in the set-up as an assistant coach in Charlotte and McCormick signed as a free agent by the Kraken on Sept. 30 2021 was named an alternate captain for the Checkers.

Bylsma quickly came away a fan of McCormick‚Äôs game.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a true professional in how he works‚Äù Bylsma said. ‚ÄúA true professional in his determination and his tenacity. He‚Äôs a leader for everybody.‚Äù

It‚Äôs easy to point at McCormick‚Äôs offensive output and conclude that puck skills define his game. But it‚Äôs the consistent doggedness that most stands out most for Bylsma. McCormick plays a hard rugged game and he does so consistently. He can play in all situations and is an easy plug-in wherever needed.

This season‚Äôs Firebirds club is structured somewhat differently from the one that took its fans on that wild ride through the Calder Cup Playoffs last year. Loaded with skill last season these Firebirds are a bit grittier a bit more down-and-dirty. Some of that is the personnel; some of that could be the lessons acquired through five rounds of Calder Cup Playoff hockey last year.

They can still score so much so that they led the league with 3.50 goals per game in the regular season. But it‚Äôs a more physical group now.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just found different ways to win all season long‚Äù McCormick said.

McCormick is also proof that development is not merely limited to players in their first or second pro season. Drafted by Ottawa in 2011 he started his pro career in 2014-15 with the Binghamton Senators in a third- or fourth-line role hitting double digits in goals and triple digits in penalty minutes in each of his first three seasons. He developed into a solid two-way player adding power-play and penalty-killing responsibilities.

And regardless of his role McCormick has always been a reliable recall option playing 94 games in the National Hockey League with Ottawa Carolina and Seattle.

It‚Äôs a resume that serves as an example for anyone on the Coachella Valley roster. There‚Äôs a reason that the club made McCormick its first captain last season.

Any AHL club especially a dangerous Calder Cup contender like the Firebirds needs leadership. McCormick provides it.

‚ÄúWearing the ‚ÄòC‚Äô is a big honor‚Äù McCormick said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a role that I don‚Äôt take lightly.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8yMDI0LXN0b2NrLXdhdGNoLW9sLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 Stock Watch - OL Mason McCormick,"Player: OL Mason McCormick

Stock Value: Purchased

Reasoning: The Steelers used their fourth-round draft pick to take a third offensive lineman in Mason McCormick. One could argue the sheer volume indicates how highly they value McCormick relative to other positions of need. They passed on some defensive backs to draft a player who has virtually no shot of playing this year. But perhaps they see him as a potential future starter for the long haul.

Odds are Mason McCormick begins his career as a backup. But he‚Äôll have ample opportunity to dictate or at least influence how things progress from there. The Steelers already tipped their hand in how they drafted him and what they said about him: they‚Äôre big fans.

You have to be a big fan of an offensive lineman to draft him in the fourth round after already drafting linemen in the first two rounds. After all the Steelers never did anything like that before in their history. But they seem to believe Mason McCormick could be a starter sooner or later. Perhaps sooner rather than later. General manager Omar Khan seemed to go out of his way to highlight next offseason. Both starting James Daniels and reserve Nate Herbig are pending unrestricted free agents. Could McCormick step into the starting lineup for Daniels by then? They seem open to it.

After all it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have plenty of tape. He played something like 3400 snaps in college if my memory is correct. He‚Äôs older he‚Äôs mature he‚Äôs humble he‚Äôs loyal he‚Äôs dedicated. He‚Äôs the kind of offensive lineman that you want to have on your team. That‚Äôs why they drafted him even though the line room seemed pretty full already.

At the other guard spot is Isaac Seumalo who is on the wrong side of 30. Even if they were to end up re-signing Daniels Seumalo isn‚Äôt going to play forever either. But McCormick first has to prove himself on the field before any of this conversation matters. Yeah they liked him but now he has to justify it.

Still Mason McCormick seems like an easy player to root for. And in terms of immediacy he could at least challenge for the top interior reserve role. He played guard generally but is center-capable so he could theoretically make Herbig expendable.

As the season progresses Steelers players‚Äô stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications particularly when players lose their jobs or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions whether minor or major.

A bad game a new contract an injury a promotion‚Äîany number of things affect a player‚Äôs value. Think of it as a stock on the market based on speculation. You‚Äôll feel better about a player after a good game or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor while others are likely to be quite drastic so bear in mind the degree. I‚Äôll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vZmFudGFzeS9iYXNlYmFsbC9uZXdzL2FzdHJvcy1jaGFzLW1jY29ybWljay1wbGF5aW5nLW91dGZpZWxkLWluLXJlaGFiLWdhbWVzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vZmFudGFzeS9iYXNlYmFsbC9uZXdzL2FzdHJvcy1jaGFzLW1jY29ybWljay1wbGF5aW5nLW91dGZpZWxkLWluLXJlaGFiLWdhbWVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astros' Chas McCormick: Playing outfield in rehab games,"McCormick (hamstring) is scheduled to play in the outfield for the next two games with Double-A Corpus Christi MLB.com reports.

Several months ago Carol Largent contacted me with an idea for an Ervin family reunion event at the historic Charles McDowell Jr. house on St. Mary‚Äôs Church Road. The reunion was for a large African American family with deep Burke County roots the descendants of Annie McDowell Ervin. The Ervins have long questioned and hoped to explore possible connections between their matriarch and the Scots-Irish settlers who established the plantation at Quaker Meadows.

Having been on the HBF board for several years I knew of the organization‚Äôs ongoing interest in expanding the known history of the McDowell House. Feeling sure they would be excited by the possibility of hosting the Ervin reunion event I connected Carol with Linda Lindsey HBF board president and secretary Beth Spahn.

After confirming a date with Linda and Beth Carol told me ‚ÄúThey are so excited about us coming they‚Äôve got me excited!‚Äù

With several weeks of planning and coordination around 60 Ervin family descendants convened on Saturday Aug. 13 at the McDowell House where they were met by six enthusiastic HBF hosts.

During the morning the Ervins and HBF hosts shared fellowship and information that expanded what they both understood about local history. Historic Burke volunteers provided tours of the house and grounds and shared stories about the Charles McDowell family. Ervin descendants provided information about the kinship between their matriarch and the McDowell County McDowells who lived at the historic Carson House in Marion and were cousins of the Burke County McDowells.

A couple of hours after the event my cellphone erupted with texts about the day.

‚ÄúWe had a blast at the McDowell House this morning‚Äù Carol said. ‚ÄúIt was educational and enlightening from both sides!‚Äù

Linda described the day as ‚Äúvery exciting and moving.‚Äù

I met with Carol and her cousins Bev Feimster and Beth Davidson at Carol‚Äôs home one Saturday morning to hear more. Three hours one crash course in Ervin family genealogy and lots of snacks and laughter later I decided to follow up with some additional research to see if I could grasp the complex McDowell lineage.

Much sleuthing remains to be done but the Ervins have determined that Annie McDowell Ervin was born in 1881. She was the daughter of William Burton ‚ÄúBill‚Äù McDowell of McDowell County a white man who was a cousin of Quaker Meadow‚Äôs Charles McDowell. Annie‚Äôs mother was a Black woman named Caroline McDowell Fleming.

Even though slavery had ended by the time of Annie‚Äôs birth North Carolina still had anti-miscegenation laws that prohibited marriage between people of different races. Individuals could only marry within their own race and Bill and Caroline later married other people.

Three years after Annie‚Äôs birth Bill married his first wife and fathered three children. His wife died and he married again fathering his youngest child Cornelia McDowell Berry in 1889. Bev remembers ‚ÄúMrs. Berry‚Äù from Hillcrest Elementary School in the 1960s.

‚ÄúI remember her being our substitute teacher‚Äù Bev said ‚Äúand she would always ask about Grandmaw Annie and I never understood why.‚Äù

Sometimes serendipity steps in and lends history hunters a helping hand.

In 1982 Bev took a part-time job at Foothills Nursing Home in Morganton. Whenever she came to work an elderly white woman who was a resident waved to her. The lady Mrs. Eloise Alexander asked for Bev to come see her regularly and they became friends.

As they learned more about each other Bev and Eloise uncovered a close connection. Eloise was Annie‚Äôs first cousin. Realizing that Bev was Annie‚Äôs granddaughter Eloise explained that her father was Frank Craige McDowell Bill McDowell‚Äôs brother. She also told Bev that Annie‚Äôs name and birth were recorded in their family Bible.

While Annie was acknowledged as Bill‚Äôs oldest daughter by her McDowell relatives she never explained the family connection to her descendants. Interracial relationships were not only frowned upon but were prohibited by law in many states until the late 1960s so people tended not to talk about them.

‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs a lot of controversy about the way things were and some people say ‚ÄòWell I don‚Äôt want to talk about it‚Äô but it‚Äôs still history‚Äù Bev said.

While the Historic Charles McDowell Jr. House wasn‚Äôt Bill McDowell‚Äôs family home the Burke and McDowell branches are related through a common ancestor who is yet to be conclusively identified.

Carol said the Ervins enjoyed visiting the McDowell House and learning about Quaker Meadows. They were especially pleased with the engagement and interest of their young descendants.

Historic Burke Foundation was equally pleased with the day.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll follow up with the family because there is much more that can be done‚Äù Lindsey said.

Beth Spahn said the Ervin reunion was one of the most exciting days she has ever spent at the McDowell House adding ‚ÄúI so want to be a part of that family!‚Äù

The study is the first to compare microCT and histology findings of valve leaflet thickening the results of which may provide clinical insights for long-term durability of transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs) and treatment of HALT. The findings were presented as Late-Breaking Clinical Science in Structural Heart Disease at the 34th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) conference the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation.

HALT is observed on CT imaging and indicates possible formation of a blood clot on prosthetic heart valve leaflets potentially affecting their ability to open and close freely. HALT may occur in at least10% of TAVR patients and can impact valve deterioration.1 While HALT can typically be treated with oral anticoagulants (OAC) it is sometimes resistant to drug therapy. 23

The study evaluated the extent of pathologic changes of valve thrombosis neointimal thickening inflammation and calcification over time in 110 TAVs explanted at surgery or autopsy. The explanted valves were collected from 11 clinical studies that included more than 7500 participants. Additionally the study also evaluated areas of leaflet thickening by two methodologies microCT and histology to assess the prevalence length and underlying cellular composition of these areas.

Although clinical thrombosis rates are extremely low in CoreValve/Evolut clinical trials of self-expanding TAVs (0%‚Äì1.3%) the study found that approximately 45% of leaflets in explanted valves showed at least some degree of leaflet thickening; the prevalence was comparable with microCT and histology assessment. Histological scores by implant duration showed there was no change in thrombus and inflammation scores over time however neointima structural changes and calcification scores increased with greater implant duration. Thrombi begin organizing after 30 days and by one year had a more organized morphology that may be resistant to treatment.

‚ÄúAs TAVR continues to grow as a treatment option for aortic stenosis identifying pathological changes to TAVs over time is critical for understanding their long-term durability‚Äù said Nina Goodheart Senior Vice President and President of the Structural Heart & Aortic business which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs results offer additional clinical evidence for our CoreValve Evolut Program to better understand the importance of early treatment when HALT is detected.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese findings help to address the need to better understand HALT development and treatment particularly in cases where OAC therapy fails. Further we believe these findings underscore the need for early detection and treatment within the first year after implantation. This may help to optimize outcomes for patients receiving transcatheter aortic valves.‚Äù said Yu Sato MD CVPath Institute study lead.

The Medtronic CoreValve Evolut R CoreValve Evolut PRO and Evolut PRO+ systems are indicated for relief of aortic stenosis in patients with symptomatic heart disease due to severe native calcific aortic stenosis who are judged by a heart team including a cardiac surgeon to be appropriate for the transcatheter heart valve replacement therapy.

Data from a pre-planned analysis of the study called KeyVibe-010 showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria. A higher rate of patients discontinued all adjuvant therapy in the coformulation arm versus the Keytruda-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences. Due to this it seemed unlikely that the study could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.

Accordingly an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended unblinding the study and guided Merck to offer patients receiving the Keytruda+vibostolimab coformulation to be treated with Keytruda monotherapy. Merck continues to analyze data from the study and will share the data with the scientific community and regulatory agencies at a later date.

At present Keytruda is approved for two indications in melanoma. Phase III studies are ongoing evaluating Keytruda+vibostolimab coformulation in lung cancer.

Merck‚Äôs stock has risen 18.6% so far this year compared with an increase of 13.4% for the industry.

This is the second Keytruda study to have failed in less than two weeks.

Last week a phase III first-line endometrial cancer study on Keytruda failed to meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) at an interim analysis conducted by an independent DMC. The study called KEYNOTE-B21 evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment with or without radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery with curative intent. As the study failed to reach superiority for the DFS endpoint its other primary endpoint of overall survival was not formally tested.

Keytruda approved for several types of cancer alone accounts for around 45% of Merck‚Äôs total pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications and rapid uptake across earlier-stage launches. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications including in earlier lines of therapy can further boost sales.

The Keytruda development program is also progressing well. The drug is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer including both monotherapy and combination studies. Merck is also working on different strategies to drive the long-term growth of Keytruda. These include innovative immuno-oncology combinations including Keytruda with TIGIT LAG3 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. In partnership with Moderna MRNA Merck is developing a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine (V940/mRNA-4157) in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. Moderna and Merck initiated a pivotal phase III study in adjuvant melanoma in July 2023 while a phase III study in earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) began in December 2023.

Story continues

With Merck‚Äôs growth largely depending on Keytruda the recent pipeline setbacks do not bode well for the company.

Following a high rate of adverse experience-related dropouts Merck called it quits Monday on a Phase III trial of its anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in skin cancer.

The late-stage study was evaluating vibostolimab as an adjuvant treatment to Keytruda in patients with resected high-risk melanoma. The investigational anti-TIGIT antibody works by restoring antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands to help T lymphocytes destroy tumor cells.

A pre-planned analysis revealed the high rate of dropouts primarily due to immune-mediated adverse events making it ‚Äúhighly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement‚Äù in recurrence-free survival.

Based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee Merck said it is unblinding the study to offer Keytruda alone to patients who had been receiving the combination treatment and sharing the results with the scientific community and regulatory agencies.

Keytruda is currently approved in two skin cancer indications for patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma and as an adjuvant for certain stages following surgery. Merck continues efforts to move its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy up to an earlier line of treatment. The company is pursuing an ongoing Phase III study combining Keytruda with Moderna‚Äôs individualized neoantigen therapy V940 in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

‚ÄúWe continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of Keytruda with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer‚Äù Marjorie Green head of oncology for Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

The Keytruda-vibostolimab coformulation is in ongoing Phase III trials for lung cancer. Merck pointed out in Monday‚Äôs announcement that interim safety reviews have not resulted in any study modifications in these studies.

In December 2023 the company announced the combination treatment failed to meet endpoints in a Phase II study of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Monday Merck & Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) announced the discontinuation of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation arm of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial.

The trial evaluates the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) compared to Keytruda alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV).

Data from a pre-planned analysis showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria.

A higher discontinuation rate of all adjuvant therapy by patients was observed in the coformulation arm versus the Keytruda-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences. Thus it is highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.

Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with Keytruda monotherapy.

Data analysis from this study is ongoing.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008.

Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in safety-related study modifications.

Last week Merck‚Äôs Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B21 trial of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment with or without radiotherapy did not meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) for newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients after surgery with curative intent.

The study‚Äôs other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since DFS did not reach superiority.

First the rapidly growing industry was largely impervious to the business cycle. Second it was dominated by the duopoly of Google (in search ads) and Meta (in social media) which one jealous rival has compared to John Rockefeller‚Äôs hold on oil in the late 19th century.

Both of these verities are now being challenged simultaneously. As China‚Äôs economy slows and the West‚Äôs slides towards a recession companies everywhere are squeezing their marketing budgets. Until recently that would have meant cutting non-digital ads but maintaining or even raising online spending. With most ad dollars now going online that strategy is running out of road.

Despite the differences in each VR headset they actually have a lot in common right down to similar price points. (Though Meta recently hiked theirs up .)

To determine the best VR headset in this goggle-to-goggle eyeball-to-eyeball face-off we put these top-tier competitors through the ringer Matrix-style. Read on to see which VR platform gives you the most bang for your virtual buck ‚Äî and why.

Round 1: Game / App library

Whether you‚Äôre considering one of the best VR headsets for work or (more likely) play the app store is always a good place to start your research. After all even the beefiest of specs on the best gaming laptops and best VR-ready laptops won‚Äôt do much good if the apps and games you desire reside on another platform.

Sorry Meta users this particular apocalypse ain‚Äôt for you. (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

As of this writing there were roughly 5700 VR-only apps and games available on Steam and only 1345 in the Oculus Store. Whereas I could frolic amid famously familiar franchises like Fallout VR and Skyrim VR with the Reverb G2 once I began downloading those massive installation files I could see where the hefty minimum requirements come into play; Fallout VR alone took up roughly 25GB of storage on my laptop which always ran hot as‚Ä¶well nuclear fallout during gameplay. (In contrast the app for Song in the Smoke ‚Äî a deceivingly simple caveman simulation game ‚Äî is only 2GB if you download it directly to the Quest 2 and 8.1GB if you download it separately to your laptop via the Oculus Link app.)

Winner: HP Reverb G2

From a developer standpoint VR games and apps made exclusively for the well-out-of-beta Steam platform tend to be more resource-heavy which explains why so many of them aren‚Äôt exactly wireless-friendly. (The Meta Quest 2 headset only has 256GB of onboard memory after all which would fill up pretty quickly if apps were 25GB each.) Nevertheless Steam has been around for roughly two decades making it more appealing to both early adopters and hardcore gamers alike.

That being said VR newbies will be plenty pleased by the myriad apps and games available on the Oculus Store and for anyone looking to dip their virtual toes into the metaverse you may appreciate the built-in community features that Meta‚Äôs been working on lately ‚Äî such as their new Horizon Worlds tools .

Round 2: Side-by-side specs

As you can see in the chart below the HP Reverb G2 gives users a wider field of view and higher-res imaging overall but that Windows-only headset requires the proper hardware to run it ( including a top-notch GPU ) and you‚Äôre necessarily tethered to your tech via the bundled 6-meter cable which can be somewhat unwieldy depending on your play area ‚Äî and VR titles of choice. (Pro tip: it‚Äôs easy to get your arms tangled up if you‚Äôre waving them around with an invisible sword in hand.)

However while the Meta Quest 2 is technically wireless out of the box you can connect it to your computer via a USB cable (and the Oculus Link desktop app ) for a notable performance boost ‚Äî if your Windows system meets the minimum requirements which are similar to the Reverb G2.

Winner: Tie

There‚Äôs something to be said for the Quest 2‚Äôs wonderfully wireless offerings but once you‚Äôve connected the headset to your PC and installed the Oculus Link desktop app you can toggle the refresh rate between 72Hz 80Hz 90Hz and 120Hz and adjust the render resolution between 2432 x 1216 and 5408 x 2736. (There also tends to be additional graphics settings within the games themselves that are notably absent in the wireless versions.) This manual performance boost gives Meta the extra edge for casual VR gamers in comparison to the Reverb G2‚Äôs native resolution of 4320 x 2160 ‚Äî which is fantastic but‚Ä¶not wireless.

Round 3: Design and comfort

User beware: if you purchase the Meta Quest 2 headset with that floppy default strap you might be turned off to the whole VR experience in no time flat. The Elite Strap (a $60 upsell) is exponentially more comfortable ‚Äî especially for fast-twitch gaming ‚Äî and it cradles the back of your head more ergonomically holding the whole headset securely in place as you flail about. The Elite Strap with Battery gives you double the juice for double the price ($120) which might be worth the extra spend if your pockets are deep enough.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

HP put plenty of thought into the Reverb G2‚Äôs overall ergonomics and according to their website they‚Äôve made some subtle adjustments from the previous model. In my testing the padded cranial cradle was just as comfortable for longer VR sessions as the Quest 2 but it took more trial-and-error to position all three straps to their optimal lengths; the main cable hangs off the back and it‚Äôs admittedly cumbersome but not overly so.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Both headsets have built-in interpupillary distance sliders which you can adjust on the fly for optimized comfort but the Reverb G2 features bonafide external speakers for slightly more robust soundscapes.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

In a side-by-side comparison you won‚Äôt find much difference between HP‚Äôs and Meta‚Äôs controllers and that‚Äôs a good thing. They both have a similar shape and similar button/joystick placement. All par for the course at the end of a beautiful day in the metaverse.

Winner: Meta Quest 2

By a virtual hair. The overall ergonomics are nearly identical but Meta‚Äôs wireless capabilities give the Quest 2 an absolute edge ‚Äî if you splurge for the Elite Strap that is.

Round 4: Setup process

Setting up each of these headsets really illustrated how much more family-friendly the Quest 2 is in comparison to the Reverb G2. Whereas getting started with Meta‚Äôs headset is just a matter of charging it up; turning it on; pairing the controllers; setting up your Meta account; and hitting the ‚Äòverse HP‚Äôs setup process is a bit more involved even if you don‚Äôt hit any software snags.

Or literal ones. (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

Once you‚Äôve confirmed your laptop meets all of the minimum specs to run the Reverb G2 properly you'll need a Steam account to pair it with. The headset also requires its own power source (via wall outlet) and it connects to your laptop via USB-C and DisplayPort. Long-story-long: if you opt for the Reverb G2 you might have some extra troubleshooting to do during setup. (Just think of it as a real-world boss fight if that helps pass the time.)

Winner: Meta Quest 2

The Reverb G2‚Äôs setup process is logical enough but it‚Äôs not nearly as intuitive as the Quest 2 platform which is practically ready to use right out of the box. Well played Meta.

Round 5: Overall performance

Logistics and hardware aside what sort of VR experience do these goggles have to offer anyway? That‚Äôs the question of the hour. As mentioned above the Meta Quest 2 goggles can be plugged into your laptop via a USB-C cable for a sizable performance boost. (And VR-style access to your desktop which is neat.) This sacrifices that aforementioned mobility of course but the extra oomph makes a difference for more photorealistic games such as The Climb (a rock-climbing simulation). Just remember if you max out all the visual settings you‚Äôll likely see a drop in frame rates across the board.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag)

In my testing with an HP ZBook Fury 17 G8  a Xeon-powered laptop that‚Äôs literally made for the Reverb G2 I experienced comparable gaming performance between each headset especially once the Quest 2 was plugged in. (Though as mentioned above each headset is only as good as the laptop it‚Äôs plugged into.) To give you an idea of what these headsets are capable of take a gander at the gameplay footage below with laptop performance settings maxed out and headset settings on default for the best visual performance my machines could muster.

Both of these titles represent what got me into PC gaming in the first place (I put over 90 hours into Fallout: New Vegas back in the day) but now that we live in the future it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed with the VR versions of both big-box titles and if I‚Äôm not careful I might sign into Skyrim one day and never come back.

I couldn‚Äôt record gameplay footage directly from the Quest 2 headset with the Oculus Link app running but from an anecdotal perspective I could absolutely observe better graphics quality in both of these games when I plugged the goggles into my laptop especially when it came to shadow effects background landscapes and close-up details. Exploring beautiful mountaintops and prehistoric environments was a surprisingly immersive experience but even more so when powered by my laptop.

In terms of audio performance I experienced a surprisingly robust soundscape from the hard-to-find built-in speakers on the Quest 2 goggles which were of similar quality to the external adjustable speakers on the Reverb G2. (Audiophiles can also offload SFX to their computer if your wired cans can do better.) One thing‚Äôs for sure: thanks to the consolidation of VR hardware in recent years either option looks slick as hell.

As a side note I prefer the Quest 2 home environments (there are 11 to choose from) which feel more‚Ä¶well homey somehow.

Winner: Tie

Based on my testing as a casual gamer (and metaverse trekker) I‚Äôd say the overall performance of each headset is fairly subjective based on how resource-heavy a given app might be and while the Meta Quest 2 goggles feel more accessible as a platform the HP Reverb G2 headset feels more like an advanced tech tool. From an anecdotal perspective it also appears to be more capable (and futureproof to some degree) when paired with the proper hardware. When the settings are tweaked properly both platforms feel smooth as butter.

Overall winner: Meta Quest 2

I‚Äôve only scratched the surface of what these VR headsets can do but if you have the right gaming rig at the ready you can expect better overall performance ‚Äî and access to more popular apps ‚Äî from the HP Reverb G2 which hardcore gamers are bound to appreciate. That being said those less concerned with high-end graphics and more concerned with super-social community features will be better served with the Meta Quest 2 which has plenty of power baked into a perfectly portable package.

Not to center Jon Feliciano who lamented the offense‚Äôs ‚Äúmany mental errors‚Äù in Sunday‚Äôs 19-16 win over the Carolina Panthers at MetLife Stadium.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre there yet‚Äù Feliciano said. ‚ÄúI think we got lucky today offensively. I think our defense and special teams played lights out.‚Äù

He‚Äôs right. Safety Julian Love‚Äôs third-down sack of Baker Mayfield with 2:38 to play ‚Äî which forced Carolina to punt the ball and never get it back ‚Äî epitomized this victory.

So did Graham Gano‚Äôs four field goals capped by his 56-yard go-ahead kick with 3:34 remaining that required some body English to turn left inside the upright.

So did the first quarter fumbles forced by linebacker Carter Coughlin on a kickoff and Darnay Holmes on defense recovered by safety Dane Belton and corner Adoree Jackson respectively.

And yet Daniel Jones and the offense were the ones who literally finished the game.

Daniel Jones stands tall against the Panthers and delivers down the stretch as Big Blue moves to 2-0.

Jones was the one who put the Panthers down by improvising on a 3rd and 6 naked bootleg to the right with 1:50 to play on the Giants‚Äô 40.

Jones was the one who stopped cut back past Panthers defensive end Henry Anderson and sprinted into a slide across the NFL logo at midfield to ice this game.

Jones was the one kneeling in victory formation to seal the Giants‚Äô first 2-0 start since 2016 the last time this franchise went to the playoffs.

‚ÄúMental toughness grit and resilience‚Äù were the qualities Jones described as necessary to win an ugly game like Sunday‚Äôs. And here‚Äôs the thing about Jones who is under pressure to prove he‚Äôs a franchise QB once and for all this season:

He has all three.

‚ÄúIt was another game that wasn‚Äôt perfect especially on offense‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot to clean up. Slow start in the first half picked it up in the second half a lot we can do better. But at the end of the day we made plays to win the game.‚Äù

They did. Jones did. For a second straight week.

Most importantly for a second straight week Jones did not let a horrible decision with the football compromise his ability to perform later.

He persisted. He performed. He answered when he needed to.

Sunday‚Äôs decision was an ill-advised throw into zone coverage toward the right sideline into the hands of Panthers linebacker Frankie Luvu.

Luvu should have had an interception at the Giants‚Äô 43-yard line in a tie game with a chance for Carolina to get points before the half.

He dropped it but the fans booed the Giants as they trotted off the field afterward anyway.

They had just watched Jones‚Äô offense squander starting field position at Carolina‚Äôs 22 and 40 yard lines on their first two drives of the game settling for field goals on both.

Jones had made the same kind of frightening throw into traffic that he‚Äôd made on his Week 1 red zone interception in Tennessee. That pick had brought the wrath of head coach Brian Daboll upon the Giants‚Äô quarterback.

So Sunday‚Äôs throw injected an unsettling feeling into an already nervous building.

But Jones didn‚Äôt let playing on the razor‚Äôs edge in another nail biter get to him.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs part of playing the position is being able to refocus and get going‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of it. Gotta be able to move on and play the next play.‚Äù

Jones‚Äô offense went three and out to open the second half. Then the Panthers took their first lead 13-6 on a 3-play 67-yard touchdown drive.

Baker Mayfield attacked rookie Giants corner Cor‚ÄôDale Flott for two completions to receiver D.J. Moore for 45 yards and a 16-yard TD on the drive.

The game was turning.

But Jones answered. He captained an 8-play 75-yard TD drive to tie it up completing 4-of-5 passes for 58 yards on the drive including a 16-yard TD to rookie tight end Daniel Bellinger.

Jones‚Äô 15-yard thread-the-needle strike to receiver Richie James on 3rd and 9 from the Giants‚Äô 26 jump-started the possession and changed the game Barkley made a solid block to buy the QB time.

Jones‚Äô ability to shake off a sluggish start and deliver that dart though is a key quality he has honed through a rocky first three seasons.

‚ÄúI think you learn that‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúThese are long games. They‚Äôre tough games. Most of these are like today a 3-point game that comes down to the last possession and one score. You can‚Äôt afford to worry about the last play or let that affect any decision you‚Äôre gonna make. I‚Äôve learned that over my career and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm always trying to do better and to focus on. I think it‚Äôs important for playing the position.‚Äù

Martindale‚Äôs replacement of Flott with veteran Fabian Moreau on defense made a difference late. Mayfield and receiver Shi Smith failed to take advantage of one big Moreau breakdown.

A run-game led Giants field goal drive gave the home team their final lead in the fourth quarter highlighted by Gary Brightwell‚Äôs 14-yard scamper on 3rd and 1. And as Feliciano noted the offense didn‚Äôt cough up the ball all day.

‚ÄúWe did a good job of not turning the ball over on offense‚Äù the center said. ‚ÄúWe kinda got our run game going late.‚Äù

Jones then used his head and his legs to put the Panthers on ice when his team needed a big play to end it.

‚ÄúA situation like that you get outside the pocket‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúYou want to throw a completion stay inbounds or run the ball to keep the clock moving. I thought they matched Saquon in the flat so I saw a lane to step up and run and obviously wanted to protect the ball.‚Äù

What does this all mean? The Giants (2-0) believe it or not could host the Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football in Week 3 in first place in the NFC East depending on what the Philadelphia Eagles do in Minnesota on Monday night.

In the meantime the offense will get back to work.

‚ÄúShoutout to Wink and the defense for playing such a great game‚Äù Feliciano said with a smirk. ‚ÄúThey could be really good. And we thank them for that.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbXBpcmUtc3RhdGUtYnVpbGRpbmctbGl0LXVwLWluLWdpYW50cy1ibHVl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Empire State Building lit up in Giants blue,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9uZmwtc3RhZGl1bXMtdGFrZS1hLXBsYXktb3V0LW9mLXRoZS1tb3ZpZS10aGVhdGVyLXBsYXlib29rL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A round of NFL stadium beer is almost the same price as a jersey,"Before I was on the radio on the weekends I had season tickets to an NFL team here in Jersey at the Meadowlands. I‚Äôm not telling you the name of that team because I don‚Äôt want any flack about my support of one team over another.

That was almost 30 years ago and I‚Äôd go with a group of guys we‚Äôd take the tailgating to an epic level go in to the stadium grab a couple of beers and enjoy the game. We would take turns buying rounds of beers and knew to bring a couple of extra bucks for that tradition.

Now going to an NFL game at MetLife stadium in East Rutherford NJ is pretty expensive. If you‚Äôre going with a couple of guys you need to remortgage your home to buy a couple of rounds of cold beers.

A new survey came out by bookies.com which broke down the cost of beer at all the 32 home NFL stadiums. I found it fascinating. I thought the New York Giants and New York Jets would be at the top of the list as most expensive since we are within close proximity of New York City and let‚Äôs face it Jersey isn‚Äôt cheap either they are not at the top of the list.

I thought or should I say I assumed that both the Jets and Giants who play at the same stadium would have the same prices for the same beer. They do not.

If you go to MetLife stadium to watch the New York Jets and you want a cold beer you‚Äôre in luck. The Jets are tied with the Lions and Falcons as the least expensive stadium to buy a beer at an average of $6.25 for a 16 oz. beer. $6.25 is pretty hefty; if you have 4 guys and you‚Äôre buying a round it‚Äôll cost you $25.00.

If you‚Äôre going to MetLife to see the New York Giants you need $11.00 for that same beer! A round of beers will set you back $44.00 almost double the cost of a beer at a Jets game.

You want to go to Philly to catch the Eagles bring your wallet and empty your bank account a 16oz beer will run you $14.67 and is the most expensive in the NFL. A round of beers for the guys will cost you $58.68 which is more than double of a beer at a Jets game.

When I tailgated almost 30 years ago it was a different time security was a little softer the stadium was easily accessible beer was less expensive and the cost was manageable. It‚Äôs a different time now and the NFL teams across the league are doing what they can to make the experience at a game a little more enjoyable but it‚Äôs a lot more expensive. I love to pull up my chair open a cold one from the fridge and enjoy the games. Staying home is the place for me.

Good luck with your favorite team. Here is the full list of the average price of a 16oz beer at every NFL stadium as published by bookies.com

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice for the fans to win a game at home finally‚Äù Mara told The Post after 2-0 Giants 19 Panthers 16. ‚ÄúJust happy for them. They haven‚Äôt had a lot to cheer about in recent years. It‚Äôs nice to have a start like that.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt the birth of a playoff team or the sudden death of a broken laughingstock.

But MetLife Stadium got good and loud when the Giants needed it on Sunday and the Giants got good and loud enough when MetLife Stadium needed them to fill the place with pride and hope.

Giants fans should be under no illusions of course.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a young team that‚Äôs still developing‚Äù Brian Daboll said.

But just because this isn‚Äôt a Dream Team doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt dream.

2-and-Oh Baby!

Or in deference to Graham Gano: Toe-and-0.

It was Gano‚Äôs fourth field goal of the afternoon this one a 56-yarder with 3:34 left that made the exit to the parking lots far different for the joyous Big Blue army than the all-too familiar trudge that always left the diehards more deflated than one of Tom Brady‚Äôs old footballs.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to build a great culture and they‚Äôre part of it‚Äù Xavier McKinney said.

It was Gano who broke down the team in this Deja Blue postgame locker room this way: ‚ÄúI appreciate y‚Äôall. Let‚Äôs keep grinding all right? Let‚Äôs keep grinding. Giants on 3 123.‚Äù

Then everybody: ‚ÄúGiants.‚Äù

It was not lost on McKinney that Gano had connected on a 51-yarder earlier in the fourth quarter following a 36-yarder and a 33-yarder in the first half.

‚ÄúI always tell him I‚Äôm like ‚ÄòMan you‚Äôre a damn Hall of Famer‚Äô ‚Äù McKinney told The Post. ‚ÄúI see him as a Hall of Famer. He‚Äôs always even-keeled. He never gets nervous.‚Äù

McKinney was confident when Daboll summoned Gano to win the game.

‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äù McKinney said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care where he kicks it from. I know he‚Äôs gonna make it.‚Äù

Daboll who does not fear failure who has explicit trust in his players summed up the most impressive trait of his team in that postgame locker room when he said: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt waver.‚Äù

Daniel Jones (22-for-34 176 yards 1 TD 21 yards rushing) did not waver in the fourth quarter after hearing the boo birds for another slow start after overthrowing a wide-open Sterling Shepard deep downfield when he scrambled up the middle for 5 yards to get Gano closer for his 51-yarder. And even more critically when he scrambled up the middle for 11 yards on third-and-6 from the Giants‚Äô 40 with 1:50 left on a perfect play call from offensive coordinator Mike Kafka to earn himself a pair of victory kneel downs.

‚ÄúThey matched Saquon [Barkley] in the flat saw a lane to run so I stepped up and ran‚Äù Jones said.

The quarterback is a fighter and he is growing on Daboll with Kenny Golladay a virtual spectator.

‚ÄúHe could have done a lot of different things and he made the right decision under pressure in a critical situation‚Äù Daboll said.

Barkley (21-72 rushing 3-16 receiving) never wavered when he ran for 19 yards and caught a pass to position Gano. The defense never wavered when defensive coordinator Wink Martindale blitzed Julian Love for a third-down sack when Leonard Williams was forced out in the third quarter and Baker Mayfield never saw the ball again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thankful for the opportunities and thankful Coach trusted me to kick into the wind like that‚Äù Gano said.

Jones had completed a 5-yarder to Shepard on third-and-23 following a holding penalty against Jon Feliciano and Daboll never wavered even though he would have preferred that Gano be a yard-and-a-half closer.

‚ÄúDabs looked at me and just pointed and said ‚ÄòGo out‚Äô and then he was like ‚ÄòHey can you make this?‚Äô I looked over and said ‚ÄòYeah‚Äô and laughed‚Äù Gano said.

Except he soon discovered it was no laughing matter.

‚ÄúThen I got out there it was like ‚ÄòMan this is a long one the wind is blowing our way.‚Äô You just try to hit it the same and make sure you hit it pure‚Äù Gano said. ‚ÄúI had to get all of it.‚Äù

3 Graham Gano kicks a field goal in the first half. AP

Gano remember had last year‚Äôs game against the Panthers circled on his calendar. He blamed the club‚Äôs medical staff for mishandling a leg injury in 2018 that nearly ended his career. So of course it was sweet for him. It always is in that situation. It sure was when he beat the Giants that season with a last-second 63-yarder.

I recently came across the QOD from June 11 2013 which discussed hauntings at some of the casino/hotels. As we approach the Halloween season can you tell me if there have been any recent sightings at these hotels and have there been any new sightings in places not previously listed? I know the Apache Hotel at Binion's has been using this as a selling point to get people to stay there.

A:

That QoD from nearly 10 years ago described sightings at primarily Luxor but also Bally's Bellagio Circus Circus Flamingo Planet Hollywood Plaza and Whiskey Pete's. You can read them here.

This was a challenging update (in more ways than one); PR departments aren't normally too enthusiastic to promote ghosts on their properties. But we did unearth so to speak a few new stories.

Here are a couple courtesy of the Haunted Vegas Tour & Ghost Hunt.

The tour visits Fox Ridge Park in Henderson where the ghost of a young boy is sometimes seen riding the swing set. Tourists who have visited it recently have taken photos of the swing set that when developed showed either a shadow on the swing or orbs in its immediate vicinity.

Another venue popular with the paranormal is Bally‚Äôs Las Vegas presently being converted to a Horseshoe. It's most famous as being the second of three MGM Grand hotels the one that was the tragic site of the 1980 fire that took more than 80 lives. A veteran Bally‚Äôs/MGM dealer recently shared with the tour that she'd been dealing blackjack when a nearby table erupted as though somebody had hit a big win. She looked up and recognized ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù a dealer who'd died in the fire still wearing the same uniform. Shaken she looked down at her cards for a moment and ‚Äî when she looked up again ‚Äî the table was empty.

If you want to do some DIY ghost-hunting you can rub elbows with spirits at the Mob Museum. Staffers there believe the former courthouse is haunted perhaps because it's now filled with the bric-a-brac of murder and mayhem.

At MGM Grand according to Vegas.com ‚ÄúThe most chilling ghostly encounter is an elderly woman who is said to occupy a bank of slot machines on the casino floor. She calmly plays two games at once as her dress engulfs her in flames. If approached she disappears.‚Äù

We also heard that the Westgate is ""filled with the spiritual presence of Elvis Presley"" its most famous headliner when it opened as the International. If true Elvis might not have left the building after all.

Finally one venue that could be expected to host apparitions or otherworldly sightings has been noticeably lacking in reports of such. The Ghostbar on the 55th floor of the Palms is from all indications mercifully free of its spectral namesakes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3BsYXNobWFncy5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwLzIwMjIvMDkveW91bmdibG9vZC1taW5lcmFsLWNvc21ldGljcy10by1yZXRhaWwtYXQtc2VsZWN0LWJlYXV0eS1hdmVudWUtbG9jYXRpb25zLWluLWxhcy12ZWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Youngblood Mineral Cosmetics to Retail at Select Beauty Avenue Locations in Las Vegas ‚Äì Splash Magazines,"Spread the love

David Becker/Las Vegas News Bureau

It could be argued that every weekend in Las Vegas is a party but this weekend is extra special and annually is one of the heaviest for visitor traffic.

That‚Äôs partly because Mexican Independence Day is being celebrated all over the Las Vegas Valley with sporting events concerts and more.

Mexicans around the world celebrated the holiday ‚Äî known by many as ‚ÄúEl Grito de Dolores‚Äù or ‚ÄúEl Grito‚Äù ‚Äî on Friday though different festivities and events will take place all weekend.

Perhaps the most anticipated event is tonight at T-Mobile Arena where superstar Mexican boxer Canelo Alvarez will battle Gennadiy Golovkin in the third meeting between the rivals.

And then Sunday the Las Vegas Raiders ‚Äî one of the most popular U.S. pro sports teams within the Hispanic community ‚Äî host the Arizona Cardinals for the team‚Äôs home opener at Allegiant Stadium.

On Friday the Raiders posted a Tweet with the Mexican flag and the message ‚Äúviva Mexico‚Äù to mark the holiday.

‚ÄúThis is going to be a huge weekend in Las Vegas‚Äù said Paul Davis senior vice president of entertainment booking for MGM Resorts International which is a partial owner of T-Mobile Arena. ‚ÄúThis is an important holiday for our resorts and a big few days for Las Vegas which has come back roaring (from pandemic closures in 2020).‚Äù

In 2019 the last calendar year not disrupted by the pandemic Las Vegas welcomed over 42 million visitors or about 3.5 million per month according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Last year the city welcomed close to 2.7 million visitors per month though it‚Äôs widely expected that the visitor total for 2022 will be closer to the 2019 figure.

Through July according to LVCVA statistics Las Vegas has attracted just over 22 million visitors so far in 2022. If the city continues welcoming visitors at that pace through the end of the year it would record over 37 million tourists for 2022.

The occupancy rate is high at hotels this weekend and whatever rooms that are left aren‚Äôt cheap. As of Friday the most affordable room in downtown was $333 at Four Queens; on the Strip it‚Äôs $399 at New York New York.

Davis said the big fight ‚Äúadds to the buzz‚Äù around Mexican Independence Day this year in Las Vegas but there are plenty of additional events around the valley.

Among many different concert offerings in Las Vegas this weekend international superstar Enrique Iglesias will finish his two-night concert stand tonight at Resorts World and Mexican singer Alejandro Fernandez will play tonight at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Mexican-born rocker Carlos Santana a longtime Las Vegas resident artist is set to play at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay and Christian Nodal will rock out Sunday at Grand Garden Arena.

Mexican band Bronco is set to entertain tonight at The Theater at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

Mexican tourists have always been important for Las Vegas‚Äô tourism.

In 2019 the year before the COVID-19 pandemic showed up in America Las Vegas welcomed 1.1 million visitors from Mexico according to the LVCVA.

That was slightly down from 2015 and 2016 which each saw about 1.2 million travelers from Mexico show up.

‚ÄúMexico has long been one of Las Vegas‚Äô top international markets and we‚Äôre delighted to once again welcome visitors to celebrate the Mexican Independence Day holiday as well as Hispanic Heritage Month‚Äù H. Fletch Brunelle vice president of marketing for the LVCVA said in a statement.

Brunelle said there were 40 weekly nonstop flights from Mexico City Guadalajara and Monterrey into Las Vegas.

‚ÄúThe resorts do a fantastic job of celebrating Mexican Independence Day through concerts comedy and sports events featuring Latin America‚Äôs top talent‚Äù Brunelle said.

It‚Äôs not just on the Strip where Mexican Independence Day is being celebrated.

Clark County officials hosted a gathering Friday which was attended by Commissioner Jim Gibson and the occasion will be marked all weekend at the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian with performances by mariachi bands dancers and Latin-themed artists.

Las Vegas attorney David Lopez-Negrete who sits as a director on the Nevada Latino Bar Association board called the celebration of Mexico‚Äôs independence ‚Äúhugely important‚Äù for Mexican Americans living in Southern Nevada.

Lopez-Negrete was born in Mexico but his family later came to the U.S. where he established citizenship.

‚ÄúThis is our home even though lots of us have immigrant roots‚Äù Lopez-Negrete said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a huge part of the community here in Clark County. In Nevada Mexicans comprise about 40% of all immigrants who come to the state so this is a big opportunity for the Mexican community to celebrate our heritage.‚Äù

Lopez-Negrete said he proudly celebrated both the Fourth of July and Mexican Independence Day.

‚ÄúI love how all the properties on the Strip host all these different events from concerts to food and just the celebration of culture‚Äù Lopez-Negrete said. ‚ÄúI know lots of people not just Mexicans are excited about Mexican Independence Day and Hispanic Heritage Month.‚Äù

The Mexican Independence Day celebration isn‚Äôt all that‚Äôs bringing visitors to town this weekend.

The three-day Life is Beautiful festival in downtown Las Vegas is expected to bring 170000 attendees officials said. The festival includes musical acts art exhibits comedians and culinary talent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9wYWxtcy1jeW50aGlhLWtpc2VyLW11cnBoZXktdGFsa3MtY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMtbXVzaWMtYW5kLWEtbG9ic3Rlci1zdWl0LXdlYXJpbmctY2hlZi0yNjQxNzU2L9IBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jYXNpbm9zLWdhbWluZy9wYWxtcy1jeW50aGlhLWtpc2VyLW11cnBoZXktdGFsa3MtY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMtbXVzaWMtYW5kLWEtbG9ic3Rlci1zdWl0LXdlYXJpbmctY2hlZi0yNjQxNzU2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palms‚Äô Cynthia Kiser Murphey talks celebrities music and a lobster-suit wearing chef,"The expansive view from the Palms‚Äô Sky Villa suite on the 32nd floor shows off many of the things Cynthia Kiser Murphey is excited about.

Looking out from one of the windows the casino-resort‚Äôs general manager points out the short shuttle ride to Allegiant Stadium available to loyalty club members going to home football games. From another window she notes the recently reopened rooftop bar Ghostbar and the new energy brought by its live music schedule.

Amenities and regional events are all part of putting the Palms back on the Las Vegas scene after going dark in March 2020. Kiser Murphey said reactivating the dormant site was not easy. Former owner Red Rock Resorts kept the property closed during the pandemic then sold it to the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians for $650 million in May 2021. The deal marks the first time a Native American tribe owns and operates a resort in Las Vegas.

By September Kiser Murphey a longtime MGM Resorts International executive was named general manager of the off-Strip resort. She began working at MGM in 1992 and was the president and chief operating officer at New York-New York from 2008 until last spring.

Even before the Palms reopened in April Kiser Murphey said the dedication of its new ownership and returning staff helped relaunch old venues and welcome new concepts.

She sat down with the Las Vegas Review-Journal last week to reflect on the nearly 21-year-old property which overlooks the Strip from across Interstate 15 on Flamingo Road and share her hopes for the future. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Review-Journal: It‚Äôs been about five months since the Palms reopened. Walk me through how the first few months have been.

Kiser Murphey: The first few months have been super fun super exciting quite dynamic ‚Äî a lot going on every day here at the Palms as we‚Äôre really learning about how the property flows and the energy and the pace. It‚Äôs really been very very exciting as we‚Äôve been opening restaurants and bringing on our live entertainment opening the Pearl (Theater) and really getting to know our amazing employees.

Has anything about the public‚Äôs reaction surprised you?

We‚Äôve had a lot of great responses for our buffet like Wednesday night is lobster night and our chef dresses as a lobster and walks around and poses for pictures. It‚Äôs super fun. I think the surprise is the love that the community has. They come in and they share a lot of stories about ‚ÄòI remember the Palms when ‚Ä¶‚Äô When we opened Ghostbar we had a lot of people admit that they might not have had a legal ID when we opened initially but they‚Äôre legal to drink now‚Ä¶ (and) coming back to celebrate the Ghostbar.

Before joining the Palms you left a leadership role at a large benefits fund. What is it like to come back to the hospitality industry?

I was honored to do it. That was my first year of my whole career that I didn‚Äôt work in hospitality. But it‚Äôs really my passion. I think I literally was born to do this. And I knew that when I was 17 and I packed my car moved to Vegas. So I came back to doing what I love and I get to do it for amazing people with an amazing team.

What‚Äôs your role in supporting the San Manuel tribe in joining this new market?

It is really such an honor to be the first tribally owned and operated resort in Las Vegas. They are a group of people that are committed to the community committed to people very dedicated to our employees and our team extremely philanthropic. It‚Äôs an honor to have the opportunity to represent them and to bring the Palms under their ownership. We‚Äôre getting to know each other. I haven‚Äôt even been here a year yet and in getting to know them they‚Äôve been incredibly supportive of our team. They came in they attended our employee pep rallies they love to come to employee orientation. They spend a lot of time really talking to our people and connecting. I feel it‚Äôs my responsibility to help bring the Las Vegas community to them and help educate them about Las Vegas since I‚Äôve been here for a little while.

What kind of lessons are you passing on about the Las Vegas community?

We‚Äôve brought (the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority) and we‚Äôre really trying to educate them about the annual events that happen in Las Vegas and how that impacts the Palms. How does the Palms join the Las Vegas experience and how to step in on all these amazing things going on in our community like all these amazing sporting events. I think it‚Äôs really exciting to merge the San Manuel talent with what‚Äôs going on in Las Vegas and with our tribal values as well.

Have returning employees provided insight especially since the Palms changed ownership?

Well we opened very fast. We got our gaming license in December. We opened in April ‚Äî not something I recommend ever again. Once the employees came in and 50 percent were returning they knew where everything was. We were looking for business tools and they walked in and said ‚ÄòHere it is. Have you tried to look there?‚Äô They also knew about the people. They know about customer favorites whether it be food items or drinks or music they know about the customers‚Äô favorite machines which customer likes which part of the gaming floor. So they‚Äôve been super helpful. There‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs happened here at the Palms and we love to hear about the history and we love to create new stories.

The Palms was once famous for its nightlife and lengthy roster of celebrity fans. Are you looking to repeat that?

I think there‚Äôs a new kind of celebrity today. We have massive (social media) influencers. They are here all the time. Opening weekend we knew we would be supporting influencers. What we didn‚Äôt know was that one of our employees would spend an hour and 40 minutes helping an influencer video their entire experience. They just assumed we wanted it. The employees brought out the chef the employees took care of them. This was going on day after day and continues even this week. That‚Äôs really new from the old days. Also going back to the celebrity days Johnny Brenden of Brenden Theatres he has provided a lot of historical perspective and he‚Äôs also excited about the future of bringing more celebrities. We‚Äôve already had a few so we‚Äôll continue to really lean into that and have a lot of activation around that. We had FC Barcelona here. Then the customers were here all night waiting at the elevators to see their favorite players.

How do you balance operating like a Strip casino while still welcoming locals?

The location would tell you that it‚Äôs very accessible to locals ‚Äî very easy to get in and out of parking garages one on the west end one on the east end free parking and flat lot entrances. Very good food and accessible pricing is super important. Having amazing movie theaters completely remodeled with local artists and local musicians ‚Äî literally all over the building. On one night you might have seven different ways you can see live music and six of them are probably local musicians. And we have local artists coming in and we have the Shag Store who‚Äôs bringing in locals who want to come see a California artist. Now we‚Äôre moving into sports season. So for example Mabel‚Äôs BBQ is partnering with local breweries so that every game will feature the craft beers from that city ‚Äî from L.A. Kansas City Arizona. As the teams come in we‚Äôll set up a barbecue and they‚Äôre setting up special menus. We‚Äôll be doing some tailgating and we‚Äôll also have viewing parties. Our sportsbook is amazing ‚Äî completely remodeled all new technology and furnishings. We‚Äôre enhancing the sports viewing experience.

What‚Äôs important when attracting the Strip customer?

I think the Strip customer certainly can come up to enjoy the music and dinner and stay over. We also have a strong affinity with our Club Serrano database people that have been loyal to Yaamava‚Äô our sister property in California. So certainly Southern California has come to Las Vegas ‚Äî we know that. You can come to Vegas with your Club Serrano rewards and you can still experience the Strip which is very close by.

Is there anything opening before the end of the year?

We have Marc Vetri coming back. Vetri Cucina has a view that‚Äôs unmatched. It‚Äôs a boutique amazing restaurant. Vetri has been in Philadelphia for many many years. He‚Äôs a well-known chef and has a real love for providing high-quality food. He‚Äôll be opening November 1. We have a lot more concerts booked in the Pearl coming up and we‚Äôre also booking live music now in Kaos.

Considering the short timeline of the Palms opening is the property where you want it to be?

Of course not we‚Äôre not there yet. When you open in four months there‚Äôs a lot to do. A lot of my responsibility is to get training for our staff. We have 120 different IT systems. That takes a lot of learning to integrate all the systems. We need to now go back and really build that infrastructure of the policies the training and the programs. Fortunately we‚Äôve had amazing friendly wonderful employees who worked hard to greet the public and to get us going. We have a lot to do to build all the infrastructure to really support them and to continue to grow the guest experience. We won‚Äôt be bored for a long time.

What are your hopes and goals for the Palms?

My dream would be that everybody just loves to come to the Palms because they feel comfortable they feel recognized and that there‚Äôs a sense of warmth and friendliness. That would be amazing. That takes some real work by the dedicated ladies and gentlemen who work here and our job as a leadership team is to support the people who serve the guests.

He has high praise however for ‚Äúzoomers.‚Äù

The Dallas Mavericks owner spoke glowingly of Generation Z‚Äîthose born between 1995 and 2010‚Äîon this week‚Äôs episode for Re:Thinking with Adam Grant. When making decisions he told the podcast they take into account all factors including the effect on their mental health.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs beautiful and it‚Äôs very analogous to when I was getting started and technology was just happening or the internet was just happening‚Äù said Cuban who sold a video portal to Yahoo for billions in the mid-1990s.

What‚Äôs more he added ‚Äúorganizations will have to understand that more and more and more as we go forward. Not only for how you treat your employees but what your customers expect as well.‚Äù

As for baby boomers they will ‚Äúgo down in history as the most disappointing generation ever from sex drugs and rock and roll to what we have today‚Äù Cuban said.

Zoomers are often associated with ‚Äúquiet quitting‚Äù and tend to favor happiness over productivity‚Äîand a career detached from their identity.

‚ÄúWhereas other generations thought that their identity started at 9 a.m. and ended at 5 p.m. Gen Z often feels that their identity starts outside of work‚Äù Jason Dorsey Gen Z expert and founder of the Center for Generational Kinetics told Fortune last month. ‚ÄúThat puts less pressure on them to define themselves through their current employment.‚Äù

Quiet quitting Thrive Works CEO Arianna Huffington told Fortune is Gen Z‚Äôs reaction to the burnout culture that dominated their parents‚Äô lives.

In a survey by the talent firm Lever earlier this year 42% of zoomers said they‚Äôd rather be at a company that gives them a sense of purpose than one that pays them more.

They prioritize flexibility too with 66% saying they‚Äôd switch jobs for more control over their work schedule assuming the salary and job description remained the same according to a survey by Adobe entitled ‚ÄúThe Future of Time.‚Äù

TikTok is littered with videos of zoomers questioning societal values that prioritize productivity over well-being. For them the pandemic was a defining moment leading to doubts early in their lives about forever pursuing the next accomplishment.

The pandemic ‚Äúis the generation-defining experience for Gen Z and will impact them for the rest of their lives‚Äù says the Center for Generational Kinetics which has studied zoomers extensively. ‚ÄúIn the area of employment there is significant government data that shows Gen Z leaving current jobs starting new jobs and reconsidering career paths and work styles.‚Äù"

(Courtesy: CC BY 4.0/N Renaudin et al. Nat. Methods 10.1038/s41592-022-01549-5)

Neuroimaging has increased our understanding of brain function. Such techniques often involve measuring blood-flow variations to detect brain activation exploiting the fundamental interaction between the brain‚Äôs vascular and neuronal activities. Any alterations in this so-called neurovascular coupling are strongly linked to cerebral dysfunction. The ability to image cerebral microcirculation is particularly important as neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs involve dysfunction of the small cerebral vessels.

Researchers at Institute Physics for Medicine Paris (Inserm/ESPCI PSL University/CNRS) have now developed a method called functional ultrasound localization microscopy (fULM) that can capture cerebral activity at the micron scale. The team published the first micron-scale whole-brain images of rodent vascular activity in Nature Methods along with a detailed explanation of the fULM image acquisition and analysis procedures.

Unlike invasive electrophysiological or optical approaches to study brain function at the microscopic scale ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can be non-invasive. The imaging technology tracks biocompatible micron-sized microbubbles injected into the blood circulation and by accumulating the tracks of millions of microbubbles reconstructed images can reveal subtle changes in the cerebral blood volume with micron-sized accuracy across large fields-of-view.

Researchers have previously used ULM to reveal microvascular anatomy at the whole-brain scale in rodents and humans. The spatial resolution of ULM is 16-fold better than that achieved with functional ultrasound imaging. But because the acquisition process is slow ULM can only produce static maps of blood flow induced by the neuronal activity.

The fULM technique overcomes this limitation. In addition to imaging the brain microvasculature the technique detects local brain activation by calculating the number and speed of microbubbles passing in each vessel. When a brain region activates neurovascular coupling causes the blood volume to increase locally dilating the vessels and allowing more microbubbles to pass. fULM provides local estimates of multiple parameters that characterize such vascular dynamics including microbubble flow speed and vessel diameters.

According to principal investigator Mickael Tanter and colleagues integrating fULM into a cost-efficient easy-to-use ultrasound scanner provides ‚Äúa quantitative look at the cerebral microcirculatory network and its haemodynamic changes by combining a brain-wide spatial extent with a microscopic resolution and a 1 s temporal resolution compatible with neurofunctional imaging‚Äù.

In vivo studies

To demonstrate the fULM concept the researchers first imaged laboratory rats with functional ultrasound (without contrast) followed by ULM in the same imaging plane. They combined sensory stimulations (whiskers deflections or visual stimulation) in anesthetized rats with continuous microbubble injection. For ULM the rats received a continuous slow injection of microbubbles during a 20 min imaging session leading to roughly 30 microbubbles per ultrasound frame.

During ULM processing the researchers saved every track with each microbubble position and its respective time position. They constructed ULM images by selecting a pixel size and sorting each microbubble within each pixel. Only pixels with at least five different microbubble detections during the total acquisition time were used for analyses.

The technique allowed the researchers to map functional hyperaemia (increased blood in the vessels) in both cortical and subcortical areas with 6.5 ¬µm resolution. They quantified the temporal haemodynamic responses during whisker stimulations for four rats and during visual stimulations for three rats by measuring the microbubble flux and velocity.

The team quantified the involvement of blood vessels during functional hyperaemia. They observed increases in microbubble count speed and diameter for a representative arteriole and venule (very small arteries/veins leading into/out of the capillaries) noting that control animals did not exhibit any changes. They also introduced a ‚Äúperfusion‚Äù and ‚Äúdrainage area index‚Äù to quantify further the involvement of each individual blood vessel. These increased by 28% and 54% during stimulation for the arteriole and venule respectively.

Due to the large field-of-view the researchers could perform quantitative analyses simultaneously for every vessel across the whole rat brain slice image even in deep structures such as the thalamus for whisker stimulations and superior colliculus for visual stimulations.

‚ÄúThe achieved spatiotemporal resolution enables fULM to image different vascular compartments in the whole brain and to discriminate their respective contributions in particular in the precapillary arterioles known to have a major contribution to vascular changes during neuronal activities‚Äù write the authors.

They add: ‚ÄúfULM shows that the relative increase in microbubble flow is greater in intra-parenchymal vessels rather than in arterioles. fULM also confirms depth-dependent characteristics for blood flow and speed in penetrating arterioles at baseline and highlights a depth-dependent variation in blood speed during activation. It also quantifies large increases of microbubble flux blood speed and diameter in venules during activation.‚Äù

As a new imaging research tool fULM provides a way to track dynamic changes during brain activation and will offer insights into neural brain circuits. It will aid the study of functional connectivity layer-specific cortical activity and or neurovascular coupling alterations on a brain-wide scale.

Tanter notes that researchers at Institute Physics for Medicine are collaborating with the Paris-based medical technology company Iconeus to make this technology available for the neuroscience community and for clinical imaging very rapidly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The last tablet we saw Brady throw was destroyed and we didn‚Äôt get to see how it fared after this temper tantrum.

While this may be a known and intended feature of these web browsers it does raise concerns about what happens to the data after transmission and how safe the practice might be particularly when it comes to password fields.

Both Chrome and Edge ship with basic spellcheckers enabled. But features like Chrome's Enhanced Spellcheck or Microsoft Editor when manually enabled by the user exhibit this potential privacy risk.

Spell-jacking: That's your spellcheck sending PII to Big Tech

When using major web browsers like Chrome and Edge your form data is transmitted to Google and Microsoft respectively should enhanced spellcheck features be enabled.

Depending on the website you visit the form data may itself include PII‚Äîincluding but not limited to Social Security Numbers (SSNs)/Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) name address email date of birth (DOB) contact information bank and payment information and so on.

Josh Summitt co-founder & CTO of JavaScript security firm otto-js discovered this issue while testing his company's script behaviors detection.

In cases where Chrome Enhanced Spellcheck or Edge's Microsoft Editor (spellchecker) were enabled ""basically anything"" entered in form fields of these browsers was transmitted to Google and Microsoft.

""Furthermore if you click on 'show password' the enhanced spellcheck even sends your password essentially Spell-Jacking your data"" explains otto-js in a blog post.

""Some of the largest websites in the world have exposure to sending Google and Microsoft sensitive user PII including username email and passwords when users are logging in or filling out forms. An even more significant concern for companies is the exposure this presents to the company's enterprise credentials to internal assets like databases and cloud infrastructure.""

Alibaba login form fields with 'show password' enabled (otto-js)

Chrome's enhanced spellchecker transmits password to Google (otto-js)

Users may often rely on the ""show password"" option on sites where copying-pasting passwords is not allowed for example or when they suspect they've mistyped it.

To demonstrate otto-js shared the example of a user entering credentials on Alibaba' Cloud platform in the Chrome web browser‚Äîalthough any website can be used for this demonstration.

With enhanced spellcheck enabled and assuming the user tapped ""show password"" feature form fields including username and password are transmitted to Google at googleapis.com.

A video demonstration has also been shared by the company:

BleepingComputer also observed credentials being transmitted to Google in our tests using Chrome to visit major sites like:

CNN‚Äîboth username and password when using 'show password'

Facebook.com‚Äîboth username and password when using 'show password'

SSA.gov (Social Security Login)‚Äîusername field only

Bank of America‚Äîusername field only

Verizon‚Äîusername field only

A simple HTML solution: 'spellcheck=false'

Although the transmission of form fields is happening securely over HTTPS it may not be imminently clear as to what happens to user data once it reaches the third-party in this example Google's server.

""The Enhanced spell check feature requires an opt-in from the user"" a Google spokesperson confirmed to BleepingComputer. Note that this is in contrast to the basic spellchecker that is enabled in Chrome by default and does not transmit data to Google.

To review if Enhanced spell check is enabled in your Chrome browser copy-paste the following link in your address bar. You can then choose to turn it on or off:

chrome://settings/?search=Enhanced+Spell+Check

Enhanced spell check setting in Chrome needs to be opted-in (BleepingComputer)

As evident from the screenshot the feature's description explicitly states that with Enhanced spell check enabled ""text that you type in the browser is sent to Google.""

""The text typed by the user may be sensitive personal information and Google does not attach it to any user identity and only processes it on the server temporarily. To further ensure user privacy we will be working to exclude passwords proactively from spell check"" continued Google in its statement shared with us.

""We appreciate the collaboration with the security community and we are always looking for ways to better protect user privacy and sensitive information.""

As for Edge Microsoft Editor Spelling & Grammar Checker is a browser addon that needs to be explicitly installed for this behavior to take place.

BleepingComputer reached out to Microsoft well in advance prior to publishing. We were told that the matter was being looked into but we are yet to hear back.

otto-js dubbed the attack vector ""Spell-jacking"" and expressed concern for users of cloud services like Office 365 Alibaba Cloud Google Cloud - Secret Manager Amazon AWS - Secrets Manager and LastPass.

Reacting to otto-js' report both AWS and LastPass mitigated the issue. In LastPass' case the remedy was reached by adding a simple HTML attribute spellcheck=""false"" to the password field:

LastPass ""password"" field now includes spellcheck=false HTML attribute (BleepingComputer)

The 'spellcheck' HTML attribute when left out from form text input fields is usually assumed by web browsers be true by default. An input field with 'spellcheck' explicitly set to false will not be processed through a web browser's spellchecker.

""Companies can mitigate the risk of sharing their customers' PII - by adding 'spellcheck=false' to all input fields though this could create problems for users"" explains otto-js referring to the fact users will now no longer be able to run their entered text though spellchecker.

""Alternatively you could add it to just the form fields with sensitive data. Companies can also remove the ability to 'show password.' That won't prevent spell-jacking but it will prevent user passwords from being sent.""

Ironically enough we observed Twitter's login form which comes with the ""show password"" option has the password field's ""spellcheck"" HTML attribute explicitly set to true:

Twitter password field has 'show password' and spellcheck set to true (BleepingComputer)

As an added safeguard Chrome and Edge users can turn off Enhanced Spell Check (by following the aforementioned steps) or remove the Microsoft Editor add-on from Edge until both companies have revised extended spellcheckers to exclude processing of sensitive fields like passwords.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctdG8tam9pbi1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbXMtbWVldGluZy_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsdHJlbmRzLmNvbS9jb21wdXRpbmcvaG93LXRvLWpvaW4tbWljcm9zb2Z0LXRlYW1zLW1lZXRpbmcvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to join a Microsoft Teams meeting,"Virtual meetings have grown more and more common in the last few years. These calls often consisting of both voice and video aid communication at a time when many organizations have both on-site and remote employees. Microsoft Teams is among the most popular tools used for day-to-day calls in many organizations.

Microsoft Teams app or any supported browser

The ultimate goal of services like Microsoft Teams is to make a meeting possible no matter where you are or what you‚Äôre doing which means there are multiple ways to join and a variety of devices you can use. Here are four different methods on how to join a Microsoft Teams meeting and remember if you have any Microsoft Teams issues we have a detailed guide to help you with that too.

Join with a link

A friend or colleague can add you to a Teams meeting whether you have a Microsoft account or not. When invited you‚Äôll receive an email with a link to the call.

Step 1: Click on the link in the email to begin the process of joining the call.

Step 2: Depending on the device you‚Äôre using you‚Äôll be taken to a screen where you can choose how you want to join. The options include downloading a desktop application for macOS or Windows using the Teams app or continuing in your browser.

Note: Some browsers including Safari are not supported. If you click the ‚Äúcontinue with browser‚Äù button while using an unsupported browser you will be prompted to download the applicable desktop app.

Step 3: Whichever method you choose the next screen will start connecting you to the call. To continue you may need to update some permissions to grant Teams access to your camera and microphone.

Step 4: Once you‚Äôve granted permission you‚Äôll be able to tweak your audio and video settings before joining the call. If you have multiple microphones and cameras you can choose which one you wish to use.

Once you enter your name and click the Join now button your request to join the call will be sent to the organizer for confirmation and you will be admitted.

Join with a Meeting ID

If you don‚Äôt want to join the meeting on the same device as the one you've opened up your email on you can input the meeting ID and passcode into any device you like.

Simply access the Microsoft Teams website and input your ID and code. You will then be prompted to choose your method of joining and adjust your settings before entering the meeting.

Join through the Teams app

If you have the Microsoft Teams mobile app or desktop app there are a number of ways to join a call.

Firstly when the organizer invites you you‚Äôll receive a notification that you can accept to enter the meeting.

You can also join an existing scheduled call from the Calendar tab of the Teams app. Simply click the join button and a new window will open allowing you to adjust your audio and video settings before entering the meeting.

Every meeting has its own chat that you can access by clicking the arrow buttons to expand the window and clicking on the chat tab. When a meeting has already started you‚Äôll be able to click the ‚ÄúJoin‚Äù button and enter a call right from the chat tab.

Join with phone audio

If you don‚Äôt have a reliable internet connection or the right device to join a video call you can also listen to the audio of a meeting with your phone. Your invite email will have the call in option listed along with the number for you to call. Simply dial the number and join in although additional fees may apply so check with your phone provider before you do that.

At the authorization meeting FDA officials announced the approval of these new boosters for emergency use based on data from eight mice in a Pfizer study. At the same time the FDA revoked authorization for the original monovalent boosters‚Äîmeaning anyone subject to a booster or ‚Äúup-to-date‚Äù mandate will have to take the bivalent booster which has no proven safety or efficacy data in human beings.

While the flu vaccine is also approved on a yearly basis without full trials the mRNA COVID vaccines do not share the flu shot‚Äôs decadeslong track record of observed safety. The population most likely to be mandated to take a bivalent booster consists largely of college students. The young men in this population are the exact demographic that face heightened safety concerns specifically around myocarditis as documented in multiple peer-reviewed studies. In fact during a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend the bivalent boosters the agency presented updated myocarditis data that confirmed the rates of myocarditis in young men were about 2-to-3.5 times higher (slide 35) than the agency had claimed last year (slide 13). Nevertheless the FDA and CDC moved to recommend the bivalent boosters for anyone over the age of 12 without human clinical trials.

This is just the latest episode in the FDA‚Äôs less-than-thorough approach to new COVID vaccine approvals. For example in May 2022 the FDA authorized monovalent Pfizer boosters for children ages 5-11 based on laboratory data that showed heightened antibody response levels in just 67 children.

During the opioid crisis the FDA famously failed to demand adequate research disregarded safety concerns and allowed Purdue Pharma to promote oxycodone for uses that were never borne out by testing. Later it was revealed that the agency had been plagued by ethical issues: When the FDA convened advisers to address mounting oxycodone safety concerns for instance five out of 10 of these advisers had received payments from Purdue and another three had received payments from other opioid manufacturers.

The continuation of unchecked conflicts of interest and several recent authorizations for uses of new medical products that are in many ways unproven demonstrate that the FDA is essentially unresponsive to public outrage culminating in the bizarre spectacle of the agency promoting bivalent boosters on social media through unsubstantiated claims of efficacy acting not as a neutral regulator but actively advertising on behalf of pharmaceutical companies with government purchase contracts. The FDA‚Äôs disregard for its congressional mandate is not unique to this moment‚Äîit is a symptom of its decadeslong transformation into an agency captured by the corporations it is tasked with regulating.

When Kelley Krohnert a mother and career IT expert from Georgia watched the CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting held on June 17 2022 she noted a slide that listed COVID as the fourth-leading cause of death for children under 1 and the fifth-leading cause for children aged 1-4 in the United States. This same slide was originally used at the FDA‚Äôs June 15 Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting when FDA advisers voted to authorize vaccines for children under 5. Krohnert immediately recognized that the slide was citing a preprint by researchers in the United Kingdom. This preprint not only used death statistics that included deaths where COVID was not an underlying cause‚Äîit also compared a 26-month cumulative total for COVID deaths to a 12-month total for other deaths. In Krohnert‚Äôs analysis COVID fell to ninth place for children under 1 and into a four-way tie for eighth place for children aged 1-4. When the researchers corrected their preprint to adjust for some of the errors Krohnert found COVID fell below influenza and pneumonia as a cause of death for children under 5.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have to do a complex statistical analysis to find these errors‚Äù Krohnert told me. ‚ÄúIf this is the standard for what goes into these presentations what kind of vetting is going into that data?‚Äù

This lack of vetting is a central issue in the FDA‚Äôs approval process. The key question for any drug authorization is ‚ÄúDo the benefits outweigh the risks?‚Äù When a disease‚Äôs risks are exaggerated one side of this equation is skewed and the equation is also affected by exaggerating the benefits of a treatment or ignoring the potential risks of that treatment. The data presented in recent FDA meetings has been consistently nonobjective and skewed to favor drug approval.

For the authorization of vaccines for children under 5 boosters for children 5-11 and the new bivalent boosters the FDA has relied heavily on measures of antibody levels as the main ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù side of the equation. This is despite the fact that Pfizer has admitted that there is ‚Äúno established correlate of protection‚Äù between antibody levels and immunity. Both the CDC and the FDA already advise against the use of antibody testing to determine levels of immunity. Essentially this metric has been deemed inadequate by the very regulatory agency that is now consistently accepting it as a substitute for clinical trials.

This lack of real efficacy data has been accompanied by a disregard for potential safety issues. European Union regulators have already warned that frequent boosters can weaken the immune system; the FDA is apparently unconcerned. The FDA also disregarded the fact that for pediatric vaccines Pfizer observed a higher rate of severe COVID in its vaccine group (table 5). Furthermore the FDA allowed the company to ignore 365 symptomatic cases in its trial and to use only the last 10 symptomatic cases after the third dose to claim 80% efficacy (tables 19 and 20). This is significant because Pfizer saw negative efficacy between doses 1 and 2. In a vaccine meant to prevent illness for an age group that is already at extremely low risk this data should have been a red flag for the FDA. Why then has the body charged with protecting Americans from inadequately tested products been so eager not just to authorize these products for emergency use but to enthusiastically recommend them?

Dr. Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia was one of only two advisers who voted against VRBPAC‚Äôs recommendation for reformulated boosters in June. I asked him about his vote as an FDA vaccine adviser and longtime advocate for vaccination. He told me he believed the thinking behind the bivalent boosters was sound. ‚ÄúThe problem for me‚Äù he said ‚Äúwas I just didn‚Äôt think the data that were presented on June 28th to our committee made that case compellingly.‚Äù

I asked Offit if he felt there was political pressure to vote a certain way. ‚ÄúI never feel pressure when I cast my vote‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúI voted no.‚Äù However he said ‚ÄúI think the way that they were presented I think it was clear that the FDA and the World Health Organization wanted to go in this direction.‚Äù It was notable that the day after the FDA‚Äôs vote the White House announced its purchase of 171 million bivalent booster doses from Pfizer and Moderna for $4.9 billion. ‚ÄúYou felt that the train sort of had left the station‚Äù Offit said.

In 2020 the Trump administration was widely criticized for rushing vaccines and pressuring the FDA. Although the Biden administration has exerted similar if not more pressure it has enjoyed a conspicuous absence of criticism. Before the FDA‚Äôs expert panel could even meet to discuss vaccines for children under 5 for example the White House‚Äôs COVID czar Ashish Jha publicly announced a precise date for when they would become available. In other words Jha appeared to know the FDA‚Äôs decision before it had allegedly made one.

Notably President Joe Biden‚Äôs election campaign reversed a long-standing trend of Republican candidates receiving far more campaign donations from the pharmaceutical industry: In 2020 Biden outraised Trump from Big Pharma by a margin of 2 to 1. Several political appointees in the Biden administration moreover have ties to vaccine manufacturers including the president‚Äôs chief campaign strategist Anita Dunn who worked for Pfizer before joining his team. Biden also ran his election campaign on the promise to ‚Äúshut down the virus‚Äù; it turned out that there were more U.S. COVID deaths in 2021 when vaccines were widely available than in 2020 when they were not. Rather than reckon with this fact and readjust its strategy the administration has doubled down by putting increased political pressure on an already compromised FDA.

The public comment section of the June 15 2022 VRBPAC meeting featured several anxious parents who described keeping their infants and toddlers under extreme conditions of isolation over two years after the the beginning of the pandemic. Many FDA panelists argued that in light of these comments it was necessary to authorize the vaccines so that these parents could finally allow their infants and toddlers to experience normal life.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just not an acceptable basis for drug or vaccine authorization‚Äù Dr. Vinay Prasad professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco told me. The purpose of the FDA as a federal regulatory agency is not to simply give people choices or even to address consumer anxiety as such. The FDA‚Äôs focus on parents‚Äô desires as a rationale for approval is particularly significant given that just 5% of children under 5 ended up getting the first dose. Clearly the demand has not been overwhelming. If we wanted unlimited options Prasad explained we wouldn‚Äôt have an FDA at all. ‚ÄúYou can just have a free market where you can have whatever choice you want‚Äù he said. The purpose of the FDA by contrast is ‚Äúto shield us from making very very bad choices.‚Äù

The FDA used to have solid credibility on safety and efficacy but in Prasad‚Äôs view ‚Äúover the last 15 or 20 years in many sectors of the FDA I think there‚Äôs been an erosion in fundamental values and an increase in favoritism toward corporate interests.‚Äù Pharmaceutical companies have been allowed to provide funding for the FDA since 1992; today a full 75% of the FDA‚Äôs scientific review budget comes directly from the industry. There is also the problem of the FDA‚Äôs revolving door. In 2016 Prasad conducted a review of the future jobs of cancer and hematology regulators and found that 57% of those who left the FDA went on to work for the industry. This ‚Äúis sort of a terribly perverse incentive‚Äù Prasad explained. ‚ÄúIf your primary job occupation is to work for the firm across the table how can you be an effective regulator?‚Äù

Currently some of the FDA advisers who have served on VRBPAC panels have potential conflicts of interest. Dr. James Hildreth for example is president and CEO of Meharry Medical College which served as a site for Moderna‚Äôs vaccine trial and which was set to receive between $1.5 million and $2 million from the pharmaceutical giant. He was granted a waiver to be a voting member on VRBPAC anyway.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services make public any funding that doctors receive from the biopharmaceutical industry. According to this database Dr. Arnold Monto the acting chair of VRBPAC received a total of $161350 in payments from pharmaceutical companies between 2015 and 2021. This includes consulting fees from Pfizer Seqirus (a company that plans to use mRNA technology to develop new influenza vaccines) and Hoffmann-La Roche (the company that provided antibody tests for Moderna‚Äôs vaccine trials). Dr. Archana Chatterjee a member of VRBPAC received $456657 in payments and research funding from pharmaceutical companies between 2015 and 2021. This includes $131657 in payments and research funding from Pfizer which the FDA apparently did not consider a potential conflict of interest.

Since 2015 at least seven other voting FDA advisers have received thousands (and sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands) of dollars from pharmaceutical companies in the form of consulting fees and research funding. Of these Dr. Ofer Levy Dr. Wayne Marasco Dr. Steven Pergam and Dr. Jay Portnoy received payments from companies involved in mRNA technology. These companies include Shire Amgen Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. The fact that some advisers received funding from companies that have previous or new investments in mRNA is made more troubling by the fact that Levy cited the general use of mRNA as a reason to approve pediatric vaccines on June 15. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a broader context‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis mRNA vaccine platform may be useful not just against this current coronavirus and its current variants but the next one as well as future pandemics.‚Äù In total of the 21 members at the June 15 meeting (who voted unanimously to recommend vaccines for children under 5) at least 10 had received some form of direct or indirect payment from the biopharmaceutical industry.

These kinds of relationships are not outside the norm. To this day we don‚Äôt know what if any financial incentives were involved in the selection process for companies that received research funding through Operation Warp Speed. This is because Donald Trump‚Äôs vaccine chief Moncef Slaoui accepted a $1 government contractor fee which legally allowed him to avoid disclosing his full stock portfolio. Moreover one of the main architects of Operation Warp Speed was the FDA‚Äôs lead vaccine regulator Dr. Peter Marks. A Star Trek fan Marks was the man who gave Operation Warp Speed its name. According to Dr. Janet Woodcock the former interim head of the FDA ‚ÄúThe U.S. response to the pandemic as far as vaccines ‚Ä¶ was largely [Dr. Mark‚Äôs] concept.‚Äù Originally Marks recused himself from a regulatory position but regained his role once he left Operation Warp Speed shortly after the program began.

Regardless of the ultimate successes or failures of Operation Warp Speed itself this raises a fundamental ethical question about how the American government works. If a regulator is personally invested in the success of drug development can he or she be objective in making regulatory decisions for ordinary people? This question is all the more relevant given the fact that COVID vaccines are some of the most lucrative pharmaceutical products in history.

In 2021 Pfizer‚Äôs COVID vaccine sales topped $36 billion and Moderna‚Äôs reached $17.7 billion. In 2022 these companies are forecast to reach a combined $51 billion in COVID vaccine sales. It is of course in the interests of Pfizer and Moderna to seek to maximize profits by bypassing clinical trials. This is how we would expect these companies to behave. It is the role of the FDA however to ensure that any product on the market is effective and safe.

As we learned during the opioid epidemic a breakdown in the decision-making process at the FDA can have a profound impact on society as a whole. To watch the FDA actively promote a fifth COVID shot for Americans while almost every other country on Earth moves in the opposite direction is to notice that something fundamental remains broken at the agency. Apart from Canada no other country in the world has approved mRNA shots for children under 5. The U.K. has banned COVID vaccines for healthy children under 12 and several European countries suspended Moderna‚Äôs vaccine for anyone under 30.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Wednesday (Sept. 21) will be the 238th day without a tech IPO of over $50 million beating the records set after the 2008 financial meltdown and the dot.com bust in the early 2000s according to researchers at Morgan Stanley.

High inflation has driven the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates dampening enthusiasm for growth stocks that were big winners during last year‚Äôs boom. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 28% this year compared to the 19% drop in the S&P 500 the Financial Times reported Sunday (Sept. 18).

Tech startups have been hit hardest but it‚Äôs not just tech. The Financial Times reported that overall U.S. IPO volumes are down 94% year-over-year with just $7 billion raised so far compared to $110 billion at this time last year.

Matt Walsh head of tech equity capital markets at SVB Securities told the Financial Times ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market right now and uncertainty is the enemy of the IPO market.‚Äù

Walsh expected a ‚Äúa small group‚Äù of companies would venture an IPO this year but most have already pushed their prospective stock listings into 2023.

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar. And Wall Street firms have started up hundreds of brand-new E.S.G. dedicated funds ‚Äî seeking to cash in on growing investor demand for such investments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzkwY2I0ZTU2LWI0NjAtNDY1NC1iNDIwLTljNDcwMjE4ZmQ5YtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Market downturn sparks longest US tech IPO drought in over 20 years,"Print this page

The stock market downturn since the start of the year has caused the longest drought in US technology listings this century with experts cautious about the pace of a revival even after tentative signs of life in other sectors.

Wednesday will mark 238 days without a tech IPO worth more than $50mn surpassing the previous records set in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the early 2000s dotcom crash according to research by Morgan Stanley‚Äôs technology equity capital markets team.

The US stock market has been rocked this year by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs battle to bring down inflation through aggressive interest rate rises. Higher rates hit stock valuations by reducing the value of future earnings and have sparked fears that the economy will be pushed into recession.

High-growth tech stocks dominated last year‚Äôs record-breaking IPO market and enjoyed some of the largest gains during the stock market boom but they have also been disproportionately hit by this year‚Äôs sell-off.

The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite has fallen nearly 28 per cent this year compared with a drop of just over 19 per cent in the S&P 500 while the Renaissance IPO index which tracks US companies that listed in the past two years is down more than 45 per cent.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market right now and uncertainty is the enemy of the IPO market‚Äù said Matt Walsh head of tech equity capital markets at SVB Securities.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll need to see some stabilisation in the outlook and investors stepping back in to buy existing public securities before they‚Äôre willing to move further out on the risk curve and buy tech IPOs.‚Äù

Life insurer Corebridge last week completed the first $1bn US IPO since January and the cautious early reception highlighted investor wariness even for more well-established and profitable businesses.

Even after the Corebridge deal overall US IPO volumes are down 94 per cent year on year with just $7bn raised so far in 2022 compared with $110bn in the same period last year according to Dealogic data.

Corebridge was being closely watched as a sign of investor appetite for more deals. But Nicole Brookshire a partner at law firm Davis Polk who specialises in tech listings said other factors such as weak earnings reports could have ‚Äúmore of an outsized impact‚Äù on the prospects for new tech issuers.

‚ÄúGuidance has worsened with some companies and sectors [and] many companies are feeling the effects of macro headwinds and that influences valuations‚Äù she said.

IT groups in the S&P 500 just about met earnings estimates in the second quarter according to FactSet but forecasts for the third quarter have been repeatedly revised lower with earnings now expected to decline 4 per cent year on year.

Many tech groups have responded to the downturn by putting greater emphasis on cutting costs and showing progress toward profitability but Brookshire said companies would need time to show the changes are working.

‚ÄúLast year there was little discussion of profitability [among IPO candidates]. Now there is more but the problem with switching focus from a growth story to a profit story is it takes time for issuers to be able to prove their progress.‚Äù

A more positive factor extending the drought SVB‚Äôs Walsh added is the fact that tech companies raised so much private capital before the downturn that ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt the same sense of urgency‚Äù. He said he expected ‚Äúa small group‚Äù of companies would still try to list this year but said most had already pushed plans back to 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLWJhbmstcmVndWxhdG9ycy1jb25zaWRlci1uZXctcnVsZXMtcmVnaW9uYWwtYmFua3MtdGltZXMtY3Jpc2lzLTIwMjItMDktMTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. bank regulators consider new rules for regional banks in times of crisis Wall Street Journal reports,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-bank-regulators-consider-new-rules-regional-banks-times-crisis-2022-09-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL3VzLWJhbmstcmVndWxhdG9ycy1jb25zaWRlci1uZXctcnVsZXMtcmVnaW9uYWwtYmFua3MtdGltZXMtY3Jpc2lzLTIwMjItMDktMTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21wYW55L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS10cmVuZHMvcmFpbm1ha2Vycy1xdWl0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtYmFua2luZy1naWdzLWZvci1ncmVlbmVyLXBhc3R1cmVzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0Mjc0ODQ3LmNtc9IBkwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21wYW55L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS10cmVuZHMvcmFpbm1ha2Vycy1xdWl0LWludmVzdG1lbnQtYmFua2luZy1naWdzLWZvci1ncmVlbmVyLXBhc3R1cmVzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDI3NDg0Ny5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rainmakers quit investment banking gigs for greener pastures,"Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit

After nearly a decade and a half in investment banking and a glamorous career in deal making with some of the top global and Indian banks Harsh Soni decided to move on to a startup driven by a ""desire to work on something closer to consumers and an opportunity to build something new"".This May Soni joined Slice as head of corporate development responsible for leading the fintech startup's strategic efforts investor relations and business finance.""While i-banking as a career offers a steep learning curve and a well-defined career path it's a high-pressure job which might not be sustainable in the long run for all"" says Soni. That apart there's this rut of repetitive monotonous work that people might fall into. ""Tech startups in particular fill that void - leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve the most pressing problems not to mention a potentially infinite upside.""Soni who moved to Slice from Bank of America  is not the only one to make this transition. The glitzy world of investment banking seems to be losing its magic for many bankers. Despite the fat bonus packages and a host of IPOs and M&A deals in the last one year several bankers are opting out to high-growth corporates or new-age companies in strategy M&A and corporate development roles.Of the 150 middle- to senior-level moves in investment banks in the last six months about 52% left the sector to join other domains show exclusive data from executive search firm Native. About 74% of the churn happened in domestic banks and financial services institutions. Data of the last couple of years at top global i-banks also show that exits are more than double compared to lateral hires.A significant increase in opportunities at large Indian companies and the scope of wealth creation at startups in the form of hefty stock options are attracting the rainmakers That apart while banking has always been a high-stress job the last two years of pandemic - which saw deal making at an all-time high - has made it tougher for many to strike a work-life balance leading to huge increase in stress and prompting several bankers to make the switch.Some of the recent top moves include Chirag Jain who joined Reliance Industries from Bank of America; Puneet Gulati head of M&A at Piramal Enterprises who moved from JM Financial; Naveen Sachdeva who joined MobiKwik from JM Financial; Dinesh Taluja who joined Reliance Retail in corporate finance and M&A from Credit Suisse; Raj Rathi who joined Dream Capital the corporate venture capital and M&A arm of Dream Sports from JP Morgan; and Shashank More who shifted to Jio Platforms from Morgan Stanley according to data put together by Native.""While many IB platforms gave out stupendous appraisals backed by a phenomenal year in business IB has become a stepping ladder for many junior bankers to move to buy side and mid- to senior-level bankers to move to corporate roles"" said Ruchi Thakkar head - capital markets at Native.""Bankers are largely attracted to established corporates or startup roles due to the pressure of revenue targets year on year. Another key reason is also the boredom of doing the same thing over a decade and the desire to move to differentiated roles"" she said.Large Indian companies and conglomerates are also growing in terms of size and offer a plethora of opportunities in investor relations and strategic M&A that require the expertise and acumen of bankers who have been involved in marquee deals.""The amount of fundraising at large Indian companies has significantly gone up and we are looking to hire bankers who have been a part of large deals"" said Pramod Menon group chief financial officer at RPG Enterprises. ""Large companies can offer them a more stable ecosystem empowerment for decision-making decent salary and a reasonably large canvas while on the banking side the burnout is much more."""

Of course terms such as ‚Äúliteralism‚Äù and certainly ‚Äúfundamentalism‚Äù have their origins in certain debates within American Protestantism but that doesn‚Äôt stop people from applying them to Orthodox Judaism. Such usage has always bemused me since a major tenet of rabbinic Judaism is that the Bible is not to be taken literally. Ancient and early medieval rabbis quite consciously saw this as what distinguished them from rival Jewish sects.

That might surprise some readers but one need not know much about Judaism to know that it is true. Two examples will suffice: the Talmud and other contemporary works insist that the lex talionis‚Äî‚Äúan eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth . . .‚Äù‚Äîrefers to monetary compensation. Nobody‚Äôs eye should be gouged out; rather like American courts today rabbinic judges were supposed to assess the cost to the plaintiff of the injury through a set of formulas and compel the tortfeasor to pay accordingly.

A second example is the biblical injunction ‚ÄúThou shalt not cook a kid in its mother‚Äôs milk.‚Äù Straightforward though it sounds the rabbis take this to prohibit any consumption of meat and milk together (even if they come from different species let alone unrelated animals) to mandate the use of separate dishes for meat and dairy and so forth. This is hardly the sort of reading that liberal Protestant theologians who reject literalism would come up with but it is by no means a literal interpretation. When it comes to more arcane cases of sacrificial ritual the talmudic rabbis are quite explicit that their readings differ from the more literal interpretations of the Sadducees‚Äîand record intense strife over these issues.

Why this is so and how the rabbis justified their sometimes radical readings of Scripture are worthy questions but I‚Äôd like to focus on the questions that bothered me when I was a college student drawn to Orthodox Judaism and have stuck with me since. What is an intellectually sophisticated believer supposed to think about the Bible‚Äôs depiction of the Garden of Eden? Could they be taken as allegory? Are they true in a more concrete sense? And most importantly were there answers to these questions that I found both satisfactory and intellectually honest? And could I really become committed to a religion if it did not have such answers?

I first started making some headway on these questions when my embrace of Orthodoxy led me to spend a year (the first of several) in yeshiva. We were studying the opening chapters of Genesis and someone asked the rabbi if the Garden of Eden was a real place. The rabbi didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúYes of course‚Äù but instead answered the question by showing us a passage from the writings of Rabbi Moses ·∏§ayyim Luzzatto known in rabbinic circles by the acronym Ram·∏•al.

Only much later would I learn that Luzzatto was one of the most interesting and controversial figures in 18th-century Jewish thought. He received a robust humanistic education in his native Padua as well as a thorough rabbinic one and authored plays and poetry in Hebrew along with extensive writings on kabbalah. In the wake of the disastrous career of Shabbetai Tsvi the failed messiah whose antinomian mysticism and eventual conversion to Islam shook the foundations of 17th-century Jewry Luzzatto‚Äôs kabbalistic speculation fueled suspicion that he was a heretic as well. The Italian Jewish community eventually forced him out of the country and he ultimately settled in the Land of Israel where he died in 1746 or 47.

Since then the controversies concerning Luzzatto faded and his work became part of the canon of thinkers venerated and studied in the world of the yeshiva. At the time I was simply aware of him as the author of The Path of the Just a guide to personal spiritual development today known to every yeshiva student and often read in preparation for the High Holy Days.

The passage the rabbi showed us regarding the Garden came from another book Da‚Äôat T‚Äôvunot a title usually translated as ‚ÄúThe Knowing Heart.‚Äù Drawing more deeply on mystical influences it is a dialogue between the soul and the intellect that covers a number of key issues in Jewish thought such as the problem of evil. Here is my translation:

This is the general idea of the two trees the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. Certainly Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning: the trees were trees the fruits were fruits and the eating was eating. But the fruits were ethereal [dakim literally ‚Äúthin‚Äù] and the eating was ethereal [dak] in a way that our thoughts cannot conceive because they can only conceive of corporeal things.

For Luzzatto the trees in the Garden of Eden were real but they were not physical. What‚Äôs most surprising about this very non-literal reading is that he justifies it with the rabbinic principle ‚ÄúScripture does not depart from its plain meaning.‚Äù To make sense of Luzzatto‚Äôs invocation of this principle we must unpack the operative term namely p‚Äôshat or ‚Äúplain meaning‚Äù and try to understand its history. Deriving from the word meaning ‚Äúsimple‚Äù or ‚Äúlaid bare‚Äù it is traditionally contrasted with d‚Äôrash (from the word meaning ‚Äúto seek‚Äù) or exegetical reading‚Äîthe sort of interpretation that gives us separate pots for meat and dairy and the vast corpus of narrative elaborations on the scriptural text known as midrash.

The golden age of d‚Äôrash was the talmudic and post-talmudic era from about 100 to 600 CE during which rabbis used the text as a springboard for their daring interpretations. What is curious is that serious interest in p‚Äôshat came later. Between about 900 and 1300 CE rabbis began focusing on basic questions about the meaning of words the parsing of unclear sentences and so forth developing more literal alternatives to what they found in Talmud and midrash. The greatest exemplar of this period was Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac or Rashi (France 1040-1105) who drew heavily on the traditions of d‚Äôrash but made a point of presenting the p‚Äôshat alongside it when he saw the two as deviating. His successors the Spanish exegete Abraham Ibn Ezra and his own grandson Shmuel ben Meir assailed him for straying too far from the p‚Äôshat to which they sought to adhere carefully even when it led them to readings that ran counter to standard rabbinic interpretations. And then there was Moses Maimonides writing in 12th-century Egypt who was deeply troubled by those scriptural passages that when read literally depicted God in anthropomorphic terms‚Äîwhich to him was philosophically unacceptable. He thus devoted many chapters of his Guide of the Perplexed to explaining why such phrases as ‚Äúthe hand of God‚Äù must be read as metaphors.

But before this p‚Äôshat revolution during rabbinic Judaism‚Äôs formative centuries Jewish exegetes did not focus on finding Scripture‚Äôs literal meaning. Mordechai Cohen a professor of Bible at Yeshiva University argues in his recent book The Rule of Peshat that this new approach to reading sacred texts was a response to specific intellectual challenges to Judaism:

Although the notion of p‚Äôshat solidiÔ¨Åed late in the Middle Ages acquiring connotations that it would retain well into the modern era the formative period from the 10th to the 13th centuries produced a number of p‚Äôshat models that responded in varied ways to Muslim and Christian interpretation of Scripture. The medieval quest to define the ‚Äúp‚Äôshat of Scripture‚Äù was not simply about what the sacred text ‚Äúreally says‚Äù; it was rather a medium through which readers in diverse cultural contexts encountered and made sense of Scripture intellectually and religiously.

Against this backdrop Luzzatto seems to pull the text in two contradictory directions. He embraces the supremacy of p‚Äôshat and writes that Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning. The trees were trees and the fruit was fruit. But then he pivots and says they were not physical trees. In what way is this not a departure from the plain sense?

Let me answer this question with a story. There were once two rabbis debating who was the greatest scholar in their generation. A simple man overheard the conversation and chimed in with a way to resolve the debate: weigh them both on a scale and whoever weighs more is bigger.

In other words a description like ‚Äúthis rabbi is big‚Äù could be talking about physical size or intellectual achievement. In Hebrew then as now the same word means both ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and ‚Äúbig‚Äù so that a rabbi of outstanding erudition would be described as a ·∏•akham gadol a big sage. In using the word ‚Äúbig‚Äù to describe something like character or intelligence we are borrowing the physical concept of ‚Äúbigness‚Äù to communicate an abstract quality. The same word can be used in very different contexts because we sense at some intuitive level a connection between the physical and nonphysical uses of the word.

Luzzatto is saying that the same is true for a word like ‚Äútree.‚Äù It can refer to a physical tree and a nonphysical tree. Our only way of understanding the nature of a nonphysical tree is to look closely at a physical one and try to understand its essential qualities. Armed with some understanding of what the essence of a tree is and what the essence of eating is we can use those reflections to make sense of what the Torah is trying to tell us.

But why is Luzzatto who seems to be pushing for an allegorical interpretation using the talmudic phrase that became the slogan of the medieval partisans of p‚Äôshat? It would be one thing if Luzzatto were saying that in addition to real physical trees the Torah is also talking about spiritual trees. Then we could say the plain meaning of the text refers to physical trees and on another level of interpretation the text is also referring to spiritual trees. But he seems to be saying the Torah is only talking about spiritual trees and that he‚Äôs adhering to the p‚Äôshat.

Luzzatto is in fact telling us something not just about the Garden of Eden but also about the parameters of the ‚Äúplain meaning‚Äù of the text. Much as you could never hope to make sense of a newspaper article or legal contract or historical document by taking the words out of context so too any word or phrase in Scripture must be read in its own context. Put differently the plain meaning of Genesis 2 and 3 to Luzzatto refers not to literal trees but incorporeal ones.

By insisting that his reading is p‚Äôshat Luzzatto is trying to make clear that these trees may be metaphysical but they are not allegorical. An allegorical reading of the Garden of Eden story would see the trees as a tool for communicating a set of ideas and nothing more. Take for example George Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm: if someone reads it and then asks if he can visit the farm today we would rightly say that he missed the point. The farm is simply the setting of an allegory meant to convey a set of ideas about politics. If the Garden of Eden were this kind of allegory asking if it were a real place would make as much sense as asking to visit the farm where Animal Farm happened.

The difference is subtle but important. Luzzatto certainly believes that the story is communicating ideas‚Äîhe goes on to say that ingesting the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge caused man to internalize a new perspective on reality‚Äîbut not as allegory. His radical and highly unintuitive reading depends on his peculiar metaphysics which posit the existence of incorporeal trees and fruits that are every bit as real as the corporeal kind. They are not mere symbols even if they are a kind of analogue for phenomena that don‚Äôt fit into our everyday experience. Another way to put this is with the talmudic dictum ‚ÄúThe Torah speaks in the language of man.‚Äù The text according to Luzzatto describes the experiences of Adam and Eve in everyday terms to make them understood.

Luzzatto is thus adhering to the general principles of the talmudic rabbis who firmly rejected the allegorical approach to Scripture of Jews like the Hellenistic philosopher Philo of Alexandria and some early Christian thinkers‚Äîan approach that shares much with the allegorical readings of Plato and other ancient texts by pagan philosophers of the era. In all the rich expanse of its midrashic readings the Talmud never tries to reduce the Tanakh to mere abstractions.

Where does this leave us 21st-century Jews trying to make sense of our sacred text? To borrow and slightly adjust Leon Kass‚Äôs elegant formulation from The Beginning of Wisdom the first chapters of Genesis are not about what happened so much as they are about what is always happening in the metaphysical spiritual and moral dimensions of human life.

Addressing the problems of the relationship between Genesis and modern knowledge of science and history‚Äîas vexing to us now as whatever philosophical questions vexed Maimonides or Luzzatto‚ÄîKass one of the most insightful Bible interpreters today writes:

[I]f the major intention of the first chapter is not historical but ontological ethical and theological Genesis is not the sort of book that can be refuted‚Äîor affirmed‚Äîon the basis of scientific or historical evidence. This is I repeat not because it is myth or poetry but rather because its truths are metaphysical and ethical not scientific or historical because it teaches mainly about the status and human meaning of what is rather than about the mechanism by which things work or came to be.

Kass favors a form of p‚Äôshat that is very different from strict literalism. The advantage of reading Scripture this way is that it makes it possible to approach the text with maximum seriousness‚Äîeach word is true and real‚Äîbut to avoid getting bogged down in the often futile attempts to read modern scientific knowledge back into the text. To me especially in my youthful searching for my place in Judaism it always seemed easier to unwind the Torah from science than to try to weave them together in the text itself.

Both Luzzatto and Kass like their numerous predecessors wish neither to reduce the Torah‚Äôs stories to fairy tales or myths nor to read them as absurdities through obsessive literalism like the village atheist who discovers that Jonah was swallowed by ‚Äúa big fish‚Äù and is excited to point out that a whale is in fact a mammal.

This brings us back to Mordechai Cohen‚Äôs observation that what he calls ‚Äúthe medieval quest‚Äù to find Scripture‚Äôs p‚Äôshat wasn‚Äôt about what the text ‚Äúreally‚Äù said but about how readers ‚Äúmade sense of Scripture intellectually and religiously.‚Äù This is as true for us today as it was in the Middle Ages.

Yet this quest can only be fully understood in relation to its motivations and here it‚Äôs worth citing Luzzatto‚Äôs much better-known work The Path of the Just:

We notice at all periods and at all times between all lovers and friends‚Äîbetween a man and his wife between a father and his son in fine between all those who are bound with a love which is truly strong‚Äîthat the lover will not say ‚ÄúI have not been commanded further. What I have been told to do explicitly is enough for me.‚Äù He will rather attempt by analyzing the commands to arrive at the intention of the commander and to do what he judges will give him pleasure. The same holds true for one who strongly loves his Creator for he too is one of the class of lovers.

Luzzatto‚Äôs uses of the word ‚Äúcommanded‚Äù in a comparison to a conversation between lovers may jar us. But like Isaiah and Hosea he understands the relationship between God and His people as a romantic one and his point is that lovers are never satisfied with a purely concrete understanding of each other‚Äôs words. They always seek the unspoken. Looking at the vast edifice of legal and ethical rabbinic commentary stretching from the Talmud to our own day it is easy to lose the forest for the trees (including the metaphysical ones). We are prone to forget that we are looking for God between the lines of all of our interpretive efforts.

The amount of water available on earth always stays the same it‚Äôs the availability of water that changes. In Bangladesh small villages use packs of pills distributed by NGOs to purify pond water and make it drinkable. In Pacific Island countries expensive desalination plants transform sea water into fresh water. Ultimately we can imagine a future where water can be extracted from anywhere in an economical fashion. Until then investing in water infrastructure seems like a compelling growth thesis.

Desalination is an attractive investment thesis but there aren‚Äôt many pure-play desalination stocks out there. In fact there aren‚Äôt many good ways to invest in water period. That‚Äôs why Xylem (XYL) stood out when we last covered them in a piece titled Investing in Smart Water Technology with Xylem.

Revisiting Xylem Stock

Xylem has been spending big bucks over the years to solidify its place in smart water technology while offering retail investors some interesting exposure to water scarcity and the Internet of Things (IoT).

What‚Äôs more the companies that went public in 2022 raised about 5% of the proceeds from the same date last year. Although forecasts speak of about 25 to 45 more IPOs to be carried out until year-end 2022 is still expected to be the weakest in terms of IPO proceeds in more than 30 years.

However the decline in IPOs and numbers this year seem less striking considering that 2021 was the busiest IPO year ever by both the number of IPOs and the amounts raised.

Looking back there‚Äôs no doubt that 2021‚Äôs IPO surge was nothing less than a bubble. With extraordinary liquidity sloshing around the markets following the Fed‚Äôs monetary easing in 2020 as well as with all the checks from the U.S. government is it any wonder that much of this ‚Äúfree money‚Äù found its way into the stock market?

This year IPOs have all but collapsed due to the economic downturn the Fed‚Äôs tightening and instability in the markets - but the heights they reached in 2021 make the downfall much more painful bringing vivid reminiscence of the burst of the dot-com bubble. Also it‚Äôs possible that a few years from now we‚Äôll talk about 2022 in terms of ‚Äúthe burst of the cash-injection bubble.‚Äù

The Four Most Dangerous Words in Investing: ‚ÄúThis Time is Different‚Äù

Now firms that were late to the party are paying the price as IPOs dry out. Companies are forced to either cancel their initial offerings or accept much lower valuations. On the other hand many investors that bought the IPO buzz in 2020 and 2021 are now wishing they didn‚Äôt. The shoppers of these blockbuster IPOs are now saddled with big losses.

To tell the truth the IPO bubble that has just burst in front of our eyes was long in the making; 2021 just took everything to extremes. In the 20th century and for a short while in the 21st companies were expected to have a proven business model and show shrinking losses if not profits at their IPOs - but that expectation no longer exists.

In the modern era it‚Äôs perfectly normal for unprofitable companies to IPO based on their future earnings. However the fact that the percentage of loss-making IPOs rose from 20% in 2009 to 70%-80% in 2020 and 2021 is somewhat unnerving. Even more disturbing is the colossal valuations at which unprofitable businesses go public.

Many money managers and analysts called for caution in vain. ‚ÄúThis time is different‚Äù used to be a warning but in 2020 it became a common belief. The thinking was that unlike in 1999 this time the tech companies going public do have great products and services that everyone uses; they aren‚Äôt just selling dreams. That might have been the case but as we now see the skyrocketing valuations at which these companies sold to the public were based on nothing but the low cost of capital i.e. interest rates at zero.

Of course investors should have been more careful; they shouldn‚Äôt have ditched common sense and should have looked into the companies‚Äô fundamentals. However most of the blame is on the preachers of the ‚Äúthis time is different‚Äù mantra. Countless articles TV hosts and financial pages informed investors that companies that go public these days are different from those in the past; and that investors should be patient with biotech or EV startups.

Investors were also told that ‚Äúprofitability is a choice‚Äù and that shareholders should sacrifice their current returns for aggressive expansion that will - someday - bring them huge profits.

The general public‚Äôs free money euphoria made retail investors easy prey for the professionals who surely knew they were feeding the bubble with Main Street‚Äôs money. However private investors‚Äô greed was kindled by unrealistic promises of high future growth enabling bankers and the companies going public to get even more greedy. At the end of the day sky-high IPO valuations allowed everyone involved - the companies the private investors and the underwriting banks - to make much more money. It's too bad that this money was made at the expense of private investors.

Case Study: Rivian Automotive‚Äôs IPO

Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) the world's biggest initial public offering of last year and the sixth biggest in U.S. history priced 153 million shares at $78 a share on November 9 2021. After the listing Rivian‚Äôs shares started trading to the general public at $106 giving the company a market value of more than $100 billion - more than the value of established automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) or Ford (NYSE: F). The shares even briefly climbed above $172 - and then declined and have done so ever since.

RIVN's surge wasn‚Äôt backed by profits or even revenues as the company had just started making sales and was having trouble keeping up with its production schedule. Why did investors agree to pay such a hefty price for a stock of a revenue-less company? In short the answer is hype fads and easy money looking for a home.

EV companies have emerged as some of the hottest investments in the few years before the current sell-off. Together with other ‚Äúgreen‚Äù themes they were pushed to the public as the way to certain profits on the back of the climate agenda. Various Wall Street gurus preached a bright future for the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù companies leading many retail investors to believe that reading the companies‚Äô financial reports is redundant. One of the biggest backers of Rivian at the time of its IPO was BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) now enmeshed in a scandal concerning another ‚Äúgreen‚Äù theme sustainable investing.

Now RIVN trades at around $39 which means that investors who bought Rivian‚Äôs shares in the days after the IPO are saddled with large losses; those that gave in to the FOMO and bought at the top are now down almost 80%. To get back their losses they‚Äôd need Rivian‚Äôs stock to rise over 360% from the current levels - which is of course possible but not really plausible.

The Biggest IPOs of 2020 and 2021: Where are They Now?

The biggest IPOs of 2020 included Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) and others. Let‚Äôs have a quick look at their performance since then concentrating on regular (non-SPAC) IPOs:

*Current Price as of September 12 2022

The 2020 IPO surge was just the beginning as we now know. 2021 brought much more hype and out-of-this-world valuations. Many of these stocks started trading publicly at the high losing value ever since which hints that even at the time of their IPO amid the bubble investors realized that their share price was highly overvalued.

As a result investors who bought into the 10 biggest IPOs of 2021 lost 43% of their money by now (average loss per stock). Meanwhile those who were unwise enough to enter these stocks at their highs lost 65% on average:

*Current Price as of September 12 2022

It‚Äôs not something unheard of for a company going public to see a decline in their share prices after an IPO however successful. Still the sheer amount of losses and the huge percentage of losers in the 2021 IPO group tells us a lot about the psychotic state of the markets last year.

Of course among 2020 and 2021 IPO graduates there are companies with solid business models and a proven ability to generate revenues (if not profits). It‚Äôs just that when there‚Äôs a bubble everyone gets sucked in. When the valuations are based on hype and greed instead of fundamentals and realistic assumptions they reflect overblown growth expectations and lead to hefty losses.

The Near Future of IPOs Looks Much Bleaker

On top of stock market losses this bubble burst will have long-lasting impacts on the IPO market and all the players involved. As the dot-com bubble burst burned a lot of investors and reduced the capital available for the IPOs in the following years this time is not going to be different. In recent years valuations have outrun the fundamentals by an outsized margin - and now it‚Äôs their time to run below the regression line in order to meet the laws of statistics (and common sense).

So in the near future companies that will have successful IPOs should be profitable and fairly large industry leaders. The ‚Äúgrowth at all costs‚Äù era is over; it‚Äôs now ‚Äúsafety time.‚Äù

Netflix recently debuted a new documentary about personal finance aptly titled ""Get Smart With Money"" directed by Stephanie Soechtig. Over the course of 90 minutes we follow four stories about people struggling with different money issues ‚Äî debt living paycheck-to-paycheck lack of income and not knowing how to invest and rising expenses while trying to pursue early retirement (FIRE).

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The four main characters are paired with a financial coach ‚Äî Paula Pant from Afford Anything Ro$$ Mac Tiffany ""The Budgetnista"" Aliche and Pete Adeney who is often referred to by his moniker Mr. Money Mustache.

Aside from being a good watch ""Get Smart with Money"" shares six smart lessons anyone can use to improve their finances.

1. A high income doesn't mean much if you don't know how to save and invest

Everyone dreams of earning a ton of money. That was the case for Teez who says he knew that one way he could earn a lot was through football. Reaching success at the early age of 21 the film states he originally earned $1.6 million. That number quickly went down after paying taxes buying a home for his family and one for his mom and taking various trips.

When Teez meets with coach Ro$$ Mac he has approximately $280000 left of his original sum. Teez doesn't have money invested for the future and is worried about the longevity and stability of his career and providing for his family.

Watching this story it's clear that high earnings are not the only goal and route to financial success. Keeping those funds and putting them to work for your future is key. Ro$$ Mac teaches Teez about opening a brokerage account and investing in the stock market.

2. Your circumstances can change at any time

When you make good money it's easy to think it'll always be that way. But through Teez's story we hear about how he made good money through football but then got released and then injured. Suddenly he had nothing coming in.

Hence the sense of urgency with making the remaining $280000 last as long as possible. No one likes to think about the next job loss or health scare that can drastically impact one's finances. But it's something we should all be prepared for just in case.

Not having money coming in is a scary reality for everyone with different degrees of difficulty. An emergency fund and disability insurance can help shore up your personal finances and ensure you're able to weather this kind of storm.

But just as your circumstances can change for the worse they can eventually change for the better. We see Teez eventually get to play football again and earn an income.

3. Paying off debt can change your future

Debt is a monthly payment that can keep you in the past. But paying off debt can change your future too. In the documentary we meet Ariana who identifies as an emotional spender and admits to being afraid of money.

She recalls growing up and having parents who taught her ""we deserve this"" whenever they spent money. That mentality led to spending more than she could sustain.

Ariana is in credit card debt and has over six figures in student loan debt. We see the shame and guilt erupt on her face as she tries to cope with paying off debt while raising two children. She mentions how her husband covers the bills and works overtime so half of her income ‚Äî $2000 ‚Äî can go toward monthly debt payments.

At one point Ariana describes taking out a personal loan to pay off credit cards. But once those limits were freed up she got back into the debt cycle.

Tiffany Aliche AKA The Budgetnista works with Ariana to come up with a plan to divide her check and budget for all her obligations through automation.

On top of that The Budgetnista shares a rubric of questions to help rein in Ariana's spending:

Do I need it?

Do I love it?

Do I like it?

Do I want it?

Ideally we want to focus on ""needs"" and ""loves."" Throughout the documentary we see how much Ariana wants to change her financial situation not for herself but for her family. Not working all the time limiting stress and going on vacation ‚Äî one of the dreams she shared with Tiffany when thinking about what she'd love to do with her money. It's clear that paying off debt can change her future.

4. Starting a small business can help lower-wage workers

We meet Lindsey who is living paycheck-to-paycheck despite working 50 hours a week with two jobs. As a bartender/waitress her wages simply don't cut it. Her food spending on takeout is also high because she's tired from working so much and being in the food industry.

One poignant part of her story is not having the necessary health insurance coverage to treat her depression and anxiety.

When she meets with coach Paula Pant she shares that she wants to break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and pursue her dreams as an artist. Paula encourages her to get some gigs together ASAP through dog-walking and pursue her art in the long term.

One brilliant idea that would allow Lindsey to do both was for Lindsey to sit in a park and sketch a dog and give the portrait to the owner with her contact info on the back for dog-walking.

As her journey progresses we see her earn more money through her art and dog-walking. She even starts selling prints of her paintings ‚Äî something that Paula refers to as ""scalable"" as the painting was created once but Lindsey can sell the prints over and over again.

For low-wage workers self-employment is one way to break through the ceiling. We see that in Lindsey's story and it's something I resonated with as well. I left my nonprofit job earning $31000 per year in 2014 to be a freelance writer. In the next year I doubled my income and was able to pay off my student loan debt thanks to having a higher income which has grown since.

5. Earning more can mean spending more

""Get Smart with Money"" follows John and Kim a married couple with two children. After becoming unemployed during the pandemic John transitioned to being a stay-at-home parent ‚Äî and both John and Kim are adjusting to their new roles and financial reality.

While John takes care of the children and household duties a refreshing perspective rarely caught on screen we see Kim earning good money through her business. She earned $70000 just a few years ago and was on target to hit $300000.

These are classic high-income earners by many standards but as we see in the documentary the couple admits to earning more and then spending more. There's a hefty food budget and lots of Amazon purchases and the couple admits to using spending as a reward or to manage stress.

Lifestyle inflation can be natural but unchecked and too much can cause misalignment. Mr. Money Mustaches tells the couple that we all have a ""Purchase Justification Machine"" where our brains will do the mental gymnastics to justify whatever purchase our heart desires.

The couple set their sights on early retirement and with the help of Mr. Money Mustache cut $3000 per month in expenses.

6. Pursuing FIRE can mean making moves literally

John and Kim took the first step by cutting their expenses by a significant amount. But they realized that with their lifestyle and desire to pursue FIRE they needed to make more moves. As in actually moving.

We see the couple downsize their home to lower housing costs and turbocharge their investments.

Moving is expensive and not something everyone can do. But if it's possible downsizing homes or moving to an affordable location can significantly lower costs. For this couple that was the right step in order to get closer to FIRE and in turn have more flexibility with life and work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LXJlbGVhc2VzLWlmLW9ubHktb24tb2N0b2Jlci0yOHRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix releases If Only on October 28th,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-releases-if-only-on-october-28th on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LXJlbGVhc2VzLWlmLW9ubHktb24tb2N0b2Jlci0yOHRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV0ZmxpeC1iZXN0LXNob3dzLWZlbWFsZS1jcmVhdG9yc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best TV shows created by women currently streaming on Netflix,"Lily Tomlin in ""Grace and Frankie"" Sandra Oh in ""The Chair"" and Natasha Lyonne in ""Russian Doll""

Gender parity in Hollywood still has a long way to go baby but while we wait for the industry to get their collective crap together what we choose to watch speaks volumes. We‚Äôve combed through Netflix‚Äôs streaming sprawl to find the best television shows and limited series from female creators for you to enjoy.

What each of the shows on this stacked list of Netflix heavy hitters has in common is that they were all written directed created or produced by a woman and frankly? That‚Äôs nothing to sniff at these days. This group covers everything from the award-winning to the comforting the heart-wrenching to the absurd ‚Äî and every single one of them is at the top of its game.

Women are great. TV is great. TV made by women is great. No further questions your honor!

1. Grace and Frankie

After their husbands and long-term business partners announce they‚Äôve been secretly in love for decades high-strung Grace (Jane Fonda) and crunchy hippie Frankie (Lily Tomlin) are forced into an unlikely friendship and roommate-ship when the only place they have left to live is the La Jolla beach house their families co-own. This is The Odd Couple for the modern era a comedy that insists that everyone no matter their age can have their fair share of high jinks. (Wait until you get to the episodes about trying to use vibrators with arthritis.)

It‚Äôs a deeply charming zany and lovable show with a stellar cast featuring Sam Waterston Martin Sheen Brooklyn Decker Ethan Embry June Diane Raphael and Baron Vaughn. Created by Marta Kauffman (co-creator of Friends!) and Howard J. Morris Grace and Frankie is a perfect comfort watch that will leave you feeling like you should give your best friend a call.

2. Bridgerton

Where to begin with the scandalous sexy and silly sensation that is Bridgerton? In this period dramedy Regency-era Londoners look for love under the critical eye of the Queen and a host of courtiers while dodging scandal at every turn. It's Gossip Girl meets Downton Abbey with a How To Get Away with Murder-type twist that's undeniably Shonda Rhimes . You're going to love it so much so that you should plan on bingeing this one straight-through. ‚Äî * Alison Foreman Entertainment Reporter

3. Maid

Created by Molly Smith Metzler and adapted from Stephanie Land‚Äôs bestselling memoir Maid: Hard Work Low Pay and a Mother's Will to Survive Maid is an absolute gut punch that will likely make you cry more than once. Margaret Qualley is excellent as Alex a young woman struggling to leave an abusive relationship while continuing to care for toddler daughter; she‚Äôs paired with her real-life mother Andie McDowell who is fantastic as Alex‚Äôs well-meaning but unreliable mom.

We follow Alex‚Äôs agonizing journey from navigating a women‚Äôs shelter to facing the baffling catch-22‚Äôs of the American welfare system (she can‚Äôt get state-sponsored child care without a job but she can‚Äôt get a job without child care) and more. It‚Äôs a powerful meditation on perseverance as well as a brutal examination of how incredibly short the United States falls in supporting those struggling to survive.

4. The Baby-Sitters Club

Warm funny and unapologetically optimistic this 2020 adaptation of the hugely popular Ann M. Martin YA book series is a superb watch for audiences of all ages. A group of preteen girls each with their own distinctive personality fashion sense and set of familial issues band together to start a baby-sitting club in their neighborhood. The friendships are strong the stories are relatable and the life lessons are surprisingly sophisticated. The Baby-Sitters Club is the smart but sweet show that celebrates girlhood in all of its many forms one we wish we had when we were younger ‚Äî but we‚Äôll settle for it well into our adulthood thank you very much.

5. GLOW

It‚Äôs the Gooorgeous Ladies of Wrestling! Created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch GLOW is one of those shows that makes you smile just thinking of it. A masterful blend of rage-fueled ‚Äò80s feminism and timeless comedic beats this half-hour dramedy delivers everything you could want in great TV each and every episode throughout its three seasons. Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin lead an unparalleled ensemble in a journey we‚Äôll never be ready to see end. Here‚Äôs lookin‚Äô at you Season 4. ‚Äî * A.F.

12. Jane the Virgin

Jane is a young woman in Miami who is deeply in love with her sweet loyal boyfriend and also well it‚Äôs there in the title a virgin so naturally she was pretty confused when she found out she was accidentally artificially inseminated during a routine gynecological visit.

Nothing hits quite like a Tina Fey show with its laugh-a-minute scripts heightened realities and absurdist humor.

Dr Iddrisu Yahaha said scientists have been developing improved seed varieties climate resilient and high-yielding varieties as well as other technologies in the sector but that farmers were reluctant in accepting and using those varieties.

an Agricultural Economist at the Wa office of the CSIR-SARI said this during a field demonstration exercise in Wa to introduce some field trials of crops to farmers as well as students.

The trial which included soybean omission trial involving lime inoculants and phosphorus and sorghum inter-cropping among others had funding support from the Soybeans Innovation Lab a USAID supported project.

Dr Yahaya explained that the crop trials were to help improve the soybeans‚Äô yield to international standards as well as to devise cost-efficient ways of pest control to help mitigate the challenges farmers were facing regarding pest control and crop yield.

‚ÄúOur problem with agriculture in the Upper West Region is the inability of farmers to adopt improved technology‚Äù Dr. Yahaha who is also the Head of Department (HoD) at the SARI office in Wa observed.

The Agricultural Economist indicated that though it would be expensive for a peasant farmer to adopt all the technologies developed adopting at least one technology could still help improve the farmer‚Äôs productivity.

He stressed the need for effective media collaboration with SARI to inform the farmers about the available agricultural technologies and to educate them on appropriate farming techniques to help increase their productivity to reduce poverty.

Dr Peter Quandahor an Entomologist with the CSIR-SARI office in Wa noted that ‚ÄúClimate change had become a major problem globally and unfortunately the area affected most was agriculture.

‚ÄúThe effects of climate change on agriculture could result in lower crop yields and nutritional quality due to drought as well as increases in pests‚Äù he added.

He explained that drought was one of the major challenges facing crop production with about 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs agricultural land found in arid or semi-arid regions.

Dr Quandahor added that studies showed that an increase in drought severity resulted in increasing populations of insect pests and altered the impact of insect pests on plants.

He therefore said scientists were developing crop varieties that could withstand the negative impact of climate change and implored farmers to adopt those improved crop varieties for their benefit.

‚ÄúIt is difficult for farmers to adapt to innovation. They are always used to the conventional approach to crop production‚Äù he said.

Some of the farmers who participated in the demonstration exercise were satisfied with the trials that were ongoing and said the success of those trials would help reduce the challenges farmers were going through especially in the area of pest control.

They said farming was all about effective pest control and application of inputs and expressed hope that if there were interventions that could reduce their cost in that it would be a gain to the farmers.

Mr Karim Alhassan a participant told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in an interview that ‚ÄúIf it (the trial) works it will be very good for the farmers because it will reduce our cost of buying inputs.‚Äù

‚ÄúControlling pests on the farm is also very expensive so if a method like this (inter-cropping) can help to repel some of the pests then it will reduce our cost of buying pesticide which the cost is rising every day‚Äù he added.

The soybeans trial was also done in the Northern and Upper East Regions as well as other West African countries including Cameroon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After a third of veterans report being arrested a new effort to understand why

After close to a decade serving in the Marine Corps Ron Self could knot a rope that was strong enough to drag military vehicles across combat zones in Africa. But serving time in a prison cell years later he couldn't get the bedsheets he'd tied together to hold.

""When I attempted to hang myself and the rope broke and I was on my knees and I realized immediately this is not -- this was not -- the solution"" he told ABC News.

After more than a decade of incarceration for a freeway shooting Self said he was still processing the anger and shame of his arrest.

He is not alone: One-third of veterans say they have been arrested according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice citing a 2017 study focused on military service and crime.

""When you separate and you're no longer part of something that's bigger than anything you've ever been a part of your entire life -- which is military service -- and you don't have that camaraderie anymore it can take a definitely a dark turn"" Self said.

That's what happened to him he said: Self was a decorated Marine awarded for his bravery in a helicopter crash in South Korea by the time he was being medically discharged in the '90s. But he said he felt increasingly unstable and estranged from civilian life. Which he thinks is why in part he agreed to be a hired gun and attempt to take someone's life during their commute to work.

""I was laying in the back of a truck in a sniper hole built into this truck"" Self remembers of the 1994 incident in which he armed himself on the freeway with a sniper rifle. ""I was looking at him [the victim] through the crosshairs of the telescope on the rifle and I remember thinking how easy that would be to just do that and then take the off-ramp and go.""

Instead Self said he aimed for the lower-right corner of the car windshield and shot two rounds several seconds apart in what he says was an attempt to avoid taking the man's life.

""My intent was to make it public so that [the person who wanted him killed] couldn't do it with someone else when this failed"" Self said.

He can still remember the reaction of a woman in a nearby car.

""The terror on her face from that windshield exploding and the gunshots -- that terror is something I've only ever seen in combat"" he said. ""The difference was we were there to stop the people causing it and in that moment it was me ‚Ä¶ I can't even articulate how that hit me psychologically.""

The driver behind the shot-through windshield was injured but alive. Self was later arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit murder attempted murder and firing a weapon within city limits.

""The fact that I did what I did I think at a subconscious level was me removing myself from society because I felt I didn't belong in society"" he said.

Self was convicted and initially sentenced to 32 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole.

After attempting to kill himself while incarcerated he decided that he couldn't let other former service members experience the same anguish.

""The solution would be a program that would help other veterans not make the poor choices I did"" he said.

While in prison Self created a peer-to-peer mentor program Veterans Healing Veterans from the Inside Out to support other former service members navigating incarceration past trauma and suicidal ideation.

He was later able to successfully argue in a parole hearing that he was attempting to avoid taking anyone's life on the freeway and was released from prison in 2017 after serving 23 years.

The former Marine recently joined the Council on Criminal Justice as an inaugural member of the Veterans Justice Commission which launched last month.

Self will work alongside two former defense secretaries Chuck Hagel and Leon Panetta as a part of a 15-member body investigating veteran arrest rates. The two-year long commission will also make policy recommendations to better support former service members.

""There's been an injustice suffered here"" Hagel told ABC adding ""no one's paid attention.""

He believes the council provides ""a strength a position a structure that we can work within and we can work on to attract some of the best minds in the country on this issue.""

""We need to do a better job"" he said of society supporting veterans returning from war. ""And it's not good enough to just say well we can do more. With this commission hopefully what we can do is we can be specific.""

The commission recognizes more than 181500 veterans in prison or jails across the U.S. citing the latest count estimated in 2011-2012 by the Department of Justice. According to the same data 8% of people incarcerated in local jails and state and federal prisons in the U.S. are veterans.

The majority of incarcerated veterans are sentenced for violent crimes and close to twice as many veterans are serving life sentences than their non-veterans counterparts according to the commission's report citing a 2016 survey by the DOJ.

The commission defined unique risk factors among people returning from war that make them more likely to engage in criminal activity. These factors include post-traumatic stress disorders traumatic brain injuries heightened mental health concerns more frequent substance misuse and financial insecurity.

Federal state and local programs have been established to assist incarcerated veterans. The Veterans Justice Outreach Program was launched in 2009 by the Department of Veterans Affairs to better identify incarcerated veterans and connect them to appropriate resources. While the U.S. House Committee on Veterans' Affairs references 138000 veterans served by this program over a four-year period the commission also acknowledges a pervasive lack of awareness from service members of what support systems are available to them both before and after their arrests.

When Self was being processed through his medical discharge after his military service he said he was not made aware of all of the resources available to him.

""I had no clue that I had a potentiality for service-connected benefits or actual monetary benefit"" he said. ""I had no idea about any of that.""

""I don't want to blame the military"" Self continued. ""And I'm not. And I'm not playing the victim. I own a very poor decision I made. But I also take into consideration now -- I made this decision five months after several people I served with were killed and I never processed that.""

After years in the military the Marine Corps had become his family where he said he found ""people that have basically chewed the same dirt spit the same bud.""

The chronic pain he faced that caused his eventual medical discharge from the Marines he says now was more tolerable overseas because of his relationships with his fellow service members. ""To be removed from that -- it was an absolute loss of identity.""

""It's an inappropriate cry for help"" Self said of service members committing crimes.

He recognizes his unique position as a formerly incarcerated veteran on the commission to answer those cries.

""Everyone that raised their hand to serve was trusted to carry a weapon in defense of this country. I violated that trust by doing what I did"" he said of his shooting. ""I may not ever be able to regain that level of trust. I can definitely spend the rest of my life trying to.""

Self believes the commission will be an important next step in studying the larger issue and ensuring incarcerated veterans know they are not alone or beyond correction and rehabilitation.

""We all have the ability for redemption. We all have the ability to change how we frame and view our past"" Self said of fellow service members who may have found themselves in a similar position to him. ""If we can reframe how that drives us through the rest of our lives it could be a lot more helpful to all people leaving the military and the society in which we fought for.""

The delivery giant's shares lost 21 per cent on Friday its biggest one-day percentage drop ever after the company said a macroeconomic slowdown had led to lower volumes of goods moving around the world in recent weeks The Wall Street Journal reported.

All three major US stock indexes fell Friday capping a week where the S&P 500 declined 4.8 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.1 per cent.

The chief executives at General Electric Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. also pointed this week to signs of economic troubles The Wall Street Journal reported.

GE's Larry Culp said managing supply chains remained difficult threatening to slow deliveries and push up costs; while Verizon's Hans Vestberg said there had been a pickup in customer churn or cancellations after a recent price increase.

The world's two biggest economies have been slowing this year.

In the US the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation that has been hovering near four-decade highs.

The Gross domestic product a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy fell 0.9 per cent in the second quarter and 1.6 per cent in the first three months of 2022 Wall Street Journal reported.

China released a raft of economic data on Friday including figures showing that housing price declines accelerated and consumer spending remained weak.

However infrastructure investment picked up more quickly than expected and China's labour market improved.

FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc. have confronted lower volumes of packages this year as a pandemic boom in online shopping cools.

Consumers have switched more of their spending to travel and entertainment plus high inflation has reduced the number of items being purchased.

Big retailers that are FedEx customers like Walmart Inc. have also pulled back on orders after they have been stuck with a glut of unsold goods The Wall Street Journal reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzLWd1YXJkLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2VzdGJyb29rLWxpc3RzLW1hc3NpdmUtbWFuc2lvbi1mb3ItNDQ3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los Angeles Lakers' guard Russell Westbrook lists massive mansion for $44.7m - realestate.com.au,"Los Angeles Lakers point guard Russell Westbrook has just listed his massive Los Angeles home for a jaw-dropping $29.99m (A$44.7m).

The Irishman made a 33rd-minute exit from Molineux during the 3-0 defeat after he flew studs-first into Grealish's abs leaving the forward with a nasty red mark.

And referee Anthony Taylor needed to time at all to pry open his back pocket with any hopeful thoughts of a VAR check for the home crowd comprehensively wiped out by replays.

talkSPORT commentator Sam Matterface drew an interesting comparison for the high boot likening it to Haaland‚Äôs karate-kick goal last time out.

""If you imagine the athleticism Haaland used the other night Collins has done that but not so well‚Äù he quipped.

Ex-Premier league midfielder Andy Townsend added: ""It's a ridiculous challenge.""

Grealish was clearly in pain but later recovered showing a nasty red mark where the boot had gone in.

It didn't stop the England international having one of his better games in a City shirt though scoring after just 55 seconds.

The forward snapped a run since May without a goal or an assist alleviating plenty of pressure in a week where manager Pep Guardiola was forced to defend his lack of output.

Erling Haaland and Phil Foden completed the routine victory as Wolves managed to limit the damage with ten men.

And speaking after the full-time whistle Wolves boss Bruno Lage moved to defend Collins despite leaving his team in a lurch.

He said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that Collins wanted to do that.

He is not alone: One-third of veterans say they have been arrested according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice citing a 2017 study focused on military service and crime.

""When you separate and you're no longer part of something that's bigger than anything you've ever been a part of your entire life -- which is military service -- and you don't have that camaraderie anymore it can take a definitely a dark turn"" Self said.

That's what happened to him he said: Self was a decorated Marine awarded for his bravery in a helicopter crash in South Korea by the time he was being medically discharged in the '90s. But he said he felt increasingly unstable and estranged from civilian life. Which he thinks is why in part he agreed to be a hired gun and attempt to take someone's life during their commute to work.

""I was laying in the back of a truck in a sniper hole built into this truck"" Self remembers of the 1994 incident in which he armed himself on the freeway with a sniper rifle. ""I was looking at him [the victim] through the crosshairs of the telescope on the rifle and I remember thinking how easy that would be to just do that and then take the off-ramp and go.""

Instead Self said he aimed for the lower-right corner of the car windshield and shot two rounds several seconds apart in what he says was an attempt to avoid taking the man's life.

""My intent was to make it public so that [the person who wanted him killed] couldn't do it with someone else when this failed"" Self said.

He can still remember the reaction of a woman in a nearby car.

""The terror on her face from that windshield exploding and the gunshots -- that terror is something I've only ever seen in combat"" he said. ""The difference was we were there to stop the people causing it and in that moment it was me ‚Ä¶ I can't even articulate how that hit me psychologically.""

The driver behind the shot-through windshield was injured but alive. Self was later arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit murder attempted murder and firing a weapon within city limits.

""The fact that I did what I did I think at a subconscious level was me removing myself from society because I felt I didn't belong in society"" he said.

Self was convicted and initially sentenced to 32 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole.

After attempting to kill himself while incarcerated he decided that he couldn't let other former service members experience the same anguish.

""The solution would be a program that would help other veterans not make the poor choices I did"" he said.

While in prison Self created a peer-to-peer mentor program Veterans Healing Veterans from the Inside Out to support other former service members navigating incarceration past trauma and suicidal ideation.

He was later able to successfully argue in a parole hearing that he was attempting to avoid taking anyone's life on the freeway and was released from prison in 2017 after serving 23 years.

The former Marine recently joined the Council on Criminal Justice as an inaugural member of the Veterans Justice Commission which launched last month.

Self will work alongside two former defense secretaries Chuck Hagel and Leon Panetta as a part of a 15-member body investigating veteran arrest rates. The two-year long commission will also make policy recommendations to better support former service members.

""There's been an injustice suffered here"" Hagel told ABC adding ""no one's paid attention.""

He believes the council provides ""a strength a position a structure that we can work within and we can work on to attract some of the best minds in the country on this issue.""

""We need to do a better job"" he said of society supporting veterans returning from war. ""And it's not good enough to just say well we can do more. With this commission hopefully what we can do is we can be specific.""

The commission recognizes more than 181500 veterans in prison or jails across the U.S. citing the latest count estimated in 2011-2012 by the Department of Justice. According to the same data 8% of people incarcerated in local jails and state and federal prisons in the U.S. are veterans.

The majority of incarcerated veterans are sentenced for violent crimes and close to twice as many veterans are serving life sentences than their non-veterans counterparts according to the commission's report citing a 2016 survey by the DOJ.

The commission defined unique risk factors among people returning from war that make them more likely to engage in criminal activity. These factors include post-traumatic stress disorders traumatic brain injuries heightened mental health concerns more frequent substance misuse and financial insecurity.

Federal state and local programs have been established to assist incarcerated veterans. The Veterans Justice Outreach Program was launched in 2009 by the Department of Veterans Affairs to better identify incarcerated veterans and connect them to appropriate resources. While the U.S. House Committee on Veterans' Affairs references 138000 veterans served by this program over a four-year period the commission also acknowledges a pervasive lack of awareness from service members of what support systems are available to them both before and after their arrests.

When Self was being processed through his medical discharge after his military service he said he was not made aware of all of the resources available to him.

""I had no clue that I had a potentiality for service-connected benefits or actual monetary benefit"" he said. ""I had no idea about any of that.""

""I don't want to blame the military"" Self continued. ""And I'm not. And I'm not playing the victim. I own a very poor decision I made. But I also take into consideration now -- I made this decision five months after several people I served with were killed and I never processed that.""

After years in the military the Marine Corps had become his family where he said he found ""people that have basically chewed the same dirt spit the same bud.""

The chronic pain he faced that caused his eventual medical discharge from the Marines he says now was more tolerable overseas because of his relationships with his fellow service members. ""To be removed from that -- it was an absolute loss of identity.""

""It's an inappropriate cry for help"" Self said of service members committing crimes.

He recognizes his unique position as a formerly incarcerated veteran on the commission to answer those cries.

""Everyone that raised their hand to serve was trusted to carry a weapon in defense of this country. I violated that trust by doing what I did"" he said of his shooting. ""I may not ever be able to regain that level of trust. I can definitely spend the rest of my life trying to.""

Self believes the commission will be an important next step in studying the larger issue and ensuring incarcerated veterans know they are not alone or beyond correction and rehabilitation.

""We all have the ability for redemption. We all have the ability to change how we frame and view our past"" Self said of fellow service members who may have found themselves in a similar position to him. ""If we can reframe how that drives us through the rest of our lives it could be a lot more helpful to all people leaving the military and the society in which we fought for.""

The delivery giant's shares lost 21 per cent on Friday its biggest one-day percentage drop ever after the company said a macroeconomic slowdown had led to lower volumes of goods moving around the world in recent weeks The Wall Street Journal reported.

All three major US stock indexes fell Friday capping a week where the S&P 500 declined 4.8 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.1 per cent.

The chief executives at General Electric Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. also pointed this week to signs of economic troubles The Wall Street Journal reported.

GE's Larry Culp said managing supply chains remained difficult threatening to slow deliveries and push up costs; while Verizon's Hans Vestberg said there had been a pickup in customer churn or cancellations after a recent price increase.

The world's two biggest economies have been slowing this year.

In the US the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation that has been hovering near four-decade highs.

The Gross domestic product a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy fell 0.9 per cent in the second quarter and 1.6 per cent in the first three months of 2022 Wall Street Journal reported.

China released a raft of economic data on Friday including figures showing that housing price declines accelerated and consumer spending remained weak.

However infrastructure investment picked up more quickly than expected and China's labour market improved.

FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc. have confronted lower volumes of packages this year as a pandemic boom in online shopping cools.

Consumers have switched more of their spending to travel and entertainment plus high inflation has reduced the number of items being purchased.

Big retailers that are FedEx customers like Walmart Inc. have also pulled back on orders after they have been stuck with a glut of unsold goods The Wall Street Journal reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMtbGFrZXJzLWd1YXJkLXJ1c3NlbGwtd2VzdGJyb29rLWxpc3RzLW1hc3NpdmUtbWFuc2lvbi1mb3ItNDQ3bS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los Angeles Lakers' guard Russell Westbrook lists massive mansion for $44.7m - realestate.com.au,"Los Angeles Lakers point guard Russell Westbrook has just listed his massive Los Angeles home for a jaw-dropping $29.99m (A$44.7m).

The NBA star purchased the brand-new home in Brentwood Park in 2018 for $19.75m meaning he would make more than a $10m profit on the sale in four years if he gets anywhere near his asking price.

Westbrook is known for his flashy fashion choices which have made him nearly as popular off the court as he is on so it‚Äôs no surprise to see the sprawling home outfitted with only the best designer finishes.

The huge 1250 sqm home sits on a half acre of land featuring formal living and dining rooms that have extravagant doorways hardwood flooring large windows and custom wood mouldings and trim according to Realtor.

A spacious family room on the main floor boasts warm wood flooring a wet bar and a fireplace.

Designed for entertaining the backyard features a covered patio heated pool and spa kitchen with a built-in grill and space for the kids to play.

The 33-year old has shuffled between other L.A. homes over the last few years.

After he moved into his Brentwood property the pro athlete listed his Beverly Hills mansion for just under $6m in 2019. It eventually sold for just under $4.4m in 2020.

Westbrook is a nine-time All-Star and previously played for the Washington Wizards Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder.

Westbrook joined the Lakers in 2021 to form a ‚ÄòBig 3‚Äô with LeBron James and Anthony Davis but the team failed to gel together and ultimately missed the playoffs.

Rumours have circulated throughout the NBA off-season that the Lakers have been looking to trade the 2016/17 MVP but nothing has eventuated yet.

It was so bad in fact that it was compared to Erling Haaland‚Äôs acrobatic matchwinner against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.

The Irishman made a 33rd-minute exit from Molineux during the 3-0 defeat after he flew studs-first into Grealish's abs leaving the forward with a nasty red mark.

And referee Anthony Taylor needed to time at all to pry open his back pocket with any hopeful thoughts of a VAR check for the home crowd comprehensively wiped out by replays.

talkSPORT commentator Sam Matterface drew an interesting comparison for the high boot likening it to Haaland‚Äôs karate-kick goal last time out.

""If you imagine the athleticism Haaland used the other night Collins has done that but not so well‚Äù he quipped.

Ex-Premier league midfielder Andy Townsend added: ""It's a ridiculous challenge.""

Grealish was clearly in pain but later recovered showing a nasty red mark where the boot had gone in.

It didn't stop the England international having one of his better games in a City shirt though scoring after just 55 seconds.

The forward snapped a run since May without a goal or an assist alleviating plenty of pressure in a week where manager Pep Guardiola was forced to defend his lack of output.

Erling Haaland and Phil Foden completed the routine victory as Wolves managed to limit the damage with ten men.

And speaking after the full-time whistle Wolves boss Bruno Lage moved to defend Collins despite leaving his team in a lurch.

He said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that Collins wanted to do that.

""He tried to play the ball but when you see that you need to admit that it can be yellow it can be red.

""Yesterday I saw a similar situation in the other game and nothing happened it was just a foul. Sometimes it depends on the referee.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA5LTE5L2F1c3RyYWMtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVzLXBlcnRoLW1pbnQvMTAxNDM4MTI40gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMTQzODEyOA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is Australia's financial crimes watchdog investigating the Perth Mint?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-19/austrac-investigates-perth-mint/101438128 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA5LTE5L2F1c3RyYWMtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVzLXBlcnRoLW1pbnQvMTAxNDM4MTI40gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMTQzODEyOA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The BYU-Oregon football matchup on at Autzen Stadium in Eugene is a battle of Top 25 teams and will be the feature game for FOX Sports on Saturday afternoon.

It‚Äôs also a game between two schools who eat sleep and breathe Nike.

Oregon‚Äôs ties to Nike are strong. Former Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman and former Ducks track athlete Phil Knight created the brand in 1964 as ‚ÄúBlue Ribbon Sports‚Äù using a waffle iron to make unique soles of running shoes. The company became Nike Inc. in 1971 named after the Greek goddess of victory. In 2021 the net worth of Nike was estimated at $176.27 billion worldwide. The Nike brand alone is worth in excess of $32 billion.

Oregon sometimes refers to itself as the ‚ÄúUniversity of Nike‚Äù and claims to have never worn the same football uniform twice. In 2017 the U of O and Nike reportedly agreed to an 11-year $88 million apparel contract so college football fans are going to continue to see bleeding-edge neon football uniforms on Saturdays.

The world headquarters for Nike are in Beaverton Ore. less than 90 minutes up I-5 from Eugene. The 286-acre campus has outdoor hallways adorned with bronze plaques honoring coaches and athletes from the 1990s the era when the headquarters were designed and created.

One of those plaques features former BYU coaching legend LaVell Edwards.

Edwards and Knight became good friends and BYU has certainly benefited from that relationship as one of the few non-Power Five programs designated as ‚ÄúNike Elite.‚Äù In 2019 BYU and Nike announced a seven-year apparel extension through 2026.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a better relationship in the country than the one we have with BYU‚Äù said Knight now chairman emeritus at Nike. ‚ÄúWe are very proud of it. We love the relationship and the program.‚Äù

While BYU didn‚Äôt divulge the final figures the news release indicated the agreement ‚Äúmore than doubles the annual value of the previous Nike agreement and includes annual cash compensation for BYU Athletics.‚Äù

Head coach Kalani Sitake said ‚ÄúEveryone loves the Nike brand‚Äìstudent-athletes coaches and recruits. It‚Äôs a big deal to have Nike as our partner providing our players with the best technology available in footwear apparel and equipment. Being outfitted from head-to-toe by the top brand in the world is very important to us. Nike has been an amazing partner of BYU football for more than 40 years.‚Äù

BYU Deputy Athletic Director Brian Santiago said the relationship with Nike is ‚Äúrock solid.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fortunate to be partners with the best in the business‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long-standing relationship and Nike has been awesome with us.‚Äù

Research done by Boardroom which was founded by Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman in 2019 bears out Nike‚Äôs dominance in college sports. As of 2021 52.3% of the 130 Division I FBS football programs are Nike-affiliated (68). Adidas is a distant second (37) followed by Under Armor (17) Jordan Brand (7) and New Balance (1).

There are currently seven Nike schools in the Big 12 (Texas Kansas State Oklahoma State West Virginia Baylor Iowa State and TCU) with one each for Adidas (Kansas) Jordan Brand (Oklahoma) and Under Armour (Texas Tech).

Of the four schools joining the Big 12 in 2023-24 three (BYU Cincinnati and Central Florida) are Nike branded and one (Houston) is Jordan Brand.

‚ÄúGoing into the Big 12 will enhance our visibility‚Äù Santiago said ‚Äúbut the core relationship with Nike remains the same.‚Äù

As a Nike Elite school all of BYU‚Äôs athletic programs are Nike ‚Äúhead to toe‚Äù and that‚Äôs no exaggeration. Santiago told a story about a Las Vegas Bowl appearance where one of the gifts was an Under Armour beanie. With colder-than-usual weather some of the BYU players were seen wearing the beanies on the sideline to stay warm during the TV broadcast.

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt take two minutes for the phone to ring from Nike‚Äù Santiago said.

Most sports at BYU have a staff member acting as a Nike liaison and they chose the gear that best fits their program.

‚ÄúI work primarily with Nike on the contractual side‚Äù Santiago said. ‚ÄúWe have a great team of equipment managers who are heavily involved in the actual ordering. We‚Äôve also got a great team that works with marketing and social media in designing some of the gear.‚Äù

Athletes at BYU look forward to the day their gear drops replenishing their supply of t-shirts hoodies socks shoes hats and the like with the Swoosh logo. Each week BYU football sends photos of that week‚Äôs Nike uniform choice out on social media.

The latest slang thrown around by the athletes to describe cool outfits is ‚Äúdrip‚Äù and BYU‚Äôs Nike drip is the envy of every Cougar fan and prospective recruit on the planet.

‚ÄúOur Nike gear is prominently displayed on every recruiting trip‚Äù Santiago said. ‚ÄúAt this level there are high stakes and we want to outfit our athletes in the very best equipment and apparel. Nike opens doors for us.‚Äù

On Nike‚Äôs end the company is prominently displayed on Saturdays in the fall on every network that broadcasts the sport.

‚ÄúNike is heavily invested with collegiate athletics and they get exposure on a very high level‚Äù Santiago said. ‚ÄúYou can turn just about any game and see the ‚ÄòSwoosh‚Äô logo. It‚Äôs everywhere.‚Äù

A good example of that was last Saturday when Nike schools BYU and Baylor met at LaVell Edwards Stadium on ESPN. Nearly every one of the Cougar fans in attendance was wearing eye-catching royal blue and much of that gear was made by Nike.

Santiago said the relationship with Nike is more than just a financial partnership.

‚ÄúThe cool thing about it is it‚Äôs not just transactional. This is a long-standing relationship that has produced life-long friendships from the equipment manager level to the administrative level to executives at Nike. It goes way beyond the transaction of product.‚Äù

Not only is the 30-year-old slugger taking care of business on the field but he is dressing like a superstar off the field. The Instagram account @mlbfits recently posted pictures of players entering Yankee stadium before a game this week. Naturally Judge was wearing shoes we had never seen before.

Of course Judge wore a pair of the classic Nike Air Force 1 shoes but it was an unknown colorway. That is because Judge is the first person to get a pair of these rare kicks (in size 17 no less). Below is everything fans need to know about Judge's kicks.

Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 Low 'Multi-Patent'

Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 Low 'Multi-Patent' @SneakerNews

Judge debuted a pair of Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 shoes in the 'Multi-Patent' colorway. The shoes are part of a collaboration between Nike and Los Angeles sneaker store Undefeated. The two partners have collaborated on countless projects in the past.

This version of the Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 shoes 'Multi-Patent' has not yet been released. From what we can surmise the multi-colored shoes feature a patent leather upper consisting of teal olive blue grey yellow and off-white.

Currently Nike has not provided a release date pricing or official images of this shoe. There is no guarantee that it even releases. But the silver lining is that rapper Travis Scott also debuted a pair of Undefeated x Nike Air Force 1 shoes in a different colorway. So that at least doubles fans chances of getting a pair of these classic Nike shoes.

Judge is many things. A home run leader future Hall of Famer and sneakerhead. Undefeated and Nike could not have picked a better person to debut the unreleased lifestyle shoes. Stay locked into FanNationKicks.com to learn more about what your favorite athletes wear on and off the field.

Having the Nike Swoosh on his outfit Woods has been one of the biggest possession of the American apparel giant.

Walking down memory lane the association between Nike and Woods dates back to the year 1996. Leaving a lasting impression with his incredible performances in the amateur tournaments Woods became a Nike-sponsored player even before his pro debut. As per reports the first contract between Woods and Nike was a 5-year deal worth $40 million. 26 years later how much is Tiger Woods worth to Nike today?

The monumental history of Nike and Tiger Woods

Woods started his career with a $40 million contract for Nike. However five years seemed sufficiently enough for the American sensation to prove to Nike that he is worth much more.

5 majors 19 tour tiles top spot in World rankings 3 PGA Tour player of the year awards and 3 PGA Player of the year awards later it was in 2001 that Woods and Nike renewed their partnership. Even though the two agreed on the same 5-year span the success of Woods had now taken the deal to a whopping $100 million.

Walking on his own-defined path of success Woods went on to pursue his aim of becoming the greatest player of all time. Five years later it was in 2006 that Woods and Nike signed their third contract. Goes without saying ten years seemed a considerable time for Nike to put Woods on the list of their biggest assets.

The result? Unlike the previous two contracts the third contract between the two was sealed for a period of seven years ending in 2013.

The latest association of the two giants

The year 2013 is often referred to by many as the biggest year of their association. In July 2013 the then Nike golf president Cindy Davis released a statement confirming the renewal of their association with Nike.

‚ÄúWe are thrilled to continue our partnership with Tiger. He is one of Nike‚Äôs most iconic athletes and has played an integral part in Nike Golf‚Äôs growth since the very beginning‚Äù she said.

As per reports the fourth contract between Nike and Woods was signed for a massive $200 million. An amount that prompted Woods‚Äôs manager to assert that Woods would continue to remain with Nike for the rest of his career. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre comfortable with where we ended up and the career trajectory that Tiger will be on with Nike‚Äù he said.

A bond not just about T-shirts and shoes

Woods has had numerous ups and downs in his personal as well as professional life. Widening the room for discussion apart from Nike Woods has also been a part of numerous other sponsorship deals in his 26-year-long career. However giving a glimpse at the unfortunate part many of these sponsors have taken a back seat when Woods‚Äô career was going through a rough patch.

On the contrary Nike has made sure to stick with Woods through thick and thin. A gesture that has given the greatest golfer of all time all the more reason to stay bonded with the apparel giant.

Over the years Woods hasn‚Äôt just contributed to Nike by showing up on the golf course with their apparel. In addition to that he has also taken up the responsibility to be one of their most prominent global brand ambassadors. The former World No. 1 has been a part of Nike‚Äôs most successful advertisement campaigns over the years.

Aside from placing pennies on the railway they would watch as the occasional handcar ‚Äî a railroad car powered by riders pumping the handles to move the wheels ‚Äî would roll by with workers repairing the tracks as they moved into town.

""It just a nostalgic thing for me now but back then that's what entertained us as children"" said LaMar 77.

In 2016 LaMar and a group of friends made the trip out to the Monticello Railway Museum where they were offered an opportunity to ride up a mile on the track on a handcar similar to the ones she saw as a child.

""We were given a special privilege and I always feel like that was special that they agreed to do that for us"" LaMar said. ""We all remember that; it was a wonderful day for us.""

Located roughly 50 miles southeast of Bloomington the Monticello Railway Museum 992 Iron Horse Place is home to over 100 pieces of railroad equipment including several restored trains and cars that operated in Illinois.

The group which operates as a nonprofit hosts a variety of events and train rides from May through October. Its staff consists wholly of volunteers who invest thousands of hours in restoring pieces and operating the day-to-day business of the museum.

""I think it's a very important part of our history in how railroads played an important part and still do in moving freight and passengers from place to place and what that journey was like"" said museum president George Roadcap 67. ""Railroads basically built Illinois in the Midwest and our towns are all laid out the way they are because of railroads.""

An evolving mission

Founded in 1966 as the Society for the Perpetuation of Unretired Railfans Inc. the group's original goal was to encourage the Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad to continue its steam-powered train rides. That effort failed with the line running its last train in June 1966 but the enthusiasts decided to operate on their own.

Operations moved to Monticello after encouragement from the Illinois Pioneer Heritage Center which noted that several miles of abandoned tracks from the Illinois Terminal interurban railway were available for purchase.

Once settled the group acquired its first engine from Montezuma Indiana in November 1966. The steam-powered locomotive had been used by the Western Indian Aggregate & Stone Co. The engine dates to 1930 and can still be seen today just outside the museum entrance.

Soon after they obtained some former Wabash passenger cars and then their second steam locomotive ‚Äî the former Southern Railway No. 401 ‚Äî from a limestone quarry in Margerum Alabama as well as another steam locomotive ‚Äî former Republic Steel No. 191 ‚Äî from Columbus Ohio.

The group renamed itself the Monticello & Sangamon Valley Railway Historical Society in 1970 before adopting its present name Monticello Railway Museum in 1982.

Today the collection includes a wide spectrum of pieces: everything from a 1944 Bates & Rogers No. 11442 locomotive crane with a lifting capacity of up 30 tons to a 1918 Quebec Central Plow No. 40065 wooden snow plow that was used in one Illinois winter during the 1970s.

Other pieces include a 1925 Rock Island No. 2541 commuter coach car that spent its time commuting to and from Chicago; a deep blue 1911 Wabash No. 6 ""Iowa"" office car that was donated by a private owner in near perfect condition; and a 1949 Shedd Aquarium ""Nautilus"" specimen transport car which was used by the John G. Shedd Aquarium to transport live saltwater animals from all coasts of the United States inside its gray metal shell.

Future expansion

The museum has been taking steps to evolve its operation even further including plans to install a historic locomotive turntable. Work is underway on some special projects such as restoration of an 1891 Chicago Burlington & Quincy caboose made entirely of wood.

Roadcap said he expects the museum's expansion to continue.

""We have a lot of talented engineers and architects that can help out"" he said ""and we probably have enough train cars and engines right now but we will always accumulate more I suppose.""

Volunteer Bill Crisp 47 said restorers have already started replacing parts of the caboose. They plan to replace every piece of wood that is damaged or rotten.

""This is the oldest piece of equipment on the property"" said Crisp a railway engineer for Norfolk Southern. ""Part of the expansion of the United States was because of the railroads so it's important to be able to preserve items like this and tell that story.""

Another piece close to his heart is the 1960 Chicago & Illinois Midland No. 31 diesel locomotive which is one of two ever built. He would routinely see it while running newspaper routes in Taylorville as a child during the 1980s Crisp said.

""I got to ride this thing when I was 10 years old and I was hooked"" Crisp said. ""I told myself that I was gonna get a job on the railroads and now it's come full circle when we acquired it in 2020.""

Bloomington-Normal labor union advocate Mike Matejka said he remembers visiting the National Museum of Transportation and Union Station in St. Louis with his father to see the Texas Eagle passenger train run on the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

Matejka's father was a transit worker who operated a trolley car in St. Louis during the 1950s. Each holiday season the family would arrange a Lionel Train set ultimately feeding Matejka's interest in locomotives.

When he transferred to Illinois State University in 1973 Matejka heard about the museum and decided to volunteer on weekends.

Since then Matejka said he has not been as active but his respect for the museum's care to detail has remained. His perspective of railroad history has also deepened beyond personal nostalgia and into appreciation of its role in creating labor unions during the 19th century.

""Workers had to organize and fight and really the impetus for workers to organize into unions was very much about safety. They wanted to be able to come home at night and to change the conditions and the law so that they had protection"" Matejka said. ""Understanding that larger historical context I think is something that I really have learned a lot more from and immerse myself into.""

Labor unions remain a crucial part of the U.S. rail industry. Companies and workers just last week reached a tentative agreement to avert a nationwide strike that could have shut down the nation's freight trains causing a massive economic impact.

'History isn't over'

Aircraft mechanic David Parker 37 who owns a 111-year-old Illinois Terminal Co. sleeper car that was saved from outside a train station in Harristown said he always knew about the museum but never visited until recently when he was looking for a set of train wheels for the car.

After he found out the museum still had the wheels he was grateful to learn that he could buy them for $100.

""I figured train parts are hard to come by and they might need the parts off of them for spares to keep other cars running but either they didn't have a use for it or they just may seem to appreciate that I was trying to save the car"" Parker said.

Gary Forshaw 74 of Edwardsville spent several years working to restore the train car after purchasing the train in 1966 with his stepbrother Fred Blue.

The car then ended up at the museum sometime afterward. Even Matejka had a hand in restoring it before it was sent to Harristown Parker said.

Parker said preservation is a way to honor the people who worked on the railroads and the stories and legacies shared today between their families who still live in the area.

""At some level we owe it to them to preserve those objects that are so important to their life story"" Parker said. ""As long as you're preserving that piece of history then its history isn't over. The story is still going and it's constantly rewritten.""

Though some volunteers have reached an age where manual labor starts to become more difficult Roadcap said he remains optimistic about the future of volunteers and the younger generation taking up the reins.

Two of the museum's younger volunteers are Bill Crisp's son Xander and his friend Isaiah Bradford 16 of Decatur.

Bradford said he started going to the museum to help Xander primarily cleaning cars. He would occasionally have the chance to photograph some of the pieces in storage or in action.

""A lot of the stuff from Monticello has to do with Illinois and the Midwest and it brings people and families together"" Bradford said. ""I've always liked trying to do something else with an art and an art I develop skill in. It's more so having those two pieces coexist with each other and build upon it together.""

Bradford said his interest in trains started in 2018 when he would visit the Wabash Depot Antique Center 780 E. Cerro Gordo St. in Decatur with his grandfather and watch the trains pass through. Since then he has started photographing trains traveling through town.

Volunteer Thomas Dyrek 19 of Normal said his first experience with trains and the museum was when his parents took him there in 2009. He fell in love with riding on the 1953 Wabash Railway No. 1189 diesel-powered locomotive.

""I started begging my parents to take me here as much as possible and now I come down here about once a month when I can to help out"" said Dyrek who now lives in Cedar Lake Indiana. ""Once every blue moon you run into a younger guy who is enthusiastic about this stuff and there are a couple other teenagers that help out this weekend.""

Now he gets to work the same locomotive that he first rode. He has even published two photo books ""Central Illinois Train Depots"" as well as one on the Toledo Peoria & Western Railway.

The museum schedules regular weekend fares for diesel trains and hosts special events including dinners steam-powered train rides and a wildly popular ""Polar Express"" train ride for the holidays which has already sold out this year.

The museum is open from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturdays and noon to 4:30 p.m. Sundays. Train rides start half an hour after the museum opens.

This weekend the museum will host Railroad Days during which families and individuals can enjoy unlimited rides on passenger and freight trains explore the museum campus drive a motorcar on the rails or even try out the new Hodge Pedal Car ride.

Outside of special events the museum can handle requests like the handcar ride for individuals looking to visit on any given day Roadcap said. Visitors looking for such accommodations are asked to contact the museum ahead of time at info@mrym.org and provide a donation.

""I have kids that are into trains and being into trains myself I like to see kids get all excited to ride them"" Roadcap said. ""That's one of my primary motivations just to see people happy and riding the train and having a good time.""

From 13 ‚Äì 17 September 2022 the Embassy of Ireland to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) at the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the assistance of the Embassy of Ireland to Uganda led a joint monitoring visit to northern Uganda.

The objective of the monitoring visit was to provide delegates with the opportunity to witness first-hand the transformative work of the TFV in northern Uganda focusing on the lasting impact of the conflict and the individuals and communities affected by the many atrocities committed. Delegates on the visit hoped to gain insight into reparation implementation programmes and hear directly victims‚Äô experiences of court-ordered reparation programme in the Lubanga and the Katanga case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Honourable Norbert Mao Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda said ‚ÄúAlthough the guns have gone silent the wounds are still deep‚Äù. He added ‚ÄúWe highly appreciate this important monitoring visit with so many delegates and we are certain that they will bring back great impressions of Uganda after their personal interactions with the victims of the LRA. It has become apparent that mental health is very important to be addressed. We have to ensure that psychosomatic services among others are continued as some victims will require this assistance to lead a normal life. The work of the Trust Fund for Victims is of utmost important to the thousands of victims in northern Uganda and we hope that the assistance will be prolonged. Without the assistance of the Government of Ireland this visit would have not been possible and we shall welcome you again any time. ‚Äú

The Chair of the TFV Board of Directors Minou Tavarez Mirabal said ‚ÄúMedical treatment trauma counselling and livelihood support are life changing services that afford recognition and a form of justice to victims of Rome Statute crimes and redress for the harm they have suffered. The TFV calls for collective efforts to restoring hope transforming lives and achieving long-term reparative justice for victims‚Äù she added.

Speaking on Ireland's hopes for the visit and support of the TFV's work H.E. Ambassador Brendan Rogers of Ireland to the Netherlands said: ‚ÄúThis visit is the bridge between The Hague and the field. Delegates are now better informed and have seen with their own eyes the impact of the work of the TFV on the ground. We now have a family of supporters of the Fund that can take that support back to The Hague and beyond.‚Äù

Participating delegates came to better understand the deeply rooted harm persisting in northern Uganda sixteen years after the LRA conflict and the need to redress this harm. Beneficiaries of the programme called upon the delegates to provide reparative measures more broadly to the victims their children and communities. Delegates committed to advocate for increased international awareness and support in order to allow the TFV to continue its programmes in northern Uganda complementing the efforts of the Government of Uganda.

Recalling the commitment to victims and affected communities of atrocity crimes President of the Assembly of States Parties Silvia Fernandez de Gurmendi called on States Parties of the Rome Statute to step up providing support to victims. ‚ÄúStates Parties should cooperate with the ICC in order to ensure perpetrators of crimes are brought to justice and the rights and needs of victim survivors are addressed. During my mandate I will do my utmost to promote the important work of the Trust Fund for victims‚Äù.

Fourteen States participated in the monitoring visit this year including the President of the Assembly of the States Parties and representatives from the governments of Australia Belgium Chile Estonia Germany Ireland Liechtenstein Netherlands New Zealand Switzerland Tanzania Uganda United States and the European Union. Also Legal Representatives of Victims in the Ongwen case and civil society organisations participated in the visit.

The Taunting Caddie (2000) With Vijay Singh playing World No. 1 Tiger Woods in a Sunday singles match his caddie Paul Tesori showed up wearing this hat that said ""Tiger Who?"" on the back. Probably not the smartest move. Woods won 2 and 1 and the U.S. restored Presidents Cup order by trouncing the Internationals 21.5 to 10.5.

The Duel in South Africa (2003) More evidence that this event has actually been competitive at times. In 2003 the matches ended tied at 17 and a tiebreaker of sending one player out from each team was used for the first and only time. Tiger Woods and Ernie Els were obvious choices and they played even through three holes that included both holing clutch mid-range par putts on the third. With darkness setting in captains Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player decided to end the event with a draw and a shared cup. Sportsmanship wins!

When Chris DiMarco ruled the world (2005) After tying in 2003 the teams remained deadlocked heading into the singles session in 2005. Playing in the final match of the day DiMarco drained a 10-footer for birdie to beat Stuart Appleby 1 up and capture the cup for the U.S. DiMarco went a perfect 4-0-1 that week at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club.

""Aquaman"" (2007) Woody Austin's infamous blooper stole the show at Royal Montreal. Trying to play a shot from a bank on the 14th hole on Friday Austin lost his balance and fell face first into a lake. After drying off he made three late birdies to salvage a halve in his four-ball match. The next day captain Jack Nicklaus announced him as ""Jacques Cousteau"" and Woody showed up wearing snorkeling gear on Sunday.

Woods' Perfect Week (2009) No one could stop Tiger at Harding Park in 2009. Playing in front of the U.S. squad's special assistant Michael Jordan Woods put forth a dazzling display of golf going a perfect 5-and-0 and leading the U.S. to another lopsided victory. That included a payback beatdown (6 and 5) of Y.E. Yang the man who had denied him at that year's PGA Championship in singles. That week Woods was the most fired up we've ever seen him at the Presidents Cup. Gotta be that argyle right?

Tiger and Steve's bromance (2009) The friendship between these two has been well documented and is a big reason for Woods being an assistant captain for Stricker in 2017 but it all started with a magical week at Harding Park. Beginning with a 6-and-4 foursomes win on Thursday the new dynamic duo rolled to a 4-0 record as a team -- and became instant BFFs.

Sammy The Squirrel (2013) The U.S. made a furry friend during the 2013 matches at Muirfield Village. Everyone especially captain Davis Love III loved Sammy the Squirrel. Well maybe not everyone. Tiger didn't look too pleased when girlfriend Lindsey Vonn put the rodent on his shoulder. Sammy was eventually pried from the hands of a sobbing Love and taken to a wildlife center. Or something like that. Photo By: AP

Two-time major winner Dustin Johnson fired a nine-under par 63 to seize a three-stroke lead after the opening round of the LIV Golf Chicago Invitational.

The 38-year-old American enjoyed a bogey-free 18 holes to start the 54-hole event at Rich Harvest Farms with the winner set to collect $4 million from a $25 million purse.

‚ÄúI struck the ball really well‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúI hit it really close. I holed a lot of putts inside 10 feet.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was hitting good putts but they weren‚Äôt going in‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúAt the end they started going in. I hope I can keep it going.‚Äù

At one point in the day Smith was shown a Rory McIlroy-inspired meme and later was bizarrely asked by a journalist ‚Äúhow many of Rory McIlroy‚Äôs tears‚Äù he has able to fit in the Claret Jug after he won the Open.

Northrop Grumman built first MQ-4C Triton for Australia

Northrop Grumman Corporation has unveiled the first Australian autonomous MQ-4C Triton UAV.

The corporation said that Australia is a joint partner in the Triton program and played a crucial role in shaping the requirements for the system.

Northrop Grumman began assembling the first Australian MQ-4C in October 2020 at its Moss Point manufacturing facility in Mississippi.

Triton would provide the Royal Australian Air Force with unprecedented capabilities to monitor and protect shipping lanes.

The drone will operate alongside the P-8A Poseidon marine aircraft and this unmanned aircraft system will cover significant areas over long distances and will be able to stay airborne longer than a traditional aircraft.

In June 2018 the Prime Minister of Australia announced that Australia would acquire 6 Triton UAVs for the RAAF. In 2020 it became known that Australia would order additional drones of this type.

The first of which is scheduled to be adopted in mid-2023.

The total cost of purchasing building infrastructure and providing support is unofficially estimated at $7 billion.

The long-duration high-altitude MQ-4C Triton drone is the marine version of the Northrop Grumman-developed RQ-4N Block 30 Global Hawk drone.

September 2022

By Shannon Bugos

The rocket boosting a new reentry vehicle for the future U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system exploded 11 seconds after launch in its first test setting the $100 billion nuclear modernization program off to a rocky start.

The test involved a Minotaur II+ rocket carrying a prototype Mark 21A reentry vehicle built by Lockheed Martin. The vehicle will house a W87-1 nuclear warhead which is in the midst of a modification program administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). A nuclear warhead was not used during the July 6 test at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

‚ÄúThe test launch will demonstrate preliminary design concepts and relevant payload technologies in [an] operationally realistic environment‚Äù said the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center in a press release prior to the test. Following the failed test the center commented only that ‚Äúan investigative review board has been established to determine the cause of the explosion.‚Äù

The blast sparked a fire on the base prompting the dispatch of local firefighters.

The rocket and reentry vehicle will be placed on the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs new LGM-35A Sentinel ICBMs. The Sentinel system was initially known as the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent before its renaming in the spring. (See ACT June 2022.)

The Air Force plans to purchase more than 650 Sentinel ICBMs to replace the existing fleet of 400 Minuteman III missiles plus spares and test missiles starting in fiscal year 2029. Testing of the Sentinel missiles under development by Northrop Grumman is slated to begin in 2024.

The Pentagon had scheduled a long-planned test of a Minuteman III ICBM for early August. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin elected to delay the test by about two weeks due to heightened tensions with China over Taiwan John Kirby coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council announced on Aug. 4. The department had cancelled another ICBM test in March. (See ACT April 2022.)

‚ÄúAs China engages in destabilizing military exercises around Taiwan the United States is demonstrating instead the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation and misperception‚Äù said Kirby.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee denounced Austin‚Äôs decision.

‚ÄúThese weak-kneed pearl-clutching attempts at appeasement hurt our readiness and will only invite further aggression by our adversaries‚Äù Rogers said.

The rescheduled test took place on Aug. 16 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. ‚ÄúThe ICBM‚Äôs reentry vehicle traveled approximately 4200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands‚Äù the Air Force said in a statement.

ICBMs constitute the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear triad and are dispersed across three Air Force bases in five states: Colorado Montana Nebraska North Dakota and Wyoming.

The service released on July 1 a draft report examining the environmental impact from the construction of the Sentinel system to include the missiles themselves as well as their vast supporting infrastructure and the decommissioning and disposal of the Minuteman III missile system. The Air Force began work on the statement in the fall of 2020.

The report found that the plan for replacing all Minuteman III missiles with Sentinel missiles will ‚Äúhave potentially significant adverse effects on cultural resources public health and safety socioeconomics and utilities and infrastructure‚Äù in the short term and in some cases the long term.

As part of the report the Air Force also had to evaluate possible alternative plans to the Sentinel system for the future of the ICBM force.

The report describes four possible alternatives to the current plan including rebuilding the Minuteman III missile fleet to existing specifications constructing and deploying a smaller ICBM constructing and deploying commercial launch vehicles containing nuclear-capable reentry vehicles or converting existing Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles for deployment in land-based silos.

The Air Force eliminated these alternatives due to the perception that they did not meet all of the system requirements in areas such as sustainability integration performance survivability safety and risk.

The service ultimately determined that only in pursuing the new Sentinel system would the United States be able ‚Äúto continue to offer long-term tangible evidence to both allies and potential adversaries of our nuclear weapons capabilities thus contributing to nuclear deterrence and assurance and providing a hedge against arms competition.‚Äù

Notably an alternative that the Air Force chose not to examine was reducing the size of the ICBM force to below 400 as some arms control experts have suggested.

‚ÄúThe current force level of 400 deployed ICBMs is not‚Äì‚Äìand has never been‚Äì‚Äìa magic number and it could be reduced further for a variety of reasons including those related to security economics or a good faith effort to reduce deployed U.S. nuclear forces‚Äù Matt Korda of the Federation of American Scientists wrote in a July 13 blog post.

The Defense Department had solicited a study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on potential alternatives for the land-based leg of the nuclear triad to possibly include the reduction of the ICBM force. The study was to be completed by the end of January 2022 but has not been made public.

On the original timeline that study would have been finished at a time when the Biden administration‚Äôs Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) also wrapped up leaving little room for the study to influence the U.S. nuclear force posture in a meaningful way. The public release of the NPR has been delayed in part due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February although it is unlikely that the Pentagon will deviate from pursuing the Sentinel program.

Congress supported the new ICBM program in fiscal year 2022 with $2.6 billion. (See ACT January/February 2022.) In June the House authorized $3.6 billion for the program in fiscal year 2023 but the defense authorization bill has yet to make its way through the Senate. The relevant pieces of appropriations legislation which allow for actual spending have not moved through either chamber. (See ACT June 2022.)

Overall the House approved a $37 billion boost to the Biden administration‚Äôs request of $813 billion for national defense for fiscal year 2023. The lawmakers rubber-stamped all nuclear modernization programs including funding for the fleet of Columbia-class submarines the B-21 Raider strategic bomber and the long-range standoff weapon an air-launched cruise missile.

The House also added $45 million for the development of a new sea-launched cruise missile and its associated nuclear warhead which the Biden administration had not requested.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2Y1MGZiYTFkLTVmMDMtNDAzNS04MzAyLTUzNTMxOWY5MzM4Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The race to reinvent the space station,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

It's done doing business with Nvidia and will stop making GPUs altogether. That's according to YouTube channels JayZTwoCents and GamersNexus which both sat down with EVGA CEO Andrew Han to discuss his frustrations with Nvidia as a partner and reasoning for making the decision. Jon Peddie Research also published a brief article on the matter.



""We are not going to be on [Nvidia CEO] Jensen [Huang]'s lap on stage so I don't want people to speculate what's going on [when we're not there]"" GamersNexus Steve Burke quotes Han as saying. ""EVGA has decided not to carry the next gen.""



When asked for comment EVGA product management director Jacob Freeman pointed Tom's Hardware to its forums where the company offered the following message:



""EVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup. Also EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards."" EVGA also confirmed that it will not carry the next generation of GPUs that it will support current generation products and that it will ""continue to provide the current generation products"" though it didn't specify for how long.



It is notable that Han met with two of the biggest tech YouTubers and had the videos embargoed so there may be more to the story.



""We‚Äôve had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products"" Bryan Del Rizzo director of global public relations for GeForce at Nvidia told Tom's Hardware. ""We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.""



EVGA will reportedly continue the existing RTX 30-series product line until it runs out of stock. The company won't be moving to partner with AMD or Intel either with plans to instead focus on other products for the foreseeable future (EVGA already makes power supplies coolers and motherboards for instance) but also reportedly won't expand into new product categories.



The company has reportedly withheld some stock for the market for the purposes of replacing cards in warranty which should protect current customers at least for a while.

Han told JayZTwoCents and GamersNexus that EVGA won't be selling the business. GamersNexus states that Nvidia's top brass were first notified in April while Peddie reports that Nvidia was informed in June. Apparently EVGA did make some RTX 40-series cards that made it as far as the engineering sample stage however.



It's unclear how EVGA will keep its employees together. It's not a huge company and while the GamersNexus video suggests Han said he wants to take care of employees it's unclear what some of these engineers will have to do. The company laid off some employees in Taiwan earlier in the summer.



Both videos suggest that EVGA feels that Nvidia has stifled it and suggest they don't find out details like MSRP costs to buy GPU chips and more until Nvidia announces them often publicly on stage. There is also talk of price ceilings as well as not being able to customize cards by changing the specs like adding more memory.



It's also an issue because Nvidia is competing against partners with its own Founders Edition cards both videos say because Nvidia as the supplier and manufacturer doesn't have to worry about profit margins as much.



EVGA has built its reputation on delivering some of the best Nvidia GPU AIB cards. In fact the VGA stands for video graphics adapter which is odd for a company that no longer makes them. According to Jon Peddie Research EVGA's shift here will ""put a big hole in Nvidia's North American sales of AIBs"" suggesting that EVGA had 40% of the market as well as fans of the brand in western Europe. Peddie notes that as GPUs require more and more electricity EVGA may be able to sell individuals and OEMs power supplies to make up for some of the profits.

According to GamersNexus  EVGA has terminated its contract with Nvidia and will cease all graphics card manufacturing including the RTX series and any other cards. The publication states that the reason for said termination is due to ‚Äúdisrespectful treatment among other things.‚Äù

The report goes on to state that EVGA will ‚Äúnot be exploring relationships with AMD or Intel at this time‚Äù and that it will completely exit the video card market. Employees have been told they‚Äôll be taken care of but the details of that have been conflicted since the company has already killed its projects.

One such project was about 20 EVT samples of EVGA RTX 4090 FTW3 cards which will not be moving to production. Its KINGPIN cards have also been canceled.

This news comes just before Team Green‚Äôs upcoming Nvidia GTC 2022  which is rumored to feature its upcoming Lovelace 4000-series chips including the GeForce RTX 4090 .

What this could mean for Nvidia?

Losing EVGA is a big blow to Nvidia as not only it‚Äôs one of the larger manufacturers of the latter‚Äôs graphics cards but it‚Äôs also used to produce sample chips that promote said chips.

And the timing couldn‚Äôt be worse for Team Green due to the upcoming GTC 2022 event on Tuesday September 20. The reason is especially important since it‚Äôs reportedly due to how poorly the EVGA workers were treated by Nvidia.

The company which is best known for manufacturing NVIDIA GeForce-based video cards is getting out of the GPU-making business. As Tom's Hardware and Ars Technica report company CEO Andrew Han sat down with YouTubers JayZTwoCents and Gamers Nexus in a closed-door interview to reveal EVGA's decision. He also talked about his grievances with NVIDIA.

Han told the YouTubers that NVIDIA had stopped treating EVGA as a true partner over the years despite their history. NVIDIA had allegedly stopped informing EVGA about new product announcements and important information such as suggested retail pricing and availability. That left add-in board partners like EVGA to find out details about the latest products on stage the same time we all do. Further NVIDIA's first-party Founders Edition cards undercut the prices of their counterparts from EVGA and other partners forcing the vendors to mark down their prices.

EVGA Han said will continue selling cards based on older GeForce GPUs like the RTX 3000 series. After it runs out of stock though that's it ‚Äî the company has no plans to team up with NVIDIA rivals AMD or Intel. EVGA has been selling other computer components and accessories such as power supplies and gaming mice for a while now. But according to Gamers Nexus 80 percent of the company's revenue comes from GeForce sales so this decision could put the company's very existence in jeopardy. When the YouTuber commented that this must have been a difficult decision to make the CEO reportedly replied that this was easy and it was working with NVIDIA that was hard.

In its forums EVGA has posted the following statement:

EVGA will not carry the next generation graphics cards. EVGA will continue to support the existing current generation products. EVGA will continue to provide the current generation products. EVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup. Also EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards.

As for NVIDIA Bryan Del Rizzo the director of global public relations for GeForce told Tom's Hardware:

One of Nvidia‚Äôs biggest partners that gamers and PC builders will be familiar with EVGA has now cited ‚Äúdisrespectful treatment‚Äù on Nvidia‚Äôs part and announced that the company will be completely exiting the GPU business.

The story came out when Steve Burke Editor-in-Chief at Gamers Nexus released a new video where Burke reports discussions held with EVGA CEO Andrew Han. The video suggests that EVGA will not be joining forces with Nvidia rivals AMD or Intel either and will simply not be making GPUs after the stock of the existing RTX 30-series is sold out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk2MDA1LWV2Z2Etc3RvcC1tYWtpbmctbnZpZGlhLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLWNpdGluZy1hYnVzaXZlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA will stop making Nvidia graphics cards citing abusive relationship,"A hot potato: The relationship between Nvidia and one of its top board partners seems to have reached a breaking point. EVGA won't produce RTX 40 series GPUs effectively exiting the graphics card market entirely. Possibly heralding the end of EVGA the decision could bring closer attention to the business interactions between GPU makers and board partners.

In an exclusive report EVGA told Gamers Nexus that it won't sell Nvidia graphics cards after the RTX 30 series. The company will keep supporting current customers' warranties but expects to sell through its remaining inventory by the end of 2022.

A primary reason for the falling out is that Nvidia's Founders Edition 30 series GPUs have undercut EVGA's variants of those cards especially as Nvidia recently made significant price cuts to clear stock.

GPU makers boosted supply in response to the crypto boom but then the crash and the more recent Ethereum merge have left them struggling to get rid of unsold stock while competing with the deluge of used cards as they prepare to launch a new generation. Board manufacturers like EVGA say they can't absorb these shocks the way Nvidia can and EVGA says it is losing hundreds of dollars on every RTX 3080 or RTX 3090 sold.

The board partner also accuses Nvidia of a lack of communication regarding MSRP when launching new GPUs. EVGA doesn't know the final price it will sell cards for until Nvidia announces the suggested pricing to the public. The GPU maker also enforces price floors and ceilings restricting EVGA's ability to price its variants according to how it customizes overclocking or cooling systems.

Currently EVGA calls itself Nvidia's #1 authorized partner in US and UK graphics card sales and Nvidia GPUs make up about three-quarters of EVGA's gross revenue. Furthermore the company doesn't sell AMD or Intel cards and doesn't intend to after splitting with Nvidia. Power supplies comprise most of the rest of EVGA's business but it's hard to imagine what the company will look like in the coming year or two without GeForce products.

The decision to leave the GPU business didn't come suddenly or recently. EVGA says they notified Nvidia in April after trying to renegotiate the partnership several times. EVGA CEO and founder Andrew Han said the decision to leave Nvidia was easy and that working with the company was hard. Han called the choice a matter of principle not money.

Han says he has no intention of selling EVGA worrying investors would change its identity and culture. The company also doesn't want to lay anyone off but that seems almost inevitable if it abandoned its main source of revenue."

This assumes significance given the representation by Indian Banks Association (IBA) to the government seeking intervention of the antitrust panel to address chip shortage that is hitting issuance of credit and debit cards. Semiconductor industry executives however attribute this to market forces. They say that once the pandemic set in certain products like laptops and smartphones took priority over others triggered primarily by action taken by consumer segments such as car companies.

Read in Explained | Explained: The $280 billion US CHIPS Bill for boosting semiconductor production to compete with China

This resulted in OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) of certain sectors releasing the slots at fabrication units allocated to automakers to cater to demand from other high-value items such as laptops smartphones headphones etc demand of which spiked as people started working from home.

‚ÄúJust like we reserve railway tickets in advance and there is a wait list one has to book slots to have chips manufactured in advance. If you don‚Äôt you lose your slot. A lot of automotive companies cancelled their slots (when the pandemic started) with the assumption that they will not be requiring it‚Äù Sanjay Gupta Vice President & India Managing Director at the Netherlands-headquartered NXP Semiconductors told The Indian Express. NXP Semiconductors is one of the three largest semiconductor suppliers to automotive companies in the world.

‚ÄúThis was because having the slots would mean you pay for some of the expenses. Running a fab takes millions of dollars a day. Automotive companies thought that supplies will not be required in the first couple of quarters of 2020 and they released those slots. But there was another phenomenon that was happening ‚Äî work from home study from home gym from home basically everything from home. Nobody had predicted this phenomenon. Digitisation that was expected to happen in a 5-10 year timeframe happened in literally one quarter‚Äù Gupta said adding that once the demand for cars came back it was difficult for auto companies to get those slots back. ‚ÄúAutomotive companies barely got their slots back and whatever they could get back they got it at a higher price‚Äù.

Explained Auto firms let go of slots Auto makers and banks allege that chipmakers prefer high-end chip sales for laptops and phone companies rather than the low-end ones they need. However semiconductor companies say that during the pandemic auto firms their demand depressed released their ‚Äúchip-manufacturing‚Äù slots given the lockdown ‚Äî and were only now coming back.

For the carmakers this meant huge order backlogs and even cutting down on some features for lack of necessary electronic parts and components.

Meanwhile in 2021 India recorded 14.85 million shipments of personal computing devices such as laptops and desktops up 44.5 per cent from 2020 according to data provided by International Data Corporation (IDC). While PC shipments have started to slow down in 2022 some sectors are still hit by semiconductor shortage.

Parallel to this is the concerted push by the Government to semiconductor manufacturing. Last week a joint venture between Vedanta Group and Taiwan‚Äôs Foxconn announced setting up a semiconductor and display fab unit in Gujarat. Proposals have also been received from Singapore-based IGSS Ventures and ISMC which is led by Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures Fund.

Last December the Union Cabinet had approved a Rs 76000-crore plan to set up a semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem. As a part of the plan the Centre has lined up incentive support for companies engaged in silicon semiconductor fabs display fabs compound semiconductors silicon photonics sensors fabs semiconductor packaging and semiconductor design.",,,,,,,,,,,,

INSIDE SATURDAY‚ÄôS MATCHUP

‚Ä¢ Saturday will only be the second meeting between ODU and Virginia. The only previous matchup was won by the Cavaliers 28-17 at Scott Stadium in 2019.

‚Ä¢ Virginia is 11-2 at home in the month of September since the 2017 season.

‚Ä¢ UVA boasts a 21-5 mark at Scott Stadium since 2018.

‚Ä¢ The Cavaliers have won six of the last seven home games against non-conference foes dating back to 2018. The only blemish in that span came last season against Notre Dame.

‚Ä¢ Playing its first season in the Sun Belt Conference ODU is the first active member of the SBC to visit Scott Stadium. UVA‚Äôs only other previous matchup against an active member of the SBC was in 2007 a 23-21 win at Middle Tennessee which left the league in 2013.

‚Ä¢ Virginia is scheduled to play the 2020 SBC Champion Coastal Carolina at Scott Stadium on Nov. 19.

TOP STORYLINES

‚Ä¢ Saturday‚Äôs contest will feature two of the country‚Äôs top tackling linebackers in UVA‚Äôs Nick Jackson and ODU‚Äôs Jason Henderson. In the first two games Henderson has been in on 32 stops the third most in the nation while Jackson leads the ACC with 11.5 tackles per game. Henderson has 26 assisted tackles the most in the country.

‚Ä¢ Virginia quarterback Brennan Armstrong is on the verge of breaking two UVA passing records. He is 253 yards away from eclipsing the UVA career passing record and four touchdowns shy of the school‚Äôs career touchdown mark. Both records are owned by Matt Schaub (2000-03).

‚Ä¢ The Cavaliers are looking to bounce back from a 24-3 loss at Illinois last Saturday. It was only the second time since 2019 in which UVA did not score an offensive touchdown (Miami ‚Äì 2019 & Notre Dame 2021).

‚Ä¢ UVA‚Äôs defense against Illinois forced four turnovers (3 fumble recoveries & 1 interception) with two coming on Illinois‚Äô first two drives. The Cavaliers haven‚Äôt recovered three fumbles in a game since the 2019 contest against Duke.

NUMBERS TO KNOW

253 - Yards Brennan Armstrong needs to break UVA‚Äôs career passing record. He has gone over 250 passing yards in 17 of his 22 career starts.

4 - Armstrong needs four touchdowns to become UVA‚Äôs all-time leader in career touchdown passes.

90.8 ‚Äì Virginia‚Äôs grade for defensive coverage against receivers after the first two games of the season according to Pro Football Focus the fourth highest in the country.

The Cubs have been big on picking up guys out of Old Dominion for the past seven years. From PJ Higgins to Jared Young to Bryce Windham this year they added a power hitting outfielder and first baseman by the name of Andy Garriola. Before the draft I was scouting the stat line for Old Dominion to see if they were any players worth taking this year and Garriola was one of the ones I was watching. So when his name was called on day three I let out a hoop and holler because he has a lot of power potential and was one of just a few bats the Cubs took in this year‚Äôs draft.

17th Round Pick 2022 Draft

As a freshman he put up really good numbers as he saw plenty of playing time. He hit .328 with 10 home runs and 62 RBI. He did not play in 2020 and took a red shirt season but he did play that summer for the Wisconsin Rapids in the Northwoods League a wooden bat league. In a little over 40 games he hit six home runs and drove in 48 while hitting .308 with a .361 on-base percentage.

When Garriola got back to Old Dominion in 2021 he tore it up again hitting 14 home runs and drove in 72 while hitting .318. He spent that summer on the Cape but he only played 13 games for Cotuit hitting just .256 Still in that short span he cranked out three home runs and drove in about a run a game in that short limited exposure.

When he came back this spring he just tore it up at the plate and was one of the NCAA leaders in home runs with 25 and RBI with 80. When you see him swing a bat as in the video below you wonder how he lasted to the 17th round because there is some serious pop in there.

I was a little surprised the Cubs didn‚Äôt play him more this summer after they signed them. He only saw action in four games and that‚Äôs not really much that you can go on there. I‚Äôm sure it had to be a little different going from playing in the Atlantic Coast spring to playing in the Arizona summer.

I am intrigued by where he‚Äôs going to begin his full season career next year. The Cubs do have a little bit of a log jam when it comes to position players. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm leaning that he will be at Myrtle Beach even though he‚Äôll be 23 years old when the season begins. Then again he could tear it up in spring training and force his way to South Bend. Still Myrtle Beach might be better as he could be suited for the type of pitchers he‚Äôs going to face.

It has to be a little difficult to be one of only a handful of position players drafted. It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs gonna have a lot of hype or publicity focused in on him but there will be some close attention paid to him just based on his r√©sum√© that he built up in college. Could he be the next Matt Mervis? And will you play more at first or in the outfield next year? There‚Äôs a lot of questions to answer but we‚Äôre not in any rush to get to them just yet.

Our five takeaways from a very weird result today:

Virginia picks up a necessary ugly win

Listen beating an under-matched in-state opponent is far better than losing to one. Unlike Virginia Tech in week one UVA got the win against ODU and avoided a second loss in a row while still having plenty to improve on. This game took a turn for the worse but the ‚ÄòHoos handled the adversity and came out on top in a contest that they probably should‚Äôve lost with a clutch six play 66 yard drive in the final 55 seconds to win it on a 26-yard Brendan Farrell field goal.

So on one hand winning despite not playing well is a positive. On the other playing like gesticulates wildly this especially after such a disappointing loss on the road is not a good sign heading into ACC play this coming week at Syracuse. The offense is going to need to make significant strides or a far-improved Syracuse team will give the Wahoos trouble.

A win‚Äôs a win but this was by no means the get-right game Tony Elliott‚Äôs team dearly needed.

Wahoos‚Äô struggles in the red-zone nearly cost them the game

Speaking of offensive struggles what made this a game was UVA‚Äôs inability to take care of the ball and capitalize when in scoring position. With seven total possessions getting inside the ODU 20-yard line UVA only generated 16 points with a pair of red-zone fumbles and a missed field goal hurting the ‚ÄòHoos dearly.

Mike Hollins ‚Äî who has had ball security issues throughout his college career ‚Äî coughed the ball up at the ODU five-yard line in a play that cost the ‚ÄòHoos at least three and potentially seven points. After the Wahoo defense got a big stop and gave the offense solid field positioning and the potential for a two-minute drive Brennan Armstrong fumbled the ball on the following possession and set the Monarchs up for their first score of the game on a 29-yard touchdown reception with 19 seconds remaining in the second quarter.

Then on Virginia‚Äôs first drive of the second half after two long completions to Keytaon Thompson and Dontayvion Wicks Armstrong failed to pickup a blitzing Monarch on his left side and lost the ball as he got blown up.

Fortunately that field goal from Farrell in the final seconds made those issues inconsequential.

But those three turnovers were absolute killers for a Virginia offense that otherwise was pretty efficient both on the ground and through the air. That said further improvement will be needed particularly in the red-zone

UVA defense continues to be a strength

After only giving up 17 points to the Illinois Fighting Illini last Saturday the Wahoo defense was even stouter against the Monarchs. Outside of a few chunk gains via the running game and the 29-yard touchdown when ODU‚Äôs best receiver ‚Äî Ali Jennings ‚Äî got a one-on-one with linebacker Josh Ahern ODU didn‚Äôt get much going all game.

The defensive line brought solid pressure and racked up three sacks on ODU quarterback Hayden Wolff with Aaron Faumui Chico Bennett Jr. and Kam Butler all bringing down the sophomore. In the running game UVA only let up 89 yards on 32 carries a significant improvement after allowing nearly 200 yards to Illinois and 170 to Richmond.

On top of that sophomores Lex Long and Jonas Sanker are continuing to impress in the secondary as UVA‚Äôs stable of safeties have been a surprising strength of this defense despite various players missing time. Long had a huge tackle on Old Dominion‚Äôs final drive of the game on 3rd and 12 when the Monarchs were searching for a go-ahead score.

With that unit playing above expectations the defensive line bringing reasonable pressure to opposing quarterbacks and UVA‚Äôs eventual success at holding opponents

Passing game improving but still very shaky

A wobbly Brennan Armstrong pass and completion to Dontayvion Wicks in the second quarter was emblematic of UVA‚Äôs passing offense on the day as a whole. Despite early struggles with under-thrown passes Armstrong eventually got more comfortable throwing the ball and made the plays when the were needed. With 284 yards through the air on 20-37 passing Armstrong broke Virginia‚Äôs all-time passing yards record with a few big throws on the final drive to pull out the victory.

The drop issues that Dontayvion Wicks has had this season are quite troublesome and were another element of the team‚Äôs struggle to nab a comfortable win. The wideout had just four catches on 14 targets after a similar stat line against Illinois in last Saturday‚Äôs loss.

Hopefully this win will give the passing game the juice it needs going forward and the noticeable improvement in the second half scheming will carry over into ACC competition.

Offensive line far improved from last week

After completely limiting what the offense tried to do against the Fighting Illini the offensive line was far better as a unit in today‚Äôs win. Garrett Tujague‚Äôs group was far from the problem for the ‚ÄòHoos today as it paved the way for a dominant ground game ‚Äî Virginia finished with 229 yards on the ground on 45 carries.

Granted Armstrong made the o-line look better as he escaped pressure and picked up yards scrambling numerous times ‚Äî he had 54 yards on the ground despite taking two sacks. but the core of Jonathan Leech Derek Devine Ty Furnish John Paul Flores and Logan Taylor was better today.

Xavier Brown is going to be very good

Perhaps an underrated performer in today‚Äôs win true freshman running back Xavier Brown provided speed toughness and great vision for UVA today as he rushed for 88 yards on nine carries including a 38-yarder which set up Virginia‚Äôs only touchdown of the game. With Hollins‚Äô struggles Brown seems to have stablished himself alongside Perris Jones as one of the top two backs on the team and should continue to get meaningful carries this season.

While his contributions to the 2022 team are going to be meaningful his potential as the future of UVA‚Äôs running backs is legit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMTcvd29tZW5zLWdvbGYtaGVhZHMtdG8td2lzY29uc2luLWZvci1iYWRnZXItaW52aXRhdGlvbmFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women's Golf Heads to Wisconsin for Badger Invitational,"NORFOLK Va. ‚Äì Old Dominion women's golf starts off its fall 2022 season at the Badger Invitational this Sunday through Tuesday Sept. 18-20. Wisconsin is hosting at the University Ridge Golf Course in Madison Wisconsin.

The passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act should alleviate semiconductor chip shortages that have increased prices and reduced supplies of cars medical devices and consumer electronics. But it would be premature to declare victory. Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine has squeezed the market for rare gases like helium and neon that are vital to semiconductor production ‚Äì highlighting our continued vulnerability in an unstable world.

The CHIPS and Science Act will bolster U.S. semiconductor research development and production making critical investments in domestic production of the building blocks of all modern technology. But the legislation does not solve the quandary of sourcing rare earth materials and gases from China Russia and other geopolitical rivals. There is a vital need for more financial support for materials producers. Without it building a semiconductor gases and chemicals plant in the United States will be prohibitively expensive for most chemical manufacturers ‚Äì forcing us to continue to rely on imports from unstable regions. Additionally the aftermath of COVID-19 will continue to increase production uncertainty and the risk of logistics interruptions putting U.S. supply-chain imports at further risk.

TECHCET and the Critical Materials Council have been actively tracing supply chain origins and disruptions emanating from Russia and elsewhere. The Russia-Ukraine disruptions are especially alarming since both countries are major global sources of semiconductor-grade rare gases. To put this into perspective TECHCET estimates that 40-50% of the world‚Äôs semiconductor-grade neon comes from Ukraine. Additionally Russian state-owned Gazprom one of the world‚Äôs largest natural gas and helium providers ramped up production.

in response to global helium supply concerns following COVID-19. This put Russia on track to produce a third of the world‚Äôs helium. However sanctions on Russia have made it much more difficult to obtain helium from Gazprom and other material suppliers.

Furthermore the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is scheduled this month to dispose of the Federal Helium System which will cause severe delays in the delivery of helium located in BLM stores. With the government out of the helium business as of the end of the month the semiconductor and other industries will have to wrestle with pricing uncertainty as well as access uncertainty vis-a-vis helium which is vital in the manufacturing process. As shown above in Figure 1 without Russian sources TECHCET predicts a shortage in helium of approximately 1.5 Billion cubic feet (BCF) by 2026.

China presents its own complications. Due to tariffs on Chinese exports the ongoing effects of the pandemic on global commerce and sporadic price spiking the flow of materials such as chemicals and metals from China has become irregular. In the past Chinese material companies have unexpectedly lowered their prices to gain market share while increasing prices for raw/starting materials as illustrated with phosphate used for phosphoric acid in Figure 2 below. This practice sometimes characterized as dumping often damages the profitability and viability of competitor companies causing chipmakers to be more dependent on materials from the Chinese market. Today China is a leading supplier of raw materials needed for chip manufacturing.

Asia also dominates the market for Ultra-High Purity (UHP) wet chemicals that are used to oxidize the silicon in semiconductor chips. Currently all of the UHP purity sulfuric acid in the United States is imported from Asia‚Äì and many of the material supply chains in Asia are dependent upon raw materials from China. For all semiconductor-grade wet chemicals TECHCET estimates that there needs to be a 37-49% increase in supply over the next four years to meet projected needs for U.S. chip expansions. Without adding capacity to produce ultra-high purity chemicals the U.S. will have to import 97% or more of the ultra-high purity chemicals needed for chip fabricators.

All these challenges converge on a single point: the need for more local and dispersed production of these vital components of semiconductor production. When unexpected problems hit ‚Äì such as war pandemics and trade complications ‚Äì supply chains strain and cannot successfully keep up with required demand. This is especially problematic given that chip demand is only expected to keep growing in 2024-2025 and beyond.

Fortunately there is an alternative to our reliance on problematic foreign sources. It starts with increasing materials production expansion efforts in the U.S. which must draw on support from the CHIPS and Science Act. By taking the right steps today we can ensure that our domestic semiconductor industry continues to power innovation and economic growth for decades to come.

Chip factories have long been considered the biggest culprit in the computing industry behind climate change.



Advancing abatement technologies to reduce carbon emissions is the top priority in the Samsung Electronics semiconductor unit's goal to become carbon neutral by 2050 a top official said Friday.



""Treatment of gas used to manufacture semiconductor chips is our biggest focus in our spending (to achieve net-zero emissions)"" Song Doo-guen executive vice president and head of the Environment ÔºÜ Safety Center at Samsung Electronics told reporters at a briefing in Seoul.



A major cause of greenhouse gas emissions is process gas a byproduct of key chipmaking processes such as etching and deposition.



According to an estimate by McKinsey ÔºÜ Co. in May process gases were liable for 80 percent of the carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions among chip fabs' direct emissions.



Such byproducts such as perfluorocarbon or hydroflourocarbon compounds have a bigger global warming potential than carbon dioxide and also an extremely long lifespan in the atmosphere of up to 50000 years the report also showed.



To decompose process gas Samsung which produced 15.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2021 is seeking to maximize the efficiency of catalysts under a ""regenerative catalytic system.""



""The core technology of the regenerative catalytic system lies in the introduction of a new catalyst and this is the barrier challenge and target technology-wise"" Song said.



Meanwhile natural gas used in boilers to control the temperature and humidity inside the fabs also generate huge amounts of carbon when burnt.



Song claimed there is no existing alternative that can replace natural gas even though it is responsible for carbon emissions.



Instead capturing and reusing waste heat would be an option to reduce carbon emissions from boilers. Samsung is working to develop carbon capture and storage technology in its in-house research unit Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology and apply the technology from 2030.



According to Song replacing gas-fueled boilers with electricity-powered boilers would rather increase carbon emissions as it would still require massive amounts of electricity.



""We need more technologies ready for use in order to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from our end"" Song said.

Such abatement technologies are a core part of Samsung Electronics' renewed green commitment under the ""New Environmental Strategy"" unveiled Thursday aimed at fully transitioning to renewable energy and achieving net-zero emissions.



Samsung has pledged a 7 trillion won ($5 billion) investment to achieve its climate ambitions and announced that it had recently joined RE100 a coalition comprising 380 global enterprises committed to becoming 100 percent renewable.



Alongside the plan to cut direct carbon emissions Samsung has also laid out a raft of plans to reduce indirect emissions mainly by pursuing ultralow-power chip products.



Other eco-conscious plans it has drawn up include capping the maximum use of freshwater to 300000 tons a day by 2030 and eradicating gaseous and liquid pollutants by 2040 with treatment technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2NoaW5hcy1jaGlwLW91dHB1dC1zaHJpbmtzLWFzLWluZGlhLXVzLXJhbXAtdXAtbG9jYWwtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NDI3OTY2MC5jbXPSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9jaGluYXMtY2hpcC1vdXRwdXQtc2hyaW5rcy1hcy1pbmRpYS11cy1yYW1wLXVwLWxvY2FsLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk0Mjc5NjYwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's chip output shrinks as India US ramp up local manufacturing,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website IIT Delhi Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit

As India and the US double down on domestic semiconductor manufacturing  China witnessed its biggest-ever monthly decline in chip manufacturing in August owing to Covid restrictions and weakening demand.According to the South China Morning Post the production of integrated circuits (ICs) slumped 24.7 per cent year on year to 24.7 billion units marking the largest single-month decrease since 1997.This is also the second consecutive month of decline for chip manufacturing. In July the output nosedived 16.6 per cent to 27.2 billion units.Local output of microcomputers fell 18.6 per cent to 317.5 billion units in August.In August domestic manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three months the report mentioned.A record 3470 chip-making companies ""went out of business in the first eight months of the year"" according to statistics from business database platform Qichacha.The slump in chip production in China is coming as both India and the US ramp up efforts to bolster local chip manufacturing.The Gujarat government has partnered Vedanta and Foxconn aiming an investment of Rs 1.54 lakh crore to achieve self-reliance in the field of semiconductor manufacturing.India's semiconductor component market is likel to reach $300 billion in cumulative revenues by 2026 as 'Make in India' and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes will boost local sourcing of semi-components in the coming years according to the report by the India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA) and Counterpoint Research.The Indian government has announced an outlay of Rs 76000 crore (around $10 billion) under its PLI scheme separately for the development of a semiconductor and display manufacturing electronics ecosystem.Meanwhile US President Joe Biden has signed into law the Chips and Science Act which provides nearly $52 billion in semiconductor production incentives.Intel has kicked off work on the new $20 billion semiconductor plant in the Ohio state in the US.Samsung has floated an idea of investing nearly $200 billion to build 11 more chip plants in the US over the next two decades."

By Charlene Badasie |

In the realm of streaming wars Paramount+ and Showtime have struggled to compete with giants like Disney+ Netflix and HBO Max. Now to expand its offering Paramount Global has decided to merge its strengths by combining both services into one app. The news follows last year‚Äôs move to unify the billing of both streaming platforms with significant discounts as the parent company wanted to give the service an extra boost. New subscribers can sign up for the basic ad-supported combo at just $7.99 a month while the commercial-free version will cost $12.99.

Current subscribers can upgrade their existing plan to the bundle within the app Deadline reports. Once the introductory discount ends on October 2nd the basic subscription will cost $11.99 a month with commercials and $14.99 without. Folks who don‚Äôt want Paramount+ but are still interested in Showtime will still be able to subscribe for $10.99 a month as a stand-alone offering. That offer also applies through third-party distributors. The reverse is also possible with a slight adjustment to the price. A standalone Paramount+ membership will cost $4.99 a month with ads or $9.99 without them.

However there is one small catch. Live sporting events are not part of the ad-free option although Showtime programming will not carry commercials when viewed via the combined app. Speaking about the app merger President and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Global Streaming Tom Ryan said the Paramount+ and Showtime bundle offers folks unprecedented value by providing a vast streaming content library at some of the lowest prices on the market. ‚ÄúThis singular user experience streamlines sign-up and enhances discovery‚Äù he told Variety.

Ryan added that the lower price will also allow more households to enjoy the combined entertainment offering from Paramount+ and Showtime. Content on the former currently includes original series like 1883 Halo Star Trek: Discovery and Secret Headquarters. There are also a slew of upcoming originals like Tulsa King On the Come Up Criminal Minds Wolf Pack and 1923 debuting this fall. Meanwhile Showtime‚Äôs popular shows include Billions Yellowjackets The Chi and Dexter: New Blood. There‚Äôs also new programming like American Gigolo and Let the Right One In premiering soon.

Interestingly Paramount+ subscribers outside the United States already have access to Showtime. The service is offered by default within the international streaming platform. According to Tech Crunch Paramount+ recently launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland with plans to expand into Austria France Germany Italy Switzerland Africa and the Middle East. The streaming service was also launched in South Korea in partnership with TVING. It plans to include India in partnership with Viacom 18. In the second quarter Paramount+ added 4.9 million subscribers reaching 43.3 million overall.

The Paramount+ with Showtime offering comes as Warner Bros Discovery works to combine HBO Max and Discovery+ into a single platform in 2023. But the company has not revealed pricing or packaging details at this time. Meanwhile Disney‚Äôs three-way bundle of Disney+ ESPN+ and Hulu has been a major success since its 2020 introduction. While each service remains separate Hulu is expected to migrate to Disney+ once the House of Mouse gains full control in 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMvbmV3cy8zN3RoLWFubnVhbC1tYWxpYnUtdHJpYXRobG9uLWJyaW5ncy1pbi1odW5kcmVkcy1vZi1jb250ZXN0YW50cy1mb3ItZ29vZC1jYXVzZS_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbG9zYW5nZWxlcy9uZXdzLzM3dGgtYW5udWFsLW1hbGlidS10cmlhdGhsb24tYnJpbmdzLWluLWh1bmRyZWRzLW9mLWNvbnRlc3RhbnRzLWZvci1nb29kLWNhdXNlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2XU Malibu Triathlon raises more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research,"More than 5000 athletes put their physical stamina to the test Sunday at the Malibu Triathlon in Zuma Beach Sunday.

The 37th annual triathlon has raised more than $16 million since its inception to raise awareness of childhood cancer and ultimately provide key funds pediatric research at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

This triathlon is an iconic event that has brought together athletes celebrities fortune 500 companies and everyone in between to raise awareness and money for pediatric cancer research.

CBSLA

This year's field included some CBSLA and Paramount team members including CBS News Morning Anchor Marci Gonzalez and Meteorologist Alex Biston.

Both Gonzalez and Biston were part of Team Paramount's relay team. More than 40 employees across all divisions of Paramount Global participated in the triathlon and have raised almost $15000 to support pediatric cancer research for CHLA.

Moreover there was also participants who have been personally impacted by either cancer or the work at CHLA and were at Zuma Beach to participate and support the cause.

In his Twitter post (which you can see below via Reynold's Facebook reshare) Reynolds wrote: ‚ÄúI am saddened to say that after many beautiful years together Aja and I have separated. Being great parents to our children is our number one priority. Thank you for always supporting us with love and care for all these years.‚Äù

Sadly this isn‚Äôt the first time that the pair ‚Äì who first got married in March 2011 ‚Äì decided to call it quits as they previously parted back in 2018.

However they decided to give it another go the following year with Volkman explaining to Parents in November 2019:

I sacrificed so many things he was away and we both had an identity crisis. Neither of us could feel fully committed to playing music or being a parent. . . . From the minute he was gone my soul had a hole in it. . . . We didn‚Äôt speak much to each other for seven months. Then we started dating again. We got a second chance at our marriage. . . . Parenting has been the most thrilling fulfilling part of our relationship and our life. Marriage is work. Keeping a family together is a lot of work.

Reynolds and Volkman have four children together: 10-year-old Arrow Eve 2-year-old Valentine and 5-year-old twins Gia James and Coca Rae.

Naturally Reynold‚Äôs tweet has received plenty of support over the last two days. You can see some encouraging reactions below:

He'll be joined by some of the biggest acts from the 90s.

Rapper Snoop Dogg is headlining a major music festival and iconic West Coast acts are joining him. The festival will be held in California this fall. Out of the performers Bone Thugs-N-Harmony will take the stage. The group announced it‚Äôs part of their farewell concert as they are retiring as a group.

The tour is a collaboration between Snoop Dogg and other legendary West Coast acts

The Long Beach California native recently announced his High Hopes Concert series in collaboration with producer and agent Bobby Dee. The lineup for Snoop Dogg‚Äôs music festival includes Ice Cube Method Man Cypress Hill Redman Xzibit Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound.

The performance will be held in Ontario California on Nov. 19. Tickets are currently available for purchase at Ticketmaster. Prices range from $49 to about $300 with mostly general admission for the festival.

Also joining the series is Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. All five of its members ‚Äî Krayzie Layzie Bizzy Wish and Flesh ‚Äî will take the stage. The group originated in Cleveland Ohio and gained traction in the early ‚Äô90s after signing to Eazy-E‚Äôs Ruthless Records.

The group‚Äôs biggest hit is ‚ÄúTha Crossroads‚Äù a tribute to then-recently deceased Eazy-E. It earned them a Grammy Award in 1997. Several of its members have since transitioned into reality television on shows like We TV‚Äôs Growing Up Hip Hop.

It‚Äôs a farewell concert for Bone Thugs-N-Harmony

The festival will be one of the full group‚Äôs final performances. It comes after Bizzy‚Äôs song ‚ÄúBizzy Get‚Äôs Busy‚Äù recently questioned why the other members of the group had performed without him. However the group reunited for a Verzuz against Three Six Mafia.

Things have since settled down between the group. According to The Jasmine Brand Bizzy‚Äôs manager reportedly promised the rapper will attend Snoop Dogg‚Äôs music festival.

The group has been in the news as of late due to reports of being set up by Suge Knight in the ‚Äò90s

In early September Bone Thugs-N-Harmony began trending after news broke that Suge Knight allegedly offered $10000 to have them attacked in 1995. During a recent interview with The Art of Dialogue Krayzie Bone claimed the former Death Row Records owner put a hit out on him and his group members to be attacked at that year‚Äôs Source Awards.

‚ÄúWhen we was at the Source Awards they told me they was gonna pay somebody $10000 to run up there and sling on [us] with a cane‚Äù he alleged. There was a lot of beef going on back then it was intense. I remember that Source Awards being very intense. It was wild.‚Äù

He continued: ‚ÄúThey told us that [Suge] had called a meeting one time and told everybody to look at our videos. One of us was wearing a Georgetown Bulldogs beanie but we had a New York Yankees ‚Äî we had different [hats].

Jacob Rees-Mogg the business and industrial strategy secretary recently appointed to the post by new Prime Minister Liz Truss cleared the proposed $7.3 billion merger saying the deal did not pose a threat to British national security.

The U.S. communications giant launched its bid to acquire Inmarsat last November. The proposed merger has been awaiting the outcome of a government probe as to whether the deal should be approved under new legislation designed to block mergers that are contrary to the national interest.

That hurdle has now been cleared but the merger still has some approval hurdles to overcome.

The U.K. Competitions and Market Authority launched its own investigation Aug. 9 into whether the deal would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the U.K. for goods or services.

The results of that probe are expected to be announced Oct 5.

‚ÄúThe deal requires a series of regulatory processes which includes reviews by the Competition and Markets Authority and in the European Union. The CMA review is ongoing‚Äù said a company spokesperson. ‚ÄúWe are working closely with them as they conduct their review and will update the market in due course.‚Äù

Both companies already serve the British defense and security market and both are vying for a slice of the Ministry of Defence‚Äôs ¬£6 billion ($6.9 billion) Skynet 6 satellite communications program elements of which are already in competition.

Inmarsat is a provider of satellite-based communications services to aviation shipping and government departments including the MoD.

Mark Dankberg Viasat‚Äôs executive chairman and CEO said the merger would allow Viasat to deepen its commitment to the British market.

Viasat has pledged to increase job numbers and research spending in Britain if the deal goes ahead.

‚ÄúViasat has been a trusted partner of the U.K.‚Äôs defense and national security communities for more than a decade including in the provision of its market-leading encryption products. The combined company whose global international business headquarters will be situated in the U.K. will build upon the strong U.K. relationships that Viasat and Inmarsat already enjoy and allow us to deepen our contribution to the U.K.‚Äôs National Space Strategy‚Äù Dankberg said in a statement.

If the deal goes ahead it will be the third major sale of British defense industrial capabilities to U.S. companies in a matter of months.

Parker Hannifin‚Äôs purchase of aerospace and defense company Meggitt and the sale of Ultra Electronics to the U.S.-owned Cobham Group have both been pushed through in the last few months.

He then lowered his head as his tears slowly trickled down his cheeks.

Austin Gamblers teammate Lucas Divino rubbed Ezekiel‚Äôs back as he continued to mourn the passing of his cousin less than a week ago in Salt Lake City.

Ezekiel never doubted that he would return to the arena this weekend for Freedom Fest in Oklahoma City. If there were ever a place he could be during such a difficult time it would likely be inside the locker room with his bull-riding brethren. It was there that he and Ouncie brought hundreds of smiles and laughter over the past three years.

‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt want me sitting over here pouting‚Äù Mitchell said before Austin‚Äôs game on Friday night. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here this weekend. That‚Äôs just all we can do. We‚Äôre cowboys. He was a cowboy. He‚Äôs going to live on and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do ‚Äì try to be the best cowboy.‚Äù

Mitchell admittedly has not slept much in the past week and it was a lot more difficult making the drive to Oklahoma City than he initially expected.

‚ÄúI felt okay up until driving up here this morning‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúThat was hard and it‚Äôs pretty hard because Ouncie loved pretty much everybody in these locker rooms too. And to see everybody and the support and the fans walking in everybody‚Äôs just so apologetic. And I just think it‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs a very beautiful thing to know how many lives that he touched and he was able to reach.‚Äù

Ezekiel and Ouncie developed a friendship in their teenage years when they bonded over their love for bull riding throughout Houston and the surrounding Texas communities despite their similar but different personalities.

Ezekiel was always the outgoing one of the two but he said not to let Ouncie fool you as he was quite the singer and dancer too beyond his tremendous fishing skills.

‚ÄúHe was kind of the more quiet person but he was also the same fun-loving guy and he would dance with me and BS and sing‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôve been too many nights driving to and from PBRs and just singing our lungs out even though I can‚Äôt really sing. He could sing a little bit better than I can.‚Äù

Growing up both teenagers had gold buckle dreams and their careers began to skyrocket into the mainstream in 2019. The two finished first and second at the season-opening Velocity Tour event in Ontario California.

That November night began their march to qualifying for the 2019 PBR World Finals.

Ezekiel‚Äôs win in Ontario propelled him onto the Unleash The Beast and it wasn‚Äôt long before Ouncie would compete at four UTB events that year. Ouncie eventually joined Ezekiel in Las Vegas for the World Finals as a Wild Card winner at the Velocity Tour Finals despite a broken leg earlier that season. Inside the South Point Hotel Casino & Spa Arena Ezekiel cheered his lungs out in support of his cousin every step of the way at those Velocity Tour Finals.

‚ÄúThere are two memories that stick out to me the most‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúFrom Ontario California whenever I won my first Velocity. That was really cool because we always talked about finishing first and second at one of these Velocities and we were able to do that. Then we made our first PBR World Finals together. He had to take a little bit different route to get there because he broke his femur that year and for him to make the Finals that year was pretty cool for me.

‚ÄúIt was special because it was a goal of both of ours and I‚Äôm glad he got to achieve that one.‚Äù

Ezekiel was also keeping an eye on Ouncie‚Äôs push to qualify for his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo this year.

Ouncie had won the bull riding competition at the Tri-State Rodeo in Fort Madison Iowa just days before his passing with an 87.5-point ride on Too Tropical. He was ranked No. 23 in the PRCA‚Äôs bull riding standings and second in the rodeo association‚Äôs Rookie of the Year bull riding standings.

‚ÄúPRCA was going to have him over at the NFR this year if they weren‚Äôt careful because he was on fire and it didn‚Äôt look like he was slowing down any at all‚Äù Ezekiel said.

Ezekiel says the best thing he can do now is to try and keep Ouncie‚Äôs legacy going as best he can.

He wants to go at his bull riding career the way Ouncie always told him to.

The same phrase has been echoing throughout his mind as he attempted practice bulls this week to try and give himself a mental escape from his emotions.

‚Äú‚ÄòSpur! Spur Zeke! You can‚Äôt ride bulls like that‚Äô‚Äù Ezekiel could hear in his mind and heart. ‚Äú‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt keep your feet at them. You learn how to ride bulls spurring. Just spur. Go back to doing you.

‚ÄòBe a Mitchell! Be a Mitchell! Be a Mitchell!‚Äô‚Äù

Ezekiel paused before looking inside the locker room where he would have liked to see his cousin preparing his bull rope.

‚ÄúGod dang I am going to miss him‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy deal now is just to stay on all my bulls and just don‚Äôt let his legacy die. I hope that I can do my damnedest and spur the sucker.‚Äù

GAFFNEY AND GAMBLERS STAFF OFFERING A LISTENING EAR

Mitchell bucked off for the Gamblers on Friday night in the team‚Äôs loss to Oklahoma but he will be right back in the starting lineup when Austin (10-7 Freedom Fest 0-1) takes on the Nashville Stampede (4-13 Freedom Fest 0-1).

Austin head coach Michael Gaffney knows how hard it can be to compete with a heavy heart. Of course Gaffney understands his situation was very different than his rider‚Äôs but he said he struggled mentally when he returned to competition two weeks after the passing of his traveling partner Brent Thurman at the 1994 National Finals Rodeo.

‚ÄúI remember sitting in the locker room in the Ector County Coliseum in Odessa Texas and people started talking to me about it‚Äù Gaffney then 25 years old recalled. ‚ÄúI remember halfway through that night I was not wanting to be there. But looking back it was that old ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got to get back in the saddle‚Äô thing. It took me about six to eight months but it was good to be around my (bull riding) family.‚Äù

Gaffney and General Manager JJ Gottsch have kept in contact with Mitchell throughout the week and offered a helping hand and listening ear.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the ‚ÄòHow are you doing? Keep your head up‚Äô and I just listen‚Äù Gaffney said. ‚ÄúJust listen to him. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done. It is just that kind of support but we definitely will talk whenever he wants. If he‚Äôs had enough of it because he‚Äôs probably been inundated with it that is okay too.

‚ÄúWe are here for him.‚Äù

Ouncie Mitchell is survived by his 4-year-old daughter.

The PBR extends its heartfelt condolences to Ezekiel Ouncie‚Äôs mother Laquita father Teaspoon and the rest of his family and friends.

The Western Sports Foundation has begun a fundraiser to help the Mitchell family with Ouncie‚Äôs funeral expenses. Click here to donate.

This detailed and candid account shows how social capital fuels start-up growth and should offer insights that will aid industry and policy efforts to better mitigate the exclusionary tendencies of tech bastions in Silicon Valley writes Robyn Klingler-Vidra.

The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs who Shaped Silicon Valley. Jimmy Soni. Simon and Schuster. 2022.

The online payments giant PayPal which now has a market capitalisation of over 100 billion US dollars is important in two ways. One because of the formative role it played in the late 1990s of establishing the infrastructure for how we make payments on the internet particularly in the US. Second because its founders and investors ‚Äì the so-called ‚ÄòPayPal mafia‚Äô ‚Äì have gone on to found and invest in some of the largest technology businesses that underpin much of life today (including LinkedIn Tesla and YouTube).

Jimmy Soni‚Äôs The Founders gives an account of the founders ‚Äì and early employees ‚Äì of PayPal. The book is told as a story of this incredible cast of characters their big personalities their epic battles (including the merger of Confinity and X.com which together formed PayPal) and their intense work culture. The writing is compelling a sort of real-life version of HBO‚Äôs Silicon Valley based upon Soni‚Äôs interviews with the founders and his forensic analysis of 20 years of interviews and speeches they‚Äôve delivered.

The key characters (who you have a love-hate relationship with across the book!) include Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. You meet them in their formative years. For this researcher the book offers wonderfully rich insight into how universities act as fertile ground for high-performing tech firms. The story is framed around how the founders met while studying at university together especially at Stanford University (in the case of Thiel and Ken Howery) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) (in the case of Marc Andreesen Max Levchin Luke Nosek and Scott Banister).

We often hear about certain schools adorning the paths of the founders of top performing technology firms. Stanford professor Ilya Strebulaev and his Venture Capital Initiative found that Harvard Stanford and Wharton are the top three unicorn-producing business schools. Such findings validate our impression that certain places have some sort of magic in their ability to produce world-leading firms.

But what happens at those universities? Is it the classroom interactions and curriculum that sprinkle unicorn dust? Or is it the mingling at parties and clubs that fosters the ability to found and build high-growth companies? Do universities serve an entrepreneurship-infused Kool-Aid boosting entrepreneurial intentions?

The Founders details the university education and training ‚Äì which social scientists call ‚Äòhuman capital‚Äô ‚Äì that fosters the abilities of such performers. Gary S. Becker‚Äôs Human Capital for instance delineates the resource as comprising ‚Äògeneral‚Äô and ‚Äòspecific‚Äô human capital. General capital refers to transferrable skills applicable to a number of industrial settings. Specific human capital in contrast is sector-specific.

In the case of the ‚ÄòPayPal mafia‚Äô there is a remarkable concentration of specific human capital particularly training in computer science. The Founders is adorned with the life stories of long-time computer programmers (for example Levchin) complemented by a smaller number of those with social science backgrounds (notably Thiel who studied philosophy and then completed law school).

The human capital that the PayPal founders crafted through their formal university education is certainly part of their story. But the book effectively chronicles how it is social capital ‚Äì distinct from human capital ‚Äì that played the central role. This aligns with seminal sociology scholarship (see Pierre Bourdieu (1986) and James S. Coleman (1988)) that similarly argues that human and social capital are distinct sets of resources albeit very much interrelated.

Social capital is understood to be a fundamentally relational resource one that comprises social networks that help people access financing jobs and other opportunities. Key work on social capital includes that of Mark Granovetter on the ‚Äòstrength of weak ties‚Äô. He argues that it is ‚Äòweak ties‚Äô rather than the ‚Äòstrong ties‚Äô of close family or friends that can help produce job opportunities. These connections foster social trust which acts as a ‚Äòsociological super glue‚Äô for transactions and relationships.

The story of The Founders is one of social interactions. It is these rather than what they were learning in the classroom that led to key hires that helped drive PayPal‚Äôs performance. Clubs and labs ‚Äì such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in the ‚ÄòDigital Computer Lab‚Äô at UIUC (9) and the co-founding of the Stanford Review ‚Äì fostered long-lasting relationships. For instance Nosek Levchin and Banister met at the ACM office at UIUC. Banister and Nosek would later set out to Silicon Valley together and co-founded a start-up. Levin later recruited Simmons who he had also met ‚Äòworking on ACM projects‚Äô (66). Spending long hours at university clubs and labs fostered the forming of ‚Äòstrong ties‚Äô ‚Äì they knew each other‚Äôs aptitude and work ethic.

These deep relationships informed in-network hiring practices for years. Soni remarks that ‚ÄòNosek Pan and Simmons were friends from Illinois; other early employees came through that network and Thiel‚Äôs Stanford contacts‚Äô (72). The ‚ÄòPayPal mafia‚Äô relied on these trusted relationships when hiring for their growing business both at Confinity and at X.com the predecessor firms that ultimately merged to form PayPal. The book replays a conversation between Thiel and Levchin where Thiel pushes Levchin to recruit from his network saying: ‚ÄòYou just graduated from one of the better computer science programs in the country. You don‚Äôt know anyone?‚Äô (65)

This prompt led to Levchin hiring two of his former UIUC classmates Yu Pan and Simmons. This aligned with Thiel‚Äôs view that ‚Äòtrust among teams was hard to build and that friends-turned-employees came preinstalled with trust‚Äô (72). However PayPal‚Äôs COO David Sacks was quoted as saying that this school network-based hiring wasn‚Äôt necessarily everyone‚Äôs ambition. Rather he stated that because of the ultra-competitive environment in Silicon Valley around the millennium ‚Äòwe had to recruit our friends because no one else would work for us‚Äô (74).

Second school networks offered access to investment capital. Thiel‚Äôs initial involvement with the predecessor to PayPal was through his investment. His fund Thiel Capital invested in Nosek and Banister‚Äôs start-up after they were introduced through Thiel‚Äôs roommate at Stanford. Future investors also came from their social network. Confinity for example raised money from ‚Äòfriends family and fools‚Äô (as is typical). The friends and family included Thiel‚Äôs parents as well as Norman Book Thiel‚Äôs classmate at Stanford and co-founder of the Stanford Review (70). Stanford professors like Dan Boneh and Martin Hellman vouched for Levchin when asked by prospective investors (82).

For Soni the notion of the ‚ÄòPayPal mafia‚Äô is essential to understanding Silicon Valley today. Lead venture capitalists like Andreesen and high-profile entrepreneurs such as Musk continue to feature in headlines. Andreesen‚Äôs blue-chip venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) just came under fire for its $350 million investment in WeWork founder Adam Neumann‚Äôs new start-up Flow. For many this epitomises the tendency of Silicon Valley venture capitalists to back the founders they know.

As the huge fundraise by Flow suggests there can be a downside to start-ups relying on social capital to hire and raise money. For the PayPal setting as Soni notes ‚Äòhiring friends risks a cloistered exclusionary monoculture and made it exceptionally hard to let people go‚Äô (72). Hiring those like you ‚Äì called ‚Äòhomophily‚Äô ‚Äì has been widely documented for fostering singular cultures that do not accept or value outsiders or even outside perspectives. Network-based growth can also accentuate exclusions based on gender ethnicity age and disability. Policies work to reverse this exclusion to foster more ‚Äòinclusive innovation‚Äô environments.

The Founders shows how social capital ‚Äì not necessarily human capital ‚Äì fuels start-up growth. It reveals why and how such insider networks work and how they backfire. For entrepreneurship researchers it offers phenomenally detailed and candid accounts of how certain campuses engender unicorn birth. With this insight industry and policy efforts can better design alternatives to university lab-fuelled trust and monocultures to mitigate the exclusionary tendencies of tech bastions like Silicon Valley.

And the National Basketball Players Association later made its stance clear with executive director Tamika Tremaglio telling ESPN that NBA players want Sarver banned for life.

PayPal said its current partnership deal with the Suns ends after the coming 2022-23 season meaning it will expire during Sarver‚Äôs one-year suspension from the NBA. Sarver was suspended this week plus fined $10m after an investigation showed a pattern of lewd misogynistic and racist speech and conduct during his 18 years as owner of the Suns.

In a statement PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman pointed to his company‚Äôs ‚Äústrong record of combatting racism sexism and all forms of discrimination‚Äù and said Sarver‚Äôs conduct is ‚Äúunacceptable and in conflict with our values‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn light of the findings of the NBA‚Äôs investigation we will not renew our sponsorship should Robert Sarver remain involved with the Suns organization after serving his suspension‚Äù Schulman said.

Schulman said PayPal will remain supportive of the team its players ‚Äúand the experienced and diverse talent now leading the organization‚Äù including coach Monty Williams general manager James Jones assistant general manager Morgan Cato and senior vice president of people and culture Kim Corbitt.

Williams Jones Cato and Corbitt are Black. The investigation into Sarver showed he ‚Äúrepeated or purported to repeat the N-word on at least five occasions spanning his tenure with the Suns‚Äù though it noted that the independent lawyers hired by the NBA to conduct the probe made ‚Äúno finding that Sarver used this racially insensitive language with the intent to demean or denigrate‚Äù.

PayPal‚Äôs statement came one day after Suns vice chairman Jahm Najafi called for Sarver to resign saying there should be ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù for lewd misogynistic and racist conduct in any workplace. Some players including Suns guard Chris Paul ‚Äî a past president of the National Basketball Players Association ‚Äî and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James also have said the NBA‚Äôs sanctions of Sarver did not go far enough.

Those statements from Paul and James came Wednesday hours after NBA commissioner Adam Silver detailed some of his reasons for deciding a suspension and fine were the proper sanctions. On Friday Tremaglio told ESPN the union ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù wants Sarver ousted from the league.

‚ÄúWhile we understand that there has been a thorough investigation and we‚Äôre very pleased that the NBA was able to follow through on that because that‚Äôs clearly something that we want to see happen we also want to make it very clear that we do not want him back in a position where he will be impacting our players and those who serve our players on a daily basis‚Äù Tremaglio said in a televised interview.

The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) executive director Tamika Tremaglio has called for a lifetime ban of Phoenix Suns and Mercury owner Robert Sarver while PayPal has threatened to end its sponsorship with the team if he remains as team owner.

Appearing on ESPN‚Äôs NBA Today with Malika Andrews on Friday Tremaglio was asked to clarify her stance having posted a Twitter thread on Thursday in which she said that Sarver should never hold a managerial position again.

When asked whether she meant a lifetime ban for Sarver Tremaglio agreed.

‚ÄúWe are absolutely calling for that‚Äù Tremaglio said. ‚ÄúWe do not want him to be in a position where he is managing or engaging with individuals who are engaging with our players or our players themselves.

‚ÄúWe are absolutely clear from the findings that are in that report that we do not want him to be in that position.‚Äù

On Tuesday the NBA announced it had fined Sarver $10 million and suspended him for a year after an independent investigation found he engaged in hostile racially insensitive and inappropriate behavior.

The report commissioned by the NBA last fall found Sarver had ‚Äúengaged in conduct that clearly violated common workplace standards as reflected in team and League rules and policies. This conduct included the use of racially insensitive language; unequal treatment of female employees; sex-related statements and conduct; and harsh treatment of employees that on occasion constituted bullying.‚Äù

Part of the findings found Sarver had ‚Äúon at least five occasions during his tenure with the Suns/Mercury organization repeated the N-word when recounting the statements of others.‚Äù

He also ‚Äúengaged in instances of inequitable conduct toward female employees made many sex-related comments in the workplace made inappropriate comments about the physical appearance of female employees and other women and on several occasions engaged in inappropriate physical conduct toward male employees.‚Äù

When asked Tremaglio said she was ‚Äúspeaking on behalf of our players.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is our players‚Äô desire that while we understand that there has been a thorough investigation and we‚Äôre very pleased that the NBA was able to follow through on that ‚Äî because that‚Äôs clearly something we want to see happen ‚Äî we also want to make it very clear that we do not want him back in a position where he will be impacting our players and those who serve our players on a daily basis.‚Äù

Also on Friday PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said the global technology platform and digital payments company will not renew its sponsorship with the Suns if Sarver stays with the team.

‚ÄúPayPal is a values-driven company and has a strong record of combatting racism sexism and all forms of discrimination‚Äù Schulman said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe have reviewed the report of the NBA league‚Äôs independent investigation into Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver and have found his conduct unacceptable and in conflict with our values.‚Äù

In October 2018 the Suns announced PayPal would be the team‚Äôs first-ever jersey patch partner.

‚ÄúPayPal‚Äôs sponsorship with the Suns is set to expire at the end of the current season. In light of the findings of the NBA‚Äôs investigation we will not renew our sponsorship should Robert Sarver remain involved with the Suns organization after serving his suspension‚Äù the statement continued.

‚ÄúWhile we strongly reject the conduct of Robert Sarver we remain supportive of the team its players and the experienced and diverse talent now leading the organization including Head Coach Monty Williams General Manager James Jones Assistant General Manager Morgan Cato and Senior Vice President of People and Culture Kim Corbitt. ‚Äú

On Thursday in an open letter to Phoenix Suns employees and players team vice chairman Jahm Najafi called on Sarver to resign while NBA greats LeBron James and Chris Paul have criticized the NBA for the punishment handed to the Suns owner.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver explained why Sarver wasn‚Äôt given a lifetime ban for his comments.

Silver said per NBA.com: ‚ÄúThe equivalent of a $10 million fine and a one-year suspension I don‚Äôt know how to measure that against a job. I don‚Äôt have the right to take away his team ‚Ä¶ but to me the consequences are severe.‚Äù

The MoU aims to strengthen efforts toward achieving a zero-waste future for the university campus and challenges students to dig deeper into the issue of plastic waste and the benefits of a circular economy through academic research. It also encourages students to find solutions to common challenges and work toward minimizing waste on the campus in ways that can be implemented at scale across universities.

Students will have access to guest lectures by senior PepsiCo leadership aimed at nurturing an environment where they can gain practical knowledge of the subject. The company will also set up collection points to encourage students to recycle better and eventually transform the university into a zero-waste campus.

Eugene Willemsen chief executive Africa Middle East and South Asia PepsiCo said: ‚ÄúFor over 65 years now the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been our home. We consider ourselves strategic partners in the realization of the Kingdom‚Äôs Vision 2030 rooted in sustainability. Guided by PepsiCo Positive (pep+) PepsiCo‚Äôs strategic end-to-end transformation for driving long-term sustainability we are working toward building a circular and inclusive value chain globally. Through the partnership with Prince Sultan University we are confident about translating our sustainability ambition into tangible action in Saudi Arabia inspiring the youth to lead as ambassadors of sustainable living.‚Äù

Dr. Ahmed Yamani president of PSU said: ‚ÄúPSU is committed to applying the UN SDG 2030 in line with Saudi Vision 2030. Our partnership with PepsiCo demonstrates our continued commitment to working closely with the industry and positively impacting the community. PSU is truly proud to be directly linked to one of the milestone changes in the higher education system in this country and that is the future of private higher education.‚Äù

Professor Mohammad Nurunnabi director of Center for Sustainability and Climate at PSU and aide to the president on ranking and internationalization said: ‚ÄúWe are proud to partner with PepsiCo a world-leading multinational company given their significant commitments on sustainability. This partnership aligns with our vision to provide the Middle East with quality education of the highest international standard and our commitment to Saudi Vision 2030. We‚Äôre delighted to come together to provide tangible solutions to combat sustainability challenges.‚Äù

Across the MENA region PepsiCo is accelerating its efforts toward a more sustainable food system as it leads the evolution toward eco-conscious consumption in a circular economy. Last year PepsiCo launched the ‚ÄúFood for Thought‚Äù platform which aims to democratize conversations about food security and sustainability by bringing together multiple stakeholders from across the food chain. The MoU with Prince Sultan University is one way PepsiCo is bringing this to life in Saudi Arabia.

Over the years PepsiCo has worked closely with its bottling partners in Saudi Arabia to ensure that large amounts of plastic are diverted from landfills. PepsiCo and key partners such as mass waste collector WASCO and environmental solution provider Naqaa have installed 16 smart solar-powered sorting machines to collect and sort empty plastic bottles in Makkah and placed 80 recycling stations at the Dakar Rally venue in Jeddah.

In addition PepsiCo has also signed an MoU with the National Waste Management Center launched community recycling projects and has partnered with Diriyah Gate Authority to collect plastic increase recycling rates and raise awareness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbXlyZXB1YmxpY2EubmFnYXJpa25ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvMTMxNzIwL9IBWGh0dHA6Ly9teXJlcHVibGljYS5uYWdhcmlrbmV0d29yay5jb20vYW1wL3BlcHNpY28tbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LW1vcmUtZml6ei1wZXBzaS1pbi1uZXBhbC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsico launches new ‚Äòmore fizz‚Äô pepsi in Nepal,"KATHMANDU Sept 18: Pepsico has launched new Pepsi with ‚Äòmore fizz‚Äô amidst an event in Kathmandu on Saturday along with brand ambassador and popular actor Pradeep Khadka.

These days you can't swing a canvas tote bag without hitting a Starbucks. Any city-dweller is liable to drive past a dozen or so in the course of a single day's commute. For goodness' sake they've even built Starbucks locations across the street from other Starbucks locations a strategy that Launi Skinner former-senior vice president in charge of store development justified by telling the Los Angeles Times ""Going to the other side of the street can be a barrier.""

At the authorization meeting FDA officials announced the approval of these new boosters for emergency use based on data from eight mice in a Pfizer study. At the same time the FDA revoked authorization for the original monovalent boosters‚Äîmeaning anyone subject to a booster or ‚Äúup-to-date‚Äù mandate will have to take the bivalent booster which has no proven safety or efficacy data in human beings.

While the flu vaccine is also approved on a yearly basis without full trials the mRNA COVID vaccines do not share the flu shot‚Äôs decadeslong track record of observed safety. The population most likely to be mandated to take a bivalent booster consists largely of college students. The young men in this population are the exact demographic that face heightened safety concerns specifically around myocarditis as documented in multiple peer-reviewed studies. In fact during a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend the bivalent boosters the agency presented updated myocarditis data that confirmed the rates of myocarditis in young men were about 2-to-3.5 times higher (slide 35) than the agency had claimed last year (slide 13). Nevertheless the FDA and CDC moved to recommend the bivalent boosters for anyone over the age of 12 without human clinical trials.

This is just the latest episode in the FDA‚Äôs less-than-thorough approach to new COVID vaccine approvals. For example in May 2022 the FDA authorized monovalent Pfizer boosters for children ages 5-11 based on laboratory data that showed heightened antibody response levels in just 67 children.

During the opioid crisis the FDA famously failed to demand adequate research disregarded safety concerns and allowed Purdue Pharma to promote oxycodone for uses that were never borne out by testing. Later it was revealed that the agency had been plagued by ethical issues: When the FDA convened advisers to address mounting oxycodone safety concerns for instance five out of 10 of these advisers had received payments from Purdue and another three had received payments from other opioid manufacturers.

The continuation of unchecked conflicts of interest and several recent authorizations for uses of new medical products that are in many ways unproven demonstrate that the FDA is essentially unresponsive to public outrage culminating in the bizarre spectacle of the agency promoting bivalent boosters on social media through unsubstantiated claims of efficacy acting not as a neutral regulator but actively advertising on behalf of pharmaceutical companies with government purchase contracts. The FDA‚Äôs disregard for its congressional mandate is not unique to this moment‚Äîit is a symptom of its decadeslong transformation into an agency captured by the corporations it is tasked with regulating.

When Kelley Krohnert a mother and career IT expert from Georgia watched the CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting held on June 17 2022 she noted a slide that listed COVID as the fourth-leading cause of death for children under 1 and the fifth-leading cause for children aged 1-4 in the United States. This same slide was originally used at the FDA‚Äôs June 15 Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting when FDA advisers voted to authorize vaccines for children under 5. Krohnert immediately recognized that the slide was citing a preprint by researchers in the United Kingdom. This preprint not only used death statistics that included deaths where COVID was not an underlying cause‚Äîit also compared a 26-month cumulative total for COVID deaths to a 12-month total for other deaths. In Krohnert‚Äôs analysis COVID fell to ninth place for children under 1 and into a four-way tie for eighth place for children aged 1-4. When the researchers corrected their preprint to adjust for some of the errors Krohnert found COVID fell below influenza and pneumonia as a cause of death for children under 5.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have to do a complex statistical analysis to find these errors‚Äù Krohnert told me. ‚ÄúIf this is the standard for what goes into these presentations what kind of vetting is going into that data?‚Äù

This lack of vetting is a central issue in the FDA‚Äôs approval process. The key question for any drug authorization is ‚ÄúDo the benefits outweigh the risks?‚Äù When a disease‚Äôs risks are exaggerated one side of this equation is skewed and the equation is also affected by exaggerating the benefits of a treatment or ignoring the potential risks of that treatment. The data presented in recent FDA meetings has been consistently nonobjective and skewed to favor drug approval.

For the authorization of vaccines for children under 5 boosters for children 5-11 and the new bivalent boosters the FDA has relied heavily on measures of antibody levels as the main ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù side of the equation. This is despite the fact that Pfizer has admitted that there is ‚Äúno established correlate of protection‚Äù between antibody levels and immunity. Both the CDC and the FDA already advise against the use of antibody testing to determine levels of immunity. Essentially this metric has been deemed inadequate by the very regulatory agency that is now consistently accepting it as a substitute for clinical trials.

This lack of real efficacy data has been accompanied by a disregard for potential safety issues. European Union regulators have already warned that frequent boosters can weaken the immune system; the FDA is apparently unconcerned. The FDA also disregarded the fact that for pediatric vaccines Pfizer observed a higher rate of severe COVID in its vaccine group (table 5). Furthermore the FDA allowed the company to ignore 365 symptomatic cases in its trial and to use only the last 10 symptomatic cases after the third dose to claim 80% efficacy (tables 19 and 20). This is significant because Pfizer saw negative efficacy between doses 1 and 2. In a vaccine meant to prevent illness for an age group that is already at extremely low risk this data should have been a red flag for the FDA. Why then has the body charged with protecting Americans from inadequately tested products been so eager not just to authorize these products for emergency use but to enthusiastically recommend them?

Dr. Paul Offit director of the Vaccine Education Center and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia was one of only two advisers who voted against VRBPAC‚Äôs recommendation for reformulated boosters in June. I asked him about his vote as an FDA vaccine adviser and longtime advocate for vaccination. He told me he believed the thinking behind the bivalent boosters was sound. ‚ÄúThe problem for me‚Äù he said ‚Äúwas I just didn‚Äôt think the data that were presented on June 28th to our committee made that case compellingly.‚Äù

I asked Offit if he felt there was political pressure to vote a certain way. ‚ÄúI never feel pressure when I cast my vote‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúI voted no.‚Äù However he said ‚ÄúI think the way that they were presented I think it was clear that the FDA and the World Health Organization wanted to go in this direction.‚Äù It was notable that the day after the FDA‚Äôs vote the White House announced its purchase of 171 million bivalent booster doses from Pfizer and Moderna for $4.9 billion. ‚ÄúYou felt that the train sort of had left the station‚Äù Offit said.

In 2020 the Trump administration was widely criticized for rushing vaccines and pressuring the FDA. Although the Biden administration has exerted similar if not more pressure it has enjoyed a conspicuous absence of criticism. Before the FDA‚Äôs expert panel could even meet to discuss vaccines for children under 5 for example the White House‚Äôs COVID czar Ashish Jha publicly announced a precise date for when they would become available. In other words Jha appeared to know the FDA‚Äôs decision before it had allegedly made one.

Notably President Joe Biden‚Äôs election campaign reversed a long-standing trend of Republican candidates receiving far more campaign donations from the pharmaceutical industry: In 2020 Biden outraised Trump from Big Pharma by a margin of 2 to 1. Several political appointees in the Biden administration moreover have ties to vaccine manufacturers including the president‚Äôs chief campaign strategist Anita Dunn who worked for Pfizer before joining his team. Biden also ran his election campaign on the promise to ‚Äúshut down the virus‚Äù; it turned out that there were more U.S. COVID deaths in 2021 when vaccines were widely available than in 2020 when they were not. Rather than reckon with this fact and readjust its strategy the administration has doubled down by putting increased political pressure on an already compromised FDA.

The public comment section of the June 15 2022 VRBPAC meeting featured several anxious parents who described keeping their infants and toddlers under extreme conditions of isolation over two years after the the beginning of the pandemic. Many FDA panelists argued that in light of these comments it was necessary to authorize the vaccines so that these parents could finally allow their infants and toddlers to experience normal life.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just not an acceptable basis for drug or vaccine authorization‚Äù Dr. Vinay Prasad professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco told me. The purpose of the FDA as a federal regulatory agency is not to simply give people choices or even to address consumer anxiety as such. The FDA‚Äôs focus on parents‚Äô desires as a rationale for approval is particularly significant given that just 5% of children under 5 ended up getting the first dose. Clearly the demand has not been overwhelming. If we wanted unlimited options Prasad explained we wouldn‚Äôt have an FDA at all. ‚ÄúYou can just have a free market where you can have whatever choice you want‚Äù he said. The purpose of the FDA by contrast is ‚Äúto shield us from making very very bad choices.‚Äù

The FDA used to have solid credibility on safety and efficacy but in Prasad‚Äôs view ‚Äúover the last 15 or 20 years in many sectors of the FDA I think there‚Äôs been an erosion in fundamental values and an increase in favoritism toward corporate interests.‚Äù Pharmaceutical companies have been allowed to provide funding for the FDA since 1992; today a full 75% of the FDA‚Äôs scientific review budget comes directly from the industry. There is also the problem of the FDA‚Äôs revolving door. In 2016 Prasad conducted a review of the future jobs of cancer and hematology regulators and found that 57% of those who left the FDA went on to work for the industry. This ‚Äúis sort of a terribly perverse incentive‚Äù Prasad explained. ‚ÄúIf your primary job occupation is to work for the firm across the table how can you be an effective regulator?‚Äù

Currently some of the FDA advisers who have served on VRBPAC panels have potential conflicts of interest. Dr. James Hildreth for example is president and CEO of Meharry Medical College which served as a site for Moderna‚Äôs vaccine trial and which was set to receive between $1.5 million and $2 million from the pharmaceutical giant. He was granted a waiver to be a voting member on VRBPAC anyway.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services make public any funding that doctors receive from the biopharmaceutical industry. According to this database Dr. Arnold Monto the acting chair of VRBPAC received a total of $161350 in payments from pharmaceutical companies between 2015 and 2021. This includes consulting fees from Pfizer Seqirus (a company that plans to use mRNA technology to develop new influenza vaccines) and Hoffmann-La Roche (the company that provided antibody tests for Moderna‚Äôs vaccine trials). Dr. Archana Chatterjee a member of VRBPAC received $456657 in payments and research funding from pharmaceutical companies between 2015 and 2021. This includes $131657 in payments and research funding from Pfizer which the FDA apparently did not consider a potential conflict of interest.

Since 2015 at least seven other voting FDA advisers have received thousands (and sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands) of dollars from pharmaceutical companies in the form of consulting fees and research funding. Of these Dr. Ofer Levy Dr. Wayne Marasco Dr. Steven Pergam and Dr. Jay Portnoy received payments from companies involved in mRNA technology. These companies include Shire Amgen Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. The fact that some advisers received funding from companies that have previous or new investments in mRNA is made more troubling by the fact that Levy cited the general use of mRNA as a reason to approve pediatric vaccines on June 15. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a broader context‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis mRNA vaccine platform may be useful not just against this current coronavirus and its current variants but the next one as well as future pandemics.‚Äù In total of the 21 members at the June 15 meeting (who voted unanimously to recommend vaccines for children under 5) at least 10 had received some form of direct or indirect payment from the biopharmaceutical industry.

These kinds of relationships are not outside the norm. To this day we don‚Äôt know what if any financial incentives were involved in the selection process for companies that received research funding through Operation Warp Speed. This is because Donald Trump‚Äôs vaccine chief Moncef Slaoui accepted a $1 government contractor fee which legally allowed him to avoid disclosing his full stock portfolio. Moreover one of the main architects of Operation Warp Speed was the FDA‚Äôs lead vaccine regulator Dr. Peter Marks. A Star Trek fan Marks was the man who gave Operation Warp Speed its name. According to Dr. Janet Woodcock the former interim head of the FDA ‚ÄúThe U.S. response to the pandemic as far as vaccines ‚Ä¶ was largely [Dr. Mark‚Äôs] concept.‚Äù Originally Marks recused himself from a regulatory position but regained his role once he left Operation Warp Speed shortly after the program began.

Regardless of the ultimate successes or failures of Operation Warp Speed itself this raises a fundamental ethical question about how the American government works. If a regulator is personally invested in the success of drug development can he or she be objective in making regulatory decisions for ordinary people? This question is all the more relevant given the fact that COVID vaccines are some of the most lucrative pharmaceutical products in history.

In 2021 Pfizer‚Äôs COVID vaccine sales topped $36 billion and Moderna‚Äôs reached $17.7 billion. In 2022 these companies are forecast to reach a combined $51 billion in COVID vaccine sales. It is of course in the interests of Pfizer and Moderna to seek to maximize profits by bypassing clinical trials. This is how we would expect these companies to behave. It is the role of the FDA however to ensure that any product on the market is effective and safe.

As we learned during the opioid epidemic a breakdown in the decision-making process at the FDA can have a profound impact on society as a whole. To watch the FDA actively promote a fifth COVID shot for Americans while almost every other country on Earth moves in the opposite direction is to notice that something fundamental remains broken at the agency. Apart from Canada no other country in the world has approved mRNA shots for children under 5. The U.K. has banned COVID vaccines for healthy children under 12 and several European countries suspended Moderna‚Äôs vaccine for anyone under 30.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyMDkxOC9wZml6ZXItZGlyZWN0b3ItcGxheWVkLXJvbGUtaW4tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtcGF4bG92aWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer director played role in development of Paxlovid,"Barbara Rodr√≠guez director of Drug Product Manufacturing Wednesday Aug. 31 2022 in her office at Pfizer in Groton.

Groton ‚Äï Barbara Rodr√≠guez a director of Drug Product Manufacturing at Pfizer was interested in pharmacy from a young age and her high school teachers nurtured that passion for science by mentoring her and providing opportunities to apply for internships.

Rodr√≠guez a first-generation Cuban American born in Union City N.J. said her parents who came to the United States in the 1970s from Cuba with a third-grade education and demonstrated a strong work ethic and the value of an education inspired her to obtain her doctorate degree in pharmaceutical sciences.

After working in factories her father gained the skills to have a small grocery store where he and her mother worked together. Rodr√≠guez helped out in the store in high school and later worked in a retail pharmacy. She completed seven internships in high school and college.

Rodr√≠guez 47 who joined Pfizer about 18 years ago is part of a team of 40 people that manufactures potential medicines that are entering clinical trials. Recently she and her team played a role to help make Paxlovid which is an antiviral to help treat high risk cases of COVID-19 to emergency use authorization.

‚ÄúWe were all very proud of that development‚Äù she said.

Growing up Rodr√≠guez said her family did not have health care and the importance of healthcare helps drive her.

‚ÄúI saw the challenges that we went through that others in the community went through in health care and I know the importance of being able to bring new medicines new treatments that aren‚Äôt available to help maintain better lifestyle and give people hope as well‚Äù she said.

Rodr√≠guez is working to inspire the next generation of scientists. When her children were younger she did science experiments using kits provided by Pfizer in the classroom.

She said a diverse workforce brings in new perspectives and different experiences and ways of thinking that drive innovation.

‚ÄúBringing your best self to work means being who you are authentically‚Äù Rodr√≠guez said.

If you buy through our links we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.

Newly approved bivalent booster vaccines targeted at Omicron subvariants may prompt a similar group of side effects noted by researchers in earlier formulations.

Americans shouldn't expect to experience brand new side effects or symptoms and are less likely to have a severe reaction to this new booster vaccine.

Those who have recently recovered from a COVID-19 illness also have special directives to consider before receiving a booster shot which are outlined below.

Americans are learning more about the new set of bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines made by teams at Pfizer and Moderna after officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized its rollout earlier this month. With clinics and pharmacies across the nation (including and ) now offering vaccination appointments you may be curious to know more about this updated vaccine and what kind of side effects may be affecting you after the shot.

If you haven't heard of the term ""bivalent"" just yet it refers to the fact that this updated vaccine contains genetic code targeted to the original strain of virus that spreads COVID-19 known as SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äî in addition to parts of the Omicron-based strains that are circulating currently.

""Half of it is the same as the original vaccine"" explains Richard Martinello M.D. the medical director of infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health System. ""The other half is focused on the new sub-variants that have been causing nearly all the disease we've been seeing over the past few months.""

Scientists have readily admitted that this particular batch of bivalent vaccines targeted towards BA.4 and BA.5 sub-Omicron variants have yet to be studied in humans officially. But you shouldn't be worried about any increase in side effects here Dr. Martinello explains as FDA regulators have seen a similar bivalent booster vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech for the ""stealth"" Omicron variant that spread rampantly last winter ‚Äî and those bivalent boosters were extensively studied before they were rolled out. Current authorizations are based on these previous studies as laid out by health regulators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""The data that was already generated from the bivalent BA.1 vaccine the human data really gave the FDA the confidence that they could approach approving this new bivalent shot"" Dr. Martinello says adding that this kind of approval system is similar to the annual flu vaccine.

What does available data suggest about any side effects of a bivalent booster compared to a primary COVID-19 vaccine or earlier boosters administered in 2021? Virologists and vaccine experts explore what we know below.

Potential Omicron bivalent booster vaccine side effects:

Data collected by the FDA for earlier bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines suggests that these shots successfully provided immunogenicity (a boost to your immunity!) and elicited consistent side effects as compared to other COVID-19 vaccines according to Dr. Martinello.

Sherrill Brown M.D. medical director of infection prevention for AltaMed Health Services indicates that current side effect notices published by the FDA sourced data from both Pfizer and Moderna's separate clinical trials for the earlier BA. 1 vaccines. In both trials the most commonly reported side effects within a week of injection were:

Pain at the injection site alongside redness and/or swelling Extended fatigue Headaches Widespread muscle pain Joint pain Chills Fever Nausea and vomiting

According to current FDA publications there's also a chance that swelling may occur in lymph nodes within the same arm as the injection site.

You'll notice that all of these side effects warnings are the same that came with original vaccine formulations. But it's interesting to note that the severity of side effects caused by bivalent vaccines were reported as less severe; Pfizer's clinical trial found that less than 1% of patients experienced severe pain or headaches whereas a majority of participants (52%) reported only mild pain at the injection site.

Similar figures were true for Moderna recipients as 59% of patients indicated they'd experienced fatigue after their shot but only 4% reported it at a severe level.

It's expected that the likelihood of severe side effects caused by COVID-19 vaccines will decrease as patients receive more boosters over the next few years Dr. Brown explains. ""Some rare side effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis have been shown to be even less common with subsequent booster doses compared to the primary series second dose shot"" she adds.

Will I experience a similar reaction after my 4th vaccine as earlier ones?

Both federal health officials and leading virologists polled by Good Housekeeping for this article suggest that you should expect similar side effects this time around if you experienced them after earlier vaccinations. Since the formulation of this particular round of bivalent booster vaccines was made in a very similar process to earlier options experts aren't expecting any new subsets of potential side effects to present this fall.

Shruti Gohil M.D. associate medical director of infection prevention at UCI Health and a professor at the University of California Irvine posits an analogy that this bivalent vaccine is like a riff on a standard brownie recipe: ""You're going to have almost the same ingredients and bake it for the same time at the same temperature ‚Äî but this time instead of just chocolate chips you add dark chocolate too"" she tells Good Housekeeping. ""The resulting brownie is the same though.""

It's important to note that individuals will react to these bivalent booster vaccines differently ‚Äî while the most common side effect is pain or swelling at the injection site many people may feel more severe side effects and unique combinations of the symptoms listed above. And if you didn't experience any side effects at all during your initial vaccine series or from the boosters after there's a good chance you won't this time around either.

""There's no way for us to predict how somebody is going to respond but we know that the spectrum of severity is the same as what we've seen with original vaccines"" Dr. Martinello adds. ""We do not expect [the public] to experience anything that would be out of the ordinary from our experience with the original vaccination.""

Will side effects be different for anyone who has recently recovered from COVID?

While it's not a hard-and-fast rule CDC officers have made recommendations to Americans to consider delaying receiving this bivalent booster vaccine at least three months from the date of your last COVID-19 infection. According to materials published by the American Medical Association research on the timing between infection and another injection indicates that an increased timeline in this range could better bolster your body's immune response compared to receiving a shot earlier.

But if you do choose to receive a bivalent booster within three months of your last sickness you shouldn't expect to experience wildly different or worse side effects as compared to if you had waited Dr. Martinello stresses. You also shouldn't expect a lighter immune response either.

""I encourage people who have had COVID ‚Äî once or even multiple times ‚Äî to still seek out vaccination as it's going to really optimize the level of protection that you have against getting COVID yet again this fall and winter"" he advises.

The bottom line:

Experts aren't expecting a dramatic shift in side effects triggered by new COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccines targeted toward Omicron spread. Those receiving a bivalent booster and notice side effects within a week of injection are recommended to do the following by CDC officials:

Rest as much as possible

Drink plenty of water and other better-for-you fluids to stay hydrated

Take over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen acetaminophen aspirin and antihistamines as needed

Apply a cold compress or a wet washcloth over the injection site if experiencing redness or swelling

Exercise your arm after injection to mitigate discomfort

Dr. Brown believes that this will not be the last time a new booster vaccine is offered to the American public ‚Äî in fact experts are projecting that annual vaccines against the spread of COVID-19 may become commonplace soon.

""I expect the COVID-19 booster shot to become an annual recommendation with small changes needed each year to keep up with and protect against new variants that arise"" she explains. ""This is a similar process that we go through with our annual influenza vaccination.""

Calvary Baptist Academy point guard Tyrone Jamison is still in the beginning stages of his recruiting process but that hasn't slowed college coaches from extending a scholarship offer to the talented target in the Class of 2027.

This week saw Louisville join the early group of programs to offer the 6-foot-2 Jamison. The Cardinals join a list of programs to do so that includes LSU Mississippi State Northwestern State Texas A&M and UAB.

Brandon Jenkins a 247Sports National Recruiting Analyst has had eyes on the rising prospect multiple times.

""(Jamison) has been on our radar for over a year and projects well as a reliable offensive talent"" Jenkins reported following Pangos All-South Camp last year. ""He is a lead guard who is wired to score and is a true threat from four ranges on the floor. He he can rise and fire at virtually any time off the dribble and showcased a lot of confidence draining shots from other area codes.""

Per MaxPreps Jamison averaged 13.3 points 5.4 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game last season at Calvary Baptist Academy.

Jamison plays with JL3 on the EYBL circuit.

San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama is reportedly ""intrigued"" by the idea of playing with Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young.

""I will say I have talked to people who know Wemby who have indicated he is at least intrigued by the idea"" ESPN's Tim MacMahon said on the Hoop Collective (39:13 mark). ""Now intrigued by that idea and pounding the table are two very different things. I have no idea whether Gregg Popovich would be intrigued by the idea.""

San Antonio has been regularly mentioned as a potential suitor should the Hawks choose to trade Young who seems to have plateaued as the 1A option in Atlanta. Young averaged 25.7 points and 10.8 assists per game this season‚Äîhis second straight 25-10 campaign‚Äîbut the Hawks failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2020.

The calculus may have changed in both Atlanta and San Antonio on Sunday with both teams coming away lottery winners. The Spurs will have picks Nos. 4 and 8 in the lottery after the Toronto Raptors' first-round pick was conveyed while the Hawks shocked the world to win the lottery.

Both teams face intriguing decisions on how to handle the draft over the next month. ESPN's Zach Lowe noted Atlanta faces a crossroads of sorts as it explores whether to trade the No. 1 pick for a veteran and continue building around Young and Dejounte Murray or make the pick and continue exploring their trade options with the two guards.

The Spurs are armed with cap space and a generational building block in Wembanyama who finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and won Rookie of the Year in 2023-24. It's possible they could look to kickstart their rebuild by floating one of those picks for a veteran who fits within Wembanyama's timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vbmV3cy80LXN0YXItcGcta2luZy1ncmFjZS11cGRhdGVzLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXRhbGtzLWxzdS1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1zdGF0ZS1zbXUtYW5kLXRjdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4-star PG King Grace updates recruitment talks LSU Mississippi State SMU and TCU,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L21vdmllcy9mZWF0dXJlcy8xNjk3Mjk0LWltYWdpbmFyeS1kaXJlY3Rvci1qZWZmLXdhZGxvdy10YWxrcy1iaWctdHdpc3QtbWFraW5nLXBnLTEzLWhvcnJvctIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbWluZ3Nvb24ubmV0L21vdmllcy9mZWF0dXJlcy8xNjk3Mjk0LWltYWdpbmFyeS1kaXJlY3Rvci1qZWZmLXdhZGxvdy10YWxrcy1iaWctdHdpc3QtbWFraW5nLXBnLTEzLWhvcnJvcj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Imaginary Director Jeff Wadlow Talks Big Twist Making PG-13 Horror,"ComingSoon Editor-in-Chief Tyler Treese spoke to Imaginary director Jeff Wadlow about the Blumhouse and Lionsgate horror movie which is now available via VOD and comes out today on Blu-ray DVD and Digital. They discussed Chauncey‚Äôs design iterations the movie‚Äôs twist and making PG-13 horror movies.

‚ÄúWhen Jessica (DeWanda Wise) moves back into her childhood home with her family her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named Chauncey she finds in the basement‚Äù reads the movie‚Äôs synopsis. ‚ÄúAlice starts playing games with Chauncey that begin playful and become increasingly sinister. As Alice‚Äôs behavior becomes more and more concerning Jessica intervenes only to realize Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be.‚Äù

Tyler Treese: I spoke with DeWanda Wise and she brought up that you‚Äôre a very collaborative filmmaker. I really love seeing these films and talking to directors where you can see they clearly take input from their actors and they come up with ideas together. So can you speak to your mindset going in and wanting to be collaborative with all the members of your team?

Jeff Wadlow: I love filmmaking because it‚Äôs collaborative art. I teach short filmmaking in my hometown. I‚Äôve been doing it for 20 years. I do it every fall. And one of the things I say to my filmmakers I say listen you just wanna execute what‚Äôs in your head then you should write a novel. You should be an oil painter. What‚Äôs amazing about filmmaking is that all these creative people come together and they all contribute things to this this stew that we‚Äôre making. And my the the favorite my favorite parts of the movies I‚Äôve made are the parts that I didn‚Äôt plan that surprised me. That evolved organically out of a back and forth with my team.

And so I think you‚Äôd be crazy not to lean into it because you have all these creative people participating. Like why wouldn‚Äôt you want the best ideas? You still don‚Äôt understand your roles. The way I describe my job as the director is I say Hey come come to the party contribute to the stew. I‚Äôll tell you when the stew is done. I‚Äôll tell you when it needs a little more pepper. But I want you all throwing in your best ingredients. Because that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre gonna make something that will be bigger and more interesting than any one single person could imagine.

This is a really fun psychological horror movie. In the last act it definitely gets wild but it starts out very grounded. You really get to see the family dynamic. Can you speak to just taking the time to establish their lives and making sure the audience connects with these characters? We‚Äôre all waiting for that horror to pop off but there‚Äôs a reason for the wait.

Yeah. You wanna connect to the characters you want to care about them. You have to have an emotional investment otherwise you‚Äôre making Jaws 2. I always talk about the difference between Jaws and Jaws 2. Jaws you spend what like 40 minutes almost an hour on land before they head out in the Orca. Because you‚Äôre getting to know the characters. You‚Äôre spending time with them so that you care about the three of them when they‚Äôre at sea.

Another example it‚Äôs not a horror movie but I was rewatching Taken the Liam Neeson movie the other day and there‚Äôs 30 minutes before she gets grabbed right? But the reason why Pierre Morel did that [and] Luc Besson did that is because they wanted to give the audience time to connect to the characters to invest in the relationships. So when it does start to pop off there‚Äôs emotional stakes.

You have a great twist in this movie. My theater was shocked when they found out the bear wasn‚Äôt being seen by everybody. When you‚Äôre doing like a big twist that‚Äôs a risk. How was it when you first test screened it? Because you could easily see something where if the breadcrumbs weren‚Äôt laid out or maybe it was made too obvious where it wouldn‚Äôt connect but thankfully it paid off here.

Honestly the first test screening didn‚Äôt [go well]. There was too much information. I shot a lot of footage of the bear not being there. Like almost every moment when someone else was in the room and Alice had the bear I would do a quick take of her mining holding the bear. So we had a lot more material and it was almost a little bit more like the end of the sixth sense. Like we had all these images of the bear not being there and it was just too much. You didn‚Äôt need it. So we pulled it way way back and that‚Äôs the version that‚Äôs in the film and it and it worked better. I mean it‚Äôs always this like weird balancing act. It‚Äôs like how much information do you give the audience versus how little because you want to be concise you don‚Äôt wanna overdo it. And if we had given them nothing you just said that you know the bear‚Äôs not there. And she‚Äôs like what? And then she realized it and then we‚Äôre onto the next scene and think going to be going like ‚ÄúHuh? I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù They needed some imagery of the bear not being there to put it together. They just didn‚Äôt need all the footage that I shot.

I love that you have the Chauncey behind you the cute little teddy bear I wanted to ask about.

That‚Äôs the hero bear. That is the bear from the movie.

I like that you went with a cute bear because I could see you wanting to go in a creepier direction maybe more tattered but then I feel like the audience would be like why is this little girl playing with this gross-looking bear?

We did a lot of iterations because we couldn‚Äôt go full Annabelle with the bear because they‚Äôd be like why would a kid want to cuddle with that thing? I mean the Annabelle doll is terrifying. You don‚Äôt wanna spend any time. Yeah. But at the same time you know there were definitely versions of him that were a little more like Winnie the Poh or Paddington and I was like well that doesn‚Äôt really work as like a is a horror icon. So where we landed was on on this guy. Right. And the key to him I mean he‚Äôs not exactly new. I mean he‚Äôs definitely tattered right? He looks a little older. But the thing that makes him still work in the kind of the poor lexicon is the asymmetry. Right? Like see how off his eyes and his ears are [off] even though he‚Äôs kind of in a neutral position. That‚Äôs what creates the unease in the audience. That‚Äôs what gives you the feeling that something is not right with this thing.

You‚Äôve done a lot of PG-13 horror and naturally that is restrictive in a way but also these types of restrictions encourage you to think outside the box and you still have so many other ways to get scares. So how do you feel about working within the PG space because I often hear that any restrictions kind of make you more creative.

One thing I say to the film students when I‚Äôm teaching that class: ‚ÄúThey say when you‚Äôre in a box the only way out is up.‚Äù So I don‚Äôt have a problem with constraints. I mean the very nature of filmmaking is filled with filled with constraints. You have limited budget you have limited time. So it doesn‚Äôt phase me. I think ultimately the story dictates the the rating. If you if I were ever to make you know a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie it‚Äôs gonna be a hard R. I mean how can you make that as anything other than a hard R It‚Äôs a guy running around with a chainsaw killing people. If I were to make a Halloween film of course it would be an R because Michael Myers is he needs to kill people with with the butcher knife and you need to see it in order to be terrified. But when you‚Äôre making a movie about imagination it‚Äôs not hard to keep it off camera and keep a lot of the terror implied because you need to imagine it and that just organically leads you to a PG 13 rating.

This recall announcement applies only to bags distributed in the United States.

PM,Philip Morris International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE3LzItZGl2aWRlbmQta2luZy1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tbWFrZS15b3UtbW9uZXktaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Dividend King Stocks That Can Make You Money in Your Sleep,"Target and Altria look well positioned to continue rewarding investors.

When it comes to dividend stocks there's nothing more important than reliability. Retirees and other investors rely on dividend stocks to pay them consistently so if you're an income investor you want to make sure you choose stocks that can pay you in good times and bad.

A great place to find these stocks is the list of Dividend Kings S&P 500 members that have raised their dividend payouts every year for at least 50 years. That's a period of time that includes the coronavirus pandemic the financial crisis the dot-com crash double-digit inflation in the early 80s and the energy crisis of the 1970s.

Only 42 stocks get to claim this title. It's a group that covers several industries though the majority of the companies are either in consumer goods or industrials. If you're looking for dividend stocks you can count on to keep printing money two great choices today are Target (TGT -0.53%) and Altria (MO 1.02%).

1. Target: An underappreciated growth story

In the retail industry most investors seem to think that Amazon is destroying everything in its path. While the e-commerce giant has turned the industry upside down some brick-and-mortar retailers are still thriving. Target is one of them. In fact Target stock has even outperformed Amazon over the last five years as the chart below shows though both have fallen in the recent market sell-off.

Target has delivered strong growth thanks to a unique multi-pronged strategy. First the company has invested in store-based fulfillment. Unlike Amazon or Walmart Target aims to use its stores to fulfill nearly all of its digital orders and it's prioritized same-day fulfillment options like curbside pick up and delivery through Shipt the Instacart competitor it acquired in 2017.

The retailer has also invested in its private-label owned brands which generate higher margins than name brands and reinforce customer loyalty as customers can only get those products from Target. The retailer now owns at least 10 billion-dollar brands and it continues to launch new ones.

Target is also aggressively opening small-format stores in underserved neighborhoods in cities and college towns across the country a high return-on-investment strategy that pairs well with its focus on same-day fulfillment. The small-format stores are also something that rivals like Amazon Walmart and Costco can't match therefore giving Target a competitive advantage.

Target has struggled this year -- it's been hit by excess inventory like many of its peers and faces difficult comparisons with its performance a year ago as consumer spending shifts back to services. But the company still seems poised for reliable long-term growth. Over the long term the company is aiming for high-single-digit earnings-per-share growth which combined with a modest valuation and a dividend yield of 2.6% sets the company up well to deliver double-digit annual returns.

Target's track record of 51 years of dividend hikes should also give investors confidence that it will continue to raise its quarterly payout.

2. Altria: An unbeatable dividend powerhouse

If you like dividends it's hard to find a better stock than Altria (MO 1.02%) the domestic parent of Marlboro. The tobacco company currently offers a dividend yield of 9% better than any other Dividend King and has a track record of 53 straight years of increases dating back to before its 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris.

Dividends are the principal reason investors hold Altria stock and the management team knows that. Altria just raised its quarterly dividend by 4.4% to $0.94 marking its 57th increase in 53 years. The company has a dividend payout ratio target of 80% meaning it aims to pay out 80% of profits as dividends.

Though cigarette sales have been declining in the U.S. for decades Altria has managed to continue growing earnings per share thanks largely to price increases and share repurchases -- even if operating profits are flat. Despite cigarette volumes falling 11% in the most recent quarter revenue after excise taxes was down just 0.7% because of price increases.

What's also noteworthy about Altria's growing dividend and earnings per share is that they've come in spite of disastrous investments in JUUL and Cronos Group which have led to billions of dollars in write-downs.

Altria will eventually have to transition away from smokeable products and its partnership to sell Philip Morris' IQOS product seems like the most promising next-gen opportunity right now. Bt management has demonstrated its ability to grow earnings per share in a declining industry for a long time.

Investors should feel confident in Altria's dividend payout and its 9% yield makes it an attractive way to ride out the bear market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The data is recorded as of every June 30 and the Philadelphia Business Journal selected the five southeastern Pennsylvania counties and the three South Jersey river counties.

When factoring in Delaware TD had long had more deposits than Wells Fargo. But Delaware data is skewed by the fact that several banks including TD have a large amount of corporate deposits in bank-centric Wilmington.

Cherry Hill-based TD a subsidiary of Toronto-based TD Bank Group (NYSE: TD) led the pack this year with $35.4 billion in local deposits good enough for a 16.7% market share and an increase from $32.3 billion and 15.2% in 2021. TD‚Äôs branch count held at 117.

San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has long been the region‚Äôs largest deposit taker due to a series of acquisitions that led to the company‚Äôs local brand changing from CoreStates First Union and Wachovia before becoming Wells Fargo.

With delayed sand supply from the Sha region in Wangdue some of the transporters are found selling truckloads of sand at truck parking in Babesa Thimphu at double the current rate. It is sold at Nu 28000 for 10m3 (cubic metre) truck from Wangdue to Thimphu. The actual market price is Nu 14000.

The Sha region supplies sand to Thimphu Paro and Haa.

A builder based in Thimphu said that the sand transported from Wangdue by the common pool vehicles is cheaper‚ÄîNu 14000 for 10m3 truck. However he said that the supply gets delayed.

‚ÄúWe have to buy in an emergency since it is not logical to keep the labourers idle paying Nu 28000 from the market‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe do not know where to complain. The cost of sand began shooting up a week ago.‚Äù











Another builder said that with limited sand supply from the Sha region they resort to buying sand from Toorsa Phuentsholing.

‚ÄúThe rate at which the transporters sell is too high. It costs Nu 27000 for 10m3 truck of sand‚Äù he added.

He said the government should monitor sand prices. ‚ÄúWith the rate too high the cost of construction with the loan availed at existing loan to asset value is difficult to manage.‚Äù

A sand transporter Tandin Dorji said that a 10m3 truck of sand from Wangdue to Thimphu costs Nu 14000. From Phuentsholing the price is Nu 25000.









‚ÄúSome transporters sell a truckload of sand from Wangdue at Nu 28000.‚Äù

Tandin Dorji also said that the nexus between the building thikadar (construction supervisor) and transporters has distorted the sand prices. A thikadar for example receives a commission of about Nu 3000 for a truckload of sand.

On the delayed supply Branch Manager of the Natural Resources Development Corporation Limited‚Äôs (NRDCL) Sha branch office Mani Gyeltshen said that the corporation lost the operation of two quarries in the beginning of the year ‚ÄîHavilum and Goleykha‚Äîbecause of the Covid-19 restrictions.

‚ÄúStocking of sand could not be maximised; the current supply is dredged sand‚Äù he said.

According to the office only 22945m3 of sand was stocked this year which was 54 403m3 less compared to 2021.









Stocking of sand is done from mid-October to March and is supplied during summer.

However Mani Gyeltshen said that the current situation would improve from the first or second week of October as the extraction of sand from riverbeds will start soon.

NRDCL has also temporarily halted both manual and online bookings from September 15 to clear the backlogs. There are 2600 truckload backlogs.

The NRDCL also capped a truckload of sand for each customer a week from September 15. In winter there is no cap on truckload.

Mani Gyeltshen said that after the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted there was huge demand for sand with the opening of construction activities.









In normal times the NRDCL Sha region dispatches 188 truckloads of sand in a day from both stocked and dredged sand -143 truckloads are dredged sand.

However currently with no stocked sand only 86 truckloads of dredged sand are dispatched in a day.

Mani Gyeltshen said that the Sha region produces 35 996m3 of sand in normal times. However after river level rose the production dropped to 25 450m3 as of August a decrease of 10545m3.

He said there are two types of sand customers namely common pool vehicles and self-owned transporters.









Mani Gyeltshen said that illegal sand trading is not possible under common pool vehicles because the NRDCL assigns customers to transporters and payment is made when the sand delivery is completed. Common pool vehicles are private transporters registered with the NRDCL.

The self-owned transporters which the customers send their own vehicles or vehicles owned by their relatives Mani Gyeltshen said that NRDCL verifies the documents like construction approval and validity and the sand must go to the particular site.

He added that the customers complain about the existence of illegal trading of sand in the market. ‚ÄúWe asked them to share the vehicle‚Äôs number. No one has done so.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,

West Port H.S. student wins award at international science fair

Vivek Sandrapaty 17 a senior at West Port High School won an award in May at the Regeneron International Science Fair in Atlanta.

The project is a prototype for a system that sends a signal for emergency services when an injury occurs. Vivek was moved by the plight of first responders who suffer severe traumatic injuries and can‚Äôt summon aid.

Vivek was among 1750 students from around the world who participated in the fair. He was awarded a fourth place Grand Award for ‚ÄúRemote Detection System for Penetrative Bodily Injury Using an Innovative Electrical Engineering Enhancement of Wearable Fabric.‚Äù

Vivek‚Äôs design uses a vest powered by a 9-volt battery that electronically senses a penetration and causes a signal to be sent if a penetration to the vest ‚Äì and likely injury ‚Äì occurs.

The prototype has limited signal range for the project but in practice the system would include use of radio transmission to expand the range.

Vivek is in the Biomedical Program at West Port and is dual enrolled with the College of Central Florida.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today‚Äôs research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble‚Äôs shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical‚Äôs shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company‚Äôs da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG‚Äôs initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

In July I wrote a column about Joe Kline of Suffield and his unwelcome surprise when his car insurance rate went up after the death of his wife.

Kline said it made no sense that the number of people insured for his two vehicles went down but his insurance rate went up by $20 a half.

What is the widow's or widower's penalty?

The practice of raising a rate after a spouse‚Äôs death has been called the widow‚Äôs or widower‚Äôs penalty.

It is banned in at least one state.

In 2015 then-Delaware Insurance Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart announced she would not approve any auto insurance rate submission that included the penalty.

‚ÄúThis so-called ‚Äòwidow‚Äôs penalty‚Äô is completely unfair‚Äù said the commissioner in a press release at the time. ‚ÄúBecoming a single driver because of the death of your spouse is not the same as being a young inexperienced single driver. I will not approve any auto insurance rate filings that cannot provide actuarially sound data for including widows and widowers in a higher single rate category.""

The ban later became a Delaware state law. I checked with several state and national industry sources this summer but most had not heard of the ban.

In Ohio there is no such ban according to the Ohio Department of Insurance.

National group reaches out

After my column I heard from the Consumer Federation of America a Washington D.C.-based consumer advocacy group.

The organization first studied what it called the unfair practice of insurers raising rates on widows and widowers in 2015. It found that several auto insurers increased rates for widows by an average of 20%.

In the 10 cities around the country studied in 2015 four of six major insurers ‚Äì GEICO Farmers Progressive and Liberty ‚Äî increased rates on state-mandated liability coverage for widows by an average of 20%. The fifth insurer Nationwide sometimes increased rates for widows. The sixth insurer State Farm did not vary the rates it charged because of marital status.

Michael DeLong research and advocacy associate for the Consumer Federation of America said the organization has been advocating for states to eliminate the practice. There are two more states that have banned the practice according to DeLong: Maryland and Massachusetts.

He also offered to do a mini study of some Ohio insurers to see how prevalent the practice was here. (An Ohio city was not among the original 10 studied in 2015).

Ohio study results

Here‚Äôs what they found:

The organization did three sets of online quotes for six major insurers Geico Liberty Mutual American Family Progressive Nationwide and State Farm. They used the same driver profile and address of a 35 year old man or woman living in Akron with a perfect driving record. Nationwide and Liberty needed more information to complete the quote so quotes were not received.

‚ÄúOur evidence found that Progressive is charging women a 'widow's penalty' raising their rates if they are widowed"" DeLong said. ""In our first test we found that the six month premium for a 35 year old married woman was $187 but if she was widowed her premium jumped to $204. And in the second test the married woman's premium was $202 and the widowed woman's premium was $218.

""Progressive is charging women more for auto insurance after their husbands pass away a perfect example of greed. It is both unfair and inhumane. What possible logic is there for this penalty on widows?""

Progressive did not respond to an inquiry seeking comment on the penalty. (9-23-22 update: Progressive responded a week after I reached out and after this column appeared. See the update at the end of this column).

For American Family the results were inconclusive and quotes were different each of the three times. In some cases widowed men or women were charged the same more or less as someone married so the organization said it can‚Äôt say for sure whether the insurer is charging the widow‚Äôs penalty.

The other companies either did not have results or did not appear to be charging the penalty based on the mini study.

DeLong said the organization is calling on the Ohio Department of Insurance to help consumers.

""Several auto insurers charge women higher rates if they are widows an egregious form of discrimination that penalizes people grieving for their spouse. The Ohio Department of Insurance should step in and ban these harmful actions by insurers‚Äù he said.

In response to an inquiry Ohio Department of Insurance Communications Director Sara Donlon said: ‚ÄúIn regards to the Consumer Federation of America study we are not familiar with the study but we encourage anyone who may find themselves in this situation to contact us at 800-686-1526 or consumer.complaint@insurance.ohio.gov so we can look into the matter.‚Äù

Kline the original subject of the column also has been trying to reach out to lawmakers to try to effect some change.

‚ÄúThank you for keeping on it. I was surprised at how many people contacted me and were totally unaware there was such a thing‚Äù Kline said of response he received after the column. Kline stayed with the same company after his agent looked around and got him a new rate to save money. He declined to name the insurer though acknowledged it is one of the major ones from the 2015 study.

9-23-22 update:

I had reached out to Progressive on Monday of the week I was working on the column for comment. I did not hear from them by my Friday deadline.

However I did hear back from Progressive spokesman Jeff Sibel a week later. He apologized for the delay and said he already knew my column had run. He asked if he could provide some clarification:

‚ÄúOur loss experience shows the single rating is actuarially more appropriate for Widow(er)s than would be a married rating‚Äù Sibel wrote. ‚ÄúFor Progressive customers who‚Äôs spouse has died while actively insured with us we continue to rate the driver in the same married classification they had before their loss. This applies for the balance of that term and all subsequent policy terms. While we continue to rate the widowed driver as ‚Äòmarried‚Äô there may be factors (such as the number of drivers vehicles and complexion of the household) that impact rate when a policy is up for renewal.‚Äù

In a follow-up email Sibel confirmed for me that a new customer who is a widow or widower would be rated as a single and not married.

Michael DeLong research and advocacy associate for the Consumer Federation of America said the group still considers the new customer who is a widow or widow being rated as a single to be the widow‚Äôs penalty.

‚ÄúThe insurance company treats widows differently than people whose spouse hasn‚Äôt yet died. The fact that they have an exception for existing customers doesn‚Äôt mean they are not mistreating widows just that they are mistreating slightly fewer of them‚Äù said DeLong who called on the Ohio Department of Insurance in last week‚Äôs column to stop the practice also sent a letter to the commissioner after the column ran.

‚ÄúThe company is basically saying we‚Äôll keep you if you had been with us before but otherwise widows need not apply. Even if it‚Äôs just a small penalty there is no reason the Department should allow insurance companies to charge widowed drivers more than married drivers for coverage the Ohio requires under law‚Äù said DeLong.

The class-action suit filed Saturday in Manhattan Supreme Court seeks more than $58 million in damages for the duped motorists from the NYPD the city Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and Runway Towing Corp. It alleges city officials let the company run an illegal ‚Äúracketeering enterprise‚Äù at the expense of unsuspecting motorists.

The suit also accuses the NYPD of repeatedly extending Runway‚Äôs contract since 2013 without competitive bidding and in the process ignoring many complaints the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection was getting about the company‚Äôs alleged lawbreaking which included underpaying workers and illegally compensating them with cash off the books.

The two city agencies ‚Äúconspired ‚Ä¶ to allow Runway to operate ‚Ä¶ even though at least six years ago motorists were telling them that Runway is overcharging consumers‚Äù said lawyer Gary Rosen who represents Runway customers and ex-staffers in the lawsuit.

Lawyer Gary Rosen who represents Runway customers said city agencies conspired to allow the towing company to operate.

The suit claims Runway has earned more than $200 million since 2010 off its NYPD contract to provide roadside assistance and towing services on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway; Kosciusko Bridge; the Cross Island Parkway in Queens; sections of the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn and Queens; Brooklyn‚Äôs Gowanus Expressway and Prospect Expressway; and the Staten Island Expressway West Shore Expressway Korean War Veterans Parkway and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway on Staten Island.

It also alleges the company relies on shady practices to drive up its profits including instructing tow operators to bring vehicles they pick up to the company‚Äôs office in Ozone Park ‚Äî no matter where they break down.

It‚Äôs a move that generates hundreds and sometimes thousands of extra dollars in unnecessary towing and storage costs for the public per vehicle former Runway workers and customers told The Post.

Mary Olsen 62 said she had no choice but to give away her 2000 Nissan Altima to Runway after it was rear-ended and totaled on the Staten Island Expressway two years back. She said a Runway tow truck brought the car to the Ozone Park storage facility more than 20 miles away without her consent ‚Äî and without providing a cheaper option such as towing it to a parking space off the nearest exit or a nearby auto body shop.

Helayne Seidman Olsen said the Runway tow truck brought her car to a facility 20 miles away without her consent and without providing a cheaper option. Helayne Seidman Advertisement

Towing fees under Runway‚Äôs city contract are supposed to be $125 plus tax but Runway can charge additional fees if the ride exceeds 10 miles and for storing a vehicle at their facility.

Olsen said she initially had no way of getting to Ozone Park from Staten Island to reclaim the car so her debt continued to mount ‚Äî including nearly $27 a day in storage fees. She said Runway wouldn‚Äôt give her access to the vehicle to sell or junk it to help pay off her tab.

Ultimately she said she was left with little choice but to work out a deal to pay Runway $325 in cash plus sign over the title to her car to pay off the remaining $927 in debt she owed.

‚ÄúIf the accident happened on Staten Island there should be a place here for the cars to be towed. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that you have to go to another [borough]‚Äù Olsen said.

Runway and its executives were previously slapped with litigation over similar claims including a class-action suit filed in Brooklyn federal court on behalf of consumers in December 2019 that is still pending.

‚ÄúTo accuse Runway the NYPD and the Department of Consumer [and Worker Protection] of operating an enterprise‚Äù violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ‚Äúis not only silly but sanctionable‚Äù said Errol Margolin a lawyer for Runway. ‚ÄúAny such lawsuit will be dismissed because there is no enterprise no conspiracy and no conduct that is illegal.‚Äù

Following previous complaints that Runway was overcharging drivers the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 2020 decided not to renew the company‚Äôs license to operate in the Big Apple city officials said. However Runway got its renewal anyway after securing a court order that the city is appealing.

‚ÄúWe will carefully investigate the allegations in this complaint and respond in the litigation‚Äù city Law Department spokesman Nick Paolucci. ‚ÄúThe city is committed to protecting consumers and workers and ensuring integrity in its contracting process.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur Jiayu project is the first to launch with our new ‚ÄòBlinq‚Äô brand which will focus on mid-to-high-end projects‚Äù Stuart Mercier Brookfield managing partner and head of Asia real estate told Mingtiandi. The Canadian fund manager is acquiring the 42000 square metre (452084 square foot) complex from debt-laden Chinese developers Guangzhou R&F Group and KWG Group Holdings.

With more than 70000 multi-family units and over $22 billion in assets under management within the sector globally Brookfield pointed to the non-resident population of over 10 million people in China‚Äôs commercial capital as a driving force for the rental market. ‚ÄúShanghai is a destination for young talent and has high barriers to home ownership which drives rental demand‚Äù said Mercier.

Brookfield had revealed the acquisition over its official WeChat channel last month and confirmed the seller identities on Thursday after JLL announced that it had brokered the disposal on behalf of Guangzhou R&F and KWG. Sources familiar with the transaction confirmed to Mingtiandi that the asset had changed hands at approximately RMB 30000 per square metre putting the consideration for the transaction at around RMB 1.26 billion.

Neither Guangzhou R&F nor KWG Group has made any disclosure regarding the asset sale.

High-End Community

Jointly developed by R&F and KWG Group and previously operated by R&F Shanghai the Jiayu project is located in Xinjiangwan an area neighbouring a cluster of universities and high tech firm campuses such as Tishman Speyer‚Äôs The Springs in Yangpu district‚Äôs Wujiaochang area north of the city centre.

The project sold includes three apartment buildings that are planned to provide around 560 apartments according to Brookfield‚Äôs earlier statement on WeChat. Upon completion of the transaction the property will be renamed Shanghai Wujiaochang Blinq Executive Apartment (Blinq Wujiaochang) Brookfield said.

Blinq Wujiaochang‚Äôs first 100 rental apartments were opened this month and the remaining units will be made available in the fourth quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2023 according to a press release by JLL.

The asset previously belonged to the commercial element of a multi-use joint venture between R&F and KWG named Amazing Bay according to a report by Guangzhou‚Äôs Times Media. The two developers had purchased a 70 percent stake in the site for Amazing Bay from US developer and fund manager Hines for $353.5 million in 2010 and another 30 percent from state-owned Shanghai Chengtou Cityland (Group) Co Ltd for 1 billion yuan ($142 million) in 2011 the report said.

Struggling Chinese Developers

Guangzhou R&F China‚Äôs 40th largest developer by contracted sales attributed to shareholders in the first half and KWG Group ranked 45th by the same metric have both been struggling to pay down debt as their revenues slide during China‚Äôs housing downturn.

In December R&F sold its remaining 30 percent stake in its Guangzhou International Airport R&F Integrated Logistics Park to Blackstone for RMB 3.4 billion after closing on its $1.1 billion sale of 70 percent of the distribution centre to the US fund manager in January.

In May R&F sold its 50 percent stake in Thames City a London joint venture with fellow Chinese developer CC Land to the latter firm‚Äôs chairman for HK$2.66 billion and booked a loss of HK$1.84 billion on that disposal.

Earlier this month the developer sold 100 percent of its stake in its Wanda Realm Beijing hotel to a unit of Beijing Pengrui Real Estate for RMB 550 million ($79 million).

KWG has also been conducting a fire sale to bolster its finances. In the beginning of the year it established a key account sales team to promote en-bloc sales of office buildings in some non-core areas of Guangzhou Beijing and Shanghai the developer said in its interim report.

In July KWG sold a 50 percent stake in a residential project in Hong Kong‚Äôs Kai Tak area to its partner Longfor Group for HK$1.3 billion.

These sales have coincided with both firms having recently secured deals to restructure their offshore debt.

With JP Morgan as the agent for both firms‚Äô debt restructuring R&F in July pushed out the deadline for 10 offshore bonds totaling $5.1 billion by three to four years while KWG this past week secured investor consent to swap $1.6 billion in near-term notes for new debt on longer maturities.

Renting Comes to Town

The value of Brookfield‚Äôs Yangpu prize comes as a result of property prices in China‚Äôs major cities becoming some of the least affordable in the world with renting gradually gaining favour with young professionals.

By raw count rental housing projects sector accounted for 15 percent of new real estate developments in China during the second quarter up from 7.6 percent in 2021 according to JLL. With China‚Äôs recently established affordable housing REITs providing a potential exit channel for investors in the sector.

‚ÄúChina continues to introduce favourable policies for the rental housing sector. We have seen a strong interest from more diversified investors in this market. As housing REITs are being ushered in the rental housing market will become more active in the future‚Äù said Sun Ling head of capital markets for JLL East China in a statement Thursday.

Three REITs with public rental housing projects in Xiamen Shenzhen and Beijing as their underlying assets rose to the first trading day‚Äôs limit of 30 percent on their debut in China last month. The three listed trusts were each more than 100 times oversubscribed among institutional investors and raised a combined RMB 3.8 billion based on Reuters‚Äô calculations.",,,,,,

Weather forecasters said the rainfall is likely to produce devastating landslides and severe flooding with up to 25 inches (64 cm) expected in some areas. A Category 1 storm with sustained winds of 85 mph Fiona is nowhere near as powerful as Hurricane Maria which slammed the island in 2017 nearly five years to the day as a Category 4 monster.

It wasn't lost on many that the nation's sole power utility company LUMA--granted control of the territory's electricity system in a 2020 privatization deal in the wake of Maria's devastation--is the institution now in charge as the entire island has lost power in the face of Fiona.

In July major protests were organized by Puerto Ricans opposed to LUMA--a joint venture by Canada-based ATCO and Houston-based Quanta Services. Citing increased outages unreliable service and higher bills opponents demanded the 15-year contract with the company be canceled.

As Reutersreported in July ""Power rates have gone up five times since LUMA began operating Puerto Rico's transmission and distribution system on June 1 2020. The last rate hike which took effect at the start of July pushed rates up by 17.1%.""

Earlier this month protests again were again on display in San Juan and elsewhere condemning LUMA.

In a statement on its website Sunday LUMA said ""full power restoration could take several days"" and asked for ""support and patience"" from its customers.

Carmen Yulin Cruz who was the progressive mayor of San Juan when Maria hit the island in 2017 offered a sobering comment in response to news of the blackout:

""Puerto Rico is 100% without electrical power"" she tweeted. ""The cycle of death begins.""

The National Hurricane Center warned Sunday that Fiona's rains ""will produce life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain.""

The NHC said Fiona was likely to continue intensifying in power after it moves on from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic moving North.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Qualcomm chip provides 5G connectivity for cellular networks but is also capable of using what is called band n53 the frequency band used by satellites from Globalstar. Qualcomm headquarters is in Sorrento Valley.

Globalstar earlier this month announced a deal in which Apple will take up to 85% of Globalstar‚Äôs satellite network capacity to enable Apple‚Äôs new emergency messaging feature.

In a statement to Reuters on Saturday Apple said there is additional proprietary hardware and software in the iPhone 14 for the new messaging feature.

‚ÄúiPhone 14 includes custom radio frequency components and new software designed entirely by Apple that together enable Emergency SOS via satellite on new iPhone 14 models‚Äù Apple said in a statement.

Apple did not give details about the satellite-specific hardware. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.

Ltd. (GWM) made a splash in China last month with the debut of GWM‚Äôs new autonomous vehicle LIDAR driving system which utilizes Qualcomm‚Äôs proprietary Snapdragon Digital Chassis Platform.

GWM‚Äôs new Mocca DHT-PHEV LIDAR ‚Äì part of the Chinese automaker‚Äôs WEY brand ‚Äî was unveiled at the Chengdu Motor Show on Aug. 29.

Building on the partnership between GWM and Qualcomm GWM‚Äôs LIDAR will be equipped with the Snapdragon Digital Chassis.

Qualcomm said in a press note released in conjunction with the auto show that the partnership with GWM ‚Äúleverage[es] Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platforms for fast and reliable connectivity‚Äù with third generation ‚ÄúSnapdragon Cockpit Platform‚Äôs leading compute performance and rich audio and visual processing capabilities.‚Äù

The LIDAR system utilizes the Snapdragon Ride Platform for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving systems (AD) allowing GWM to offer ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs first commercialized vehicle‚Äù to feature Qualcomm‚Äôs platform the note also stated.

In July Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said ‚ÄúIn automotive the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is fast becoming the industry‚Äôs platform of choice and is enabling the transition to next-generation vehicles.‚Äù

Qualcomm‚Äôs automotive design pipeline is now ‚Äúover $19 billion‚Äù Amon said ‚Äì up $3 billion just since Q2. ‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the continued traction and design wins across global automakers and Tier 1 partners‚Äù Qualcomm‚Äôs CEO added.

Qualcomm made a major move into the automotive sector earlier this year when the company purchased Swedish firm Veoneer a pioneer in autonomous driving software. In 2022 the Volkswagen Group‚Äôs software company CARIAD also tapped Qualcomm to supply chips to enable assisted and automated driving functions for VW-made vehicles expected to hit the market in 2025.

Auto Investor Day Coming

Qualcomm will be hosting its Automotive Investor Day on September 22 in San Diego. The event to be livestreamed will feature an overview of the company‚Äôs automotive-related business vision and strategies ‚Äî and will also include a live Q&A session with company executives.

Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon Ride Platform is a comprehensive portfolio for high performance central compute and vision system solutions based on the Snapdragon family of automotive system-on-chips (SoCs) and accelerator products.

Qualcomm‚Äôs low-power high-performance platforms allow for scaling all tiers of ADAS and AD systems ranging from regulatory NCAP solutions to highly automated driving.

Utilizing the Snapdragon Ride Platform the WEY Mocca DHT-PHEV LIDAR Edition is designed to process more than 12 cameras multi-radars and lidars on the combination of the industry leading 5nm ADAS SoC and accelerator while implementing a safety critical ADAS system.

Qualcomm in its press note said its Snapdragon Ride Platform will provide ‚Äúdifferentiated intelligent driving solutions and unique customization‚Äù for the WEY LIDAR system ‚Äúfrom concept to start of production which is projected to be in less than two years.‚Äù

The system has support for real-time rendering high-resolution display and extreme color reproduction of images captured with vehicle‚Äôs cameras on its cockpit screens which allows users to enjoy ‚Äúmore convenient smarter and safer immersive driving experiences‚Äù the note also stated.

International Collaboration

Great Wall and Qualcomm have collaborated for several years across multiple technology areas including advanced in-vehicle connectivity and digital cockpit.

GWM has already launched several commercial vehicles using Qualcomm Technologies‚Äô intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) products which are powered by Snapdragon Digital Chassis solutions.

GWM makes gas and electric vehicles (EVs) and is planning to roll out hydrogen fuel cell SUVs later this year. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Hebei Province. China‚Äôs largest manufacturer of SUVs and the country‚Äôs eighth-largest auto maker GWM sold 1.3 million vehicles in 2021.

GWM shares are listed on the Hong Kong (HSI) stock exchange and also on the U.S. OTC market under the ticker GWLLY. The company has more than 100 subsidiaries and over 60000 employees.

This feature launches in the United States and Canada first starting in November.

A Reuters report this weekend indicated that the satellite features are enabled by a Qualcomm X65 modem inside the phones. An Apple statement to Reuters also said that custom Apple-designed radio frequency components and software also make the satellite feature possible.

The Qualcomm X65 modem enables 5G cellular connectivity for phone calls and data but also and ‚Äòband n53‚Äô which enables the iPhone to communicate with satellites in the sky. Specifically Apple has partnered with satellite infrastructure managed by Globalstar.

Emergency SOS via Satellite will be available when the user initiates an Emergency SOS call but fails to connect to a cell tower. In that case the phone will present the option to connect to satellite and send a short text message instead. Users will need a clear view of the sky for the feature to work; iOS will direct the user to point their device to line up with satellites overhead.

If local emergency services can use text-based channels the iPhone will transmit these messages directly via the satellite link. If not Apple relay centers will receive the SOS message and call the emergency services on your behalf.

This service will be free for two years starting in November. Apple has not disclosed pricing plans for the satellite service after that free period is up. Country availability is limited to United States and Canada initially.

It is an open secret that Apple‚Äôs chip teams are currently working on an in-house 5G modem with the aim to expunge Qualcomm parts from the iPhone entirely with primary goals of power efficiency (longer battery life) and reducing royalty payments to improve unit cost margins of every iPhone sold.

However making a modem is incredibly complicated and many analysts remain skeptical if Apple will succeed. Apple hopes to replicate the success of its custom silicon investments for the A-series and M-series SoCs. The consensus of the rumor mill currently expects the first Apple modem to be ready for primetime in 2024."

Sidelined for much of August by a hamstring injury the 29-year-old journeyman could only watch as a handful of rookie receivers seized their respective opportunities to leap-frog him on the depth chart. But while they could take his reps they couldn‚Äôt take his reputation ‚Äî as a big-bodied big-moment performer.

Hence the reason he stayed on the roster. And hence the reason Tom Brady looked his way at a pivotal moment Sunday.

On WR Breshad Perriman: ""He's a pro's pro. He's a guy's guy."" pic.twitter.com/QGWzefYcku ‚Äî Sports by Tampa Bay Times (@TBTimes_Sports) September 19 2022

Perriman‚Äôs 28-yard scoring catch with 7:41 remaining provided the go-ahead points for the Bucs in their 20-10 triumph at Caesars Superdome.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we kept him‚Äù Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. ‚ÄúAt the end of cut day he can do everything and he comes up big at the right time.‚Äù

A thing of beauty üëè pic.twitter.com/wAS8wk8wh2 ‚Äî Sports by Tampa Bay Times (@TBTimes_Sports) September 18 2022

Perriman‚Äôs reception came nine months after he walked off the Bills at Raymond James Stadium turning a short Brady throw into a 58-yard touchdown in a 33-27 overtime triumph. On Sunday Perriman (three catches 45 yards) said he released so effectively that he turned his initial route into a go pattern allowing Brady ‚Äî well protected by a makeshift line ‚Äî to find him in the right corner of the end zone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my guy man‚Äù fellow receiver Mike Evans said. ‚ÄúHe works so hard made a great play on the first touchdown which really sparked everything after that.‚Äù

Injury update

The concerns about the average age of the Bucs roster ‚Äî the oldest in the NFL at 27.15 years ‚Äî grew more substantial by halftime Sunday.

Two more veterans 32-year-old defensive tackle Akiem Hicks and 31-year-old reserve left tackle Josh Wells exited in the first half with foot and calf injuries respectively. Reserve tailback Giovani Bernard 30 didn‚Äôt return after injuring an ankle in the second half.

Already sidelined before kickoff were 33-year-old left tackle Donovan Smith (elbow) and 33-year-old receiver Julio Jones (knee) both of whom were deemed inactive for the game. ‚Äú(Smith) didn‚Äôt practice all week‚Äù Bowles said. ‚ÄúSo we kind of got a feel at the end of the week he wasn‚Äôt going to play.‚Äù

Bowles had no postgame update on Wells and indicated it is too early to ascertain Smith‚Äôs availability for next week‚Äôs home opener against the Packers. Seminole High alumnus Brandon Walton replaced Wells logging the first offensive snaps of his NFL career. Walton appeared on four special teams plays last week against the Cowboys.

Special again

Despite a wonky 26-yard attempt in the fourth quarter rookie punter Jake Camarda continued validating the fourth-round pick his team invested in him. Camarda averaged 40.6 yards on his other five attempts pinning three inside the 20.

His most critical effort: a lofty 49-yarder from his own end zone with 1:56 remaining in the first half. The excessive hang time allowing the Bucs coverage to scurry downfield resulted in a 6-yard loss by returner Deonte Harty. New Orleans took over at its 31 and failed to score.

Meantime veteran Ryan Succop nailed two 47-yard field goals and is perfect on four tries from 44 yards or longer this season. Succop totaled seven field goals of 40 or more yards (in 10 tries) in all of 2021.

The show is unrelentingly dark both in story theme and visuals with many scenes so dim it's difficult not to feel like it's all supposed to be a metaphor. The Apple TV+ series is about a future where a deadly virus has resulted in most people in the world being blind. Those very few born with sight are considered alternatively as witches or as saviors to disabled people.

As The A.V. Club writes ""That vision would be considered a super power to blind people who have managed to restore civilization without it ‚Äî smacks of ableism but that isn't 'See's' only trouble."" It has a blindness consultant. (And disability consulting is unfortunately some of the lowest-paid work in television and film.) The show also boasts of a large blind cast and actors who are low vision though none of them appear to be in leading or major roles which are played by seeing actors with eyes digitally altered by special effects.

It's somewhat depressing that this is considered a huge step for disability in Hollywood but here we are with Jason Momoa as Baba Voss the leader of a dystopian blind tribe and adopted father of young adult twins who can see. Their mother Maghra (Hera Hilmar) was pregnant by the mysterious Jerlamarel (Joshua Henry) a kind of seeing prophet with not the greatest intentions when she first stumbled into the tribe's encampment. Last season Jerlamarel was killed as was beloved elder Paris (the great Alfre Woodard) and this season started with the characters once a tight family unit scattered.

""See"" is on its third and final season and we're headed for an ending as seemingly dark as its beginning. Episode 4 both sets characters off on their own journeys and by the end brings some back together.

Sibeth (Sylvia Hoeks) formerly known as the queen escapes and covers herself in animal manure to get past guard dogs. It's not pleasant but neither has most of her reign been. With dramatic piano chords benefitting ""The Phantom of the Opera"" she wanders in the woods.

The show is best when it's groups of people bantering in the woods as opposed to wallowing in damp industrial buildings.

Momoa's Baba Voss is really great at two things: fighting people and being a good dad. Now he's a great grandad to ""a boy named Wolffe and a dog named No."" He leaves his dog at first reluctant to have the companion all but now beloved and proven guarding his grandson whose reluctant father is Kofun (Archie Madekwe). Kofun of course was seduced by the former queen Sibeth who is both older creepy and happens to be his aunt. How ""House of the Dragon"" of them. Kofun feels guilty for helping Sibeth to hide before her escape.

Archie Madekwe and Nesta Cooper in ""See"" (Apple TV+)

Baba Voss Kofun Haniwa (Nesta Cooper) the likable Wren (Eden Epstein) and the hilarious Charlotte (Olivia Cheng) set off to rescue Jerlamarel's kids. The show is best when it's groups of people bantering in the woods as opposed to wallowing in damp industrial buildings so it's nice to see the band head off on a merry side quest. Time in the woods allows Baba Voss and Kofun to have a heart to heart. Baba Voss is good at those too. ""Stay alive my boy"" he advises before slapping him on his wound.

Animal manure is a recurring theme this episode.

Meanwhile Ambassador Trovere (Trieste Kelly Dunn) and Lord Harlan (Tom Mison) are off on their own flirting. Oops Harlan has fallen in love with the woman he was forced to marry new queen Maghra. He breaks off from the ambassador and heads with ""some associates"" to sneak into the city.

Baba Voss takes his group to the site of Bow Lion's death. The sighted kids examine the damage made by new-fangled explosions and Baba Voss convinces Ranger to join their cause by invoking the name of Tormada the scientist who created the bombs that killed so many already.

Michael Raymond-James and Jason Momoa in ""See"" (Apple TV+)

Animal manure is a recurring theme this episode as Harlan sneaks into Trovere's city whilst hiding in a rattling wagon of livestock. ""Did it have to be chickens?"" he asks like someone from another century who knows of ""Indiana Jones. ""

Sibeth struggles to make it alone in the wilderness doing an admirable job of smacking her lips after eating insects off a log while Harlan in his storyline delivers news of the advanced weapons headed the city's way. Sibeth's not actually alone either as there are wolves in these here woods. Mad scientist Tormada makes his case for explosions in front of the council. A demonstration is apparently in order. Harlan won't stop talking long enough to escape. I mean he just wants the details.

Harlan makes it but much of the council do not and the lord realizes that the sexy ambassador was in on it the whole time though she swears she didn't have a choice. She gives Harlan a choice though to ""live at the top of the new order."" But Harlan is nothing if not stubborn.

Sylvia Hoeks in ""See"" (Apple TV+)

It rains on Sibeth the show perhaps finally deciding that her character is more camp than anything else. And there's more than one ""Indiana Jones"" nod in this episode with Indy's least favorite reptile finding our least favorite royal. Sibeth's more Rasputin than queen as she apparently lives to be annoying another day.

We get an insight into the bomb factory where some of Jerlamarel's children are forced to work. Time for Baba Voss to work his magic and the women too who rescue the children. Maghra fights in her administrative way which is asking for a vote to finally begin an official battle.

""See"" keeps threatening war and perhaps like the downpour on Sibeth (and Maghra who's waiting vainly for her lost sister outside and on Baba Voss in his own storyline) the bombs mean it finally will rain firepower upon the fractured kingdoms.

One of Nvidia‚Äôs biggest partners that gamers and PC builders will be familiar with EVGA has now cited ‚Äúdisrespectful treatment‚Äù on Nvidia‚Äôs part and announced that the company will be completely exiting the GPU business.

The story came out when Steve Burke Editor-in-Chief at Gamers Nexus released a new video where Burke reports discussions held with EVGA CEO Andrew Han. The video suggests that EVGA will not be joining forces with Nvidia rivals AMD or Intel either and will simply not be making GPUs after the stock of the existing RTX 30-series is sold out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk2MDA1LWV2Z2Etc3RvcC1tYWtpbmctbnZpZGlhLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLWNpdGluZy1hYnVzaXZlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EVGA will stop making Nvidia graphics cards citing abusive relationship,"A hot potato: The relationship between Nvidia and one of its top board partners seems to have reached a breaking point. EVGA won't produce RTX 40 series GPUs effectively exiting the graphics card market entirely. Possibly heralding the end of EVGA the decision could bring closer attention to the business interactions between GPU makers and board partners.

In an exclusive report EVGA told Gamers Nexus that it won't sell Nvidia graphics cards after the RTX 30 series. The company will keep supporting current customers' warranties but expects to sell through its remaining inventory by the end of 2022.

A primary reason for the falling out is that Nvidia's Founders Edition 30 series GPUs have undercut EVGA's variants of those cards especially as Nvidia recently made significant price cuts to clear stock.

GPU makers boosted supply in response to the crypto boom but then the crash and the more recent Ethereum merge have left them struggling to get rid of unsold stock while competing with the deluge of used cards as they prepare to launch a new generation. Board manufacturers like EVGA say they can't absorb these shocks the way Nvidia can and EVGA says it is losing hundreds of dollars on every RTX 3080 or RTX 3090 sold.

The board partner also accuses Nvidia of a lack of communication regarding MSRP when launching new GPUs. EVGA doesn't know the final price it will sell cards for until Nvidia announces the suggested pricing to the public. The GPU maker also enforces price floors and ceilings restricting EVGA's ability to price its variants according to how it customizes overclocking or cooling systems.

Currently EVGA calls itself Nvidia's #1 authorized partner in US and UK graphics card sales and Nvidia GPUs make up about three-quarters of EVGA's gross revenue. Furthermore the company doesn't sell AMD or Intel cards and doesn't intend to after splitting with Nvidia. Power supplies comprise most of the rest of EVGA's business but it's hard to imagine what the company will look like in the coming year or two without GeForce products.

The decision to leave the GPU business didn't come suddenly or recently. EVGA says they notified Nvidia in April after trying to renegotiate the partnership several times. EVGA CEO and founder Andrew Han said the decision to leave Nvidia was easy and that working with the company was hard. Han called the choice a matter of principle not money.

Han says he has no intention of selling EVGA worrying investors would change its identity and culture. The company also doesn't want to lay anyone off but that seems almost inevitable if it abandoned its main source of revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9NaW5pc2ZvcnVtLU5VQ1hpNy1kZXNrdG9wLVBDLXJldmlldy1VbHRyYS1zbGltLWdhbWluZy1QQy13aXRoLUdlRm9yY2UtUlRYLTMwNzAtYW5kLUNvcmUtaTctMTE4MDBILjY1Mjg5Ny4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minisforum NUCXi7 desktop PC review: Ultra slim gaming PC with GeForce RTX 3070 and Core i7-11800H,"Minisforum is known as a system manufacturer for mini PCs in this country (Germany).

The company which is best known for manufacturing NVIDIA GeForce-based video cards is getting out of the GPU-making business. As Tom's Hardware and Ars Technica report company CEO Andrew Han sat down with YouTubers JayZTwoCents and Gamers Nexus in a closed-door interview to reveal EVGA's decision. He also talked about his grievances with NVIDIA.

Han told the YouTubers that NVIDIA had stopped treating EVGA as a true partner over the years despite their history. NVIDIA had allegedly stopped informing EVGA about new product announcements and important information such as suggested retail pricing and availability. That left add-in board partners like EVGA to find out details about the latest products on stage the same time we all do. Further NVIDIA's first-party Founders Edition cards undercut the prices of their counterparts from EVGA and other partners forcing the vendors to mark down their prices.

EVGA Han said will continue selling cards based on older GeForce GPUs like the RTX 3000 series. After it runs out of stock though that's it ‚Äî the company has no plans to team up with NVIDIA rivals AMD or Intel. EVGA has been selling other computer components and accessories such as power supplies and gaming mice for a while now. But according to Gamers Nexus 80 percent of the company's revenue comes from GeForce sales so this decision could put the company's very existence in jeopardy. When the YouTuber commented that this must have been a difficult decision to make the CEO reportedly replied that this was easy and it was working with NVIDIA that was hard.

In its forums EVGA has posted the following statement:

EVGA will not carry the next generation graphics cards. EVGA will continue to support the existing current generation products. EVGA will continue to provide the current generation products. EVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup. Also EVGA would like to say thank you to our great community for the many years of support and enthusiasm for EVGA graphics cards.

As for NVIDIA Bryan Del Rizzo the director of global public relations for GeForce told Tom's Hardware:

We‚Äôve had a great partnership with EVGA over the years and will continue to support them on our current generation of products. We wish Andrew and our friends at EVGA all the best.

O,Realty Income,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2hlcmVzLXdoeS1yZWFsdHktaW5jb21lLWlzLWEtbm8tYnJhaW5lci1kaXZpZGVuZC1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Realty Income Is a No-Brainer Dividend Stock,"This reliable business has withstood the test of time.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O -0.16%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

With its 4.4% dividend yield and monthly dividend payouts investors in search of passive income can't go wrong with Realty Income stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two totalitarian empires entered into an alliance planning to divide the independent countries of Central Europe amongst themselves. The German sphere of influence was to include western Poland Lithuania and Romania while the Soviet control was to extend over eastern Poland Latvia Estonia and Finland.

For my nation the most important consequence of the pact was the joint liquidation of the independent Polish state and the division of our territory between two occupying powers Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Other provisions of the treaty were partially modified in the following two years. Finland managed to protect its sovereignty in the Winter War of 1940. Lithuania though after an episode of relative independence was absorbed by the Soviet Union. But various detailed amendments did not affect the critical principle of the pact ‚Äì Hitler‚Äôs and Stalin‚Äôs imperialisms were from then on to decide the fate of the peoples and states of our part of Europe.

Under German occupation Poland suffered enormous human and material losses. The Nazis killed 6 million citizens of the Republic of Poland including nearly 3 million Polish Jews. They destroyed and burned thousands of Polish towns and villages most of all the country‚Äôs capital Warsaw. They stole countless material possessions and cultural assets both private and public which were never returned to my country. Only a few of the perpetrators of German genocide extermination war crimes mass terror and looting were brought after the war before the tribunals in Nurnberg and Warsaw and suffered the punishment they deserved.

Still Nazi Germany‚Äôs crimes were at least morally condemned by the entire free world. Unfortunately this does not apply to the crimes of Communist Russia which went unpunished and often forgotten.

What did the Soviet occupation of more than half of Poland‚Äôs pre-war territory entail? It entailed the Katyn Massacre ‚Äì the extermination of 22000 prisoners of war: Polish Army officers policemen soldiers civil clerks and other political prisoners. They were shot in defiance of all international conventions because Stalin regarded them as patriots loyal to their homeland and implacable enemies of communism. It entailed the deportation of half a million of my compatriots to gulags and forced settlements in Siberia and the Asian part of the Soviet Union a vast number of whom never returned from that ‚Äúinhuman land‚Äù and died in exile. It entailed brutal NKVD terror and ideological indoctrination attempts to crush the Polish national identity and tradition the coercive instillation of communist principles in children and forcing a renunciation of faith.

We Poles are not the only ones who have suffered from all of it. The Baltic nations Estonians Latvians and Lithuanians were equally afflicted. So were other nations that fell within the Soviet sphere of influence after Russia‚Äôs victory over the Third Reich.

The Nazi-Soviet pact collapsed less than two years after its conclusion when Germany attacked Stalin‚Äôs Russia on 22 June 1941. But the principle stating that the fate of the Central and Eastern European countries was to be decided not by their free peoples but by the rulers of the imperial powers remained in force.

The Soviets defeated the Nazis and in 1945 seized the entire territory of Poland and other states further to the west and south as far as the rivers Elbe Danube and Drava. Some of them were annexed directly to the Soviet Union as federal states ‚Äì such was the fate of the Balts Belarusians or Ukrainians. In others Russia installed puppet governments made up of local communists completely subservient to Moscow ‚Äì this happened in Poland Czechoslovakia Romania Hungary Bulgaria and eastern Germany.

For our peoples the defeat of the Third Reich did not bring the long-awaited freedom. The subjection to the Russian empire continued until the fall of communism ‚Äì for half of a century!

It was not until the democratic changes initiated in 1989 by the Polish ‚ÄúSolidarity‚Äù movement that the Poles and other nations of Central and Eastern Europe truly liberated themselves and regained the sovereignty of their states. Most of them gradually became full members of the European Union and NATO.

However the independence of any country from our region has always been a thorn in the Russian imperialists‚Äô side. Thus as soon as Moscow recovered from the shock of losing its Stalinist sphere of influence it started moving toward restoring the empire. We remember the military assault on Georgia in 2008. We also remember several brutal suppressions of the freedom movements in Belarus and Ukraine. Finally we remember Russia‚Äôs hostile policy towards independent Ukraine the military annexation of Crimea and Donbas in 2014 and above all the ongoing full-scale genocidal war against the sovereign Ukrainian state unleashed on 24 February 2022.

For the nations of our region who remember the historical events symbolised by today‚Äôs date ‚Äì 17 September ‚Äì there is no doubt that imperial Russia is seeking to enthral other countries yet again. It wants the same thing it wanted in 1939 and 1940 when it acted in alliance with Hitler‚Äôs Germany and between 1945 and 1991 when it ruled our countries on its own.

Russia has always wanted power over all of Central and Eastern Europe. But a free Poland free Ukraine and all the other independent states of our region will never agree to this.

For our peoples it is a matter of life and death preserving identity and survival. It is a matter of our future security and prosperity.

According to the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2016 by average 556 women die from childbirth a slight decrease over ten years from 578 in 2005. With the current annual rate of reduction Tanzania may not meet the global goal of reducing maternal deaths to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

With high teenage pregnancy (32%) high birth rate (6.7) unmet need for family planning (28%) and lower than national average antenatal clinic attendance 16% below 40% national average Kigoma is one of the regions in Tanzania with highest maternal deaths. In 2019 Kigoma reported 100 maternal deaths119 in 2020 and 75 deaths reported in 2021.

A recent assessment conducted by the regional health management team also found high rates of maternal death. According to the report the major causes of high maternal death included: obstetric hemorrhage which accounts for 56% of all maternal deaths in the Kigoma region whereas hypertensive disorders contribute (9%) sepsis (8%) anemia in pregnancy (6%) obstructed labor (4%). Other causes claimed 17% of maternal deaths in 2021.

In rural areas of the Kigoma region access of pregnant women to quality health services is constrained by inadequate skills among healthcare providers distance to health facilities cost inadequate obstetric diagnostic capacities and inadequate and unreliable referral.

Other reasons including quality of services contribute to high maternal and perinatal death in the Kigoma region. To solve the problem the regional health management is working with WHO and other partners to improve access to equitable and affordable quality Emergency Obstetric and Essential Newborn Care services in the region.

‚ÄúWe developed a three years 2020-2023 contingency plan to avert the high number of maternal and perinatal deaths because our region has the highest number of maternal deaths nationally‚Äù said Dr. Benadeta Peter Kigoma Regional Reproductive Child Health Officer. The plan addresses the identified critical issues related to the quality of health care the competence of health care providers and access to health services.

The plan seeks to address a weak referral system especially in villages along Lake Tanganyika inadequate skills and competencies of providers in obstetric emergencies and limited equipment to screen danger signs leading to delays in making the right decisions. Other partners supporting Kigoma region‚Äôs effort to reduce maternal and perinatal deaths are United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) UNICEF World Vision UMATI Marie Stoppes Women Promotion and Tanzania Red Cross Society.

With generous support from the Norwegian Embassy WHO is supporting the Kigoma region to build technical capacities in managing obstetric and newborn complications. ‚ÄúThese efforts coupled with other partners‚Äô contributions will subsequently avert the trend of maternal and newborn deaths‚Äù said Dr. Jairos Hiliza WHO Field Officer in Kigoma.

To begin with WHO supported the training of 88 healthcare providers on Obstetric Emergencies and Essential Newborn care whose 87% were newly employed healthcare providers who had limited practical skills to manage obstetric and newborn emergencies.

Additionally WHO supported the training of 55 trainers of trainees who will be readily available to continue with onsite mentorship coaching and supportive supervision during the routine health services provision.

With participants from all eight (8) districts and refugee camps the training has equipped 37 health facilities that provide Emergency Obstetric and Essential Newborn Care services with skilled health care providers to help save the lives of mothers and children in Kigoma Region.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi5wbC93ZWIvdGFuemFuaWEtZW4vd2Utam9pbi13b3JsZC1jbGVhbnVwLWRheS1pbi10YW56YW5pYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We join World Cleanup Day in Tanzania - Poland in Tanzania,In order to ensure the highest quality of our services we use small files called cookies.

A federal judge approved a fund Friday for more than 1000 people who said they were sexually abused by a former physician at the University of Michigan according to court documents.

The order allows victims of Dr. Robert Anderson to start collecting some of the $490 million settlement negotiated with the school earlier this year according to the documents filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Anderson who worked at the university from 1966 to 2003 has been accused of sexual assault against hundreds of students ‚Äì including a two-time Super Bowl champion and a former world-class wrestler. Anderson died in 2008.

Last year an investigation commissioned by the university into the allegations found that university officials failed to act on the reports.

The settlement finalized Friday required ‚Äúconsent from 98% of the claimants‚Äù and was done through a ‚Äúa neutral third-party mediator‚Äù who was appointed by a judge the university said in a Friday news release.

‚ÄúThe University of Michigan offers its heartfelt apology for the abuse perpetrated by the late Robert Anderson‚Äù university Board of Regents Chair Paul Brown said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe hope this settlement helps the healing process for survivors.‚Äù

The victims are responsible for deciding how to divide the settlement funds the university added.

‚ÄúThis settlement allows the university to protect future generations of students and everyone in the university community‚Äù university president Mary Sue Coleman said. ‚ÄúIt complements a separate settlement reached earlier this year that adds a Coordinated Community Response Team to the best practices now in place.‚Äù

That team was created to improve the university‚Äôs response to sexual misconduct reports according to the university.

The allegations at the University of Michigan mirror those in years past against Larry Nassar at Michigan State University and Richard Strauss at Ohio State University ‚Äì both doctors who abused their trusted positions to sexually abuse college students and athletes. The cases also involve allegations that powerful institutions ignored or otherwise dismissed complaints about sexual misconduct.

Sexual abuse allegations span decades

The investigation into the allegations against Anderson began in March 2020 and a report on the findings dated May 2021 concluded that he had sexually assaulted and abused at least several hundred patients.

After dozens of interviews the inquiry also found that the university failed to act on reports of egregious misconduct.

The 240-page extensive report cites interviews with hundreds of former patients as well as ‚Äúapproximately 200 current and former University employees including administrators faculty members and coaches as well as additional (University Health Services) Athletic Department and Michigan Medicine personnel.‚Äù

Initially Anderson served as a University Health Services doctor and was moved to the Athletic Department in 1981 after ‚Äúcredible reports of misconduct‚Äù were relayed to Thomas Easthope the then-assistant vice president of student services in 1978 or 1979 according to the report.

In an interview with the report‚Äôs authors and sworn testimony Easthope told investigators that he was aware of allegations against Anderson at the time and ‚Äúclaimed to have confronted Dr. Anderson and fired him‚Äù according to the report. ‚ÄúBut Mr. Easthope did not do so‚Äù the report said. Easthope died in February 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JvYmVydC1sZXdhbmRvd3NraS1ob3Qtc3RyZWFrLWNvbnRpbnVlcy0yMTE0MDg4ODYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Lewandowski hot streak continues as Barcelona go top of LaLiga,"Robert Lewandowski‚Äôs double helped lift Barcelona into top spot in LaLiga as they cruised to a 3-0 home win against 10-man Elche.

On Saturday (Sept. 17) the moon will enter the stage of its phase called the last quarter ‚Äî also called the third quarter ‚Äî during which time it will be half-illuminated as seen from Earth.

Both the last quarter and the third quarter may be confusing names for this stage initially as the moon is half illuminated but they actually refer to the fact that the moon has completed 3/4 of its orbit around Earth at this point.

The half-lit moon will be visible over New York at around 11:00 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT on Sept. 18) and it will disappear from view at the break of dawn on Sunday (Sept. 18) around 6:19 a.m. EDT (1019 GMT). At this time the last quarter moon will reach an altitude of around 74 degrees above the horizon in the southeast (about seven fist widths at arm's length).

During the lunar cycle which takes around 29.5 days to complete the moon is seen at different stages of illumination and at different times of the day.

At the last quarter the moon rises around midnight and is at its maximum height above the horizon at around dawn. It sets around midday.

During the stage of the lunar cycle that includes the last quarter the illumination of the moon is receding as its phase changes from the full moon to the new moon.

The moon is said to be waning at this time as it changes from full moon ‚Äî its most illuminated state ‚Äî to its least illuminated stage called the new moon. The moon's lighted side is shrinking because its orbit is taking it out of view from our perspective here on Earth.

The next stage in the moon's cycle after the last quarter is the waning crescent. At this point the moon will be seen as little more than an arc of silver light as it is nearly back to the point in its orbit at which it directly faces the sun.

Following this is the new moon at which point the moon's illuminated side is fully facing the sun appearing near invisible from here on Earth. At this point the moon rises and set with the sun meaning it is out during the day. Following this the lighted side of the moon grows and the moon begins to rise later each day ‚Äî during which it is described as waxing ‚Äî continuing until it is once again fully illuminated during the next full moon.

The divide between the light side and the dark side of the moon is called the 'lunar terminator' and during the last quarter it marks sunset on the moon. On the flip side of this during the first quarter the lunar terminator shows sunrise on the moon.

During both the first and last quarters from above the moon's axis the lunar terminator is aligned with the terminator line of Earth that divides night and day on our planet.

The next lunar cycle begins with the new moon on Sept. 25 with the next full moon on Oct. 9 and then the next last quarter moon rising on Oct. 17.

A travel industry insider said the company had lost patience and was inclined not to send its Spectrum of the Seas ship back to Hong Kong after a failure to get a clear answer from the government a month after it made an application to restart the service.

Cruise line Royal Caribbean International is expected to abandon its plans to relaunch a ‚Äúcruise to nowhere‚Äù service in Hong Kong because it has taken too long to get permission from health authorities the Post has learned.

Industry leaders last month confirmed Royal Caribbean had tried to get approval from the Health Bureau to resume a ‚Äúcruise to nowhere‚Äù service.

A company representative detailed its precautions and on-board healthcare facilities at a closed-doors meeting in a bid to show how it would deal with potential Covid-19 outbreaks.

An industry source who attended the meeting told the Post it had been expected Royal Caribbean would be given the go-ahead inside a few days to send its ship back to Hong Kong in the fourth quarter of the year as the meeting was ‚Äúvery positive‚Äù.

‚ÄúUnfortunately the cruise company waited one month but no reply. So most likely they will announce that they will give up because they can‚Äôt wait any more ‚Ä¶ Even if RCI announces they will come back it will probably be after December only. We missed the whole summer period‚Äù the source said.

A spokeswoman for the cruise line stopped short of confirmation that it had abandoned its plans to restart a service from Hong Kong.

But she said it was difficult to include the city in any of its plans with no clear road map from officials on further easing of pandemic curbs and that cruise lines needed ‚Äúconsiderable lead time to redeploy ships from one region to another‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe understand Hong Kong may have different views and we have been working with the local authorities for over eight months now since our suspension ‚Ä¶ but we are really running out of time‚Äù she said.

The spokeswoman did not specify which vessel was involved or for how long the company might abandon its plans to set sail from Hong Kong.

She added Hong Kong was ‚Äúone of the last markets‚Äù in the world that had still to resume cruises.

The spokeswoman said that Singapore had restarted cruises almost two years ago and had returned to voyages with destinations from June this year.

She highlighted that more than 125000 Hongkongers enjoyed trips last year with zero infections and emphasised that ‚Äúcruises to nowhere‚Äù were a safe holiday option.

‚ÄúCruises to nowhere‚Äù where a ship puts to sea but does not dock anywhere else before returning to its home port have been used over the coronavirus crisis in a bid to keep the industry ticking over.

The news came as a string of major sports events were cancelled or moved elsewhere because of strict Covid-19 rules or the government‚Äôs failure to make decisions in time to allow proper organisation.

It also came as the city considered an end to hotel quarantine measures for overseas arrivals if the number of new Covid-19 infections stabilised.

Cruises were scuppered earlier this year after the government increased efforts to stem the spread of Omicron variants of Covid-19 which forced the cruise industry and tourism in general to grind to a halt.

Freddy Yip Hing-ning the managing director of Goldjoy Holidays warned any further delays on easing curbs by the government would hurt the travel sector further.

He added the resumption of cruise services would provide ‚Äúgreat help‚Äù to the battered industry.

‚Äú[The health authorities] have been delaying and delaying. They don‚Äôt care about the industry they don‚Äôt care about the Hong Kong economy‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIf the ship comes back the Hong Kong government will immediately have a good image. The port can hire a few hundred people to work immediately.‚Äù

He said travel agencies were struggling because of a lack of income but the resumption of a cruise service would allow them to earn some commission when customers made bookings through their platforms.

A spokesman for the Health Bureau said the government had been exploring whether there was scope to refine its safety measures for cruise ships.

He said factors like transmission risks infection control requirements and industry concerns would be taken into account and that the government‚Äôs decisions would be announced in a timely manner.

The spokesman emphasised that the government was committed to allowing the resumption of normal social and economic activities as soon as possible but also had to safeguard public health.

He highlighted that cruise operations have been allowed to restart under the second phase of social distancing relaxation measures in May.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi12cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1jaG9vc2luZy1iZXR3ZWVuLWJpZy1jcnVpc2UtbGluZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean vs. Carnival: Which Is the Better Cruise Line?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/royal-caribbean-vs-carnival-choosing-between-big-cruise-lines on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi12cy1jYXJuaXZhbC1jaG9vc2luZy1iZXR3ZWVuLWJpZy1jcnVpc2UtbGluZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy81LWNydWlzZS1zaGlwLXNob3JlLWV4Y3Vyc2lvbnMtaS10cmllZC1hbmQtaW5zdGFudGx5LXJlZ3JldHRlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 cruise ship shore excursions I tried and instantly regretted,"There have been a few shore excursions I've taken over the years that I would love to get my time and money back.

Shore excursions are a major part of any cruise vacation because the ports of call a cruise ship visits is an extension of the overall trip. Each day you visit a new port and there's just enough time to get a taste of what that city island or country has to offer.

I've usually had good luck with choosing a tour as I've learned the sort of things I like and don't like to do. But once in a while I run into a dud and realize I've made a mistake.

Sometimes the issue is subjective because I personally don't care for the type of tour offered or something else just isn't my cup of tea.

Other times I felt the tour just didn't measure up to expectations. In any case it left me wishing I had done something else.

Here are five times I took a cruise ship shore excursion and reconsidered my decision making almost immediately.

Blue Waters Beach Escape in Falmouth

Ever since Royal Caribbean started visiting Falmouth Jamaica I've struggled to find a great go-to shore excursion.

Part of the issue is Falmouth is a relatively new cruise port and there aren't a lot of attractions nearby which means you need a long bus trip to get to the great stuff.

On one visit in 2016 I thought to heck with spending an hour or more on a bus we'll go to the beach and enjoy the Caribbean waters because how bad could it be?

We tried Blue Waters Beach Escape that I booked through Royal Caribbean and it reinforced one of the most common issues a person can have on a tour booked through the cruise line: an oversold and underwhelming experience.

While bus ride was short to the beach (about 10 minutes) we found a ton of other tours had beaten us here which left very little seating.

Some guests who arrived after us had no chairs available and had to settle for beach chair mats until chairs were freed up by departing guests. The shore excursion title says ""An exclusive Blue Waters Beach Escape"" but clearly this was not as exclusive as one may have thought.

On top of that the food offered by the beach's ""5-star chefs"" was also quite underwhelming and limited.

The lesson for me here was to reconsider beach break shore excursions sold through the cruise line for the overselling aspect it brings with it. In the Caribbean there are plenty of beaches in any port so I'm best served by finding another way to visit one of the other less-crowded options.

A day at Margaritaville

Another ""Jamaica mistaica"" was to skip the tours all together and just hang out at the Margaritaville in Falmouth.

On my next visit to Falmouth we thought we'd take it easy and just hang out in the Margaritaville bar that contained within the Falmouth cruise port because it has a rather large pool plenty of chairs and food that we'll enjoy (even if it's nothing special or authentic).

The day started off good as we got to Margaritaville and found our spot. There was no cost to enter the pool or use the facilities and the kids really enjoyed the pool.

Unfortunately a lot of other people had the same idea we did and by mid-morning the pool and seating was super crowded.

Being a Margaritaville the food and drink were nothing spectacular but also quite expensive. The longer we stayed the more I thought ""I could be enjoying a very similar experience back on the cruise ship for a lot less money"".

We eventually packed things up and went back to the ship but the lesson I learned here was Margaritaville is fine for a quick visit not a whole day stop.

Trying to get to St. John on my own

Ever since I visited St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands I loved how absolutely beautiful it was and wanted to return every time.

In order to visit St. John you have to take the ferry from an area of St. Thomas known as Red Hook. Red Hook is not really near any popular beaches so it is not exactly the most popular destinations out there.

My plan was to go take the ferry to nearby St. John and enjoy a day at one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever visited.

We went to the taxi stand and asked to go to Red Hook. In St. Thomas taxis in the form of a sedan are nearly nonexistent.

Each taxi driver passed us on to someone else as they were unwilling to drive us there. For some strange reason the taxis in St. Thomas are primarily these converted pickup truck buses and the taxi operators all want to maximize every seat in the vehicle.

So after 30-40 minutes of literally standing around to go we were told to board one of these buses to go to Red Hook. Except the bus was not going to Red Hook. We asked the people onboard where they were headed and were told some other beach on the island. So clearly the plan was to take these folks somewhere and drop us off later.

I was so irritated at the situation that I decided I would rather spend my day back on the ship than deal with the taxi consortium.

My lesson learned here was to either book a Royal Caribbean excursion that would take us to St. John or pre-arrange private transportation to the ferry area.

Kennedy Space Center

Don't worry I loved Kennedy Space Center when I visited it on my Anthem of the Seas cruise. The issue was how I chose to get there.

We sailed on Anthem of the Seas from New York and had a port stop in Port Canaveral.

I don't remember why but when we decided to visit Kennedy Space Center I was fixated on finding a Royal Caribbean shore excursion to take us there. Kennedy Space Center is a very short distance by car from Port Canaveral and I'm not certain why I didn't take a taxi cab.

We got to the space center without any problems and had a fabulous time but we wasted a lot of time with the bus.

We booked the Kennedy Space Center Express tour which was not a guided tour and it would simply drive us to the entrance and give us a time to return back.

Part of my mistake was assuming 5 hours at Kennedy Space Center was going to be too much time and I'd run out of things to do. The reality was I wish we had another five hours because it was incredible.

Had I just taken a taxi to Kennedy Space Center we could have squeezed out another hour or two from our day.

Mr. Sanchos in Cozumel

My most recent shore excursion goof was spending the day at Mr Sanchos Beach Club in Cozumel.

Within a half hour of arriving that little voice in my head started saying ""this was a mistake"" and I tried my best to enjoy the day but it was a disappointment.

It's my opinion that Mr. Sanchos' popularity seems to have lead to the one faux pas of any beach spot: overcrowding. They clearly had sold every chair and table at the resort and I found it to be overcrowded and unenjoyable.

The wait staff were great but I found it disappointing how busy things were because it felt like we were all pushed together a little too much.

Making matters worse was the food which came overcooked and didn't taste great.

I know Mr. Sanchos is a beach resort a lot of people have enjoyed over the years but I thought it paled in comparison to many other beach days spots in Cozumel.

Bonus: Walt Disney World

Consider this a word of caution rather than a personal experience.

A lot of cruisers that visit Port Canaveral for the day are tempted to book a shore excursion that takes them to Walt Disney World in nearby Orlando.

It's an hour-long drive and seems like a great idea for a day visit.

The problem with this idea is how incredibly expensive a one-day pass is to the parks along with the timing.

Because your ship arrives much later than when the theme parks open for the day (compounded by the fact it will take you time to disembark and then drive to the parks) you'll have a very limited window of time to enjoy what Disney offers.

Moreover because you have to be back onboard the ship much sooner than the theme parks close there's just no way you're getting your money's worth from a day visit.

If you want to experience Disney World with a cruise your best best is to do a land vacation there before your cruise for a few days and then book a short weekend cruise on Royal Caribbean to recuperate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5aGVyYWxkLnN4L2lzbGFuZHMvaGFybW9ueS1vZi10aGUtc2Vhcy1jYW5jZWxzLXRodXJzZGF5LXBvcnQtc3QtbWFhcnRlbi12aXNpdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Harmony of the Seas' cancels Thursday Port St. Maarten visit,"‚ÄòHarmony of the Seas‚Äô cancels Thursday Port St. Maarten visit

Interacting with the audience after the launch of the Bangla edition of his book ‚ÄòWhy Bharat Matters‚Äô in Kolkata S Jaishankar said ‚ÄúThey (Western countries) do want to influence us because many of these countries feel that they have influenced this world for the last 70-80 years...Western countries actually feel that they influenced the world for the last 200 years.

Jaishankar claimed that the Western media want a certain ‚Äúclass of people‚Äù to rule the country and feel ‚Äúdisturbed‚Äù when the Indian electorate doesn't feel the same way.

Jaishanakar was responding to a question on allegations made against India by Canada and the US of poll interference and conducting operations on foreign soil.

""Why are these newspapers so negative on India? Because they see an India that is not in a sense compliant with their image of how India should be. They want people ideology or a way of life...they want that class of people to rule this country and they are disturbed when the Indian population feels otherwise"" Jaishankar said at the event.

The minister also alleged that Western media at times ‚Äúopenly endorsed candidates and political parties‚Äù.

""The Western media in some cases have openly endorsed candidates and political parties they don't hide their preference. They are very smart somebody is doing this domination game for 300 years they learn a lot anubhavi log hain chatur log hain (they are experienced and clever people)"" he said.

Describing it as a ""mind game"" Jaishankar took a dig at the West pointing out that nations resorting to legal avenues to determine election outcomes are now lecturing India.

‚ÄúThey (newspapers) will reputationally damage you somebody will bring out an index and put you down in that... The countries which have to go to court to decide the result of their election are giving us gyan about how to conduct the election. This is the mind game that is happening in the world‚Äù Jaishankar said.

Jaishankar subtly alluded to the ongoing legal dispute initiated by Donald Trump in his attempt to reverse the 2020 US Presidential election results where Joe Biden defeated him.

""Any entity anyone considering business deals with Iran they need to be aware of the potential risk they are opening themselves up to potential risk of sanctions"" he added.

The Long-Term Bilateral Contract on Chabahar Port Operation was signed between Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) of India and the Port & Maritime Organisation (PMO) of Iran on Monday enabling the operation of Shahid-Behesti port in the Chabahar Port Development Project for a period of 10 years.

Mr Jaishankar further said that India had a long association with the project but was not able to sign a long-term pact which was important. He added that New Delhi was able to sort out the issues and sign the long-term agreement which will benefit the entire region.

""We have had a long association with the Chabahar Port but we could never sign a long-term agreement. The reason was...there were various problems on the Iranian end...the joint-venture partner changes the condition changed"" the Foreign Minister said.

He added ""Finally we were able to sort this out and we were able to get the long-term agreement done. The long-term agreement is necessary because without it you cannot really improve the port operation. And the port operation we believe will benefit the entire region.""

The Chabahar Port is an India-Iran flagship project that serves as an important transit port for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries which are landlocked countries. India has been a key player in the development and operation of Chabahar Port.

The Indian government has invested in the port's infrastructure and has been involved in upgrading its facilities to make it a viable transit route for Indian goods bound for Afghanistan and Central Asia.

But now the pioneering brand is set to make a triumphant comeback in Northern Virginia by the end of 2024.

Flight co-owners Swati Bose and Kabir Amir who earned a James Beard semifinalist nod for Outstanding Wine Program in 2020 and 2023 just inked a 2175-square-foot lease to reopen in National Landing (269 19th Court S. Arlington Virginia). Flight fans can expect to find a familiar selection of small-production and terroir-driven varietals but this time around Flight will forgo its sit-down restaurant and bar model and largely function as a bottle shop instead. (Meanwhile its original Chinatown space at 777 6th Street NW will get a new life this spring as a Mexican establishment called Mezcal Cantina. Its Maryland-based operator bought out Flight‚Äôs liquor license Bose tells Eater.)

For its next chapter Flight 2.0 will sit on the ground floor of JBG Smith‚Äôs shiny new apartment complex called the Grace. Flight‚Äôs founders started talking to its future landlord in early 2023 long before they decided to close in D.C. The original plan was to plant a second Flight Wine Bar at the glossy mixed-use project near Amazon HQ2.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now more of a hybrid and pure retail concept ‚Äî we thought it seemed like the right time space and partners for this‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe area is developing so fast. It‚Äôs pretty exciting and doesn‚Äôt feel real yet.‚Äù

Some Flight features will remain unchanged. The team will continue to host its intimate wine classes ‚Äî which will now be offered three times (as opposed to once) a month for groups up to 12 ‚Äî as well as tastings with a chosen winemaker every week.

Flight will open with 150 wines which is significantly smaller than its 800-count list before. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre staying with the philosophy of [offering] wines from lesser-known regions with minimal intervention‚Äù she says.

While the new location is still in its preliminary design phase Flight 2.0 will definitely look different than its dimly lit and slightly subterranean Chinatown digs. ‚ÄúWe envision the space to be bright and airy ‚Äî we are lucky to have a nice corner spot with large windows‚Äù she says. The sun-drenched setup will also offer direct access to the building‚Äôs lobby.

The eclectic global wine list Flight is known for will be joined by select beer and non-alcoholic beverages stocked around the space. Instead of serving a full-blown food menu like before Flight will simply sell cheeses and charcuterie to fashion boards at home. All wines purchased by the bottle can be consumed off-site.

‚ÄúRestaurant pricing is hard when it comes to wines so we‚Äôre really excited to be able to do retail pricing‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt was tough to make the decision to close Flight in Chinatown but we made the right [one] and had a good send-off.‚Äù

Soon after liquidating their inventory through pick-up sales the well-traveled couple ran off to New Zealand for two weeks ‚Äî one of their favorite wine regions ‚Äî before buckling down to sign off on the new lease.

Flight will help activate the foot of the 337-unit 26-story apartment building. The Grace will open in tandem alongside REVA an even bigger rental complex with 471 units.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9wcm9mb290YmFsbHRhbGsvcnVtb3ItbWlsbC9uZXdzL2pldHMtc2lnbi1maWZ0aC1yb3VuZC1kYi1xd2FudGV6LXN0aWdnZXJzLXNldmVudGgtcm91bmQtcy1qYXlsZW4ta2V50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets sign fifth-round DB Qwan'tez Stiggers seventh-round S Jaylen Key,"The Jets signed two more draft picks Monday leaving only third-round receiver Malachi Corley unsigned.

Investment Highlights

Arabian Drilling is poised to benefit from its strong presence in the Kingdom and from the positive tailwinds in the onshore and offshore drilling market

Primarily operates in the Kingdom which is a leading oil-producing country characterised by the lowest production costs in the world.[9]

The Kingdom is critical in addressing the robust hydrocarbon demand in the MENA region and globally with the Kingdom expected to be the key contributor towards the incremental volume additions in the MENA region with 30% of the total MENA additions until 2030G.9 The Kingdom is expected to increase its hydrocarbon production in onshore and offshore by 2025G at a CAGR of 3% between 2021G and 2025G reaching 13 mmboe/d in 2025G.9

Arabian Drilling has played ‚Äì and continues to play ‚Äì a significant and integral role in the growing resilient and changing hydrocarbon production market in the Kingdom with E&P drilling expenditure in the Kingdom expected to increase by 13% per annum from 2021G to 2025G to support increased production. This is underpinned by Saudi Aramco ‚Äì the Company‚Äôs main customer and the main operator of E&P activities in the Kingdom ‚Äì which announced significant plans to increase relevant annual E&P expenditure to over SAR 150 billion for 2022G compared to SAR 120 billion in 2021G and SAR 101 billion in 2020G (with expenditure expected to grow through to the middle of the decade).

Furthermore the Kingdom is expected to significantly increase natural gas production to cater to the growing gas demand in the Kingdom with the highest demand growth of more than 5% CAGR between 2021G and 2030G compared to a 1.5% increase globally.9

The cost competitiveness of liquids supply in the Kingdom and the Middle East as a whole is expected to result in activity concentration in the region as we move towards 2030G.

All of these factors are expected to drive onshore and offshore rig demand and Arabian Drilling is well positioned to capitalize on the strong market tailwinds.

Track record of operational excellence maximizing value for its customers as evidenced through its industry-high utilization rates robust score on Rig Efficiency Index (REI) non-productive time performance and excellent safety standards when benchmarked against international standards.

Arabian Drilling scores highly on the REI a key barometer for operational performance and part of a contractor‚Äôs eligibility to participate in Saudi Aramco tenders and historically it has maintained a consistently high REI score above 90% (36-month average of 92%) which has supported longer term contract extensions and renewals with Saudi Aramco generally at premium day rate compared to the Company‚Äôs competitors.

Superior operational performance and REI score has resulted in the Company having a strong contract backlog of SAR 8.2 billion as of 31 July 2022G which represents a 3.8x multiple on 2021G revenue including SAR 5.5 billion directly from Saudi Aramco.

Arabian Drilling exhibited one of the lowest non-productive times in the drilling industry with 0.74% NPT in 2021G (lowest NPT achieved in the last seven years) with zero business interruption delivering real tangible value to its customers.

Arabian Drilling is committed to achieving operational excellence in performance quality and safety through ensuring strong operational excellence foundations training and leveraging technology to drive operational efficiencies and improvements resulting in:

Best performing player in the Kingdom with outstanding performance across all relevant industry KPIs: As of 30 June 2022G the Company had a utilization rate of 91% which indicates that out of the 45 rigs 41 rigs were contracted and operational. Industry high safety record with an all-time low total recordable incident frequency rate (TRIF) and lost time incident frequency rate (LTIF) of 0.22 and 0.14 respectively as of 31 December 2021G; well below both the Company‚Äôs targets and industry averages.[10]



As of 30 June 2022G 27 rigs scored superior performance with >95% REI and 10 rigs were recognized as high performers with 85-95% REI.



Robust financial profile with a strong track record of resilient profitability margins and a solid balance sheet

Consistently delivered robust financial performance backed by a strong balance sheet with conservative leverage levels and a disciplined approach to cost management.

Arabian Drilling has a superior financial profile with resilient profitability through various economic cycles achieving a 41% EBITDA margin in 2021G (and an average of more than 40% over the last three years) despite the ongoing effects of the pandemic and oil price shocks in 2020G. EBITDA margin has been consistently higher compared to global drilling peers through the cycle and has been maintained at these levels for the past three years.

Business model based on a lean cost structure characterised by a highly skilled work force with an in-house maintenance and technical team. Through the implementation of various cost reduction initiatives Arabian Drilling has managed to make significant cost savings totalling over SAR 180 million across both 2020G and 2021G.

In 2021G the Company recorded total revenue of SAR 2.2 billion ($586 million) ‚Äì the onshore segment recorded revenue of SAR 1.6 billion ($439 million) representing 75% of the total revenues and the offshore segment recorded SAR 553 million ($147 million) representing 25% of the total revenues:

Strong increase in day rates improved utilization rates and new contract awards are expected to boost revenues in the short to medium term.

Utilization rates are expected to reach 100% by 2023G up from 91% as of 30 June 2022G.

Despite some pandemic-related impacts the Company has reacted swiftly with a strong growth in operations resulting in a significant and almost four-fold increase in the Company‚Äôs contract backlog (up from SAR 2.4 billion as of 31 December 2021G to SAR 8.2 billion as of 31 July 2022G) adding further visibility to its revenue going forward.

Continued strong cash generation disciplined cost management and capex spend have resulted in the Company reducing its net debt resulting in a healthy leverage level (1.1x as of December 2021G and 0.7x as of 30 June 2022G) which is well below its peers.[11]

Disciplined growth strategy to build scale deliver performance and generate attractive shareholder returns underpinned by several strategic and growth levers

Aims to solidify its position as the Kingdom‚Äôs national champion by expanding its fleet and also tapping into the expected growth in the KSA market including the significant increase in the offshore drilling rigs and the surge in unconventional drilling that is expected to occur in the coming years (i.e. Jafurah unconventional gas field). The Company has a track record of expanding its fleet having successfully increased its rig fleet by 40% over the past five years from 32 in 2016G to 45 in 2021G.

Expand its regional footprint into other adjacent geographies through both organic and inorganic growth opportunities leveraging its infrastructure and operational expertise. The Company recently submitted tender proposals in Bahrain and Kuwait. These opportunistic markets provide additional growth avenues to increase free cash flows and returns to shareholders.

Text description provided by the architects. Pine Bluff Arkansas was once a Mississippi Delta jewel positioned where southern pines meet vast farmlands along the Arkansas River. Like many delta cities Pine Bluff was in steady decline as industries relocated and river traffic waned. The city that once boasted 70000 people fell to 40000 in population gaining a negative national reputation for crime hurting its ability to draw industry and retain homegrown talent.

A once thriving Main Street that boasted the State‚Äôs largest theater now stood lined with empty dilapidated storefronts‚Ä¶downtown felt abandoned. When several buildings collapsed onto Main Street city leaders and citizens banded together to save Main Street and create economic incentives; the citizens wanted to reverse the course of their city. One initiative was to set knowledge to the forefront with a new Main Library positioned on a prominent Main Street corner where buildings had burned/collapsed as a symbol of rebirth for downtown and Pine Bluff as a whole.

Public meetings revealed the desire to create a‚Äúliving room for the community‚Äù that focuses heavily on children and youth to give hope encouragement and the desire for knowledge to spark the desire to stay reinvest and rebuild their city. Citizens wanted a place that was uplifting inspirational and full of natural light while feeling safe and secure. They wanted a place that pointed to a future that‚Äúlifted expectations. What emerged was a community-embedded supportive learning center offering not only books but also a performance space a teaching kitchen recording studios a caf√© and computer training for adults and youth.

A building program that equally divided books with more dedicated education/specialized spaces generated a diagram of two distinct parallel forms shifted to open views and accept the light and articulated by function and the site‚Äôs odd shape. Public stacks are in storefronts along Main Street with the children‚Äôs library framed above: knowledge is on display. A dynamic cantilevered open auditorium floats completely free above the main entrance lifting to the north as a bold progressive language of hope. Auditorium steps connect the children‚Äôs library up to a Teen Loft that overlooks the entire library and downtown a dynamic space symbolizing the importance of young people to the city. Surprisingly the open steps have drawn the local university‚Äôs students as well choosing to study and hang out at the public library over their own campus.

The library has two primary entrances connecting Main Street‚Äôs intersection through the building to parking on the west. The plan parti creates a pedestrian intersection at the circulation desk as an internal street lit from above. A continuous clerestory allows the roof to cleanly float free flooding both floors with light. The west fa√ßade bends with the odd site‚Äôs odd shape due to a private property interrupting the block connecting to parking through an activity lawn. A bold oval-shaped cylinder housing utilitarian functions become the hinge point for the bending form and a visual marker of the entrance from the surrounding parking and streets. The western fa√ßade is reminiscent of books on a shelf utilizing slender windows of varying widths and vertical fins to mitigate heat gain.

The Pine Bluff Library is a beacon for the value of reinvesting in citizens through education and a symbol of hope for what Pine Bluff can be.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3BoaWxsaXAtZWxsZXktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1NDAxMzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phillip Elley Obituary (2022) - Austin TX - Harrell Funeral Home of Austin,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/phillip-elley-obituary?id=36540137 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL3BoaWxsaXAtZWxsZXktb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1NDAxMzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbGVkb2JsYWRlLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvb3V0ZG9vcnMvMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9vdXRkb29ycy1nYXJkZW4tdG9tYXRvZXMtdmVnZXRhYmxlcy9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjIwOTE4MDQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Outdoors: Garden grows wonderful crops creates a few tomato snobs,,,,

Fashion Square is still doing business as usual continuing with new tenants and leases according to documents filed with the Albemarle County Planning Department. Mall officials have said retailers currently in the mall will continue with their leases.

Court documents obtained by Sean Tubbs of Town Crier Productions and shared with The Daily Progress show that the mall has new tenants slated to come into the shopping center while others may leave.

Among those coming into the mall is the Jefferson Area Board for Aging which plans to open a 2500 square-foot Medicare Insurance Counseling office in the mall‚Äôs south wing next to the Eddie Bauer store.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to be able to offer in-person counseling for this open enrollment season and [we‚Äôre] grateful to the new landlord for working with us‚Äù said Randy Rodgers JABA‚Äôs insurance counseling program manager. ‚ÄúTo be able to provide more people this important service we needed a bigger space. And having this site at Fashion Square Mall along with Zoom and phone appointments we hope to be able to help several thousand people.‚Äù

Mall officials confirmed this week that Home Depot the Georgia-based home improvement big box retailer with more than $150 billion in revenue purchased the mall with the exception of the women‚Äôs Belk store and the former JCPenney storefront. The mens‚Äô Belk storefront which is separate from the women‚Äôs store is included in the purchase.

Home Depot‚Äôs national competitor Lowe‚Äôs has a retail outlet about a mile away from the mall.

Attempts to reach Home Depot for comment on the sale or plans for the mall have been unsuccessful. The purchase price has not been announced.

Home Depot and the local holding company that purchased the mall at a July 2021 foreclosure auction on the county courthouse steps entered into a sale agreement on July 8 of this year with a July 31 effective date according to Tubbs.

Tubbs has been a reporter for local news organizations for 30 years. He now produces the Charlottesville Community Engagement newsletter and podcast.

On Sept. 2 the Charlottesville Circuit Court recorded three documents between Home Depot USA and Charlottesville JP 2014-CP the holding company that previously owned it.

One of the documents is a Deed of Bargain and Sale with no clear sale price and another is a detailed list of parcels affected. Another document releases Home Depot from a ground lease and sublease that governs the property.

That document references the bankruptcy of Sears Roebuck and Company which anchored one end of the mall and was part of the original operating agreement for the shopping center.

Sears declared Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 2018 and closed the Albemarle County store early the next year.

Online records at Albemarle County do not show an updated ownership of the mall. Those records often lag behind however.

County assessor records show the land on which the mall sits is assessed at $8796000 as of Jan. 1. The building and improvements on the site are assessed at $7329900 for a total assessed valuation of $16125900.

The assessed value is what the county uses to determine tax bills.

In a separate transaction Fashion Square Assets LLC a company associated with developer Richard Hewitt purchased the former JCPenney space on Sept. 10 2020.

Earlier this summer Albemarle County agreed to rent a portion of the space for use as a public safety center including vehicle parking and bays for maintenance.

Albemarle County Fire Rescue maintenance crews would be at the site and Albemarle County police will station the department‚Äôs traffic unit there.

The county will pay $3.1 million to refit the site and $558000 for the first year‚Äôs rent.

The sale is the latest in a series of ownership changes for the once-bustling 570000-square-foot indoor shopping center that has struggled for relevance in the wake of online sales and the pandemic.

Built in the early 1980s the mall was once the moving force in retail sales in Central Virginia. Like other indoor malls across the country its popularity faded as people switched to online purchases and many retailers left or went bankrupt between 2015 and 2021.

The mall was purchased by Simon Property Group in 1997. It was assigned to Simon‚Äôs spin-off company Washington Prime Group in 2014. The spin-off company held Simon‚Äôs strip center business and smaller enclosed malls. It merged with Glimcher Realty Trust in January 2015 and became WP Glimcher.

In late 2019 the mortgage loan secured by Fashion Square was transferred to special servicing after the borrower notified the lender that future projected cash flows will be insufficient to ensure future compliance with the mortgage loan.

After a request by Midland Loan Services the special servicer for Fashion Square a judge in March 2020 approved the appointment of a special servicer. In 2021 the mall was sold at auction back to the lender after defaulting on the loan.",,,,,,,,,,,,
SWKS,Skyworks Solutions,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzE4LzUtc3RydWdnbGluZy1zdG9ja3MtdG8tYnV5LWF0LWEtZGlzY291bnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Struggling Stocks to Buy at a Discount,"These perennial outperformers are down but definitely not out.

Looking back at investing articles from 2009 and 2020 the worst years for stocks of the Great Recession and the pandemic the fear in the market was palpable. But there were some brave souls with the foresight to look past the headlines -- those who did have been richly rewarded as has been the case in every market correction. Forget timing the bottom; that's a fool's errand. Incrementally buying during those down times was ridiculously profitable.

What's the lesson? Strategize long-term dollar-cost average and stick with fantastic companies. Alphabet (GOOG 0.60%) (GOOGL 0.71%) The Trade Desk (TTD -1.54%) Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 0.55%) Amazon (AMZN 0.27%) and Disney (DIS -0.45%) are down more than 20% year to date (YTD) and worthy of hefty consideration.

1. Alphabet looks like a bargain

When a company's primary revenue driver is so popular that it becomes a verb that's a pretty impressive sign. You might have even ""Googled"" to find The Motley Fool. With Alphabet's stock down nearly 23% this year it's time for investors to sit up and take notice.

Alphabet has several profit and growth drivers. Its core Google Search service is a must for advertisers giving it incredible pricing power. YouTube capitalizes on streaming growth and Google Cloud is growing against tough competition.

Google's advertising business which includes Google Search YouTube and Google Network has increased sales from $95 billion to $111 billion year over year through the first half of 2022 against a challenging economic backdrop. Total operating income rose to $39.5 billion from $35.8 billion even as management grappled with inflation and cutbacks in many advertising budgets. Increasing sales in the face of headwinds show the power of Alphabet's market stronghold.

Google Cloud competes with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud market. Sales have grown nearly 40% this year but the segment isn't profitable yet. Google Cloud is a fantastic opportunity for Alphabet to diversify its profit drivers if management can successfully scale to profitability.

Alphabet is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 21 or more than 12% lower than it traded at the start of 2019 making the stock compelling.

2. The Trade Desk capitalizes on a massive shift

While Alphabet has the market cornered in search advertising The Trade Desk is making things happen in streaming. The Trade Desk offers advertisers a comprehensive platform enabling targeted advertising across several mediums including the coveted connected television (CTV) market.

CTV refers to any content accessed through the internet such as watching Netflix or Disney+ on a smart TV or using Roku or similar devices. It's easy to see why this market is the new must-have for advertisers.

The Trade Desk stock is down more than 25% this year after getting caught up in the growth stock euphoria in 2021. But its results are terrific. Revenue reached $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021 marking a 43% increase over the $836 million prior year.

The Trade Desk separates itself from other growth stocks by producing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits to the tune of $138 million in fiscal 2021 along with $379 million in cash from operations -- an impressive 32% margin.

The Trade Desk has momentum opportunity and execution and the stock is now trading near its pre-pandemic price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This could be the time to accumulate shares for the long term.

3. Only one segment matters for Amazon's future

Amazon stock is down 25% this year as investors fret over rising costs logistical headaches and labor shortages which have crushed profits in retail. But Amazon's future is not in online retail sales. Its future is AWS the world's leading cloud services provider and business here is booming. AWS accounts for all of the company's operating income and a significant portion of sales growth this year.

AWS sales reached a record $62.2 billion in 2021 and $72.1 billion over the past 12 months. What's better? AWS has an operating margin of over 30%. Amazon also has a burgeoning digital advertising revenue stream that made $31.2 billion in 2021 and grew 18% last quarter. While some agonize over short-term losses in retail long-term investors can buy the stock at a discount knowing that AWS (with an advertising cherry on top) will power profits for years to come.

4. Skyworks enables our increasingly connected world

Have you been to a big-box store recently and seen these new smart refrigerators? Or maybe you're on the cutting edge and already own one. This is a whimsical example of what's known as the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT includes devices from cars to hearing aids. The future of our world is connected and the semiconductors (chips) made by Skyworks are at the forefront.

Skyworks' chips are also used in conventional applications like smartphones tablets automobiles and gaming platforms. The sluggish demand and expected economic slowdown have caused shares to drop more than 35% year to date. Despite the headwinds the company increased the dividend by 11% last quarter. The forward yield is now close to 2.5% -- historically high for Skyworks. Revenue for third-quarter fiscal 2022 reached $1.2 billion on double-digit growth and management guided for continued growth above 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Chip stocks have been hit hard but incrementally purchasing Skyworks now could pay handsomely in the future. In the meantime investors can enjoy the yield.

5. Don't doubt the mouse

Disney has had a tough few years with the pandemic closing or limiting attendance followed by inflation and fears of a recession. But the company has something up its sleeve: Pricing power. Recent articles show pricing at Disney parks rising much faster than inflation over many years. How can Disney do this? Because it has a unique product that people love and other companies can't replicate.

The stock is down about 28% this year because Wall Street is anticipating that the economy will take its toll on earnings. And they are probably right. But we don't beat the market investing for right now; we outpace the market by anticipating where a company will be in the future.

Disney has several profit drivers for the future. First the parks are a unique experience that has been a rite of passage for generations. Revenue in this segment is up 92% so far this fiscal year reaching $21.3 billion through three quarters. Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services are adding subscribers at a tremendous pace -- 14.4 million were added last quarter alone. In addition the company believes it can capitalize on the sports betting craze with ESPN.

Some investors run for the exits when the market goes on sale. Others use a disciplined strategy to purchase great companies at a discount. If you are in the latter category consider the terrific companies above.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But when a play breaks down there‚Äôs arguably nobody in the NFL who can make something happen out of nothing like he can.

We saw that play out in astonishing fashion on Sunday.

During the Cardinals‚Äô Week 2 game against the Raiders Murray looked to have Arizona rallying back from a 20-point deficit and make it an eight-point game in the fourth quarter. He did so with one of the more ridiculous (successful) two-point conversions we‚Äôll ever see.

When protection broke down for Murray the Cardinals quarterback basically ran circles around the Raiders defense for 20.8 seconds (!!!) on his way to the end zone.

An average football play lasts just a few seconds especially a two-point attempt. But Murray extended the play far beyond the typical realm of possibility.

A top company official for HDF Energy announced the plan for the southern African country recently. The hydrogen power plant in Namibia would be Africa‚Äôs first.

The Swakopmund project is expected to cost about $181 million. Once operational the company said it will supply electrical power 24 hours a day throughout the year. It will increase the electricity supply to Namibia which imports 40 percent of its power from neighboring South Africa.

Namibia is one of the world‚Äôs sunniest and least densely populated countries. It wants to be able to use its great potential for solar and wind energy to produce ‚Äúgreen‚Äù hydrogen power. And Namibia wants to become a renewable energy center in Africa.

Hydrogen power is considered ‚Äúgreen‚Äù when it is made with renewable power. And it is seen as an important way to reduce carbon-based fuels in the energy industry. However the technology remains untried and costlier than other forms of power.

The project will use solar panels able to produce 85 megawatts (MW) of electricity. They will power electrolyzers that produce hydrogen which can be stored. Electrolyzers produce hydrogen by using electricity to separate hydrogen from oxygen in water.

Nicolas Lecomte is HDF Energy director for southern Africa. He said ""Yearly we can produce 142 gigawatt hours enough for 142000 inhabitants and that is conservative.""

HDF Energy is also considering new projects across Africa and in other parts of the world.

Lecomte told Reuters ""Soon after southern Africa you will see HDF developing projects in east Africa.‚Äù

Another company is in talks with Namibia‚Äôs government to secure an agreement for a planned hydrogen project. Hyphen Hydrogen Energy is registered in Namibia. It is proposing a $10 billion project to produce 350000 tons of green hydrogen a year before 2030. It will be for markets near Namibia and around the world.

European Union investment

European Union and Namibian officials said the EU also plans a deal with the country to support its green hydrogen industry. European nations are trying to reduce their dependence on Russian energy.

The German government has already agreed to invest $41.8 million in Namibia‚Äôs green hydrogen plan. And Belgian and Dutch companies are also operating in the country in that field.

Obeth Kandjoze is director-general of Namibia‚Äôs National Planning Commission. He said direct EU financial support was likely to be limited but a financial deal could bring in other investors.

The Academy Award-winning 1994 film ""Forrest Gump"" starring Tom Hanks wouldn't have been complete without the titular character's loyal and kind-hearted best friend Bubba. As soon as Bubba makes his first appearance onscreen we learn that he has an obsession with all things shrimp. He's a proud shrimp boat worker who describes to Forrest (in great detail) the method of catching shrimp and all the ways you can cook them once you do. Anyone who has seen the film will always remember the passion Bubba had for those tiny ocean crustaceans.

As Bubba so confidently states ""Shrimp is the fruit of the sea."" Well Bubba's love of shrimp didn't only live solely on the silver screen. In 1996 the very first Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant opened in Monterey California to pay homage to shrimp-loving Bubba and his shrimp obsession. The Bubba Gump chain has since grown massively in popularity and anyone who dines there can count on one thing: The place sure slings a whole lotta shrimp.

But they also serve up a bunch of seafood dishes for those craving something different. However as you can imagine not every ocean dish offered is worth swimming towards. So grab your snorkel and toss on your life preserver because some of the dishes that Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. are excellent while others simply don't make the cut.",,,

The lower air fares may be having their intended effect at least according to travelers at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport.

Many said they considered flying to a neighbor island because of the cheap price.

The latest fare war was triggered by Southwest which entered the Hawaii market in 2019 ‚Äî It‚Äôs advertising one-way fares as low as $39.

With Hawaiian matching the price travelers have been quick to take the opportunity. Frequent Canadian visitor Christine Campbell and her family of five decided to fly to Kona for a week because of the low fares.

‚ÄúI had been watching the inter-island fares and I knew kinda what we would spend‚Äù said Campbell. ‚ÄúAnd then I saw the news about Southwest and then I saw the $39 sale so I jumped on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow that‚Äôs a good deal!‚Äù said Kauai resident Dwight Yama who flew with his wife to Honolulu to visit their grandchildren.

‚ÄúYou know we should have that all the time so that‚Äôs good that they‚Äôre fighting with each other‚Äù he added.

While recent media reports say Southwest is bleeding money in the inter-island market the Dallas-based carrier has announced plans to add even more flights between the islands.

It also reported record revenue for the second quarter of the year.

‚ÄúIt really is a game of ‚Äòchicken‚Äô and both airlines ‚Äî Hawaiian and Southwest ‚Äî are using the rest of their systems to subsidize this fare war that‚Äôs going on because nobody makes money at these $39 fares‚Äù said aviation expert and historian Peter Forman.

Forman said it‚Äôs hard to speculate how long Southwest will stay in the the inter-island market but right now he believes that it‚Äôs going to try to force a competitive advantage against Hawaiian.

The situation brings back memories of Go! Airlines which started a fare war that resulted in the 2008 shutdown of Aloha Airlines after 62 years of service.

‚ÄúGo! was on a mission to get rid of Aloha so that was not nice‚Äù recalled Yama.

‚ÄúPeople watch what happened with the Go! situation and that gives Hawaiian an advantage because a lot of people don‚Äôt like a big mainland ‚Äî or even a small mainland company coming in and bumping out one of their local companies‚Äù said Forman.

But for now Southwest and Hawaiian will duke it out.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nice little bonus for us right now‚Äù said Judy Yama. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not going to last so we‚Äôll just take advantage as we can.‚Äù

Two Southwest employees cared for a passenger's pet fish for nearly 4 months when it couldn't fly.

Customer service agent Ismael and fiancee Jamee looked after Kira's fish Theo over the summer.

Kira was reunited with Theo this week after returning to college in Tampa Southwest said.

Two Southwest Airlines employees looked after a passenger's fish for four months when it was not allowed on her flight the airline said.

In a Twitter thread on Thursday the airline said a passenger called Kira was unable to bring her pet fish Theo on a flight in May after finishing her freshman year at college.

To ensure Kira did not miss her flight but could also save her pet a customer service agent named Ismael offered to look after the fish for her. Text message exchanges show Ismael saying he bought a bigger bowl for Theo over the summer.

Ismael cared for the Beta fish with his fiance Jamee who is also a Southwest employee for nearly four months before meeting up with Kira in Tampa as she was about to start her sophomore year of college.

Text messages appear to show Kira shared a gift card with the couple to thank them for their efforts.

Kira was reunited with Theo this month before starting her sophomore year of college per Southwest. Southwest Airlines.

Insider contacted Southwest for more information.

The story is a rare bright moment in what has been a summer of flight chaos with many passengers suffering cancellations diversions crew time-outs as well as lost luggage pets and even children.

While Kira was blocked from travelling with her fish prior to the flight other passengers have unfortunately lost track of pets that were permitted to take to the skies.

In July Air Canada sent passenger Abbas Zoeb's cats from Toronto to San Francisco without him when he encountered visa issues. The airline initially suggested he travel to San Francisco to collect them before sending them back 15 hours later.

The actions of Ismael and Jamee highlight the steps some staff have taken amid the unprecedented chaos. In August another Southwest customer service agent told Insider recent struggles had been challenging with police having to step in to control an angry passenger on one occasion.

Staff Writer

Eight months after voting to become the first unionized Starbucks in Florida the N. Monroe & John Knox store participated in an all-day unfair labor practice strike on Sept. 5 2022. The strike was backed by local activist organizations such as FSU Students for a Democratic Society and the Tallahassee Community Action Committee.

According to the strike letter written by workers at Starbucks and addressed to the store manager and district manager employees went on strike for the following reason: ‚ÄúWe strike in solidarity with the NLRB‚Äôs complaint against Starbucks where they deemed corporate‚Äôs withholding of benefits of unionized stores illegal.‚Äù The letter also notes that Starbucks has raised the minimum wage to $15/hr in non-unionized stores three weeks in advance of unionized stores while denying the $15/hr minimum wage to stores known to be in the organizing stages of unionization.

The reason given for the strike is an Aug. 25 2022 complaint filed against Starbucks by the National Labor Relations Board that accuses Starbucks of illegally withholding increased wages and benefits for stores that vote to unionize. The National Labor Relations Board is seeking back pay for denied raises and benefits in addition to interim CEO Howard Schultz reading a notice to all employees informing them that some have been illegally denied raises and benefit increases. The case is scheduled for an Oct. 25 2022 hearing before an administrative law judge.

This comes after a string of complaints leveled against Starbucks by the National Labor Relations Board since a store in Buffalo NY became the first unionized Starbucks in the United States last January. Less than a week before Starbucks was accused of withholding increased pay and benefits from unionized stores a federal judge in Tennessee ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven baristas fired following a union organizing drive at a Starbucks location in Memphis. According to Starbucks Workers United the labor union representing unionized Starbucks workers more than 75 union leaders have been dismissed by the company since December.

Caesar Scalia one of the baristas on strike said that ‚ÄúWe all agree the strike was a solid success we had a ton of support from local organizations who showed out for several hours and a large majority of our customers were supportive and sympathetic as well.‚Äù

In regards to the ongoing situation between Starbucks and the current trend of unionization Caesar feels it is ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù and that ‚Äúfor a company that constantly prides itself on taking care of its employees it continues to drop the ball the larger our movement grows"".

When asked what he felt being in a union brings to workers Caesar said ‚ÄúI love our union. It‚Äôs connected us in ways I thought impossible in a workplace. The solidarity is overwhelming ‚Äì We proved to ourselves that we got each other‚Äôs backs and that we do have a voice that can better our environment here; that was the whole premise of us unionizing ‚Äì having a voice.‚Äù

When asked to comment on the strike Starbucks spokesperson Abigail Barker responded that ‚ÄúStarbucks respects our partners. Partners have a right to lawfully participate in protests or events that are personally important to them. Partners do not represent Starbucks while engaging in protest activity. We remain committed to our partners and will continue to work together side-by-side to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone.‚Äù

The N. Monroe & John Knox store was not the only unionized Starbucks that took action on Labor Day. According to an Instagram post from Starbucks Workers United more than 50 other unionized locations participated in pro-labor demonstrations on Sep. 5 2022. Actions from other stores included strikes reduced hours closed cafes and protests. One store in Oklahoma City rallied at the Oklahoma State Capitol joined by local politicians union leaders and the public.

Elsewhere in Tallahassee workers at local business Serenity Coffee and Kava Bar went on strike for Labor Day. According to a statement from Serenity Bartenders United the reasons for their strike included ‚Äúover two years of mistreatment mismanagement and most importantly abuse that we as employees have received by the hands of our previous manager and owner.‚Äù

The Instagram page for Starbucks Workers United Tallahassee asked members of the community to ‚Äúsupport a local TLH coffee shop that‚Äôs on strike! Workers united will never be divided‚Äù. Later in the week Serenity announced its permanent closure citing ‚Äúrising costs rising rent and heavy inflation.‚Äù

A GoFundMe page organized by former Serenity manager Hannah Bancroft disputes Serenity‚Äôs reasoning for closure writing that ‚Äúwe used our chance to be the voice for many other small business employees met with the same fate of mismanagement mistreatment and abuse. Yet we were met with the unfortunate fate of the workers losing their lifeline permanently.‚Äù

According to data collected from the NLRB as of Sept. 5 2022 more than 200 Starbucks stores across the country have voted to unionize covering over 5500 workers. On April 1 2023 former PepsiCo chief commercial officer Laxman Narasimhan will replace interim CEO Howard Schultz as Starbucks's new chief executive officer. Narasimhan‚Äôs position on unionizing Starbucks stores remains unclear at this time.

Looking to the future Caesar hopes ‚Äúsomething good will come out of the complaint the NLRB will be taking corporate to court for but as of right now all we can do is keep pushing and hope they‚Äôll meet us and bargain in good faith.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL3NlcC8xOC9zdGFyYnVja3MtbWFrZW92ZXItd2lsbC1zaW1wbGlmeS1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks makeover will simplify service,"Starbucks -- ringing up record sales but struggling with low employee morale -- plans to spend $450 million next year to make its North American stores more efficient and less complex.

The company also said it plans to open 2000 net new stores in the U.S. by 2025 with an emphasis on meeting the growing demand for new types of service including drive-thru mobile ordering and delivery. Drive-thru now makes up 50% of U.S. sales for example while delivery demand has grown by 24% so far this year.

Customizable cold drinks -- which now make up as many as 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage orders -- are also taxing employees in kitchens designed for simpler hot drinks. Starbucks debuted a new work station that requires less movement and can cut 50 seconds off the process of making a blended iced mocha. And a new patented technology will cut the time needed to make cold brew coffee from 20 hours to a few seconds.

""It's clear that our physical stores have to change. Our physical stores were built for a different era"" said John Culver Starbucks' chief operating officer at a day-long event for investors in Seattle last week.

Starbucks executives made little mention of a growing unionization effort at its U.S. stores during morning presentations. But it has clearly been an impetus for the company to think more deeply about ways to improve employees' work life. Since late last year 236 of Starbucks' 9000 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize an effort the company opposes.

""The reality is we have a trust deficit with our partners"" said Frank Britt Starbucks' executive vice president and chief strategy officer. ""The work we do in our stores today is too physically hard.""

It wasn't immediately clear if the new investments and technology would be offered to non-union stores; Starbucks said the company hasn't yet decided how the investment will be doled out. But in May Starbucks announced $200 million in additional pay and training but said that benefit would only go to non-union stores. Starbucks says it is required to negotiate new benefits with union stores.

Starbucks Workers United the union organizing workers said around 300 protesters picketed outside the Starbucks meeting last week.

Leading the revamp will be Laxman Narasimhan a former PepsiCo executive who was named Starbucks' CEO earlier this month. Narasimhan will spend the next six months shadowing interim CEO Howard Schultz who helped shape the company after buying it in 1987 and has been leading it on a temporary basis since April. Schultz will remain on Starbucks' board when Narasimhan assumes the CEO position in April.

""It's an incredible opportunity for me to be learning at the feet of one of the best entrepreneurs in the world"" Narasimhan said

Schultz said Starbucks notched the best sales week in its 51-year history in August when it introduced its fall drink lineup. But Schultz said Starbucks lost its way during the pandemic when employee retention tumbled even as customers demanded new service like curbside pickup.

The emphasis will be on meeting the growing demand for drive-thru and delivery. Starbucks recently saw the best week in its 51-year history when it introduced its latest fall drinks. But it says stores need better equipment to make drinks more quickly. Among the things driving the revamp is an ongoing unionization effort which Starbucks opposes. More than 230 U.S. stores have voted to unionize since late last year. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa file)

The Canal Street Starbucks location has been in operation for nine years. It will officially close on Oct. 3.

Starbucks officials announced in July that 16 stores across the country were closing due to safety concerns.

‚Äã‚ÄãWorkers are ""seeing firsthand the challenges facing our communities ‚Äî personal safety racism lack of access to healthcare a growing mental health crisis rising drug use and more"" senior vice presidents of U.S. operations for Starbucks said back in July.

Interim Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz warned that the initial closures were ""just the beginning"" and more permanent closures were anticipated.

""We are beginning to close stores"" because of safety issues Schultz said in a video posted social media in July. ""This is just the beginning. There are going to be many more.""

STARBUCKS ACCUSED BY UNION OF RETALIATION OVER CLOSURE OF TWO LOCATIONS

New Orleans became the murder capital of the country this month at ‚Äã‚Äã52 homicides per 100000 residents as of Sept. 11 according to data from the Metropolitan Crime Commission. New Orleans has eclipsed the number of homicides in other notoriously dangerous cities such as St. Louis and Chicago.

All in homicides in New Orleans are up 141% when compared to 2019 and up 78% when compared to 2021 according to the data.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Fox News Digital when approached for comment that the company takes ""pride in creating a safe warm and welcoming"" environments noting it's ""core"" to their mission.

""Throughout the process we listen to our partners to ensure we‚Äôre making the best decision for them the community and our company"" the Starbucks spokesperson said. ""These challenges affect all retailers which is why we have protocols and resources in place to ensure our partners are out of harm‚Äôs way.""

""Our local leaders are and have always been empowered to use these resources to modify store operations and create the best experience for our communities.""

Whether you've been to Starbucks dozens of times (perhaps in the last month) or only once it's certainly tough to keep up with the Starbucks menu as it continues to grow and change. Not only does it rotate beverages seasonally but there are often new products.

That's where bottled juices come in. In addition to an impressive and beloved menu there are also several bottled beverages Starbucks offers. The best part of these drinks is that you only need to wait in the checkout line; no need to wait to pick up your order. So if you're in a hurry these are an excellent option for those quick exit mornings.

Starbucks offers four types of bottled juices: energy drinks cold-pressed juices cold-pressed smoothies and juice boxes. Starbucks' own energy drinks are called Baya Energy and these are juices blended with the coffee fruit to give you a boost of energy. The cold-pressed juices and smoothies come from Evolution Fresh. At Evolution Fresh juices and smoothies are cold-pressed rather than heat pasteurized to help preserve flavor and nutrients. Starbucks also offers boxed apple juice from Tree Top a company that hails from Washington smack dab in the middle of apple country so you just know its apple juice is going to be great."

In early 2018 Goldman Sachs gave one of its decades-old mutual funds a makeover.

It had been invested in the stocks of large European and Japanese companies across many industries but suddenly it became the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG Fund. Its new investing mandate: choose foreign companies with the best reputations on environmental social and governance policies.

E.S.G.-fund makeovers have become the trend du jour on Wall Street: BlackRock J.P. Morgan Morgan Stanley HSBC WisdomTree Putnam and MassMutual have all done it. Over the past five years about 90 mutual funds and E.T.F.s have undertaken similar revamps according to the mutual fund rating firm Morningstar.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic the St. Vrain Valley School District increased its percentage points earned in its performance framework.

Colorado uses performance frameworks as part of the state‚Äôs accountability system to evaluate schools and district systems based on student performance graduation rates and performance of historically underserved students. Frameworks which are used to accredit school districts and assign school plans restarted this year after a two year break due to the pandemic.

St. Vrain was rated accredited this year as the school was in 2019 but increased its overall earned percentage from 61.1% to 61.5%. Executive Director of Assessment Ann Reed credited the improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic to the district‚Äôs preparation and investment in students.

‚ÄúWe would like to extend the congratulations to our staff who worked really hard during the school year and during this time partnering with families to offer an extended school day strong rigorous grade level instruction during the school year and our summer programming in June as well as our JumpStart program at the middle and high school level prior to school starting‚Äù she said.

Seeing the district improve wasn‚Äôt a surprise according to Reed and in fact staff worked intentionally to ensure that students would continue to progress.

‚ÄúWe have a lot of local systems in place to monitor student academic progress‚Äù Reed said. ‚ÄúUsing that I think we were encouraged that our students were growing throughout this time.‚Äù

Approximately 89% of St. Vrain schools were in the top two ratings. Rocky Mountain Elementary School and Timberline PK-8 made especially significant gains Reed noted.

Longs Peak Middle School was one school that saw their rating decrease but Reed said the district is already working hard to address that.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre partnering with and working with staff students and families to support their strong academics‚Äù she said.

Additionally district officials emphasize that while state measures of success through standardized testing are an important metric St. Vrain takes several other factors into account when looking at the overall picture.

‚ÄúWe look at many different measures of student achievement and this is just one part of that story‚Äù district spokesperson Kerri McDermid said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many additional inputs and things to support student success beyond just the assessment data and the performance framework.‚Äù

More than anything the framework results show that St. Vrain is getting a return on their investment into student success.

Published September 18 2022

A kingdom united in grief will mourn the loss of their revered Queen on Monday. Pomp and pageantry will be on display as tens of thousands line the streets of the British capital and hundreds of millions tune in for the state funeral of Elizabeth II.

Monday‚Äôs ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements codenamed ‚ÄúOperation London Bridge‚Äù honoring Elizabeth‚Äôs remarkable life -- from a young princess who was not born to be Queen to a sovereign who redefined the role and won almost universal admiration.

Following the Queen‚Äôs death at Balmoral on September 8 her coffin was flown back from Scotland and moved to London‚Äôs Westminster Hall in a somber procession. She will lie in state there until the morning of her funeral.

Crowds of mourners will flood the capital in the hopes of witnessing the coffin -- draped in the Royal Standard and carrying the Instruments of State -- one last time before the Queen makes the journey to her final resting place within St. George‚Äôs Chapel in Windsor. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about Britain‚Äôs farewell to one its greatest ever monarchs.

Monday September 19The day of the funeral and the final journey to Windsor Westminster HallAt around 10:35 a.m. (5:35 a.m. ET) the coffin will be lifted from the catafalque. A bearer party founded by the Queen's Company 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards will carry it from Westminster Hall to the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy.



The gun carriage will set off at 10:44 a.m. (5:44 a.m. ET) on the short journey from New Palace Yard to Westminster Abbey where the funeral service will take place. The route will be lined by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. King Charles III and members of the royal family will walk behind the coffin. Westminster AbbeyThe service will be conducted by the Dean of Westminster starting at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET). The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will deliver a sermon. Towards the end of the service at around 11:55 a.m. the Last Post will sound before a two-minute silence is observed.



World leaders politicians public figures and European royals as well as more than 500 dignitaries from around the world will be at the service which will be attended by up to 2000 people.

WindsorThe Queen‚Äôs coffin will be driven to Windsor around 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the capital. Windsor Castle is where the Queen lived for the last two years of her life. The Long WalkOnce in Windsor the state hearse will be driven just after 3 p.m. (10 a.m. ET) along The Long Walk a picturesque avenue leading to the castle where thousands will be waiting to bid the Queen farewell as she passes. Windsor CastleThe King and other royals will join the procession on foot as it passes through the castle‚Äôs quadrangle at around 3:40 p.m. (10:40 a.m. ET).



Minute guns will be fired by the King‚Äôs Troop Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn throughout the royal cortege.

Soldiers from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment will line the steps as the bearer party carries the coffin inside for the committal service.

A more intimate committal service will take place at St. George‚Äôs Chapel at about 4 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) conducted by the Dean of Windsor. The royal family will gather there along with a congregation made up of members of the Royal Household past and present as well as personal staff who have worked on the private estates.

St. George‚Äôs should be a familiar location to many as it is where Prince Philip's funeral service was held last April as well as more jubilant occasions like the nuptials of the Queen's grandchildren.

At the service's conclusion the Queen's coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault set below the chapel where many royal family members have been laid to rest.

The service concludes the public arrangements for the late monarch however a private burial service will be held for the family later Monday evening. The Queen is to be buried with her late husband of 73 years Prince Philip in the King George VI Memorial Chapel located elsewhere within St. George's.

The memorial chapel is where the Queen's father and mother were interred. A casket containing the ashes of the Queen's sister Princess Margaret is also there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vam91cm5hbHN0YXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcmV0YWlsLW1hcmtldC1zbG93bHktcmVib3VuZGluZy1pbi1saW5jb2xuL2FydGljbGVfYTMxOTQwY2QtOWI0ZC01NDBlLWE0MDYtNjNjZjM3MDIyMmNjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail market slowly rebounding in Lincoln,"There are some encouraging signs for the retail sector in Lincoln.

According to the most recent report from NAI FMA Realty the city's retail vacancy rate was 6.6% at the end of June the same as it was at the end of December but down from 7.1% a year ago.

""The first half of 2022 was a solid one for the retail sector"" NAI FMA said in the report noting that retail occupancy levels remain healthy and rents are increasing.

""More retailers are opening stores than closing them despite facing challenges of ongoing supply chain issues and recruiting and retaining staff"" the report said.

While many of the stores that have opened are smaller stores such as dollar stores or vape shops there are some large regional and national tenants planting a flag in Lincoln.

Hy-Vee in April opened its Wall to Wall Wine and Spirits store in the former Bed Bath & Beyond location at 5040 N. 27th St.

Burlington Stores and Sierra Trading Post have both filed building permits for stores at the former Sears store at Gateway Mall though neither has publicly confirmed plans.

In its report NAI FMA said a store called International Fresh Market is planning to take over the former Fresh Thyme Market space at 5220 O St. although the company does not list Lincoln as one of the locations listed on its website as ""coming soon.""

Dillards also is planning to expand into the former Younkers space at Gateway Mall and there has been some construction activity at the new NorthStar Crossing mall in north Lincoln though developers have yet to announce any tenants.

""The future of retail looks better than it did two years ago"" Sally DeLair a commercial advisor with NAI FMA said in the report.

One area of commercial real estate that does not look better than it did two years ago however is the office market.

According to the report the office vacancy rate rose to 10.3% in the first quarter which is the highest it's been since the end of 2015.

The market experienced negative net absorption -- meaning the amount of new vacant space was larger than the amount of previously vacant space leased -- during the first half of the year after also experiencing the same conditions in the last half of last year.

The report noted that the lingering effects of the pandemic have caused many larger employers to reevaluate their space needs.

Nowhere is that more apparent than the downtown area where the vacancy rate is 20.7% more than double the overall rate. That's occurring even with building's such as the Terminal Building former LES building and Gold's building being converted into mostly residential and hotel space.

""Data in this most recent report confirms the widely held belief that office demand will shift away from (downtown) and move towards the suburbs"" NAI FMA's Tom Graf said in the report. ""Downtown landlords will have more incentive than ever to work with community partners in keeping not just their buildings but their submarket relevant.""

While the office market continues to struggle and the retail market is seeing small improvements the market for industrial space continues to boom.

The industrial vacancy rate hit 1.3% in the first half of the year the lowest ever recorded in Lincoln. The rate is less than half of what it was just one year ago.

The market has had positive net absorption of nearly 1 million square feet of space over the past year and though there are large industrial projects in the construction or planning stages all over the city it may not be enough to keep up with demand.

Jared Froehlich of NAI FMA said in the report that while the industrial real estate sector has seen a lot of growth over the past five years ""the lack of supply and the shifts in the economy could make sustaining this momentum a bit more challenging in the near future.""

Metinvest Kryvyi Rih Machining and Repair Plant (KMRP) carried out major repairs of a 20-ton electric bridge crane at the heat treatment section of the steel casting workshop. Metinvest Kryvyi Rih reports about it on its Facebook page.

Specialists updated the crane control system and replaced cable materials. A comfortable chair was installed in the cabin a heating and air conditioning system was also installed and a loudspeaker was installed for convenient communication with colleagues.

‚ÄúThanks to modern technology the driver has everything to perform work tasks productively and comfortably‚Äù the company notes.

Previously an electric overhead crane with a load capacity of 16 tons was installed in the mechanical assembly shop of KMRP after major repairs.

As GMK Center reported earlier in August Metinvest-KMRP launched the MA4134A pneumatic hammer in the steel construction shop the operation of which was suspended 10 years ago. Thanks to the restoration of the hammer Metinvest-KMRP will be able to expand the range and quantity of manufactured products.

Earlier KMRP produced wooden models for casting unloading and loading trunnions. Casting of parts will be done by Kametstal specialists and after casting the parts will be handed over to the enrichment factories of Ingulets Mining.

KMRP produces and repairs equipment for mining and metals enterprises of the Metinvest group. The enterprise has a metallurgical complex with a closed cycle. The plant produces parts from more than 40 grades of steel and alloys assembles and welds products from steel sheet metal and long products.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The rear I/O plate has holes. This is because there is a shroud the is designed as a fan intake. For a 200-300W CPU this shroud would probably be challenged but it worked in this chassis even with the Intel Xeon D-2755TE 16-core processor. One item we will note on this is that the shroud is very flexible. As a result it is a bit harder to get into place than many of the more rigid designs we see.

Once removed we can see the CPU heatsink for the Xeon D-2775TE.

We previously did a review of the Supermicro X12SDV-16C-SPT8F that powers this system. Check that one out for more on that platform.

Here is the airflow view with the PCIe riser and the CPU shroud removed and both memory and storage installed.

The memory is DDR4 and this platform takes ECC LRDIMMs and RDIMMs. All four channels are provided via 1 DIMM per channel slot configuration.

We installed a Sabrent Rocket Q NVMe SSDs as well as a few other options in this server in the M.2 slot. That worked well for primary storage. It would have been nice to have dual M.2 for redundant storage.

Not used but available in this system are the two MiniSAS connectors providing eight PCIe lanes or alternatively more SATA. We did not use these in our configuration. You can learn more about them in the motherboard review.

The PCIe riser comes on a small cage that helps provide rigidity to the riser solution when deployed. We wish that instead of requiring screws that this eventually becomes a tool-less riser slot.

Here is a look at the riser without the cage. If we were putting a high-power PCIe card here to take advantage of the 800W PSUs we would add two additional fan modules to the rear of the chassis.

Here is a quick look at the system again assembled one will see additional storage.

On the side of the system in front of the PSUs we get 2.5‚Ä≥ storage. One can see the hard drive here.

Next we are going to show the topology management and performance. If you read the motherboard review you can probably skip these as we tested the motherboard in this configuration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0b3JhZ2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VwZXJtaWNyby1ncHUtc3VwZXJzZXJ2ZXItc3lzLTgyMGdwLXRuYW8tbGF1bmNoZWQtd2l0aC1udmlkaWEtaGd4LTgtZ3B1LXN1cHBvcnTSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdG9yYWdlcmV2aWV3LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N1cGVybWljcm8tZ3B1LXN1cGVyc2VydmVyLXN5cy04MjBncC10bmFvLWxhdW5jaGVkLXdpdGgtbnZpZGlhLWhneC04LWdwdS1zdXBwb3J0P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO Launched with NVIDIA HGX 8-GPU Support,"Supermicro has added to their robust line of Universal GPU systems with an 8U box capable of housing eight socketed (SXM) NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs that support NVLink and NVSwitch.

Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO Highlights

The highlight of this box is clearly the support for NVIDIA‚Äôs HGX A100 8-GPU SXM4 Multi-GPU Board. That board and associated fans and heatsinks for cooling make up the lower half of the 8U chassis seen above. This box supports CPU-GPU PCIe 4.0 x16 interconnect and GPU-GPU interconnect via NVIDIA NVLink with NVSwitch.

Cooling is a big deal with GPU systems like this; if thermals get out of control the system will throttle performance. Supermicro has put significant effort into its dual cooling zones to ensure the GPUs remain operating at peak performance. There are fans at the front and back of the system in addition to a bank inside the server and a few more in the back. While the primary go-to-market chassis is air-cooled Supermicro does offer liquid cooling support in this chassis.

The top half of the Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO is the computer and storage portion of the server.

At launch this uses a Supermicro Super X12DGO-6 motherboard with support for two Intel Xeon Scalable CPUs with TDP up to 270W. The board also offers 32 DDR4 DIMM slots which translates to a max DRAM footprint of 8TB (LRDIMMs).

The motherboard also offers 10 PCIe slots all PCIe4 x16 LP including AIOM/OCP 3.0 support. These slots are split into two banks on the back of the system and are ready for NICs or a wide variety of accelerator cards. In terms of storage the system supports six drives in the front (tri-mode) and an optional set of four NVMe bays on the back. Some of the SSD bays also support NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage. There is M.2 onboard for boot duty.

A single 6000W OCP-compliant power supply provides power. In addition the system supports both AC and DC Power including support for standard OCP DC rack configurations.

Our Perspective

Supermicro is listening to customers in HPC and AI fields who are clamoring for more powerful GPU systems. To date Supermciro has also been flexible in their Universal GPU line making it easy to swap out Intel for AMD CPUs for instance or NVIDIA SXM GPUs for something else. That means from a few base components Supermicro can get pretty creative to solve high-end GPU needs.

The only thing that‚Äôs strange with the Supermicro GPU SuperServer SYS-820GP-TNAO is that it‚Äôs 8U. That‚Äôs a very beefy box and something that might be a challenge for those who are rack U-sensitive. Supermicro can configure similar 8-GPU servers in 4U and 5U. There are reasons to go with the 8U chassis though; it‚Äôs a little more efficient it should have better thermals and there are many more expansion options.

Supermicro is leaning very hard into the GPU server space; in traditional Supermicro form they have something for everyone.

Despite that Patrick recently went to buy some SSDs for some TinyMiniMicro nodes and did not have a clear decision in mind as to which drives he should purchase. Thus was born the idea of a recommendation article or buyer‚Äôs guide which is not something we normally do here on STH. As an opinionated person who has laid hands on more SSDs than almost anyone I know I wanted to take a moment to look at the state of consumer M.2 NVMe SSDs (and SATA as a bonus in this edition) as I see it and make some recommendations. These recommendations are my opinion and mine alone. There are no sponsorships or even input from Patrick or anyone else that goes into this list.

The Categories

There will never be a single answer for what constitutes the ‚Äòbest‚Äô SSD so we came up with three general categories; PCIe 3.0 SSDs PCIe 4.0 SSDs and SATA. For the PCIe SSDs we further broke things down into three sub-categories; cheap midrange and high-end. Initially SATA offerings were not even considered for this guide. I decided to include them because SATA SSDs still represent an easy way to add bulk storage to almost any system and from a server perspective are almost always better than 10k or 15k RPM drives. Because performance at the SATA level has long since saturated the SATA interface I opted only to provide ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and ‚Äúpremium‚Äù categories for SATA drive recommendations.

One additional note; despite my time reviewing SSDs for STH and using them in my day job there are still hundreds of models that I have never touched. As a result the only drives considered for inclusion in this article are ones that I have had personal experience with.

PCIe Gen 3 NVMe SSD Recommendations

Despite being superseded by Gen 4 drives there is still a wide range of performance differentiation within Gen 3 drives and Gen 3 NVMe SSDs can still outperform SATA by nearly 6X the transfer rate of SATA SSDs.

For a cheap PCIe Gen 3 drive I am nominating the Intel 670p. This is a QLC drive with modest endurance but the price is low performance is good and the warranty is spot on at 5 years. Until recently I would have touted the Intel name in conjunction with that warranty though recently Intel‚Äôs SSD business was sold and spun off into Soladigm a subsidiary of SK Hynix.

The midrange PCIe Gen 3 recommendation goes to the Samsung 980. For your extra dollars over the 670p you get TLC NAND slightly better performance and close to double the rated endurance.

My high-end PCIe Gen 3 recommendation is the SK hynix Gold P31. This drive has everything you can want in a PCIe 3.0 SSD. It has good performance a good warranty and a better-rated endurance than the Samsung 980. It is power efficient and easy on the thermals. I liked the Gold P31 so much that I use this in my personal PC as my primary drive. Considering all the SSDs I have access to that endorsement should ring very clearly.

PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD Recommendations

Next up is the much newer PCIe Gen 4 drives. These drives offer up to around 2X the potential performance versus their Gen 3 predecessors but it took a while for SSD controllers and their accompanying NAND to rise up to the challenge of saturating that much available bandwidth. Soon we will have Gen 5 drives to consider but for now these are top dog.

For a cheap PCIe Gen 4 recommendation I am giving the nod to the Sabrent Rocket Q4. This QLC based drive is a good performer very much in line with the high-end first-generation PCIe 4.0 SSDs. Added to that the warranty is good and the price is right. The biggest weak point for the Q4 series is the low endurance rating.

My midrange PCIe Gen 4 choice is the XPG Gammix S70 or S70 Blade. I was very impressed at the performance of the S70; it consistently battled it out near the top of my charts with other second-generation PCIe 4.0 drives. Additionally the S70 has a much-improved endurance rating compared to the Rocket Q4. I am also throwing in a nod towards the S70 Blade drive; it is similar enough that for most purposes I would consider the drives interchangeable.

And finally my high-end PCIe Gen 4 recommendation is a tie between the Seagate FireCuda 530 and the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus. These drives are very similar internally and their performance is almost identical. Between the two I would generally pick whichever one is less expensive. The Seagate does have one extra that differentiates it; the FireCuda 530 includes a 3-year data rescue plan. Both drives have excellent rated endurance and absolutely top-tier long-term sustained write speed.

Bonus: SATA SSDs

SATA SSDs are still broadly used for bulk storage upgrading older systems and RAID deployments. Most systems have only one or two M.2 slots but even very inexpensive consumer motherboards tend to come with 4+ SATA ports.

My inexpensive SATA recommendation is the Crucial MX500. This drive is based on TLC NAND and has good performance specs. It comes with a 5-year warranty from a company that is a major vendor. Rated endurance is a weak point for the MX500 but it is not unreasonably low. The MX500 is available in both 2.5‚Ä≥ and M.2 form factors though capacities are limited to 1TB in the M.2 format.

For my premium SATA recommendation I am nominating the Samsung 870 EVO. Samsung drives held the banner for premium SATA SSDs for years and the 870 EVO is the latest drive in that lineage. The Samsung 870 EVO has all the same benefits as the less-expensive Crucial MX500 but a higher endurance rating.

Unlike the MX500 the Samsung 870 EVO is not available in a M.2 form factor. In its place I would recommend the Samsung 860 EVO which does come in M.2 and is incredibly similar to its 870 EVO successor.

Final Words

We are going to keep this guide updated from time to time. We should also mention that we will add a PCIe Gen 5 NVMe SSD version of this in the future. There are other drives that you will see on STH and in systems that we may review and may not make this list like the Kioxia XG8 that we will review soon. There are many OEM drives that we see but we are not going to call these ‚Äúretail‚Äù unless we can find them easily. Also this guide did not cover U.2/U.3 SSDs or EDSFF.",,,

GREENSBORO N.C. ‚Äî Have you ever received a text telling you if you put a company's logo on your car you can be paid to promote it?

A WFMY News 2 viewer received a text like that and is wondering if it's a real offer.





THE QUESTION

Will Oral B pay you $500 to put a decal on your vehicle to promote their brand?

OUR SOURCES

THE ANSWER

WHAT WE FOUND

We brought the text message to the Better Business Bureau and they say it is definitely a scam. Lechelle Yates says this is a textbook version of an employment scam. She says people have reported similar messages to the BBB.

""We call it an employment scam because you're hired to drive around with the big Oral-B on the side of your vehicle but that's a bit of a misnomer because you actually become a victim when you fall for the fake check and that's the part of the scam"" Yates said.

If you fall for the scam she says the new ""employer"" sends you a fake check for completing the job. You would then deposit the check and use that money to pay the person to put the decal on the car. But once the check is found out to be fake you're on the hook for the lost money.

""Because this is an employment scam when you are looking for a job one of the hallmarks of unemployment scams is the emails with the recruiters or whoever you're talking to about the job never comes from the business itself and never comes from so-and-so@amazon.com or so and so oral-b.com that's always a really good red flag"" Yates said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Which would be telecom stocks right?

Maybe not.

The truth is that telecom stocks ‚Äî there are really only three biggies these days; AT&T (T) Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS) ‚Äî aren‚Äôt what they used to be. Some say that has to do with their disastrous forays into the world of media but it‚Äôs probably more a matter of failed execution and the maturation of the business.

First the media math. Remember that within a two-week period in May of last year both AT&T and Verizon jettisoned WarnerMedia and Yahoo their respective content properties (yes the latter owns my employer Yahoo Finance). These moves were made to rid the data-driven left-brain telcos of frivolous flowery ‚Äî never mind costly ‚Äî media businesses. Getting out of content the thinking went would allow the telephone companies‚Äô distribution businesses to run full-out and unfettered which would presumably be a boon to shareholders.

‚ÄúMy days are a little bit more predictable than they were a couple of years ago‚Äù AT&T CEO John Stankey told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi this week. ‚ÄúThat's one of the reasons why we made the decision to do what we're doing. I didn't think I could do my best work or the broader management team could do their best work if we were trying to fight too many battles on too many different fronts. We are a more focused company today. We're executing each week better than we were the week before but we still have room to go.‚Äù

For sure on that last point.

Since May 15 2021 roughly when these announcements were made Verizon‚Äôs stock is down 18% and AT&T is down 19%. The S&P is only off 4%. The stocks still underperform the market after factoring in their 6% plus dividend yields.

Perhaps that‚Äôs surprising given these companies made game-changing announcements ‚Äî particularly in the case of AT&T as its divestment of content was a much bigger move relative to the size of its overall business. It‚Äôs also surprising since both AT&T and Verizon stocks sport generous dividend yields which ideally would bolster the shares during a market downturn.

Did deep-sixing the content businesses help the telcos‚Äô stocks? No it did not.

Before we get more into that let‚Äôs first consider T-Mobile once ridiculed (and still loathed) by the Big Two for its over-the-top former CEO John Legere and its garish (yet effective) pink branding. Legere stepped down two years ago but guess what T-Mobile is now ascendent if not triumphant. Barron‚Äôs recently pointed out that T-Mobile has a bigger market cap ($177 billion) than Verizon ($173 billion) or AT&T ($119 billion). True both Verizon and AT&T are more leveraged so that the overall enterprise value of the two older companies is bigger. But the fact remains that T-Mobile stock has trounced Verizon and AT&T ‚Äî and the market ‚Äî over the past five years.

Story continues

John Legere arrives at Manhattan Federal Court during the T-Mobile/Sprint federal case in New York U.S. December12 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton (Shannon Stapleton / reuters)

Why is that? In a word execution. T-Mobile merged with Sprint priced aggressively to build market share and most importantly improved its network.

‚ÄúTMUS 5g network is probably 18 months ahead of AT&T and Verizon's if not a little more‚Äù says Keith Snyder an industry analyst at CFRA. ‚Äú[AT&T‚Äôs and Verizon‚Äôs] balance sheets are bad. Those two companies combined have about $300 billion that they need to get off their balance sheet at some point. Meanwhile they need to spend very heavily on network deployments and new spectrum.‚Äù

And another thing: ‚ÄúVerizon's stock price is lower than it was 20 years ago. AT&T's stock price is lower than it was 20 years ago‚Äù says veteran industry analyst Craig Moffett. ‚ÄúGranted they've paid dividends but the total return by owning those stocks has been less than what you would have gotten from a corporate bond.""

Someone‚Äôs made money here though. As this 2017 McKinsey report points out internet giants Amazon Google and Facebook have built up massive businesses on the networks of AT&T and Verizon. The combined market caps of those three tech giants ‚Äî $3 trillion ‚Äî is 6.4 times that of the three telcos' $469 billion.

So did AT&T and Verizon blow it by not being able to marry content with distribution? Moffett thinks that‚Äôs a red herring.

‚ÄúI'm not sure ‚Äòthe tug and sway between content and distribution‚Äô has ever been a terribly relevant thesis‚Äù Moffett says. ‚ÄúIt's one of those things that people like to talk about but it doesn't really have all that much real-world application. Partially the problem with trying to be vertically integrated is that the law frowns on it. So there's limitations on what you could do. You could theoretically make content exclusive and that sort of thing but as carriers you generally aren't allowed to do that. So there isn't really any particular strategic logic for being vertically integrated.‚Äù

To Moffett it‚Äôs more a matter of two companies with declining businesses and bloated balance sheets that will struggle to pay their dividend down the road. AT&T already cut its dividend as part of its divestiture of the media business earlier this year.

As for the companies‚Äô path forward: ‚ÄúThey're not going to go bankrupt‚Äù Snyder says. ‚ÄúThey're established their businesses are generating cash. It's just that they need to rethink what they're doing.‚Äù Moffett offers a more succinct prognosis: ‚ÄúIt's terrible.‚Äù

On the other hand both analysts are sanguine about T-Mobile which they say will continue to grow at the incumbents‚Äô expense.

Is there any optimism to be had AT&T or Verizon? ‚ÄúThe bull case for Verizon or AT&T is that expectations are so low that the stocks have nowhere to go but up‚Äù Moffett says. ‚ÄúAnd as long as they maintain the dividend that thesis could perhaps work.‚Äù But then he adds: ‚ÄúThe problem is as we've seen so often with these companies if they can't generate any growth then the sustainability of the dividend eventually is in doubt.‚Äù

For Verizon and AT&T it‚Äôs not a great position to be in. Turns out even big splashy media deals couldn't help them.

Tech makers can be loathe to admit it but one of the key benefits of a smartwatch ‚Äî or at least a watch-like fitness tracker ‚Äî is the ability to detach yourself from your phone. With either kind of wearable you can avoid pulling your phone out of your pocket quite so often which also prevents doomscrolling and other distractions. A watch will let you take some actions without interrupting a conversation or even breaking your stride.

Some watches go a step further with cellular versions letting you leave your phone behind for hours. Examples include everything from Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Watch 5 to hardcore athletic products like the Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin Forerunner 945 LTE.

Many carriers expect you to pay monthly fees for wearable calls and data however never mind the upfront cost for the watch. T-Mobile US for example charges $10 or more for unlimited data. Canadian carriers Rogers and Telus both charge $10 CAD per month. French operator Bouygues Telecom wants ‚Ç¨2 per month for a secondary data-only SIM which doesn‚Äôt enable phone calls.

It‚Äôs about time all these fees came to an end ‚Äî here‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt make sense going into 2023.

Are you paying to enable cellular functions on a wearable device? 1420 votes My wearable doesn't have cellular/I don't own a wearable 32 % Yes 34 % No 35 %

The premise is fundamentally flawed

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

The core issue should be obvious: If I‚Äôm using data or making calls on my smartwatch I‚Äôm not doing that on my phone and vice versa. In effect we‚Äôre being charged for the privilege of owning an additional device not actually consuming more bandwidth.

Smartwatches are stand-ins for our phones instead of a source of additional consumption.

Carriers might argue that your phone is still using a passive separate stream of cellular traffic even when it‚Äôs sitting at home or in a gym locker. It‚Äôs probably connected to Wi-Fi in both places however in which case any cellular data is being sipped. Even when that‚Äôs not true I‚Äôm not going to be doing anything heavy like Spotify streaming or OS updates on a device that isn‚Äôt with me.

This isn‚Äôt akin to having a second phone line in other words. It makes sense to require a full mobile plan (calls and messaging plus data) for smartwatch service but I think most people would agree their wearable traffic should be an extension of that plan exactly as if they were using their phone.

Cellular access means better safety

Google

One of the things that prompted this op-ed was thinking about Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúFar Out‚Äù press event. The company spent a surprising amount of time talking about safety tech including crash detection satellite SOS on the iPhone 14 lineup and a rescue siren on the Apple Watch Ultra. One long video montage was devoted to how existing Watch features had saved lives.

Even companies like Google and Samsung have bragged about tech like SOS alerts though which highlights another reason to drop extra cellular fees. That is when it‚Äôs possible to communicate from anywhere at anytime we‚Äôre inherently safer.

The best safety is being able to reach out for help at any time.

It‚Äôs common to offer some sort of emergency calling or messaging for free on cellular watches including the Galaxy Watch. The problem is that these options are usually barebones. You can dial a service like 911 or send a burst of messages to emergency contacts and that‚Äôs about it. You can‚Äôt say call your partner when it seems like someone‚Äôs following you or message a friend to drive you home when you‚Äôre drunk.

High costs often deter people from buying a cellular model in the first place. If carriers and device makers want to prove they‚Äôre serious about safety they should find a way to make wearable connectivity more accessible to everyone. On top of nixing monthly fees that could mean adding cellular radios to every model and/or expanding options that don‚Äôt require a carrier plan. Related: The best emergency apps for Android

Nickel-and-diming is probably hurting overall sales

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

From an industry perspective you have to imagine vendors would sell more cellular watches ‚Äî regardless of whether they come at a premium ‚Äî if shoppers weren‚Äôt worried about paying ongoing fees later. Those fees can sometimes be trivial but in North America at least they tend to have some bite.

Assume for example that you‚Äôre looking at a watch with Verizon which charges $10 per month (plus taxes and other fees) for an associated plan. If you keep service going for three years that adds over $360 to whatever you‚Äôre paying for hardware. However useful cellular might be in safety and fitness a lot of people (myself included) are willing to gamble with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth models to save that kind of money.

Free smartwatch plans could be a draw to a carrier's other offerings.

Carriers of course are less concerned about unit sales than they are locking in continuous subscription revenue which is why they offer so many ‚Äúfree‚Äù phones to customers. Free smartwatch plans could be a draw to carriers‚Äô overall offerings and might even be inevitable given competitive pressure. Long-distance calling went from being expensive to de facto and all the major US carriers now offer unlimited data plans.

Can we expect smartwatch plans to be fixed?

Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority

In the short term I‚Äôd expect carriers to hold on to smartwatch fees with their teeth. They‚Äôre one of those simple sources of continuous revenue so whether or not the practice is short-sighted carriers will gladly charge money whenever they can convince people to pay.

All it would take is one carrier offering a free smartwatch plan bonus to trigger a competitive rush.

I‚Äôm optimistic in the long term however precisely because of that need to convince the public. Consumers are always looking to save cash and the value proposition of smartwatch plans is weak in many non-emergency situations. Beyond being stand-ins for phones smartwatches make plenty of feature and interface sacrifices for the sake of wearability. People who own them will still regularly pull out their phones to get some things done faster.

Cellular is nice to have ‚Äî especially for safety reasons ‚Äî but financial realism means that it‚Äôs often one of the first features on the chopping block when shopping for wearables which are already a luxury as far as many people are concerned.

And it all comes down to the way your phone interacts with your wireless provider.

Starting with the iPhone 14 Apple is ditching the physical SIM card tray. Instead the latest iPhones will use eSIM technology which uses software rather than a physical card to store your cell phone user information. While supporting eSIM is not a new move for the best phones on the market abandoning the physical SIM card completely is a major shift.

In fact it‚Äôs such a major shift that Apple's move comes with an important caveat. The iPhone 14 lineup will only ditch the physical SIM card in the U.S; other regions will still feature an iPhone with a physical SIM card slot.

Still Apple's move to eSIM indicates that the company thinks eSIM is the future so it is important to know how that could impact you going forward.

What is eSIM?

(Image credit: Panuwatccn/Shutterstock)

eSIM is a fairly simple concept. Instead of requiring a physical SIM card slot to determine which phone carrier you are using your phone uses software to perform the same task.

There can be a lot of benefits to using eSIM though keep in mind a phone carrier has to offer it as an option for you to use it. The good news for U.S. customers is that most major U.S. phone carriers offer eSIM from T-Mobile and Verizon to more budget-friendly options like Mint Mobile .

eSIM on iPhone 14

Apple has offered eSIM support since the iPhone XS XS Max and XR arrived in 2018. In fact the iPhone 13 even gave you the ability to have multiple eSIMs on one phone . Currently Apple says you can have eight or more eSIMs (that‚Äôs oddly specific) and use two phone numbers at the same time.

Setting up the eSIM is fairly simple. You need to first get the eSIM card in one of four ways: install a carrier plan scan a QR code use a phone carrier‚Äôs iOS app or use Apple‚Äôs eSIM quick transfer ‚Äî a feature that's new to iOS 16  which comes out September 12.

These four methods are all pretty straightforward. To install a carrier plan the wireless provider will send you a push notification on your iPhone. Just tap that notification and the iPhone will open up Settings and walk you through the process.

Using a QR code is similar; just scan the QR code and a push notification will appear. After that the process is the same.

Using your mobile phone carrier‚Äôs app is a little more complicated but only just. You‚Äôll need to install the phone carrier‚Äôs app on your phone then open the app and log in. Then you'll have to find instructions in that app to add an eSIM.

At that point the phone carrier‚Äôs app should automatically open Settings and then Settings will walk you through the process. However each carrier determines how its own app works so we cannot promise how smooth ‚Äî or rough ‚Äî all that will be.

Finally there is a new eSIM setup option on iOS 16 called eSIM Quick Transfer. This allows you to transfer your current SIM card (whether it's a physical SIM card or an eSIM) from your old iPhone to a new iPhone as an eSIM. The only catch here is that both phones have to run iOS 16 or it won‚Äôt work. But for a lot of people this will be an easy way to transfer their SIM card when upgrading phones. I wish I had this option when I upgraded to my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and had to transfer a physical SIM card.

eSIM: Advantages and disadvantages

(Image credit: Apple)

While eSIM advocates tout the simplicity of using software instead of a physical card there is a downside to Apple opting to go eSIM only ‚Äî carriers have to support eSIM for it to work. While that's not a concern in the U.S. where T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T are confirmed to provide eSIM support for iPhone 14 it could be more a pain traveling overseas.

That said a lot of international providers offer eSIM as well. In fact one of our editors just traveled internationally using an eSIM and is never going back to a physical card. As someone who has had to travel abroad with physical SIM cards or pay for an international data plan using eSIM feels like the future for globetrotters.

Aside from international travel there are some other benefits to eSIM as well. First no more stabbing yourself with a SIM card tool. Second by removing the physical SIM card slot the phone has more room inside the case to improve other features instead of setting aside space for a physical card. You also cannot lose an eSIM card and while physical SIM cards can be swiped to use in port-out scams that hijack phone numbers the only way to get an eSIM is to steal the whole phone.

Golovkin - Live Results From T-Mobile Arena In Las Vegas,"By Mark Eisner: Canelo Alvarez (58-2-2 39 KOs) defeated Gennadiy Golovkin (42-2-1 37 KOs) by a surprisingly close 12 round unanimous decision on Saturday night in their trilogy fight on DAZN PPV at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Canelo dominated the first seven rounds outworking and outboxing the 40-year-old Golovkin who looked like he was gunshy.

However in the championship rounds from eight to twelve Canelo gassed out and Golovkin took over the fight to finish strong. Unfortunately for Golovkin he started too late to make up the difference from the earlier rounds.

The judges‚Äô scores were 116-112 115-113 and 115-113. The win for Canelo ends the rivalry between him and Golovkin. It‚Äôs not the knockout that Canelo wanted but at least he got the victory.

Undercard results:

WBC super flyweight champion Jesse ‚ÄòBam‚Äô Rodriguez (17-0 11 KOs) put on a low-blow clinic tonight in beating Israel Gonzalez (28-5-1 11 KOs) by a 12 round unanimous decision. Rodriguez seemed to lose his cool after getting worked over to the body in the first seven rounds by the far more experienced Gonzalez. In the eighth round Bam Rodriguez repeatedly nailed Gonzalez with blow blows after accidentally head-butting him. Rodriguez looked like he was bothered by the body shots that Gonzalez was hitting him with as he normally faces headhunters. He‚Äôs quite good at getting out of the way of shots to the head but tonight he showed that he couldn‚Äôt avoid getting hit to the body. The judges‚Äô scores were 118-109 117-110 and 114-113. The first two scores were dreadfully poor as Bam Rodriguez appeared to barely edge it. Boxing News 24 scored it 114-113 for Rodriguez. The scores were terrible as was the performance from Rodriguez. It would be a good idea for Bam Rodriguez‚Äôs management to give up on their idea of matching him against Roman ‚ÄòChocolatito‚Äô Gonzalez because he‚Äôs not good enough. Had this been Chocolatito in there tonight Rodriguez would have lost badly. In the future hopefully Bam doesn‚Äôt continue to throw low blows when fights aren‚Äôt going his way.

Super middleweight contender Ali Akhmedov (19-1 14 KOs) easily defeated veteran Gabriel Rosado (26-16-1 15 KOs) by a lopsided 10 round unanimous decision. The judges‚Äô scores were 100-90 100-90 and 100-90. The 36-year-old Rosado was missing his shots by a mile and looking like his reflexes were shot. In the tenth round Rosado went all out trying to score a knockout but he was unable to land often enough to bother Akhmedov. The performance by Rosado was worse than his recent losses to Shane Mosley Jr and Jaime Munguia. With the defeat Rosado has now lost his last three fights.

After an uneventful first four rounds Pacheco hurt Collazo with a big right hand in the fifth round and then hammered him with lefts to the body until he went down. After Collazo got back up Pacheco teed off with heavy shots to the head resulting in the referee stepping in to halt the contest. Collazo was still on his feet but was taking too much punishment. The time of the stoppage was at 2:29 of the fifth round. Earlier in the contest Collazo showed no interest in letting his hands go which made things easy for Pacheco to dominate the fight.

Preview:

Undisputed super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez (57-2-2 39 KOs) is the favorite but Golovkin (42-1-1 37 KOs) feels confident that he‚Äôs going to have his hand raised with an upset.

This is a fight that Golovkin has been waiting for since 2018 and he‚Äôs finally getting his opportunity to face Canelo for the third time.

‚ÄúThe whole card from top to bottom. Not only is this the biggest Canelo fight we‚Äôve ever done but it‚Äôs also the best card with it‚Äù said Eddie Hearn to the DAZN Boxing Show.

‚ÄúJesse ‚ÄòBam‚Äô Rodriguez for me I think is going to be the Fighter of the Year. Israel Gonzalez who pushed Chocolatito all the way and arguably beat Kal Yafai in Monaco for the world title as well. This is a brilliant fight.

‚ÄúI think Jesse Rodriguez may already be pound-for-pound one of the top fighters in the sport. Ali Akhmedov against Gabe Rosado is an absolute all-out war.

‚ÄúWhat about Kieran Conway against Ammo Williams Diego Pacheco against Enrique Collazo Aaron Aponte against Fernando Molina and you‚Äôve got Marc Castro in a great fight.

‚ÄúWhen you build a card sometimes you get it right from top to bottom and this is the perfect example.

‚ÄúNot only do you have the biggest fight in boxing [Canelo vs. Golovkin] but you‚Äôve got a card where the fight fans can tune in on DAZN or be in the arena early doors and watch an unbelievable night of entertainment‚Äù said Hearn.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going with Canelo. Canelo of course took a loss to Bivol. I think he it off more than he could chew at that time‚Äù said Devin Haney to DAZN. ‚ÄúI think Bivol caught him slipping but I think GGG is past his prime.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still a dangerous fighter because he can punch but I think Canelo should beat him‚Äù said Haney.

‚ÄúI think if GGG comes in there with his A-game he‚Äôll beat Canelo‚Äù said Chris Eubank Jr. ‚ÄúI feel like that loss to Bivol may have really affected him mentally.

‚ÄúHe now knows he isn‚Äôt indestructible which he thought he was. So yeah I‚Äôm going to go with GGG.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think this is going to be the best fight of all three. The spite in this fight the bad intentions in this fight are on another level‚Äù said Eddie Hearn.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know which way it‚Äôs going to go. I do make Canelo Alvarez the favorite. One thing I absolutely guarantee is this fight will not go 12 rounds this time.

‚ÄúBoth guys are going in there with one thing on their mind and that‚Äôs to win this fight inside the distance‚Äù said Hearn.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a tough one. I‚Äôm going to have to give it to Canelo this time. I gave it to GGG the last two fights but I‚Äôm going to have to give it to Canelo this time‚Äù said Nonito Donaire.

‚ÄúCanelo wants to prove himself. He wants to prove himself so that he can rematch Bivol and get that confidence level that he had in the past. He learned from the first fight not to just go for the power shot. Utilize everything that he has‚Äù said Donaire.

‚ÄúI think Canelo is going to stop GGG‚Äù said Regis Prograis. ‚ÄúWhy I just think that with him coming off a loss he‚Äôs going to go back in the gym and be more serious and dedicated.

‚ÄúGGG is like 41 years old. Canelo is way younger. I think Canelo might stop him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a GGG fan but I think Canelo is in his prime; he‚Äôs still learning and is still growing. I think he takes the win against GGG‚Äù said Mikaela Mayer.

‚ÄúAs Paulie Malignaggi says the politics ain‚Äôt going to let Canelo lose‚Äù said Antonio Tarver. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to let him lose. So what GGG has to do is take it out of the judges‚Äô hands.

‚ÄúDoes he have the power and the ability the tenacity to stop Canelo? That remains to be seen. I know he [Golovkin] has waited around for this contest for a long time.

‚ÄúReally not trying to take any risks to sour or spoil this opportunity. Sometimes you can be sitting and waiting on a guy for too long and the fight isn‚Äôt there.

‚ÄúI think Canelo has a lot to prove coming off of that Bivol fight. He‚Äôs still defending his undisputed championship so there‚Äôs something there for Canelo.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say Canelo wins this impressively. Come on Canelo you‚Äôve got to give us the fight we want to see bro. You got to give us the Benavidez. You got to give us the Charlo bro.

‚ÄúWe need to see those fights. I‚Äôm not saying these guys beat Canelo. I‚Äôm just saying I want to see Canelo fight the best‚Äù said Tarver.

Canelo Alvarez and Gennadiy Golovkin will be going at it tonight on DAZN PPV in their trilogy clash at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. This is the fight that will determine who the better fighter is among these two superstars and it should be exciting as long as it lasts.

The pay-per-view portion of the card begins at 8:00 p.m. ET and the main event is expected to take place at approximately 11:00 p.m. ET. Boxing News 24 will be giving live updates & results of tonight‚Äôs action below."

Here are key facts about the structure of the listing:

Share capital

Porsche's share capital is being split in two with 455.5 million ordinary shares and the same number of preferred shares totalling 911 million shares overall a play on the company's most iconic model.

Ordinary shares carry voting rights which matter when it comes to the question of who controls the company.

Preferred shares don't carry voting rights but their holders will receive an additional dividend of 0.01 euros apiece on top of every dividend the company pays out on its ordinary shares.

Shares in Porsche AG are expected to start trading on Frankfurt's stock exchange on Sept. 29.

What VW is selling

As part of the deal Volkswagen plans to sell 25% plus one ordinary share in Porsche AG to Porsche SE the holding firm controlled by the Piech and Porsche families effectively giving them a blocking minority in the namesake brand.

Volkswagen also plans to sell 25% of preferred shares on the market. Qatar Volkswagen's third-largest shareholder has already committed to buy 4.99% leaving another 20.01% or 10% of Porsche's total capital to other investors.

The sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Abu Dhabi and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price have also committed to buying 1.8 billion euros worth of preferred shares between them.

Porsche SE already Volkswagen's largest shareholder and holder of the majority of voting rights in Europe's top carmaker has pledged to pay a 7.5% premium for its ordinary shares over the placement price of the preferred shares.

How much will VW get?

Volkswagen's proceeds from the sale of ordinary and preferred shares will be between 18.1 billion and 19.5 billion euros.

In case of a successful IPO Volkswagen will call an extraordinary shareholder meeting in December where it will propose to pay 49% of total proceeds or 8.9 billion-9.6 billion euros to its shareholders in early 2023 as a special dividend.

Who will control Porsche?

VW Group and Porsche SE will jointly own all of Porsche AG's ordinary shares in a 75 percent minus one share-25 percent plus one share split.

Overall 75 percent minus one ordinary share of Porsche AG's total share capital will be owned by VW Group after the IPO.

Porsche SE will own 12.5 percent plus one ordinary share of Porsche AG's total capital while Qatar will own 2.5 percent. The remaining 10 percent will be free-float.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3N0eWxlL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS12b2xrc3dhZ2VuLXRhcmdldHMtNzAtNzUtMTgwNDExNjc2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Volkswagen targets 75 billion euro valuation in landmark Porsche IPO,"FILE PHOTO: An employee of German car manufacturer Porsche fixes a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S label at the Porsche factory in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen Germany

""We are now in the home stretch with the IPO plans for Porsche and welcome the commitment of our cornerstone investors"" Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Arno Antlitz said.

In line with Volkswagen's agreement earlier in September with its largest shareholder Porsche SE  25% plus one ordinary share in the sportscar brand which do carry voting rights will go to Porsche SE at the price of the preferred shares plus a 7.5% premium.

In statements posted to Twitter Facebook and Instagram Rockstar Games said it suffered a network intrusion that allowed someone to access and download ‚Äúconfidential information from our systems including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt this time we do not anticipate any disruption to our live game services nor any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects.

A Message from Rockstar Games pic.twitter.com/T4Wztu8RW8 ‚Äî Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) September 19 2022

The alleged hacker behind the leak claimed to be the same person who launched a wide-ranging attack on Uber last week.

On a Grand Theft Auto fan forum the individual shared a link to footage and clips from Grand Theft Auto 6 a title which Rockstar has not publicly confirmed is in development.

They attached images videos and source code as evidence and linked to the New York Times coverage of the Uber security incident while describing it as their ‚Äúprevious work.‚Äù The hacker claimed to have ""GTA 5 and 6 source code and assets GTA 6 testing build.‚Äù

The individual writing in apparently fluent English and using the handle ‚Äúteapotuberhacker‚Äù said they were reachable via Telegram where their handle was Tea Pot. The person did not respond to requests for comment.

Initially the hacker offered data related to Grand Theft Auto 5 which has already been released for nothing less than $10000 but claimed they would not sell any of the data related to Grand Theft Auto 6 which is still in development.

The account wrote around 1 a.m. EST ‚Äúimma sleep for some hours now‚Äù before logging off in the early hours of Sunday. Although they posted subsequently their Telegram account has now been deleted.

The hacker also took to a message board on 4chan to discuss the incident claiming to have gotten initial access to Rockstar Games by social engineering an employee. They openly discussed wanting to negotiate with Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two Interactive but did not specify what they wanted to negotiate about.

In later messages the hacker said people connected to Take-Two Interactive were ‚Äúon‚Äù him and that he was unsure of what to do. With others on the message board the hacker mulled the pros and cons of selling the stolen data and footage or simply keeping it wondering which would allow them to avoid legal peril.

The hacker‚Äôs last message said they plan to leak more of what they stole if Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive did not pay them.

Take-Two Interactive was forced to file several DMCA infringement notices and takedown requests in an effort to get the leaked game footage off of YouTube and Twitter.

Where things get scary is that the hacker claims to have source code for both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Grand Theft Auto 6 which could obviously have huge ramifications for Rockstar if it gets in the hands of the public.

This has already escalated quite quickly with the person saying that he‚Äôll take offers of five figures for the Grand Theft Auto 5 source code with this leading to someone posing as the hacker and getting transferred $100000 (USD) in bitcoin by an undisclosed person in return for the GTA V source code. Obviously this wasn‚Äôt sent over as the person posing as the hacker wasn‚Äôt the one to receive the wire. At the time of writing the person has said that he will not sell Grand Theft Auto 6 source code but says that he is willing to negotiate with Rockstar.

The hacker has updated the original post stating that he is ""looking to negotiate a deal"". The hacker has also said that he has source code for GTA 5 and GTA 6. pic.twitter.com/LDtkAUt4Vt ‚Äî Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) September 18 2022

According to VGC in a post on GTA Forums Teapotuberhacker said: ‚Äú‚ÄúOk so this has gone unexpectedly viral woke up to 3000 Telegram DM‚Äôs. If you are an employee of Rockstar or Take 2 and you‚Äôre trying to contact me send me a message containing 22559219889638875756 on Telegram or you can email me at X ** from your corporate email address ** I will try to read all these replies soon ‚Äì I am looking to negotiate a deal.‚Äù

PC Gamer reports that a user on the GTA Forums has posted a 3GB file full of 90 videos of GTA VI footage. It‚Äôs not exactly clear how the footage was obtained but the ‚Äúteapotuberhacker‚Äù poster claims to be behind the unrelated Uber hack late last week and says they may ‚Äúleak more data soon‚Äù including GTA V and GTA VI source code assets and testing builds.

The massive leak lines up with some earlier reporting on GTA VI showing a female playable character in some clips. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that GTA VI would include a female protagonist influenced by Bonnie and Clyde. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier says he has verified the leak is real through sources at Rockstar Games.

The leaked videos are currently being posted to YouTube Twitter Reddit and many gaming forums online. In one video posted to YouTube a playable female character named Lucia is seen robbing a restaurant and taking hostages. There is plenty of placeholder text showing this is clearly unfinished gameplay and you can visibly see where the game engine is detecting objects in the scene.

Another clip shows a playable character on the ‚ÄúVice City Metro‚Äù train which lines up with reports that the game is set in a fictionalized version of Miami much like 2002‚Äôs GTA: Vice City. A separate clip includes a poolside conversation that feels similar to the NPC conversations in Rockstar‚Äôs Red Dead Redemption 2.

It‚Äôs not clear how old the footage is but some appears to be running on RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3080 cards so the development build can‚Äôt be any older than two years. Other clips show new NPC interactions updated UI and animations and even Rockstar‚Äôs own internal debug tools for GTA VI on PlayStation.

Leaked clips are being shared widely on YouTube and social media sites

While GTA VI is reportedly at least two years away these leaked clips show early and unfinished development builds and testing of some aspects of the game. It‚Äôs not the first time a Rockstar game has been leaked heavily. Trusted Reviews was forced to donate more than $1 million to charity and issued an apology in 2018 after the site published details about Red Dead Redemption 2 ahead of the game‚Äôs launch.

We‚Äôve reached out to Rockstar owner Take-Two to comment on the leak and we‚Äôll update you if we hear back. Take-Two appears to have started filing takedown requests for some GTA VI footage hosted on YouTube though. ‚ÄúThis video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Take 2 Interactive‚Äù now appears on some videos but many others remain online.

Update 9:25AM ET: Article updated with confirmation the leak is authentic."

Chinese state-backed hackers have targeted computer systems used by ‚ÄúHeads of government‚Äù Prime Minister‚Äôs Office government institutions linked to finance aerospace defence companies telecom companies IT organizations and media companies in multiple countries in an intelligence gathering operation that has been in motion since 2021.

This has been unearthed by researchers of Broadcom Inc a Delaware-based corporation headquartered in San Jose California United States. The report by Broadcom has stated that the target of this cyber espionage were ‚ÄúAsian governments‚Äù and does not specify which country/countries of the 48 Asian countries were targeted by these Chinese state supported hackers.

Researchers from Broadcom‚Äôs Software‚Äôs Symantec threat hunter team told The Sunday Guardian that the company does not ‚Äúdisclose victim identities‚Äù. According to the research the hackers installed Shadow-pad malware into the systems of its intended victims. The said malware was able to execute keylogging take screenshots download files and steal clipboard data.

While the report does not name the Chinese entities as being responsible for these attacks Shadow-pad trojan malware is something that has been used by the Chinese government-sponsored Bronze Atlas group since at least 2017. Researchers in the past have found irrefutable evidence to link these cyber thieves to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) (Chinese intelligence agency) and the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA).

‚ÄúThe malware was likely developed by threat actors affiliated with Bronze Atlas and then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups around 2019‚Äù a Delhi-based cyber researcher told The Sunday Guardian. According to Broadcom the current campaign appears to be almost exclusively focused on government or public entities. According to experts the trojan programs were most likely installed on each compromised computer the attackers wanted to run malware on. In some cases it was likely installed on multiple computers on the same victim network. These malwares were mostly embedded in software including security software graphics software and browsers.

Bronze Atlas which also goes by the name of APT41 Barium Double Dragon Wicked Panda or Winnti has been termed as a prolific APT an Advanced Persistent threat (APT) actor a broad term used to describe an attack campaign in which the intruder or team of intruders establishes an illicit long-term presence on a network in order to mine highly sensitive information.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDkxODAwNTAyNC9lbi9GdXR1cmUtQmVhdXR5LUxhYnMtQW5ub3VuY2VzLUJZT01BJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1SZXRhaWwtRXhwYW5zaW9uLUludG8tVWx0YS1CZWF1dHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future Beauty Labs Announces BYOMA's Retail Expansion Into Ulta Beauty,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following its explosive success in the US and UK skincare innovation house Future Beauty Labs announces the retail expansion of its award-winning skincare line BYOMA into Ulta Beauty.

The brand launches with the U.S.‚Äô largest specialty beauty retailer digitally on Sunday and will go into 715 doors nationally on Oct. 16.

Despite the brand‚Äôs age ‚Äî it only launched earlier this year ‚Äî it has already hit $9 million in retail sales via its existing partnership with Target and is on track to hit $15 million for its first year there the brand confirmed to WWD.

Byoma is owned by Future Beauty Labs the parent company behind Tan-Luxe Tanologist and Isle of Paradise. The company‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Marc Elrick told WWD it was born out of consumer insights.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a consumer-led business‚Äù he said of the brand‚Äôs inception. ‚ÄúDuring the pandemic we noticed internally and what we saw on social was the consumer over-exfoliating. With the rise of DermTok and a lot of conflicting information out there I felt like the consumer was more informed but maybe more confused.

‚ÄúWhen we looked at the data insights as well as our own social media platforms we noticed it was a really big problem‚Äù he continued.

Social media‚Äôs role in the brand‚Äôs creation didn‚Äôt end there. The brand which houses its formulas in Gen Z-friendly vibrantly colored packaging has already gained 200000 social media followers. Its Moisturizing Gel Cream is the brand‚Äôs top seller given its TikTok virality status with 1.7 million views.

The brand‚Äôs offerings include a cleanser three serums the moisturizer and a hydrating trio kit. Each product incorporates a proprietary barrier-health complex with ceramides cholesterol and fatty acids at optimal ratios. Prices range from $12.99 to $24.99 and the full assortment will be available at Ulta.

As reported by WWD Ulta Beauty is winning with the Gen Z consumer. A Piper Sandler survey cited the retailer as the top retailer for the cohort nabbing 48 percent mindshare.

Though the brand plays well with younger consumers Elrick stressed that Byoma‚Äôs appeal spans demographics. ‚ÄúEvery single person has a skin barrier and every single person can benefit from barrier care whether your barrier is compromised or not‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve noticed from the data we‚Äôre starting to get back from our retailers is that it‚Äôs appealing to a much broader demographic.‚Äù Byoma also over-indexes with Gen X.

‚ÄúOur vision is to build the next CeraVe‚Äù Elrick continued. ‚ÄúWith the demand we‚Äôve had from retailers globally and the roadmap that we‚Äôve built we will absolutely get there.‚Äù

The brand which recently expanded across European markets anticipates it will exceed between $300 million and $500 million in retail sales in the next three years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9sb2dpc3RpY3MvZGZjLXRvLWtlZXAtZGF0ZS13aXRoLXRhcmdldC1vZi1taWQtMjAyMy1mb3ItY29tcGxldGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlNjU5MDY0NDUuZWNl0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2xvZ2lzdGljcy9kZmMtdG8ta2VlcC1kYXRlLXdpdGgtdGFyZ2V0LW9mLW1pZC0yMDIzLWZvci1jb21wbGV0aW9uL2FydGljbGU2NTkwNjQ0NS5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DFC to keep date with target of mid 2023 for completion,"Even as the ambitious dedicated freight corridor (DFC) is expected to be largely operational by the middle of next year innovative business solutions are being worked out to increase its share of freight transportation.

‚ÄúExcept for the Vaitarna to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Terminal (JNPT) stretch in Mumbai we expect the deadline of June 2023 to be met‚Äù said an official.

Of the 2843 km that consist of the two corridors ‚Äî the Eastern and Western DFC 1352 km have been completed. All work contracts have been awarded and 100 per cent of the land has been acquired. The 1337 km long eastern DFC stretches from Ludhiana to Sonnagar while the Western DFC from JNPT to Dadri is 1506 km in length. Every day around 170 trains are running on its corridors at average speeds of over 60 kmph.

‚ÄúAbout 1 billion gross tonne km (GTKM) of freight is carried every seven days on the corridors‚Äù said an official with the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd (DFCCIL) adding that on a daily basis 120 to 140 million GTKM of freight is transported.

Coal food grains fertilisers and steel are the major commodities transported on the eastern DFC. Containers and cement form the bulk on the western front.

The transit time has also come down drastically by at least 50 per cent. For instance the transit time between Mundra to the National Capital Region earlier took about three days which has now reduced to less than one and a half days.

New business models

DFC Bridge over the Sabarmati river

The DFCCIL is already working on the ‚Äòtruck on train‚Äô service and is exploring other business development activities such as transport of small cargo and setting up of goods sheds and freight terminals. ‚ÄúWe want to use the capacity and speed of the DFC which gives scope for a lot of experimentation‚Äù the official said.

One of the new models on the anvil is transport of small cargo with a packet size of about 100 tonne from the hinterlands to the port along with first and last mile connectivity for which DFCCIL is empanelling service providers.

The service which will be attractive for MSMEs is likely to start soon. The tariff would depend on operational costs and local conditions.

DFCCIL is inviting private players to build goods sheds and freight terminals. About 10 such terminals will be needed on the western corridor. Solar energy is another area where the DFCCIL plans to make a foray.

It is in talks with NTPC BHEL and SECI to put up solar panels along the alignment and adjoining land parcels.

Abrasives adhesives sealants and fillers advanced materials automotive parts and hardware building supplies cleaning supplies coatings compounds and polishes dental and orthodontics lab supplies and testing labels lubricants personal protective equipment office supplies signage & marking tapes and tool manufacturing are among the products produced by 3M India Limited. According to Value Research's statistics 3M India Ltd. is a debt-free company but what could sound more intriguing to potential investors is that 3M India is one of the multibagger stocks that have turned investors' lakhpati to crorepati over the course of a long-term investment.

Share price history of 3M India

The shares of 3M India ended Friday's trading session on the BSE at ‚Çπ23919.65 a piece up 4.50% from the previous close of ‚Çπ22890.10. The total volume recorded by the stock was 1188 shares lower than the 20-Day average volume of 286 shares. The stock price has gone up dramatically from ‚Çπ220 on July 11 1997 to the current market price logging a multibagger return and an all-time high of 10772.57%; as a result if an investor had invested ‚Çπ1 lakh in the stock 25 years ago the amount would now have grown to ‚Çπ1.08 Cr.

The stock has gained 64.12% in the previous five years but it has fallen 4.72% in the last year. The stock has declined 7.30% year-to-date (YTD) in 2022.

The RSI indicator value for 3M India Limited as of 16/09/2022 was 66.61 suggesting that the stock is neither in an overbought nor oversold condition. The stock is currently trading at a P/B ratio of 12.35 PE of 82.68x and EV/EBITDA of 53.05x making it an overvalued stock when compared to its peers such as Quess Corp Ltd Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Nava Ltd Balmer Lawrie & Company Ltd.

Should you buy the shares of 3M India?

On Thursday the research analysts of the broking firm ICICI Securities said in their note that ‚Äú3M India‚Äôs FY22 annual report highlights the following: (1) Company is expanding its local manufacturing capacity for respirators masks hand sanitisers etc; it will also supply industry consumables to mobile phone manufacturing companies availing the PLI schemes. (2) 3M India is steadily investing in increasing its offline and online reach for Scotch Brite. (3) It introduced four products in automotive and consumer segments. We expect launch of additional products in tandem with normalisation of the economy. (4) Royalty as a percentage of sales reduced from 5.3% in FY21 to 5.2% in FY22. We remain positive on 3M India due to its competitive advantages such as: (1) strong brands (2) established distribution network and global relationships with large manufacturers and (3) access to parent‚Äôs technology pool.""

They further added that ‚ÄúWe model 3M India to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 16.6% and 39.4% respectively over FY22-FY24E with steady improvement in RoE. Maintain BUY with a DCF-based target price of Rs26500. Key risks: prolonged weakness in the economy and failure of new products.""

Or follow us on Google News

I probably saw news of the new Tesla blind spot camera feature when it was introduced in December 2021 and then forgot about it or maybe it was somehow in my social media and Google News blind spot (haha) and I never noticed it at all. Well recently while going through my settings for something else I noticed ‚ÄúAutomatic Blind Spot Camera‚Äù in the Autopilot settings and enabled it. The description says ‚ÄúShow side repeater camera when turn signal is engaged.‚Äù

In short when you turn on a turn signal a video feed of one of your cameras shows up on the bottom left corner of the screen. (Reportedly you will soon be able to move where on the screen the blind spot camera feed shows.)

If you engage the left turn signal you‚Äôll get a video feed from the back left corner of the car. If you engage the right turn signal you‚Äôll get a video feed from the back right corner of the car. Here‚Äôs a short video from the internets showing use of the Automatic Blind Spot Camera feature:

I love this new(ish) feature. It provides great visibility to the areas behind my car where another car may be hiding out and asking for a horrific accident if I start changing lanes or turning without checking the blind spots adequately.

The one downside of the camera feed is that you do have to look down and away from the road for a moment to view it so you still have to remember to use it and you do have to take your eyes off of other potential issues in front of you or on the side of you at the same time that you‚Äôre preparing to change lanes or turn. This is one case where it would truly be nice to have a little screen behind the steering wheel ‚Äî like the IONIQ 5 has (though the IONIQ 5‚Äôs camera feed seems to be notably smaller and thus not quite as useful as Tesla‚Äôs in that respect):

But clearly we‚Äôre not getting that screen added to a Model 3 and I have a bigger request anyway.

The blind spot that has caused me the most risk isn‚Äôt actually one of the ones in the back of the car. It‚Äôs the blind spot caused by the front-right pillar. There have been a handful of instances in which someone (in a car on a bike or walking) was going from right to left at just the same rate as I was moving forward such that they remained hidden behind that pillar for a few seconds or even several seconds.

It seems impossible when you look at the pillar but it happens. It‚Äôs like the magic of a solar eclipse and the fact that the moon is just the right size to perfectly block the much larger sun due to how much further away the sun is. A full car can fit behind the pillar as it drives along a crossroad probably aided in its cover by the rear-view mirror.

Ideally when I turn on my left turn signal I‚Äôd have two blind spot camera feeds pop onto the touchscreen ‚Äî one for the back left and one for the front right.

I know ‚Äî this is probably too much to ask and my wish won‚Äôt be granted. But one can try.

This week: Tesla proposes $375M lithium refinery for EV batteries in Texas; PGT Trucking expands border operations; Lineage Logistics signs lease at Houston ColdPort; and Otay Mesa port of entry receives $150M federal grant.

Amid surging global demand for electric vehicles automaker Tesla Inc. is looking to create a domestic lithium supply chain for EV batteries.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) recently filed a notice with the state of Texas seeking special tax breaks for the proposed lithium refinery to be located in Robstown Texas about 20 miles from the Port of Corpus Christi and less than 200 miles from its Gigafactory Texas in Austin.

Tesla touted the proposed lithium refinery as the first of its kind in the United States stating it would ‚Äúprocess raw ore material into a usable state for battery production‚Äù according to an application with the Texas Comptroller‚Äôs office dated Aug. 22.

Tesla said it wants a site that has access to shipping channels along the Gulf of Mexico.

‚ÄúTesla will ship lithium products from the refinery by trucks and rail to various Tesla battery manufacturing sites supporting the supply chain for large-scale and electric vehicle batteries‚Äù according to state documents.

If approved Tesla could begin construction on the refinery by the end of the year and production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide could begin in 2024. The refinery could create up to 162 full-time jobs by 2025 with salaries of up to $81000 per year Tesla said.

Tesla has not received any regulatory permits and said its final decision will be dependent on how much state and local property tax relief it can receive stating it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdetermining factor for investment in Texas.‚Äù





According to an analysis by the Austin American-Statesman the tax program could save Tesla about $16.2 million in taxes.

In its application with the Texas Comptroller‚Äôs office Tesla also said it‚Äôs considering a site in Louisiana for the lithium refinery but did not specify a location.

CEO Elon Musk tweeted in April that Tesla may need to begin refining lithium because of rising prices.

‚ÄúPrice of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining and refining directly at scale unless costs improve‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúThere is no shortage of the element itself as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth but the pace of extraction/refinement is slow.‚Äù

The price of lithium is up 120% this year according to a tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The global lithium market size was valued at almost $7 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow 12% by 2030 according to Grandview Research.

Along with EV batteries lithium is also used in a host of other electronic devices such as laptop computers and cellphones.

‚ÄúElectrification of vehicles is projected to attract a significant volume of lithium-ion batteries thus anticipated to drive the market over the forecast period‚Äù Grandview Research said.

The U.S. mines about 1% of global lithium with the majority of raw lithium supplies coming from Australia Argentina and Chile. China refines about 60% of the world‚Äôs lithium with 148 refineries across the country according to Gavekal Research as reported by Barron‚Äôs.

Otay Mesa port of entry receives $150M federal grant

The Otay Mesa East port of entry in Southern California was recently awarded a $150 million grant from the Biden administration‚Äôs Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

The funds will be used for ‚Äúhighway multimodal freight and rail projects that will make the nation‚Äôs transportation systems safer and more resilient eliminate supply chain bottlenecks and improve critical freight movements‚Äù according to a news release from the Department of Transportation.

Officials said the federal grant ensures the $1.1 billion Otay Mesa East-Otay II project will be completed on schedule. The Otay Mesa port of entry is located just south of San Diego along the U.S.-Mexico border.

‚ÄúThis really puts it together and closes the loop around the funding to take us to the final construction‚Äù Maria Rodriguez project development program manager for the San Diego Association of Governments told Border Report.

The project began construction last month and will create a new border crossing 3 miles east of the original Otay Mesa port of entry. It will include 10 lanes five for passenger vehicles and five for cargo transport. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2024.

Mario Zelaya the owner of a 2013 Tesla Model S says he was locked out of his vehicle after the battery pack died because of an alleged design flaw. Now he says he can‚Äôt even get inside the car to access the ownership documents to sell the vehicle he has opted not to fix.

Zelaya said in a TikTok video that he paid $140000 CAD ($105472 USD at current exchange rates) when he bought the car new and got it serviced regularly. Now though he claims that a design flaw in 2013-2014 Models Ss means that the HVAC condenser drips onto the battery pack leading to rust and eventually damaging the batteries.

Tesla is refusing to pay for a new battery because the issue was discovered after the vehicle‚Äôs warranty expired. Zelaya though claims that the issue must have started while the vehicle was covered and that he has been in contact with Transport Canada which is now investigating the issue.

‚ÄúNot only did they do an investigation on this car they‚Äôre going to be doing one that Tesla doesn‚Äôt realize is coming up because I got in touch with another owner who has the exact same problem‚Äù Zelaya said. ‚ÄúThe battery died Tesla‚Äôs trying to sweep it under the rug. They won‚Äôt give them any explanation about why the battery died.‚Äù

Indeed that is a service that Transport Canada offers. Consumers are invited to contact the regulator via its website where they can fill out a defect complaint form. The service has previously led to a defect notice on the Kia Soul whose heated seats were burning occupants.

It is unclear though whether or not the organization is close to taking any action for the 2013-2014 Tesla Model S and no investigation is underway for this issue in the U.S. according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

A look through the complaints section of the regulator‚Äôs website though does show that at least one owner had a similar issue. Filed in April 2021 the complaint stated that they had ‚Äúwater intrusion‚Äù causing their drivetrain to fail and was told that it was not covered by warranty. Some forum posts also look like they might possibly be describing issues that are similar to this one.

As for being unable to open the doors on his Tesla that is a known issue with the EV for which there are a number of solutions though they do seem to be rather involved. Sensibly Zelaya opted to simply pay $30 CAD ($22.60 USD) to get new documents.

He now claims that he will be selling the car for around $20000 CAD ($15067 USD). It‚Äôs unclear what the new owner will do with the car but a new battery pack will allegedly cost $26000 CAD ($19588 USD). All in that might not be a bad deal since similar models are selling for $49950 CAD ($37632 USD) in Toronto.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bHR4LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RyYWZmaWMvdHdvLWRlYWQtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXRyZWUtY2F0Y2hlcy1maXJlLWxha2UtbXVycmF5LzEwMS03Y2E0MDRmZi05OTgwLTQyYmQtYWZiNy03ZWZkZmJiYWY5ZGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla accident leaves two dead near Lake Murray in South Carolina,"Both the driver and front seat passenger were pronounced dead at the scene.

RICHLAND COUNTY S.C. ‚Äî Two people have died in a crash involving an electric car that happened early Sunday morning.

According to Master Trooper David Jones with the South Carolina Highway Patrol the crash happened around 2:10 a.m. on Salem Church Road which is in northwestern Richland County near Irmo and Lake Murray.

Jones said the vehicle a 2021 Tesla was traveling west on Salem Church Road when it left the road to the left and struck a tree after which the vehicle caught fire.

Both the driver and front seat passenger were pronounced dead at the scene Jones said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY3RpZi5vcmcvbmV3cy8xNTAtMDAwLWxpdGVycy13YXRlci1uZWVkZWQtcHV0LW91dC1maXJlLWVsZWN0cmljLWNhctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Up to 150 000 liters of water needed to put out a fire in an electric car,"...Teslas may take up to 30000-40000 gallons of water maybe even more to extinguish the battery pack once it starts burning...""

A US fire service recently needed to use 24 000 gallons - almost 90 000 liters - of water to put out a battery fire in a Tesla in a parking lot car fire. Studies suggest even more water may be necessary to put out fires in EVs.

According to an article in Firehouse.com on September 16 a Tesla was burning in the city of Stamford US.

Two engines a truck company and an incident commander were initially dispatched. In total 14 firefighters were sent to the scene as soon as it was determined the vehicle involved in the fire was a Tesla.

Fire crews started out by pouring 200 gallons of water on to the fire however soon realized it wasn=t enough to handle the burning battery so they hooked up a second engine.

A total of 600 gallons per minute was poured onto the fire for 40 minutes before they were able to declare the fire extinguished. That is in total 24 000 US gallons of water.

In metric terms 2200 liters of water per minute was poured on to the EV. Over 40 minutes of intervention it amounts to a total of roughly 88 800 liters of water.

However a Tesla might require twice that amount of water or more once the battery pack becomes fully involved.

According to an article on TheHill.com on August 17 2021 it is considered normal procedure that firefighters will need to use up to 40 times more water to put out a fire in an EV compared to a standard gasoline car.

The article also claims authorities have said a Tesla Model X poses a serious threat of starting a fire for hours after a crash.

‚ÄúNormally a car fire you can put out with 500 to 1000 gallons of water‚Äù Austin Fire Department Division Chief Thayer Smith said according The Independent.

‚ÄúBut Teslas may take up to 30000-40000 gallons of water maybe even more to extinguish the battery pack once it starts burning.""

Woodlands Fire Chief Palmer Buck told Fox 7 that ""there is no blueprint for putting out fires involving electric vehicles"":

‚ÄúThere is not at this point any easily obtainable extinguishing agent on the market to deal with these fires. It all goes back to the way the cars are engineered with the battery pack being at the bottom of the car and encased in a titanium shell so you really can‚Äôt gain access to it you just have to sit back and pour water on it‚Äù Buck said.

A large part of the reason many EVs are notoriously difficult to extinguish may be due to the construction of the vehicle with a heavily encased battery pack which is difficult to reach for the fire crews.

While normally a conventional car fire may be put out with between 2000 and 4000 liters of water an EV will often need a much more prolonged intervention because the battery is protected by a strong encasing. Because the chemicals in the battery will continue to produce their own oxygen to some degree even when completely soaked the water is often less effective than of conventional fuels.

Many experts recommend the method of submersion of a burning EV into a water filled container like a sea can. However this is is not always practical or possible to arrange and it also takes considerable time to fill the container which may be counterproductive when needing to protect surrounding vehicles or buildings from the EV fire.

Some fire services have improvised their own methods of partial submersion for EVs on fire as CTIF.org reported on earlier this August.

‚ÄúCultivating Community Through Art: Sam Coronado‚Äôs Serie Project & Its Continuing Legacy‚Äù features prints from the artist-in-residence program Coronado began independently in 1993.

Coronado taught at ACC from 1986 until his death in 2013. Born and raised in the greater Dallas area he began his artistic career as a technical illustrator for Texas Instruments following service in the U.S. Army. He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1975 from the University of Texas.

Like many of his generation activism and creating community were inseparable from Coronado‚Äôs artistic practice. While at UT he helped kickstart the Chicano Art Students Association and in 1984 he co-founded Mexic-Arte Museum.

In the early 1990s Coronado visited Self Help Graphics in East Los Angles which had incubated the Chicano art movement in the 1970s. Screen printing proved a natural tool for the movement. Screen prints are cost-effective and fairly quick to produce ‚Äî a nimble creative response to rapidly unfolding social and political issues. Moreover printmaking linked the Chicano art movement with the importance of the medium in Mexico as a means of communicating social and political causes through art.

Back in Austin in 1993 Coronado opened his printmaking studio in the Montopolis neighborhood an historically Latinx community. Under the auspices of the Serie Project artists were invited to work with a master printer to create an original screen print that was then published in editions of 50 half of which the artist kept. The remaining prints joined Serie‚Äôs growing collection some of which were sold to collectors others presented in exhibitions throughout Texas and beyond.

In 2002 the Serie Project became founding members of Consejo Grafico the first nationally recognized consortium of Latino printmakers in the United States.

More than 250 artists ‚Äî the majority Latinx or artists of color ‚Äî participated in the Serie Project during its 20-year existence. Some were already established; many were emerging artists and first-time printmakers. The current exhibition includes Serie prints by artists who now have celebrated careers: Cruz Ortiz Deborah Roberts Luis Valderas and Joey Fauerso.

The ACC exhibition highlights Serie Project artist with connections to the school as well as work by Coronado himself. It also includes a selection of work by the three Coronado Studio Master Printers: Pepe Coronado (no relation) Brian Johnson and Jonathan Rebolloso who made a three-part work called ‚ÄúPaletas‚Äù when he was an ACC student.

Today Rebolloso and Pepe Coronado carry on the legacy of Sam Coronado. Pepe was one Sam‚Äôs first mentees and the first Master Printer of the Serie Project. Rebolloso was a student of Sam‚Äôs at ACC.

Continuing through Dec. 8 the ACC exhibition offers a nicely presented introduction to the significant influence Sam Coronado had on Austin‚Äôs cultural landscape and on many artists.

With the opening of its new 2.2 million-square-foot $400 million expansion the largest distribution center in the state now lies in a city of 8573 residents. The company which already employs 3600 in Thief River Falls plans to add more than 100 employees in each of the next three years.

And while the company's growth has helped the area hold its own as far as population it does not insulate the company or others in northwestern Minnesota itself from the economic issues of today. All over Minnesota and indeed the country communities are dealing with a tight workforce affordable housing issues inflation and supply chain issues.

President Dave Doherty said the company is well ahead of its hiring goals with no immediate plans to stop as the new facility continues to ramp up.

""We're investing more than we originally planned for good reasons"" Doherty said about employment and also how the expansion grew in both scope and from the original price estimate of $250 million. ""We saw some cool things along the way.""

While Textron's Arctic Cat factory sits next to Digi-Key ‚Äî and Polaris and Marvin have large operations in neighboring Roseau County ‚Äî the growth of the privately held electronics component distributor is paramount to the health of Thief River Falls and surrounding Pennington County.

Digi-Key‚Äôs new warehouse is one of the 10 largest in the country.

The $45 million in local and state tax breaks and incentives were more than worth it for this reason officials said at a ribbon-cutting for the expansion in August.

""If your neighbor doesn't work there don't go too far down the street and you'll find somebody that does work at Digi-Key"" said Brian Holmer mayor of Thief River Falls.

Fast growth means investment across community

In 2016 Digi-Key had annual sales of $1.86 billion and 3200 employees. The company expects for this year's annual revenue to be $5.15 billion with 5081 workers overall and 4133 in the U.S.

The company is a quick-turn distributor of electronics components offering 13.4 million products to more than 857000 customers in 180 countries each year. That means trucks ‚Äî run by FedEx USPS UPS and others ‚Äî are constantly leaving with orders. In fact space is dedicated within the expansion for the carriers.

The Thief River Falls airport is the third-busiest cargo airport in Minnesota behind Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Rochester International Airport said Joe Hedrick the airport manager. The facility built a 140000-square-foot concrete cargo ramp this year and next year will complete a 30000-square-foot hangar so larger cargo plans can be loaded and unloaded indoors.

""Without Digi-Key we wouldn't have that outbound cargo"" Headrick said.

Right now officials are completing a master plan for the airport that would include an 800-foot extension to the main runway in the next four to six years to increase cargo capacity even more.

While many rural areas in Minnesota and across the country are losing population with teens and young adults leaving after high school and college because of either a perceived lack of opportunity or a big deficit in job openings.

Thief River Falls gained 2% in population between 2010 and 2020. Pennington County held steady adding 62 people during the decade for a population of 13992.

Without Digi-Key and Textron Thief River Falls would not be able to support a regional medical center Holmer said. There are also opportunities at retail and support businesses.

Yet he admits the tight workforce is causing concern. The unemployment rate in Pennington and Roseau counties was 2.1% in July not much higher than the record 1.8% rate for the state.

Digi-Key relies heavily on northwestern Minnesota for employees with 87% of its workforce living within a 60-mile radius of Thief River Falls.

""This workforce issue is the issue of our moment"" said Steve Grove commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. ""There is no question it's going to be with us for a while. We've got to be doing new things.""

Wages in the distribution center start at $18 to $20 an hour depending on the shift with a $2000 sign-on bonus. Entry-level wages in sales jobs start at $22.70 an hour.

The company also provides a generous health plan that covers 97 cents for every dollar in medical expenses plus other benefits.

More than 17 miles of automated conveyer belts transport products throughout Digi-Key‚Äôs new 2.2 million-square-foot warehouse.

""We're actively recruiting people from all walks of life here"" Doherty said.

Shane Zutz now the company's director of human resources spent years as a teacher coach and school administrator in Thief River Falls before Digi-Key recruited him.

The expansion ‚Äî and the automated systems built into it ‚Äî will allow others to advance their careers in the company Zutz said. An employee at Digi-Key he stressed can still go from entry-level to leading departments with one creating a human resources program for veterans and another directing a $100 million marketplace.

""We want people to be able to move around and learn our company. And so then when we get it to these places these inflection points we can lean on them to help us through those times to continue to be successful"" Zutz said.

Key to the new expansion is a conveyor system by Austrian-based Knapp. A leader in automated storage picking and shipping systems that provides logistics for large retail and fulfillment operations.

The new systems mean the employees who pick items and pack boxes can work more efficiently the company said. But the move also created different types of specialty jobs that requires recruiting more people to the Thief River Falls area.

Dave Doherty president of Digi-Key says northwest Minnesota has a rare gift for innovation.

Fast growth also poses challenges

Having such a strong regional employment base opens up the problems that the rest of Minnesota including the Twin Cities has right now.

Even parking can be an issue. Because Digi-Key has to draw from a large region to fill new jobs the city of Thief River Falls moved its electrical department to make room for a new employee lot.

The city also expedited the building permit process helped with the infrastructure and utilities needed for the expansion and worked with DEED on a variety of financing options.

""They needed an overall whole package"" Holmer said of the incentives given to Digi-Key.

And the city and county are also working on other issues that come along with growth.

""Housing definitely is an issue for us regionally and is for Marvin and Arctic Cat and others as well."" Zutz said. ""I think a bigger risk for families is day care right at the moment.""

In Thief River Falls 500-plus children need day-care slots but the community is 100 to 150 short. Digi-Key has tried to create more flexibility in schedules to respond to the need and the community is working on long-term issues.

Holmer a four-term mayor running unopposed this fall for re-election growth at Digi-Key and Arctic Cat also provide an unmet housing demand.

""And with that demand goes investors that come into the community"" he said. During the past four years 600 housing units were added including new multi-unit buildings.

""It's just not enough. We're not putting it up enough fast enough"" Holmer said.

Selling northwestern Minnesota

The fact that Digi-Key plus Polaris in Roseau and Marvin in Warroad are homegrown companies make for a solid economic base.

""Its a unique regional economy that I don't think a lot of Minnesotans know "" Grove said. ""They've heard about brands like Arctic Cat or Polaris or Marvin windows but did they know they are all located in the northwest corner of the state?""

The state needs to support workforce promotion so the companies do not need to slow their growth for lack of available workers.

""Some of these regional groups that are pulling together efforts to market and sell themselves are critical"" Grove said.

Digi-Key is on board.

""We want to be a partner in the region; we don't need to own the region. That has not been a goal at Digi-Key. We want Marvin to be thriving Polaris Arctic Cat all those folks. In fact you know we talk to them often"" Zutz said. ""That's kind of the spirit I think of northwest Minnesota.""

The companies all do things a bit differently because of the remoteness of the region that breeds a certain can-do attitude.

""Growing up in Boston if I couldn't find something at the store I would just assume it never existed"" Digi-Key's Doherty said. ""It is incredible that people here don't count on someone else to build something for them; they build it themselves.""

At Digi-Key that culture started with founder Ron Stordahl 79 someone who has always liked to keep a low profile but still comes in daily. While he does not get involved in the day-to-day operations anymore he ""wants to keep a pulse on the vibe"" Doherty said.

Its Next Generation turboprop will address what Embraer believes will be an explosion in regional air travel over the next 20 years with a design that includes aft-mounted engines for a quieter cabin and better fuel efficiency than its competitors.

While initially aimed at the commercial market the Next Generation remains a good example of how the new breed of turboprop is differentiating itself from the stodgy ultrapractical blade-spinners of old. This new guard is quickly becoming known as luxe and tech-savvy aircraft that can fill the roles of small- to mid-sized jets.

‚ÄúThe turboprop story has been a mix of private and business use‚Äù says Philippe de Segovia director of TBM promotion at Daher which recently released its TBM 960. ‚ÄúWhat we see is rising interest from people who are getting caught in airline delays and cancellations or who don‚Äôt want to be forced into close quarters with others or who need to reach places fast to make appointments without spending too much money.‚Äù

The evolution derives from a generational shift as those under 40 see the market with a greater focus on both convenience and sustainability. ‚ÄúA propeller looks old-fashioned while a jet is cool and more modern‚Äù says de Segovia. ‚ÄúBut the new generation is less concerned with perception and at end of day go for efficiency.‚Äù

At Beechcraft the 90-year-old turboprop manufacturer the movement has led to a reworking of its venerable King Air brand which first took flight in 1964. Christi Tannahill senior vice president of customer experience at Textron Aviation Beechcraft‚Äôs parent points out that recent models such as the King Air 360 and 260 are no longer as utilitarian as previous generations. ‚ÄúThe fit and finish have dramatically improved‚Äù she says noting the upgrades were inspired by luxury SUVs.

That means reshaped cabinetry pull-out worktables USB charging stations and upgraded materials. Details such as illuminated cupholders and pinhole lighting along the sidewalls are the types of touches that wouldn‚Äôt have made their way into turboprops of the past. But now luxe is in. ‚ÄúEverything from the seats to the large windows to the accent lighting and resculpted sidewalls has been reworked to create more space overall‚Äù Tannahill says.

On the tech side Beechcraft has introduced auto-throttle to the cabin as well as digital pressurization that decreases cabin pressure for a more comfortable flight. The 11-seat King Air 360 cruises at 312 knots with an 1806-nautical-mile range while the nine-seat 260 nearly matches those numbers.

While those aren‚Äôt jet speeds de Segovia argues that turboprops have an advantage thanks to less time spent interacting with air traffic control‚Äîplus since they are more efficient at medium altitudes they reach their cruising speeds sooner than jets. ‚ÄúEspecially in congested airspace there‚Äôs often no advantage to flying a jet‚Äù he claims.

Daher‚Äôs single-prop TBM 960 also runs at more than 300 knots while in the cockpit the integrated flight deck includes everything from an auto-landing system to icing detection and protection. The cabin serves up jet-like features including ambient strip lighting integrated into the header and electronically dimmable windows controlled by a ‚Äúpassenger comfort display.‚Äù

And then there are the running costs. De Segovia points to a customer who flies about 500 hours annually: After switching to a turboprop he saved $400000 in operating fees while giving up very little luxury. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no comparison between now and 10 years ago‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTurboprops have amenities for all types of passengers with a lot of ramp appeal.‚Äù",,,,,,

Previous studies have reported the role of PAR 1 in the osteogenic processes demonstrating that its absence is associated with derived bone marrow cells migration impairment an increase in osteoclast colonization enhanced osteoclastogenesis and a decrease in mineralized bone deposition in vivo1416.

On the other hand PAR 1 activation has been largely reported to upregulate bone formation by mediating proliferative responses in osteoblasts51014. Our group has previously demonstrated that PAR 1 activation in PDLSCs is specifically associated with an increase in mineralized nodule deposition higher calcium concentration levels and increased PDLSC proliferation. In addition PAR 1 blockage decreased the calcium deposition suggesting that PAR 1 plays a major role in mineralization and differentiation of PDLSCs17.

In the present study we isolated PDLSCs from three patients characterized the surface marker phenotypes by flow cytometry and purposefully proceeded to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation potential in the cell line that presented a mesenchymal profile (I2). The non-specialized mesenchymal stem cells found in the periodontal ligament tissue such as PDLSCs present pluripotency properties that allow differentiation into several cell types including osteoblasts and cementoblasts. These cells exhibit a phenotype that is compatible with the positive expression of OCT4 STRO-1 CD-44 and CD-146 cell markers1819202122. Further cells with positive expression of STRO-1 were found to be related to periodontal tissue formation and expressed in dental follicle cells in mice2324.

Our results demonstrated a possible correlation between the presence of stemness markers (OCT4 CD146 SOX2 CD-90 STRO-1 CD-44) and PAR 1 prevalence with a higher calcium deposition being found in I2 in the ARS essay although further analysis is needed to confirm this association. At the same time I2 was negative for CD14 CD31 and CD34 corroborating with PDLSCs phenotype present in the literature15.

Vascularization is a key mechanism in the earliest stages of osteogenesis during ectopic bone formation2526 and angiogenesis is pivotal to enabling osteogenesis in vivo27. The absence of vascularization leads to tissue necrosis through hypoxia and nutrients dearth282930. Cell sheets present improved vessel formation capability because the space between the cell layers allows for the formation of capillaries and therefore vascularization in newly transplanted grafts31.

In this study we could identify qualitative histological differences between the groups regarding angiogenesis. The CTRL group exhibited a significant number of white spots suggesting necrotic areas possibly due to a lack of vessel formation (Fig. 4A) especially when compared with the OST and OST + PAR 1 groups (Fig. 4A). These findings could be explained by the absence of ascorbic acid in the CTRL group in which depletion is related to angiogenesis impairment by inhibiting mature type IV collagen formation32. Further the possible vascularization found in the OST group (Fig. 4A) may be explained since the group was at an earlier stage of osteogenesis when compared to the OST + PAR 1 group suggesting that the osteogenesis process may have been ‚Äúaccelerated‚Äù by PAR 1 activation which is also known to play a role in angiogenesis333435 and coagulatory pathways13. These findings corroborate with several studies that demonstrated the pro-angiogenic role of PAR 1 activation mainly through VEGF increased expression333435. Further VEGF has been shown to be an important angiogenic marker on studies evaluating the osteogenic and osteointegration processes on PDLSCs exposed to titanium-derived biomaterials in vitro3637.

In fact the enhanced osteogenic profile found in the OST + PAR 1 group on the histological findings was consistent with the immunohistochemistry and micro-CT results in our study (Fig. 3). Evaluation of bone volume percentage (BV/TV %) through micro-CT displayed significantly higher values in the OST + PAR 1 group when compared to the OST and CTRL groups (Fig. 3B).

In the bone neoformation processes several extracellular molecules produced by differentiating osteogenic cells can be used to identify the stages of bone maturation in vivo38. Integrin 1Œ≤ functions as a modulator facilitating osteoblast attachment spreading adhesion migration and differentiation in osteogenesis via specific alpha(v)beta(3) signaling pathway3940 and is capable of recognizing ligands with RGD-motifs like BSP which works as an osteoblast differentiation marker expressed during initial stages of bone formation4142. Further integrin 1Œ≤ is capable of promoting angiogenesis by mediating human endothelial cell attachment and migration40 and is found to be able to integrate complexes that functions as a receptor to several collagen types43. In this matter PAR 1 activation is intrinsically related to an increase in collagen deposition in fibroblasts4445 and therefore enhancing adhesion when integrin Œ≤1 is present in the substrate4647.

In this study the immunohistochemistry assay results for the OST + PAR 1 group showed a higher protein expression for collagen type I integrin 1Œ≤ and BSP comparing with the other groups evidencing an upregulated expression of important osteogenic immunological markers mediated by the PAR 1 activation.

Finally it is important to highlight some limitations present in this study. First the research included only one donor cell line for the main experiments which substantially reduces the external validity of the in vitro findings. Secondly we found great difficulty in isolating mesenchymal strains from patients and a great difference in the surface markers characterization was found among the isolated cells. Moreover although the flow cytometry data from the Individual 2 isolated cells were positive for a panel of surface and transcriptional factors of stemness further differentiation into other mesenchymal cell types i.e. adipocytes and chondrocytes would be necessary to fully confirm their pluripotency phenotype. Yet the osteoblastic differentiation verified in the present study suggests the therapeutic applicability in bone regeneration for PDLSCs presenting the herein characterized immunophenotyping profile. Finally PAR 1 expression was found to be widely variable limiting the receptor activation associated outcomes for further PAR 1 targeting therapies.

On the other hand the use of cell sheets obtained through the removal of third molars seems to be a feasible option for further clinical therapies since cell sheets present no associated adverse reactions because they can be obtained from and implanted in the same donor. Moreover cell sheets are feasible to be used in regeneration procedures because the preservation of the extracellular matrix provides good structural stability and manageability allowing this tissue engineering strategy to have a promising future as an option in regenerative treatments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLWJvbmstb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1NDAwMzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christopher Bonk Obituary (2022) - New Castle DE - Spicer-Mullikin Funeral Homes & Crematory - New Castle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/christopher-bonk-obituary?id=36540034 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2NocmlzdG9waGVyLWJvbmstb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY1NDAwMzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMzAxOC0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quantitative fragmentomics allow affinity mapping of interactomes,"Synthesis of purified biotinylated and fluorescent peptides used for holdup fluorescence polarization and AP-MS experiments

Peptides for holdup assay systematically incuded a N-terminal biotin covalently added to their N-terminus via a chemical linker. We have previously extensively used biotinylated peptides for binding assays192264. In our experience we never found that the inclusion of a N-terminal linker-biotin moiety significantly altered the structure nor the binding properties of protein-peptide complexes.

HPLC-purified (all >95% purity) biotinylated peptides were chemically synthesized on an ABI 443A synthesizer with standard Fmoc strategy with biotin group attached to the N-terminus via a TTDS (Trioxatridecan-succinamic acid) linker or were commercially purchased from Genicbio (Shanghai China) with biotin group attached to the N-terminus via an Ahx (6-aminohexanoic acid) linker. Predicted peptide masses were confirmed by mass-spectrometry. Peptide concentrations were determined based on their dry weight.

Fluorescent peptides f16E6: fluorescein-RTRRETQL; fRSK1: fluorescein-KLPSTTL and fpRSK1: fluorescein-KLPpSTTL were chemically synthesized on an ABI 443A synthesizer and HPLC purified with fluorescein coupled directly to the N-terminus. The biotinylated MERS-E peptide was FITC labeled (fMERS: biotin-Ahx-DSK(-fluorescein)PPLPPDEWV) as follows: the peptide was mixed with sub-stoichiometric FITC (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA) in a basic HEPES buffer (pH 8.2). Labeling reaction was stopped with 100 mM TRIS and the reaction mixture was buffer exchanged in order to remove fluorescent contaminants. The concentrations of fluorescent peptides and labeled fraction of fMERS were determined based on their dry weight and their fluorescence intensity. For competitive fluorescence polarization assay only HPLC purified peptides were used.

Reagents for crude peptide library synthesis

All solvents and chemicals were used without any further purification and purchased as peptide grade when available. N-methylpyrrolidinone was purchased from Biosolve. Diisopropylcarbodiimide and collidine were purchased from Sigma. The following L-amino acids were used: Fmoc-Ala Fmoc-Arg(pbf)-OH Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH Fmoc-Asp(Otbu)-OH Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH Fmoc-Glu(Otbu)-OH Fmoc-Glu-Otbu Fmoc-Gly-OH Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH Fmoc-Ile-OH Boc-Ile-OH Fmoc-Leu-OH Fmoc-Val-OH Fmoc-Lys(boc)-OH Fmoc-Ser(Otbu)-OH Fmoc-Thr(Otbu)-OH Fmoc-Tyr(Otbu)-OH FmocTrp(Boc)-OH Fmoc-Phe-OH and they were purchased from either Protein Technologies Novabiochem Merck or IRIS Biotech (Germany). Biotin was purchased from Sigma. Fmoc-preloaded resin was used and purchased from Merck Millipore. Fmoc-8-amino-36-dioxaoctanoic acid (Fmoc-Ado-OH) was purchased from Flamma Group Italy.

Crude peptide library synthesis used for holdup experiments

Crude peptide libraries were synthesized by parallel 96 format peptide synthesis using Intavis multipep RSi. Filter plates from NUNC (Thermo-Fischer) were used loaded with 10 mg per well of Fmoc-preloaded polystyrene resins (Merck Millipore). Fmoc-amino acids (Fmoc-AA) as 0.3 M in dimethylformamide (DMF) containing 0.3 M OxymaPure were used. Three consecutive couplings using 100 Œºl Fmoc-AA and 11 Œºl DIC (3 M in DMF) were employed with coupling times of 5 15 and 60 min. Removal of Fmoc was done by washing twice with 120 Œºl of 25% piperidin in DMF for 2 and 8 min. Washing was done by adding 150 Œºl to each well by the 8-pin manifold five times. Coupling of biotin was done as a 0.3 M solution in DMSO containing 0.3 M OxymaPure and activated by DIC. Coupling time was extended to 15 min 45 min and 360 min. TFA cleavage was done by 93% TFA containing 4% triisopropylsilane 1% thioanisol 3% H 2 O for 2 h. The total volume of 1 ml TFA added was added to each well. TFA was reduced in volume to ~150 Œºl followed by precipitation by the addition of diethyl ether. The peptides were transferred to Waters solvinert plates and washed thoroughly five times with diethyl ether. After washing with diethyl ether a small fraction of the peptide slurry was added to a microtiter plate and dried followed by UPLC-MS analysis after solubilization in DMF/H2O (1:1). Analysis of purity and identity by MS was performed using Waters Acquity UPLC system with Waters Acquity TUV detector 214 nm connected to a LCT Premier XE mass spectrometer from Micromass. The buffer used were 0.05% TFA in H2O (buffer A) and 0.05% TFA in acetonitrile (buffer B) using a gradient of 5‚Äì60% B for 3.5 min on a Waters column BEH C18 1.7 mm; 2.1 mm √ó 50 mm and a flow rate of 0.45 ml/min.

All peptides had a biotin group attached to the N-terminus via an Ado-Ado linker. Internal standards used for fluorescent holdup normalization (see below) were re-synthetized as crude peptides. No apparent differences in these internal standards were observed between HPLC purified and crude peptides in holdup experiments. Predicted peptide masses were confirmed by mass-spectrometry in all cases and the purity was found to observably reach >90% in most cases. Average peptide concentrations were determined based on the excess dry weight of the entire 96-well plate and we used 10‚Äì50√ó molar excess (based on dry weight) in holdup experiments to take into account the variability of peptide-to-peptide yields.

Preparation of PDZ library in bacterial lysates for holdup experiments (by LYSC)

The PDZome v2 library consisting of all 266 human PDZ domains as His 6 -MBP-PDZ constructs was prepared as previously described27. We have previously used MBP to facilitate and standardize the production of many recombinant proteins and domains in a folded soluble and active form1947606465. We never found that the presence or absence of MBP significantly altered the structure nor the binding properties of protein-peptide pairs. However it remains statistically possible that the affinities of some particular PDZ-PBM pairs addressed in our screen have been altered by the inclusion of MBP.

The library was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with an autoinduction media and was lysed as described elsewhere in detail27. The His 6 -MBP-PDZ concentrations of soluble cell lysate fractions were evaluated with a microfluidic capillary electrophoretic system (Caliper LabChip GXII PerkinElmer Waltham Massachusetts) and were adjusted to 4 ¬µM by dilutions. Lysozyme and BSA internal standards were added to the library before freezing the library in 96 well plate for the holdup experiment.

Single affinity purified protein expression and purification for holdup experiments (by SAPF)

For single affinity purification the PDZome v2 library was expressed in the same conditions (strain media buffers) than for the bacterial lysate27 but at a bigger culture scale (24 ml per PDZ instead of 6 ml per PDZ). The production (24 ml) and Ni-affinity purification (800 Œºl of beads/PDZ) follow strictly the protocol described in ref. 66. The elution volume of Ni-affinity purification was reduced from 4 ml66 to 2.5 ml/PDZ. 96 PDZ are produced in parallel and are purified in four blocks. At the end of the purifications of these blocks purified PDZs are desalted using Zeba Spin plates (Thermo scientific) in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 300 mM NaCl 10 mM imidazole. The purity and concentration of each His 6 -MBP-PDZ were evaluated with a microfluidic capillary electrophoretic system (Caliper LabChip GXII PerkinElmer Waltham Massachusetts) and adjusted to 4 ¬µM by dilutions before freezing the library in 96-well plate for the holdup experiment.

Double affinity purified protein expression and purification for holdup experiments (by DAPF) and fluorescence polarization assays

For double affinity purification His 6 -MBP-PDZ constructs from the PDZome v2 library27 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with IPTG induction (1 mM IPTG at 25 ¬∞C for 4‚Äì5 h) and harvested cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 150‚Äì300 mM NaCl 2 mM BME complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Basel Switzerland) 1% Triton X-100 and trace amount of DNAse RNAse and Lysozyme. Lysates were frozen at ‚àí20 ¬∞C before further purification steps. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged for clarification. Expressed PDZ-domains were captured on pre-packed Ni-IDA (Protino Ni-IDA Resin Macherey-Nagel Duren Germany) columns were washed with at least ten column volume cold wash buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 2 mM BME) before elution with 250 mM imidazole. The Ni-elution was collected directly on a pre-equilibrated amylose column (amylose high flow resin New England Biolabs Ipswich Massachusetts). Amylose column was washed with five column volume cold wash buffer before fractionated elution in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 1 mM TCEP 10% glycerol 5 mM maltose complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. The concentration of proteins was determined by their UV absorption at 280 nm before aliquots were snap freeze in LN2 and storage at ‚àí80 ¬∞C.

Holdup assay

Principle of the holdup assay and previously published versions

The holdup assay is a comparative chromatographic retention approach devoid of washing steps which in contrast to pull-down assay allows monitoring the steady-state binding equilibrium between one molecular species attached to resin and another one present in solution28. Streptavidin (GE Healthcare Uppsala Sweden) resin is saturated with either biotin (‚Äúcontrol resin‚Äù) or a biotinylated peptide. Then a PDZ-containing solution is added to both resins and the reaction mixture is agitated for 15 min at room temperature. The whole experiment is carried out on filter plates (Millipore Burlington Massachusetts) and the incubation step is stopped with rapid filtration to separate the unbound PDZ fraction. Finally the concentration (a.k.a. intensities) of His 6 -MBP-PDZ is determined and binding intensities (BI) are calculated using Eq. (1):

$$BI=\frac{{I}_{total}-{I}_{depleted}}{{I}_{total}}$$ (1)

where I total is the total intensity (e.g. concentration peak intensity fluorescent signal etc.) of the PDZ present in the flow-through of the biotin-saturated control resin and I depleted is the intensity of PDZ in the flow-through of the peptide-saturated resin. In the holdup buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 300 mM NaCl 1 mM TCEP) at least a single internal standard was used (BSA/lysozyme or fluorescein/mCherry) for peak intensity normalization.

Previously the holdup approach was automatized on liquid handling systems19. In this method a total bacterial lysate over-expressing the His 6 -MBP-PDZ protein was used and the His 6 -MBP-PDZ intensities were measured using capillary electrophoresis. While the ease of use of such a complex matrix is desirable (ease of library preparation crowded environment etc.) the readout is both slow and requires a multi step data-curation as described in details in refs. 2267. To eliminate this bottleneck we also developed an intrinsic fluorescence based holdup method where the concentration measurement is done based on the fluorescence of Trp residues of purified His 6 -MBP-PDZ constructs64. The fluorescent readout is fast and can be done on any fluorescent plate-reader however at a cost of accuracy. Indeed any contaminant present in the holdup mixture such as contaminants from bacterial source or spontaneously cleaved His 6 -MBP will generate a background fluorescence that will decrease the observable partial activity of each PDZ sample. The real partial activity of each sample can be retrieved through calibration with some BI values obtained previously by capillary electrophoresis-based holdup.

New developments increase the throughput and the precision of the holdup method

Automated holdup experiments were originally designed in a way where 96 different PDZ domains were tested against 4 wells on a 384 well filter plate 3 different/identical peptides and a single control. In a reverse holdup layout multiple peptides are tested against the same protein. For example 370 peptides and 14 biotin controls can be placed on a single 384 well filter plate and then tested against a single PDZ. This way not only the number of tested peptides increase but also the number of controls too. In previous holdup experiments the singlicate control for each PDZ caused an under-determined situation where the precision of the determined BI value was mainly determined by the accuracy of the single control measurement. For example if an interaction was reportedly measured in triplicates three peptide-saturated wells were compared with a single control. In the reverse holdup layout many control wells are measured on the same PDZ and therefore the total intensity can be determined at high precision and great accuracy. For example if an interaction was reportedly measured in singlicate each peptide saturated well was compared with 10‚Äì15 controls.

As a minor tweak we also prepared presaturated resin stocks for the reverse layout holdup experiments instead of saturating resins directly on the filter plate. This allowed us to achieve a higher reproducibility by minimizing the well-to-well variability of resin immobilization rates and to prepare multiple plates simultaneously. Stocks were prepared by simply up-scaling the described procedure for a single well (see below). Stocks were stored in holdup buffer and the biotin depletion step (where the nearly peptide/biotin saturated resins are incubated with large excess of biotin to deplete the remaining vacancies in the resin) was only executed after transferring the desired amounts to filter plates.

Due to the extremely slow dissociation rate of the biotin-streptavidin interaction it is possible to recycle the holdup-treated resins in the filter plate several times (at least up to 20-25 times from our personal experience the holdup measurements being highly reproducible at least up to this number). Recycling was carried out in 5 steps. The plates were washed first with ten resin volume 1 M NaCl then with ten resin volume 2 M Urea and finally three times with ten resin volume holdup buffer. All steps in the holdup protocol where the liquid fraction needs to be filtered can be performed either on a vacuum manifold or by centrifugation with the exception of the last washing step before adding the PDZ-solution and the holdup reaction itself which both need to be performed by centrifugation.

By combining the fluorescent readout the reverse holdup layout and the resin recycling not only the throughput of the holdup assay increased by several orders of magnitude but also its precision and accuracy. In addition this optimized protocol does not require any specialized instrument and can be implemented with a simple plate reader a centrifuge and a multichannel pipette. Optimally with the help of a vacuum manifold an electric multichannel pipette (such as an E1-ClipTip pipette from Thermo Fisher Waltham Massachusetts) and a liquid dispensing station (such as a Flexdrop IV from PerkinElmer Waltham Massachusetts) the holdup assay is capable to measure the affinities of 5‚Äì10000 interactions a day at a fraction of the cost of the originally developed automatic setup.

Interaction measurements with holdup experiments

In the present work we include data from three types of holdup measurements: holdup measurement with bacterial lysates coupled with capillary electrophoretic readout (LYSC) holdup measurement with high-throughput single affinity purified PDZ protein coupled with fluorescent readout (SAPF) and holdup measurement with double affinity purified PDZ protein coupled with fluorescent readout (DAPF).

Most LYSC data originate from previous articles19202122266869. Additional LYSC holdup experiments were carried out as previously described using only the original layout. Briefly 2.5 Œºl streptavidin resin was mixed with biotin or biotinylated peptide at 55 ŒºM concentration in 6.5 resin volume for 15 min to achieve resin saturation then after a single washing step (ten resin volume holdup buffer) the resin was depleted with biotin (1 mM biotin 5 resin volume 15 min). Holdup experiments were carried out after three washing steps (ten resin volume holdup buffer). 5 Œºl bacterial lysate with 4 ŒºM His 6 -MBP-PDZ supplemented with 4 ŒºM BSA and 0.05 mg/ml lysozyme was incubated on the filter plate for 15 min with shaking before filtration by centrifugation. Filtrates were analyzed with Caliper Labchip GXII (Perkin Elmer Waltham Massachusetts) and collected data were analyzed with in-house developed algorithms2267. In total our database includes 4475 unique interactions characterized by CALIP method originating from 9920 measurements. We have found that the standard deviation of duplicate experiments (n = 1893) was œÉ = 0.05 BI. We set our binding detection threshold based on this and defined it at 2œÉ (BI = 0.1). Based on this threshold 807 unique interactions showed detectable binding in CALIP holdup experiments.

SAPF experiments were carried out in the original layout. Resin preparation was identical as in LYSC holdup experiments. In each well 2.5 Œºl peptide- or biotin-saturated resin was incubated with 5 Œºl single affinity-purified His 6 -MBP-PDZ at a concentration of 4 ŒºM. His 6 -MBP-PDZ was supplemented with 50 nM fluorescein and 100 nM mCherry. Incubation was carried out on filter plates for 15 min with shaking before filtration. Filtrates were analyzed on a PHERAstar (BMG Labtech Offenburg Germany) microplate reader by using 485 ¬± 10 nm‚Äì528 ¬± 10 nm (fluorescein) 575 ¬± 10 nm‚Äì620 ¬± 10 nm (mCherry) and 295 ¬± 10 nm‚Äì350 ¬± 10 nm (Trp-fluorescence) band-pass filters. In total our database includes 6850 unique interactions characterized by SAPF method all measured in singlicate. Due to the lack of replicates we set the same binding detection threshold that we defined for LYSC experiments (BI ‚â• 0.1). Based on this threshold 1101 unique interactions showed detectable binding in SAPF holdup experiments.

DAPF experiments were carried in the reverse layout with presaturated resins. Resin presaturation was performed with the same volume/concentration ratio as in the resin preparation for the LYSC and SAPF experiments but over a longer period of incubation (2‚Äì4 h). The presaturated resin slurry was supplemented with 20% ethanol for longer-term storage. After distributing 5 Œºl presaturated streptavidin resin on filter plates after a single washing step (10 resin volume holdup buffer) the resin was depleted with biotin (1 mM biotin 5 resin volume 10 min). After two washing steps the resin was incubated with 10 Œºl double affinity-purified His 6 -MBP-PDZ solutions which was supplemented with 50 nM fluorescein and 100 nM mCherry. Fluorescence intensity measurements were performed as described in SAPF experiments. The reverse layout made it possible to include several peptides on the filter plate that was measured previously with Caliper-based holdup methods. In case the reverse layout was used measured BI values were compared to LYSC standards to determine the partial activity of each PDZ sample. Then the determined partial activity was applied in the calculations to normalize the obtained BI values. In total our database includes 59179 unique interactions characterized by DAPF method originating from 62604 measurements. We have found that the standard deviation of duplicate experiments (n = 2780) had an average of 0.029 BI (with a few outliers) and a median of 0.019 BI respectively. Based on these we used œÉ = 0.025 to define our binding detection threshold at 2œÉ (BI = 0.05). Based on this threshold 17726 unique interactions showed detectable binding in DAPF holdup experiments.

Competitive fluorescence polarization (FP) assay

In direct fluorescence polarization assay the fluorophore label can interfere with affinity determination and can cause large experimental bias. For this reason affinities were determined with competitive FP measurements where the bound fluorescent peptide is chased out by increasing concentration of unlabeled competitor. In the fitting procedure affinities of both peptides are considered. Each PDZ-domain was first tested with labeled peptides in direct experiments and then optimal labeled peptides were used in competitive experiments.

Double affinity-purified His 6 -MBP-PDZ were used for affinity measurements by FP. Fluorescence polarization was measured with a PHERAstar microplate reader by using 485 ¬± 20 nm and 528 ¬± 20 nm band-pass filters for excitation and emission respectively. In direct FP measurements a dilution series of the MBP-PDZ was prepared in 96 well plates (96 well skirted PCR plate 4ti-0740 4titude Wotton UK) in a 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 buffer that contained 150 mM NaCl 0.5 mM TCEP 0.01% Tween 20 and 50 nM fluorescently-labeled peptide. The volume of the dilution series was 40 Œºl which was later divided into three technical replicates of 10 Œºl during transferring to 384 well micro-plates (low binding microplate 384 well E18063G5 Greiner Bio-One Kremsm√ºnster Austria). In total the polarization of the probe was measured at eight different protein concentrations (whereas one contained no protein and corresponded to the free peptide). In competitive FP measurements the same buffer was supplemented with the protein to achieve a complex formation of 60-80% based on the direct titration. Then this mixture was used for preparing a dilution series of the competitor (i.e. the studied peptides) and the measurement was carried out identically as in the direct experiment. Analysis of FP experiments were carried out using ProFit an in-house developed Python-based fitting program70. The dissociation constants of the direct and competitive FP experiments were obtained by fitting the measured direct data with a quadratic binding equation first and by fitting the measured competitive data with a competitive equation using several obtained parameters from the first fit71. In part competitive fluorescence polarization data were taken from refs. 2221. In total 395 unique interactions were characterized by competitive FP in our database.

Conversion of holdup binding intensities to dissociation constants

In the holdup measurements we measure steady-state binding intensities that can be converted to steady-state dissociation constants using Eq. 2:

$${K}_{d}=\frac{([PDZ]-BI*[PDZ])*([PBM]-BI*[PDZ])}{BI*[PDZ]}$$ (2)

where [PDZ] is the total PDZ concentration (set to 4 ¬µM in usual cases in our assays) and [PBM] is the total peptide concentration. This later parameter is unknown which makes a direct and accurate conversion impossible. To find the missing peptide concentration we use orthogonal affinity measurements2122. We determine the dissociation constants by competitive FP of a set of interactions that are also measured by holdup. Then we substitute the measured BI and K d values into Eq. (2) and calculate the corresponding [PBM] concentration. Finally we take the median of all calculated concentrations (3‚Äì10 concentrations depending on peptide) for a given peptide to determine an average parameter that can be used for the conversion of all measured BI values of the same peptide. We have found that in most cases the peptide concentration lied between 10‚Äì40 ¬µM with an average peptide concentration of 18 ¬µM. Only ~39 peptides were characterized by FP out of the >450 measured by holdup. For peptides that were not characterized by FP we used this average peptide concentration for conversion.

When we perform the conversion from BI to K d  the binding detection threshold of the holdup measurements dictates the threshold for the quantification of the K d values in the affinity scale. As a consequence of the peptide concentration and BI detection threshold variability PDZome-binding profiles of each PBM have a slightly different K d quantification threshold in affinity scale. In the least sensitive experiment the K d quantification threshold was found to be only 30 ¬µM and it was at 790 ¬µM in the most sensitive experiment. On average the quantification threshold was around K d = 320 ¬µM.

In our database converted affinities are shown as pK d values where pK d is defined as the negative 10-base logarithm of the dissociation constant. Therefore pK d values are closely related to the change in Gibbs free energy upon binding. Due to the different detection thresholds of the different holdup experiments as well as the different peptide concentrations in each assay we do not merge together the affinities determined by different holdup methods. Instead we provide each determined affinities separately for all measured holdup assays as well as a ‚Äúcomposite affinity‚Äù for each interaction which is taken from the most reliable holdup method.

The uncertainty of determined pKd values can be estimated in at least two different ways either using the measured or propagated uncertainty of BI values or by measuring the pKd variability between the holdup and the FP experiments. Standard deviation of BI values is provided in our database in case more than one experiment was performed. In case of singlicate experiments one can propagate the errors that we observed in the same kind of experiments when duplicates were measured (œÉ = 0.05 for LYSC/SAPF and œÉ = 0.025 for DAPF experiments). This standard deviation of BI values can be used to propagate the error into the determined pKd value. However an accurate error propagation model needs to include both the variability of the BI values and the peptide concentration and the latter is difficult to assess based on current data. Alternatively it is possible to do error estimation based on pKd values determined by FP. Note that we use the FP dataset for the determination of the peptide concentration therefore the two datasets are globally centered. However each peptide concentration is determined from multiple holdup-FP experiment pairs and therefore the variance of individual pairs can be still measured. The difference between the orthogonal pKd values derived from FP and holdup measurements follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.227 pKd. If we assume that neither of these methods perform systematically better than the other we can use this standard deviation as a global metrics of the uncertainty of determined pKd values in our database. For example one can also use it to estimate the confidence of an affinity difference using the following empirical rule: >0.227 pKd difference indicates ~68.3% confidence (1 œÉ) >0.454 pKd difference indicates ~95.5% confidence (2 œÉ) and >0.681 pKd difference indicates a 99.7% confidence (3 œÉ). However this does not mean that only >0.454 pKd differences should be considered as reliable in our database. One needs to assess the uncertainty of each studied measurement in several ways (e.g. by comparing different holdup measurements or the ways of affinity conversion) in order to make objective judgment on data quality.

Profaff database

To aid the access to our affinity measurements we established a PHP- and MySQL-based online database that is accessible at the https://profaff.igbmc.science/ address. On the database one can browse the affinity profiles of PDZ-domains and PBMs by searching based on gene ID motif sequence or consensus motif. It is possible to access all additional information of each interaction such as measured BI values details of normalization and conversion or even the competitive titrations of FP measurements. In addition for each PDZ-domains where we detected binders above a certain (adjustable) binding threshold we provide affinity-weighted frequency plots based on the sequences of all detected binders where the weights are calculated based on Eq. (3):

$$weight={10}^{p{K}_{d}-bindingthreshold}$$ (3)

Finally the ProfAff database is built so that it can include any holdup measurements done on other types of domain-motif interaction. For example in the actual version it also includes measured affinities from some of our previous works: of 14-3-3 proteins with a few phosphopeptides (phosphorylated PBMs)60 and of HPV E6 proteins with host LxxLL motifs (Bonhoure A. et al manuscript in preparation). All these sub-databases are interconnected therefore it is possible to see whether a PBM is also targeted by 14-3-3 domains or if a protein also contains an LxxLL site. The code of the database is uploaded to GitHub at https://github.com/GoglG/ProfAff (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6820648). We hope that the ProfAff database will serve as a proof of concept database for the community and will set a new trend for future interactomic databases.

Quantitative reference interactome

A non-exhaustive collection of previously published PDZ-PBM affinities used as an external benchmark was generated as follows. We started from the database published by Amacher et al.29 which makes an inventory of different PDZ-PBM affinities published up to 2007. To complete this list articles were collected from PubMed using the keywords ‚ÄúPDZ[Title] AND interaction‚Äù (April 2021). If an affinity measurement was performed the nature of the PDZ and the PBM interacting along with their Uniprot codes the method used for measuring the interaction the eventual modification to the PBM peptide necessary for the measurement (i.e. fluorophore biotin etc) and the measured K d along with the standard deviation of the measurement (when available) were collected. The same information was collected for the affinities reviewed in Amacher et al. The following data were excluded during collection or from the data reviewed in Amacher et al.: (i) data concerning full-length proteins or PDZ domains in tandem as opposed to isolated PDZ domains; (ii) data concerning PBM variants (mutations or post-traductional modifications) or artificial PBM sequences (i.e. generated by phage-display); (iii) data for which the length or the sequence of the PBM was not available. The resulting database comprises 1547 K d measurements extracted from 132 publications and measured between 142 different PDZ domains some of them of different origins (human mouse rat and/or vinegar fly) and 280 different PBM motifs from all classes including 12 internal PBM. For a complete list of this reference interactome as well as references for each interaction see Supplementary Data 1.

For interaction matching we used only affinities from human mouse and rat PDZ-domains. PDZ-domain boundaries were not assessed during data collection. In addition the database contains PBMs with lengths between 4 and >100 residues but only affinities from 8-12mer peptides were used for interaction matching. Interaction matching was performed based on corresponding 10mer PBM sequences (i.e. exact extended or truncated) and PDZ-domain names. In total we have found 362 matching affinities between our measurements and this filtered benchmark dataset where the affinities showed a PCC of 0.59 (see Fig. 2B).

Estimating PPI affinities and matching with a qualitative reference interactome

We used the previously generated domain-motif interactome consisting of the composite affinities (i.e. taken from the most reliable holdup method; see above) to estimate affinities of PPIs. We assumed that a multidomain PDZ-protein can only interact with a single PBM at the same time (Eq. (4)):

$$PDZ+PBM \rightleftharpoons {(PDZ-PBM)}_{site1}{{{{{\rm{or}}}}}}{(PDZ-PBM)}_{site2}{{{{{\rm{or}}}}}}{(PDZ-PBM)}_{siten}$$ (4)

Using this approximation as proposed by others before45 the association constant of a multi-site interaction is the sum of the association constants of all sites (Eq. (5)):

$${K}_{aadditive}=\frac{{[PDZ-PBM]}_{site1}+{[PDZ-PBM]}_{site2}+\ldots+{[PDZ-PBM]}_{siten}}{[PDZ]\times [PBM]}=\sum {K}_{asite}$$ (5)

This calculation does not imply neither positive nor negative cooperation between interaction sites. In addition we do not take into account the formation of higher order multivalent complexes that may form especially at higher concentrations. The contribution of unmeasurable weak interactions was also neglected in the calculations. Although for these reasons our calculation is inherently imperfect it readily provides a lower limit for the affinity of the ‚Äúfull-length complexes‚Äù since most of these neglected effects would in principle increase the global affinity. Most importantly this simple calculation can be done without any a priori knowledge about the synergistic nature of each multi-domain-proteins.

To collect previously observed qualitatively reported binding events between PDZ and PBM proteins we analyzed the Biogrid (4.4.199 version) Intact (2020_10_01 version) and Bioplex (Dec_2019 version both 293T and HCT116 datasets) databases33031. We performed the search within the interactomic space that we experimentally studied using the holdup method. To find instances of reported interactions we looked for co-occurrence of the IDs of PDZ- and PBM-proteins within single entries. In case the PBM originated from a PDZ-protein this algorithm identifies it as an observed interaction. Thus any potential self-binding was manually checked in all databases. In total we have identified 1233 629 152 and 56 observed interactions from the Biogrid Intact Bioplex (293T) and Bioplex (HCT116) databases. In total our qualitative benchmark interactome includes 1654 unique interactions observed between the 150 PDZ-proteins and the 448 PBM-proteins. Out of these 1248 interactions were tested in our assays and we could match quantifiable affinities to 725 interactions.

Hierarchical clustering of the human PDZ-PBM interactome

To cluster the PDZ-PBM domain-motif interactome based on their interactomic properties we used unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) clustering based on the Euclidean distance in pK d scale. Note that pK d values are closely related to binding energies (Eq. 6):

$$p{K}_{d}=-{\log }_{10}{K}_{d}=\frac{-\Delta G}{2.303\times RT}$$ (6)

Note that the Euclidean distance of one affinity in pK d scale equals to ŒîŒîG/2.303*RT therefore the Euclidean distance of two binding profile equals to the sum of all ŒîŒîG/2.303*RT values. Clustering of both PBMs and PDZ domains were performed based on a near-complete part of the interactome consisting of composite affinities covering 448 PBMs and 133 PDZ-domains. First we thresholded our interactome at 3.5 pK d  thus removing the very small number of interactions that we managed to quantified at an even weaker threshold. Then we replaced these and all the unmeasureable weak affinities with 3.5 pK d . Within this interactomic space the affinities of a few unmeasured interactions (n < 5) were estimated based on a kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) approach. First a PBM clustering was performed by omitting the affected PDZ-domains. Based on this the two nearest neighbors in the interactomic space was determined and the missing affinity was replaced by the average of their affinities with the same domain.

Crystallization

For crystallization PDZ domains were cloned with an N-terminal TEV protease cleavable His 6 tag and a C-terminal ANXA2 (Annexin A2) tag727374. His 6 -PDZ-ANXA2 constructs were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) with IPTG induction (1 mM IPTG at 18 ¬∞C for overnight expression) and harvested cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 150-300 mM NaCl 2 mM BME complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Basel Switzerland) 1% Triton X-100 and trace amount of DNAse RNAse and Lysozyme. Lysates were frozen at ‚àí20 ¬∞C before further purification steps. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged for clarification. Expressed PDZ-domains were captured on pre-packed Ni-IDA (Protino Ni-IDA Resin Macherey-Nagel Duren Germany) columns were washed with at least 10 column volume cold wash buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 2 mM BME) before elution with 250 mM imidazole. The Ni-elution was cleaved with TEV protease and the PDZ-ANXA2 was purified by cation exchange on a HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare Chicago Illinois). Proteins were aliquoted at 5‚Äì7 mg/ml concentration before flash freezing in LN2. Samples were supplemented with 5‚Äì6 molar excess of selected PBM peptides and 2 mM CaCl 2 before crystallization.

Crystallization conditions were screened using commercially available (Qiagen Hampton Research Emerald Biosystems) and in-house developed kits by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method in 96-well MRC 2-drop plates (SWISSCI Neuheim Switzerland) using a Mosquito robot (TTP Labtech Cambridge UK). Crystals of MAGI1_2 in complex with the PBM of HPV35 E6 grew rapidly in a drop made from 5 ¬µl of protein solution and 5 ¬µl of reservoir solution containing 20‚Äì25% polyethylene glycol 3000 100 mM sodium citrate buffered at pH 5.5 and 100 mM trisodium-citrate at 20 ¬∞C. Crystals of SNTB1 in complex with the PBM of HPV35 E6 grew rapidly in a drop made from 2 ¬µl of protein solution and 2 ¬µl of reservoir solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 200 mM sodium malonate buffered at pH 7.0 at 20 ¬∞C. Crystals of SYNJ2BP in complex with RPS6KA1_‚àí3P were grown in a drop containing 100 mM ammonium sulfate 100 mM sodium formate 25% PEG smear broad (Molecular Dimensions Sheffield UK) and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5 at 20 ¬∞C. Crystals of SYNJ2BP in complex with HTLV1 Tax1 were grown in the F10 condition (120 mM Monosaccharides 100 mM Buffer System 3 pH 8.5 50% Precipitant Mix 2) of the MORPHEUS screen at 20 ¬∞C. Crystals of SNX27 in complex with the PBM of MERS-E grew rapidly in a drop made from 2 ¬µl of protein solution and 2 ¬µl of reservoir solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 100 mM imidazole buffered at pH 8.0 at 20 ¬∞C. All crystals were flash-cooled in a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Synchrotron Swiss Light Source (Switzerland) on the X06DA (PXIII) beamline or at SOLEIL (France) on the PX2-A beamline. All data were processed with the program XDS75 and the phase problem was solved by molecular replacement76 based on the previously determined crystal structures of MAGI1_2-ANXA2 complex (PDB ID 5N7D) and the structures of the PDZ domains of SNTB2 SYNJ2BP and SNX27 (2VRF 2JIK 6SAK) using Phaser and structure refinement was carried out with PHENIX77. TLS refinement was applied during the refinement. The crystallographic parameters and the statistics of data collection and refinement are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The refined model and the structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the PDB with the accession codes 7P70 7P71 7P72 7P73 and 7P74.

Cell cultures and lysate preparation for proteomic analyses

HEK293T and HeLa cells were authenticated and found 100% identity to ATCC cat. CRL-3216 and ATCC cat. CCL-2 respectively. Jurkat and HaCat cell lines were not authenticated (original source: ECACC and Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum DKFZ respectively). HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (1 g/L glucose Gibco) medium completed with 5% FCS and 40 Œºg/mL gentamicin diluted every 3rd/4th day 1/10. HaCat cells were grown in DMEM (1 g/L glucose Gibco) medium completed with 10% FCS and 40 Œºg/mL gentamicin diluted every 3rd/4th day 1/4. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI (Gibco) medium completed with 10% FCS and 40 Œºg/mL gentamicin diluted every 3rd/4th day 1/12. All cells were kept at 37 ¬∞C and 5% CO 2 . For proteomics analyses cells were seeded on T-175 flasks. After they reached confluency adherent cells were washed with PBS once and collected by scraping with ice-cold lysis buffer (Hepes-KOH pH 7.5 50 mM NaCl 150 mM Triton X-100 1% complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail 1√ó EDTA 2 mM TCEP 5 mM glycerol 10%). Jurkat cells were collected by 1000 g √ó centrifugation washed once with PBS then collected by 1000 g √ó 5 min centrifugation again and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer. Lysates were sonicated 4 √ó 20 s with 1 s long pulses on ice then incubated rotating at 4 ¬∞C for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm 4 ¬∞C for 20 min and supernatant was kept for further analysis. Concentration determination was carried out by standard Bradford method (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent #5000006) using BSA (MP BIomedicals #160069) as control on a Bio-Rad SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer instrument.

Sample preparation for affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) experiments

For PDZ-AP-MS experiments PDZ domains were cloned as His 6 -AviTag-MBP-PDZ constructs. For co-expression with BirA E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were co-transformed with His 6 -AviTag-MBP or His 6 -AviTag-MBP-PDZ-coding and PET21a-BirA (Addgene #20857) plasmids78. Simultaneously to IPTG induction 50 ¬µM biotin was added to the media. After cell harvesting the lysis buffer was also supplemented with 50 ¬µM biotin. Otherwise expression and double affinity purification was identical as previously described in details. Biotinylation efficiency was found to be around 60%.

For PBM-AP-MS experiments 30 Œºl streptavidin resin was mixed with biotin or peptide at 50‚Äì60 ŒºM concentration in 6‚Äì6.5 resin volume for 60 min to achieve resin saturation. For PDZ-AP-MS experiments 30 Œºl streptavidin resin was mixed with biotinylated MBP or MBP-PDZ at 40-50 ŒºM concentration in >1000√ó resin volume for 60 min to achieve resin saturation. After saturation resins were washed a single time (ten resin volume holdup buffer) and were depleted with biotin (1 mM biotin 5‚Äì10 resin volume 10 min). Finally resins were washed two times. 0.5 ml 2 mg/ml cell lysate was added to the dry resin (1 mg total input) and were incubated at 4 ¬∞C for 2 h. Then the beads were washed three times with 10 resin volume buffer containing: 50 mM TRIS pH 8.5 150 mM NaCl 1% TritonX-100 10√ó complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail 2 mM EDTA 1 mM TCEP. Then the beads were washed two times with ten resin volume buffer containing: 50 mM TRIS pH 8.5 150 mM NaCl 1 mM TCEP. Finally captured protein was eluted from the resin in two steps and the eluted fractions were pooled. For each elution the beads were incubated for 30 min with three resin volume buffer containing: 20 mM TRIS pH8.5 100 mM NaCl 500 ŒºM TCEP 8 M Urea. Between each step the beads were separated by mild centrifugation and the supernatant was removed by gentle pipetting.

Reagents for mass spectrometry

Acetonitrile MS grade formic acid trifluoroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid iodoacetamide urea tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) 2-carboxyethy-phosphine from Sigma Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier France) trypsin from Promega (Charbonnieres les Bains France) lysyl endopeptidase from Wako (Richmond USA)

Sample digestion for mass spectrometry

The samples were precipitated with TCA 20% overnight at 4 ¬∞C and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C. The protein pellets were washed twice with 1 mL cold acetone and air dried. The protein extracts were solubilized in urea 8 M reduced with 5 mM TCEP for 30 min and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Double digestion was performed at 37 ¬∞C with 500 ng endoproteinase Lys-C for 4 h followed by fourfold dilution and an overnight digestion with 500 ng trypsin. Peptide mixtures were then desalted on C18 spin-column and dried on Speed-Vacuum.

LC-MS/MS analysis

Samples were analyzed using an Ultimate 3000 nano-RSLC (Thermo Scientific San Jose California) coupled in line with a LTQ-Orbitrap ELITE mass spectrometer via a nano-electrospray ionization source (Thermo Scientific San Jose California). Peptide mixtures were injected in 0.1% TFA on a C18 Acclaim PepMap100 trap-column (75 ¬µm ID √ó 2 cm 3 ¬µm 100 √Ö Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3 min at 5 ¬µL/min with 2% ACN 0.1% FA in H 2 O and then separated on a C18 Accucore nano-column (75 ¬µm ID √ó 50 cm 2.6 ¬µm 150 √Ö Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 220 nl/min and 38 ¬∞C with a 90 min linear gradient from 5% to 30% buffer B (A: 0.1% FA in H 2 O/B: 99% ACN 0.1% FA in H 2 O) regeneration at 5% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode in data-dependent mode with survey scans from m/z 350‚Äì1500 acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120000 at m/z 400. The 20 most intense peaks from survey scans were selected for further fragmentation in the Linear Ion Trap with an isolation window of 2.0 Da and were fragmented by CID with normalized collision energy of 35%. (TOP20CID method) Unassigned and single charged states were excluded from fragmentation. The Ion Target Value for the survey scans (in the Orbitrap) and the MS2 mode (in the Linear Ion Trap) were set to 1E6 and 5E3 respectively and the maximum injection time was set to 100 ms for both scan modes. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s after one repeat count with mass width at ¬±10 ppm.

Mass spectrometry data analysis

Proteins were identified by database searching using SequestHT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (PD2.4 Thermo Fisher Scientific) on human FASTA database downloaded from SwissProt (reviewed release 2020_11_27 20304 entries https://www.uniprot.org/). Precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set at 7 ppm and 0.6 Da respectively and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Oxidation (M +15.995 Da) was set as variable modification and Carbamidomethylation (C +57.021 Da) as fixed modification. Peptides and proteins were filtered with a false discovery rate at 1%. Label-free quantification was based on the extracted ion chromatography intensity of the peptides. All samples were measured in technical triplicates. The measured extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) intensities were normalized based on median intensities of the entire dataset to correct minor loading differences. For statistical tests and enrichment calculations not detectable intensity values were treated with an imputation method where the missing values were replaced by random values similar to the 10% of the lowest intensity values present in the entire dataset. Unpaired two-tailed T-test assuming equal variance were performed on obtained log 2 XIC intensities. The detection threshold for enriched proteins in AP-MS experiments were analyzed above twofold enrichment with <0.01 P value. Then proteins with PDZ-domains or PBMs were extracted from the list of enriched proteins. In case only a specific isoform of the detected protein contains a PBM the identified peptide fragments were manually checked to check which isoform(s) were most likely detected. All raw LC-MS/MS data (from 165 runs) have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange via the PRIDE database with identifier PXD027743.

Generation of HEK293T stable cell lines

The p10-IRES2-EGFP vector was generated previously79. We inserted the wild-type and C-terminal 10 amino acid-deleted (E6ŒîPBM) versions of HPV16 E6 in MCS between the IR-DRs by standard restriction enzyme based cloning. Sleeping Beauty transposase containing pSB100 vector (Addgene #34879) was a kind gift of Dr. Zsuzsanna Izsvak (MDC Berlin Germany) and Dr. Tamas I. Orban (RCNS Budapest Hungary)80.

HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM (1 g/L glucose Gibco) medium completed with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin‚Äìstreptomycin diluted every 3rd/4th day 1/10 and were kept at 37 ¬∞C and 5% CO 2 . Stable cells were generated as described previously79. Briefly we co-transfected the cells with 2 Œºg p10 and 0.2 Œºg pSB100 (10/1 ratio) vectors on six-well plates using jetPRIME (Polyplus #114-15) reagent as recommended by manufacturer. 3 days after transfection cells were trypsinized and sorted for EGFP positive cells on a BD FACS Aria III equipment. Two weeks after the first sort stable cells were selected by sorting again for EGFP positive cells. Relative copy number of transposon casettes integrated into the genome were determined by qPCR (Supplementary Fig 4C). We do not find significant difference in the copy numbers between E6 and E6ŒîPBM expressing cells however they both contained ~3-times less copy compared to the control cells. Despite this copy number difference we do not observe difference in GFP expression in these cells by western blot which indicates that the expression of GFP from the empty IRES vector is less efficient compared to the vector that also contains E6 or E6ŒîPBM before the IRES sequence. Lysates were prepared for proteomics analyses and western blot as described above and below respectively.

gDNA isolation and relative copy number determination

gDNA was isolated with standard SDS lysis-isopropanol precipitation method. Relative copy numbers were determined by qPCR with SybrGreen reagent (Quiagen QuantiTect #204143) on a Roche Lightcycler 480 II equipment by using previously described method and primers81 recognizing the GFP and the IR-DR left arm (part of the transposon casette) sequence. The Ct values were normalized to RPPH1 gene using standard ŒîŒîCt method.

RT-PCR

Cells were plated on 6-well plates. When they reached confluency RNA was isolated by using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (#74104). On-column DNase digestion was done by using Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set (#79254). 2 Œºg total RNA per sample was transcribed to cDNA by using SuperScript IV kit (Invitrogen #18091050) with random hexamer primers (Thermo Fisher #SO142) according to standard protocol. For qPCR primers were designed with the help of Primer Blast (NCBI NIH https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) choosing primers which recognize all common alternative transcripts of the given gene (Supplementary Fig 4). qPCR was done by using QuantiTect SyberGreen (Qiagen #204143) and LightCycler II equipment (Roche). Standard ŒîŒîCt method was used to determine relative quantity to GAPDH. For further analyses GraphPad Prism 7 software was used.

Western blot

Cells were directly lysed in 4√ó Laemmli buffer (120 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 8% SDS 100 mM DTT 32% glycerol 0.004% bromphenol blue 1% Œ≤-mercaptoethanol). Equal amounts of samples were loaded on 8% 10% or 12% acrylamide-gels. Transfer was done into PVDF membranes using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System and Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Transfer Kit (BioRad #1704273). After 1 h of blocking in 5% milk membranes were incubated overnight 4 ¬∞C in primary antibody in 5% milk. The following antibodies and concentrations were used: anti-GAPDH (Merck #MAB374) 1/5000 anti-HPV16 E6 (IGBMC polyclonal recognizing the N-terminus of the protein) 1/1000 anti-GFP (IGBMC polyclonal) 1/5000 anti-p53 (CST clone 7F5 #2527) 1/1000 anti-E6AP (Sigma clone 3E5 #SAB1404508-100UG) 1/1000 anti-SCRIB (Thermo Fisher #PA5-54821) 1/1000 anti-MAGI1 (Santa Cruz #sc-100326) 1/1000 anti-SAP97/DLG1 (Thermo Fisher #PA1-741) 1/1000 anti-SNX27 (Thermo Fisher #MA5-27854) 1/500 anti- PDZK1/NHERF3 (Santa Cruz #sc-100337) 1/1000.

Three BD patients who met the ICD-10 criteria of bipolar disorders in a Chinese family including the grandfather the father and the daughter were diagnosed by two senior psychiatrists and treated at Xiamen City Xianyue Hospital (Fig. 1). Other family members recruited in this study including the mother the uncle and the grandmother were reportedly healthy. Details of the clinical features of the three affected members used in this study are compiled in Supplementary Table 1. Moreover 182 sporadic BD patients and 146 healthy controls were recruited and tested for GOLGB1 mutations. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Xiamen City Xianyue Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from participants.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS)

WGS was carried out at Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing China). Briefly genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and fragmented to an average size of ~350 bp. DNA library was created using established Illumina paired-end protocols and subjected to WGS using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina Inc. San Diego CA USA) to generate 150-bp paired-end reads with a minimum coverage of 10√ó for ~98.5% of the genome (average sequencing depth over 30√ó).

WGS data analysis

After sequencing raw reads were filtered by in-house quality control software to remove low-quality reads. Clean reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hs37d5) using the Burrows‚ÄìWheeler Aligner [31] and duplicate reads were marked using sambamba tools [32].

SNVs and INDELs were called with samtools to generate gVCF [33]. The raw calls of SNVs and INDELs were further filtered with the following inclusion thresholds: (1) read depth >4; (2) root mean square mapping quality of covering reads >30; and (3) the variant quality score >20.

Annotation was performed using ANNOVAR (2017June8) [34]. Annotations included minor allele frequencies from public control data sets as well as deleteriousness and conservation scores enabling further filtering and assessment of the likely pathogenicity of variations.

To filter rare variations we first selected variations with a MAF less than 0.01 in 1000 genomic data (1000g_all) [35] esp6500siv2_all [9] gnomAD data (gnomAD_ALL and gnomAD_EAS) [10] and in-house Novo-Zhonghua exome database from Novogene. After discarding synonymous SNVs and small fragment nonframeshift (<10 bp) INDELs in the repeat region defined by RepeatMasker we analyzed only nonsynonymous SNVs and INDELs occurring in exons or splice sites (splicing junction 10 bp). Variations were screened according to scores of SIFT [36] Polyphen [37] MutationTaster [38] and CADD [39] softwares. Potentially deleterious variations were reserved if the scores of more than half of these four softwares support the harmfulness of variations [40]. To better predict the harmfulness of variation the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification system was also used which classifies variations into pathogenic likely pathogenic uncertain significance likely benign and benign [41].

To identify loci linked to BD we performed an independent genome-wide scan for linkage in this family. This linkage analysis using merlin tools and the Perl combined with the family high throughput sequencing data and the HapMap database of Chinese population (CHB) allele frequency using the known SNP as a marker linkage analysis to get the chain candidate area.

The relationship between proband and parents was estimated using the pairwise identity-by-descent (IBD) calculation in PLINK [42]. The IBD sharing between the proband and parents in all trios is between 45 and 55%.

Given the inheritance pattern of the pedigree dominant genetic modifiers seem to be responsible for disease pathogenesis in this family. Therefore from filtered rare variations we identified variations that were heterozygous in all three patients but not mutated in unaffected family members as candidate causal variations.

GOLGB1 sequencing

Genomic DNAs were extracted from BD patients and controls and used as PCR templates to amplify exons 9 and 15 of the GOLGB1 gene (NM_004487). Primer pairs used were: Exon9_forward (5‚Ä≤-AGAAGGGCTTTCTCTCTAGCATA-3‚Ä≤) and Exon9_reverse (5‚Ä≤-TGGTTCAATTGGTTTGAGTACAGAT-3‚Ä≤) and Exon15_forward (5‚Ä≤-GGAAGAAACTGGGTGAAGGGTA-3‚Ä≤) and Exon15_reverse (5‚Ä≤-GTGGACTGTTAGGTGCTGGTTTC-3‚Ä≤). PCR products were then subjected to Sanger sequencing.

Mice

C57BL/6J wild-type mice were housed under Specific-Pathogen-Free conditions at Xiamen University Laboratory Animal Center. Mice were kept on an 8:00‚Äì20:00 light/dark cycle with free access to phytoestrogen-free chow and water. Animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Xiamen University.

Mouse primary neuron culture

Primary neurons were derived from postnatal day 0 (P0) mouse brains as described previously [43]. Briefly hippocampal and cortical tissues were removed from the P0 mouse brain and then dissociated with 0.25% trypsin and DNase I (0.2 kU/mL Worthington) at 37 ¬∞C for 15 min. Neurons were cultured in a neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection

AAV2/9 (serotype 2/9) viruses carrying mouse Golgb1 shRNAs or scrambled control shRNA were packaged by OBIO Technology (Shanghai China). There were three Golgb1 shRNAs used: shGOLGB1 #1: 5‚Ä≤-GAGGAGAAAGCTGGAGGAA-3‚Ä≤ shGOLGB1 #2: 5‚Ä≤-ACTGCCATGGAATCGAATAAT-3‚Ä≤ and shGOLGB1 #3: 5‚Ä≤-GTTTCACGGGTCACCTATAAA-3‚Ä≤. The scrambled control shRNA sequence is: 5‚Ä≤-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG-3‚Ä≤. Cultured mouse primary neurons were infected with AAV for 3 days in vitro (DIV) and analyzed at 10 DIV.

For in vivo injection one microliter of AAV containing shGOLGB1 #2 or scrambled control shRNA (5 √ó 1012 V.G./ml) was slowly injected into lateral ventricles (2 mm distance from ventral to skin and 2/5 from lambda suture to the eye) of P0 C57BL/6J mice under hypothermic anesthesia. After injection mice were put on a warming pad for body temperature recovery.

Animal behavioral tests

Treated mice at 2 months of age including ten female and nine male mice injected with AAVs expressing scrambled control shRNA and 13 female and 14 male mice injected with AAVs expressing shGOLGB1 #2 were subjected to various behavioral tests. All behavioral analyses were carried out in a double-blinded manner. Habituation was done in the testing room for more than 30 min at the beginning of each test day. All tests were carried out by researchers blinded to mouse genotype. Data were recorded and analyzed using the Smart 3.0 video tracking system (Panlab Harvard Apparatus). Procedures for the open field test the tail suspension test the elevated plus-maze test the three-chamber social interaction test the Y-maze test and the novel object recognition test were reported previously [43 44]. Procedures for other behavioral tests were as the following.

For the two-bottle choice sucrose preference test mice were first acclimatized to two identical bottles one filled with water and the other one filled with water containing 1% sucrose for 36 h. Mice were then fasted overnight without food and water for 12 h. After fasting mice were presented with water and 1% sucrose again. The two bottles were weighed and exchanged positions every 12 h three times. Sucrose preference was determined as the ratio of total sucrose to water consumption.

For the forced swim test mice were placed in the water with a temperature of 25 ¬∞C in a cylinder (21 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height) for 7 min. Total immobility duration during the last 6 min was recorded for comparison.

The dark/light box consisted of one black/dark (15 cm3 √ó 20 cm3 √ó 25 cm3) and one light (30 cm3 √ó 20 cm3 √ó 25 cm3) plexiglass compartment that were connected by a tunnel. Mice were placed into the light box and allowed to move freely for 10 min. The time spent in the light box and the number of entries into the light box were recorded for comparison.

Elevated O-maze consisted of an elevated circular platform with two opposite quadrants enclosed and two open. Animals were placed in the center of one open arm and let explore open and closed arms for 5 min. The time spent in open arms and numbers of open arm entries were analyzed.

Western blot

Samples were lysed in TEN buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 150 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA and 1% NP-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (BCA Protein Assay Kit Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PVDF membrane transfer. Proteins were identified by incubating with indicated primary antibodies and then with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein band intensities were determined using the Image J software [45]. Antibodies used were: anti-GAPDH (Abways ab0037) anti-PSD93 (Abcam ab151721) anti-PSD95 (Cell Signaling Technology 3450 S) anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology 9272 S) anti-phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling Technology 9271 S) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific 31430 and 31460).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)

Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). After reverse-transcription using Superscript III transcriptase (Invitrogen) samples were analyzed on a LightCycler¬Æ 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Applied Science Basel Switzerland). PCR primers used are the following:

mGOLGB1-F 5‚Ä≤-GCCTTCACTAAGAGCATGTCAT-3‚Ä≤;

mGOLGB1-R 5‚Ä≤-GCTGATCCTTTAGAGCAATGCAG-3‚Ä≤;

Immunostaining

Brain samples of mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde sequentially dehydrated in 20 25 and 30% sucrose solution frozen in OCT compound and then prepared as 15-Œºm slices. Slices were incubated with indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 ¬∞C followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescence and DAPI for 60 min at room temperature. The fluorescence microscope images were acquired by an A1R (Nikon) confocal microscope. Antibodies used were: anti-NeuN (Cell Signaling Technology 94403 S) anti-GFAP (Proteintech 16825-1-AP) anti-Iba1 (Wako 019‚Äì19741) and Alexa fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H C L) secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific A-11012).

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.3 software (GraphPad Software). Sample sizes were determined based on the assumption of a normal distribution and similar variability between experimental groups. No animals or samples were excluded from or randomized in the analyses. The normality distribution was corroborated using the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test. Two-tailed Student‚Äôs t-test was used for the comparison of two independent groups. The variances were similar between groups. Data represent mean ¬± standard error of the mean (SEM). p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTI2NS030gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cancer stem cells induced by chronic stimulation with prostaglandin E2 exhibited constitutively activated PI3K axis ...,"Cancer related cells appeared rich in a source of inflammatory eicosanoids

LLC and miPS-LLCcmP cells showed the composition of phosphatidylserine (PS) 14.3% and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 23.6 and 16.5% respectively whereas PS was 9.6 and PI 10.7% in miPSCs. And the ratio of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is in LLC and miPS-LLCcmP cells were 30.7 and 29.0% whereas it was 52.7% in miPSCs (Fig. 1A). Thus PS and PI were relatively higher and PC was lower in the cancer related cells when compared with normal stem cells. The composition of glycerophospholipids such as PI PS and PC in cancer cells is reported to significantly be different from that in normal cells12. The increased ratio of PI could be traced to the conversion of miPSCs into CSCs because the PI-metabolic system is involved in the development of cancer13. Furthermore most of the fatty acids at the 2-position of PI are arachidonic acid1415. Generally arachidonic acid is used in vivo as a part of prostaglandins and leukotrienes so-called eicosanoids which are closely related to inflammation and cancer16. We hypothesized the composition ratio of PI in miPS-LLCcmP cells and LLC cells higher than in miPSCs should imply the involvement of inflammatory eicosanoids in the conversion of miPSCs into miPS-LLCcmP cells.

Presence of prostaglandin E2 in the conditioned medium of LLC cells

Since the major candidate of prostaglandin involved in inflammation was prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) the amount of PGE2 in the conditioned medium (CM) of LLC cells which was supposed effective in the conversion of miPSCs into CSCs was quantified by ELISA. As the result LLC cells produced 16.9 ng/mL of PGE2 which was approximately 30 times higher than the amount of 0.5 ng/mL produced by miPSCs (Fig. 1B). miPS-LLCcmP cells produced 4.9 ng/mL of PGE2 implying that the converted cells acquired the ability to produce PGE2.

Further we assessed the expression of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) which digests PI to excise arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX-2) which is induced in inflammation and catalyses cyclization of C8‚ÄìC12 of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) 1 by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1C). As the results LLC cells overexpressed 50 11 and 8 folds of cPLA2 COX-2 and PGES1 respectively more than miPSCs while those in miPS-LLCcmP cells were almost equivalent to those in miPSCs. The results of Western Blot for cPLA2 and COX-2 were consistent with those of rt-qPCR (Fig. 1D).

The expression of PGE2 receptors was then assessed in miPSCs in order to confirm that PGE2 could stimulates miPSCs to activate the cytoplasmic signalling. EP-2 and EP-4 which were closely related to cancer among PGE2 receptors were found expressed in miPSCs as well as miPS-LLCcmP cells and LLC cells (Fig. 1E).

Since PI3K/Akt pathway was reported to be activated through EP-2 or EP-4 both of which were subtypes of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulated by PGE2171819 the phosphorylation of Akt was assessed in miPSCs by the stimulation of PGE2 (Fig. 1F). As the result Akt was phosphorylated by 10 ng/mL of PGE2 in miPSCs showing the time course dependent manner with the peak at 60 min from the stimulation.

Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a biproduct of arachidonic acid and also known as one of the inflammatory eicosanoids like PGE2. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis are arachidonate 5-lipoxigenae (Alox-5) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4h). Since LTB4 is considered closely related with cancer16 the expression of these two enzymes in the three cells was assessed by RT-qPCR. However the expression level of Alox-5 was not detectable in LLC cells while LTA4h was detected indicating the synthesis of LTB4 should be difficult (Fig. 1G). Further the quantity of LTB4 in the CM of LLC cells was not detectable by ELISA of which sensitivity was lower than 1 pg/mL (Fig. 1H). Taking all these data into consideration PGE2 was supposed to be a factor responsible for the conversion of miPSCs into CSCs.

Evaluation of PGE2 to convert miPSCs to CSCs

Since the concentration of PGE2 was almost 20 ng/mL in the CM of LLC cells and the CM was diluted two-fold when miPSCs were previously converted into miPS-LLCcm cells miPSCs were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/mL of PGE2 for 4 weeks without leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which was required to maintain the stemness of miPSCs in the standard culture condition as described in the Materials and Methods section. As the result miPSCs survived as those cultured in the presence of CM of LLC cells while they died within 1 week after culturing without LIF or PGE2 (Fig. 2A). These cells were designated as miPS-PGE2 cells which kept GFP expressed under the control of Nanog promoter indicating undifferentiated condition of the cells in the same manner as demonstrated in miPS-LLCcm cells6 (Fig. 2A). Flow cytometric analysis showed that GFP+ population in miPS-PGE2 cells was 68% while that in miPS-LLCcm cells was 48% indicating the resultant cells of the conversion were the mixture of differentiated and undifferentiated cells when they were cultured in adhesive condition (Fig. 2B). It was worthwhile noticing that miPS-PGE2 cells acquired the expression of CSC markers such as CD44 and CD133 (Fig. 2C).

Since the sphere-forming assay was first introduced as a functional approach for studying adult stem cells20 and has been widely used to evaluate the stem properties of proposed CSC populations212223 miPS-PGE2 cells were assessed for the self-renewal potential by the sphere formation in a dish with low attachment surface. As the result miPS-PGE2 cells formed spheres under non-serum condition indicating self-renewal potential in the same manner as demonstrated in miPS-LLCcm cells (Fig. 2D). The potential of differentiation into vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in miPS-PGE2 cells was assessed for the tube formation on Matrigel. The tube-forming capacity of the cells was quantified by the number of branching points (Fig. 2E). As the result miPS-PGE2 exhibited the potential of differentiation as well as that of miPS-LLCcm cells.

Subcutaneously transplanted miPS-PGE2 cells formed tumors in nude mice (Fig. 3A). It is worthwhile noticing that the converted cells exhibited significantly rapid tumor growth when compared to miPSCs which developed benign teratoma and miPS-LLCcm cells which developed malignant tumor. The volume of tumors from miPS-PGE2 cells reached to an average of 600 mm3 in less than 2 weeks while those from miPS-LLCcm cells required at least 3 weeks to reach to the same size (Fig. 3B). While histological features of teratoma derived from miPSCs showed no malignancy (Fig. 3C) the xenografts derived from miPS-PGE2 cells showed high mitotic figures and a high degree of atypia (Fig. 3D I II) which were similar to those of the malignant tumors developed from miPS-LLCcm cells6. The secondary tumor by the injection of miPS-PGE2P cells showed infiltration into the surrounding muscular layer and high mitotic figures and nuclear atypia (Fig. 3D III IV). Simultaneously immunohistochemistry of the tumor derived from miPS-PGE2P cells showed strong immunoreactivity to anti-E-cadherin -Ki67 and -CD44 antibodies indicating high proliferation rate with CSC subpopulation as well as heterogeneous intercellular adherence while teratoma section did not show any of these immunoreactivities (Fig. 3E).

Primary culture of miPS-PGE2 derived tumor showed characteristics of CSCs

Primary culture of a tumor developed from miPS-PGE2 cells was designated as miPS-PGE2P. miPS-PGE2P cells colonized and proliferated on an adhesive culture dish in the same manner as miPS-LLCcm cells (Fig. 3F). miPS-PGE2P cells sustained the expression of GFP which could be traced back to the injected miPS-PGE2 cells and showed two different subpopulations of GFP+ and GFP- cells representing the undifferentiated and differentiated subpopulation respectively. GFP- cells exhibited fibroblast-like morphology apparently supporting the microenvironment of the GFP+ cells that are CSCs. Regarding to the stemness miPS-PGE2P cells sustained the expression of stem cell markers such as Nanog Oct3/4 and SOX2 (Fig. 3G) while the level of KLF4 was significantly downregulated as it was in miPS-LLCcm cells. As for the markers of CSC miPS-PGE2P cells showed the expression of CD44 and CD133 whereas the expression of CD44 was as the same level as that in miPS-LLCcm cells but higher than that in miPSCs (Fig. 3H). miPS-PGE2P cells formed spheres in the serum free condition (Fig. 4A). The extreme limiting dilution assay showed that the self-renewal potential of miPS-PGE2 cells was significantly higher than that of miPS-LLCcmP cells (Fig. 4B). The potential of differentiation into ECs in miPS-PGE2P cells was assessed on Matrigel and evaluated by the tube formation (Fig. 4C). miPS-PGE2P cells were found sustaining the differentiation potential as shown in miPS-PGE2 and miPS-LLCcmP cells. The tube structures were most extensive during 12‚Äì24 h after seeding. There was no significant difference in the number of tubes and branch lengths between miPS-PGE2 and miPS-LLCcm cells after 24 h. The differentiation was simultaneously assessed by immunofluorescence staining for CD31 which serves as phenotypic and functional markers of ECs (Fig. 4D). miPS-PGE2 cells expressed CD31 in the tubes together with GFP exhibiting different subpopulations of ‚ÄúCD31+/GFP- (red)‚Äù and ‚ÄúCD31‚àí/GFP+ (green)‚Äù and ‚ÄúCD31+/GFP+ (yellow)‚Äù. This result indicated that the tumor angiogenesis might occur by CSCs sequentially differentiating from undifferentiated phenotype (green) to differentiated phenotype (red) through mid-stage (yellow) and that the tube structures were finally composed of heterogeneous cells which would partly explain the heterogeneity in a tumor tissue.

PI3K/Akt signalling in miPS-PGE2 and miPS-PGE2P cells

Previously our group reported that PI3K/Akt signaling was activated in miPS-LLCcm cells10. Following this information we assessed the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in miPS-PGE2 cells. As the results of RT-qPCR the expression of Pik3cg was significantly upregulated in miPS-PGE2 cells when compared to that in miPSCs as found in miPS-LLCcm cells (Fig. 5A). Regarding to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling the phosphorylation of Akt was assessed by Western Blotting. As a result the constitutive phosphorylation of Akt in miPS-PGE2 cells was recognized as found in miPS-LLCcm cells and higher than that in miPSCs without LIF (Fig. 5BC). Among PI3K oncogenic frequent mutations in the Pik3ca gene have been reported in human cancer13. The typical amino acid changes due to the mutations are E542K E545K and H1047R. However no mutations were found in the Pik3ca gene in miPS-PGE2 cells by the cDNA sequence analysis (Fig. 5D). It is conceivable that upregulation of PI3K level enhances the product of phosphatase of phosphatidyl inositol 345 phosphate (PIP3) triggerring PI3K/Akt pathway toward carcinogenesis2425. Since PI3K/Akt pathway is negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) which is a lipid hydrolytic enzyme specific to PIP3 PTEN is considered as the tumor suppressor gene. Three major mutations PTEN gene resulting in the amino acid changes of R130L R173C and R233X where X means anonymous have been reported to inactivate PTEN in human cancers262728. Accordingly we assessed the expression of PTEN and cDNA sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Fig. 5E). The expression of PTEN was lower in miPS-PGE2 cells than in miPSCs. And there were no mutations in the three mainly reported sites in the PTEN gene in miPS-PGE2 cells.

The RNA from converted miPS-PGE2 cells primary cultured miPS-PGE2P cells and miPSCs were subjected to the RNA-seq and the gene expression profiles were compared as a heat map using iDEP (Fig. 6A). The upregulated genes depicted in red when compared to miPSCs in the converted cells and the primary cells were respectively picked up and applied to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The analysis revealed that top enriched pathways in the converted cells and the primary cells were including those related to cancer stemness and cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix interactions (Fig. 6BC). The Parametric Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (PGSEA) showed commonly activated KEGG pathways between converted and primary cells when compared with miPSCs were ‚Äúmmu05200: Pathways in cancer‚Äù ‚Äúmmu04510: Focal adhesion‚Äù ‚Äúmmu04390: Hippo signaling pathway‚Äù ‚Äúmmu04512:ECM-receptor interaction‚Äù ‚Äúmmu04310:Wnt signaling pathway‚Äù and ‚Äúmmu04151:PI3K-Akt signaling pathway‚Äù which were apparently related with cancer. The genes categorized in the pathways were picked up and checked their normalized counts. The genes of which counts were upregulated in both miPS-PGE2 and miPS-PGE2P cells were further picked up and summarized in the supplementary Table S1. From the Table S1 the genes with extensive upregulation were collagen type I Œ±1 (COL1A1) collagen type IV Œ±1 (COL4A1) collagen type IV Œ±2 (COL4A2) filamin B (FLNB) GLI family zinc finger 2 (GLI2) insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) integrin subunit Œ±V (ITGAV) vinculin (VCL). VCL is considered as adaptor supporting integrin to connect with actin filament29. FLNB is known as an actin-binding protein30. On the other hand collagens appear to enhance the extracellular matrix (ECM). Especially COL1A1 may play supportive function to cancer associated fibroblasts in vivo31. Collectively the cancer stem cells appear to be strengthened by the cytoskeleton together with the ECM connected through integrin molecule.

miPS-PGE2P cells maintain CSC characteristics without exogenous PGE2

The dependency of CSC characters on PGE2 in the primary culture derived from tumor of miPS-PGE2 cells miPS-PGE2P cells was assessed. First of all miPS-PGE2P cells were divided into two groups of culture with/without PGE2 and cultured for 2 weeks. As the result miPS-PGE2P cells exhibited the growth in adhesive condition sphere formation and differentiation into vascular endothelial cells in the manner independent of PGE2 (Fig. 7A‚ÄìD) (Supplementary Fig. S7). Simultaneously the phosphorylation of Akt was assessed in the presence or absence of PGE2 in miPS-PGE2P cells. And Akt was found phosphorylated even without PGE2 (Fig. 7E). Collectively miPS-PGE2P cells could be concluded to acquire the CSC signatures independent of exogenous PGE2. Although the Akt phosphorylation in miPS-PGE2P cells was independent of exogenous PGE2 stimulation the autocrine dependency of the cells on PGE2 is still not ruled out. Therefore the production of PGE2 in miPS-PGE2 and miPS-PGE2P cells was assessed by ELISA. The amount of PGE2 produced in the conditioned medium of both cells was estimated to be approximately 0.3 ng/mL which is almost at the same level as that in the conditioned medium of miPSCs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Since the level of PGE2 in the conditioned medium of LLC cells was approximately 17 ng/mL (Fig. 1B) the level of PGE2 produced by miPS-PGE2P cells is almost 50 to 60 folds less than that by LLC cells. In this context miPS-PGE2 cells could be independent of the exogenous PGE2 to maintain the CSC signatures."

SEATAC Wash. ‚Äî Security screening lines stretched all the way into the parking garage at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Sunday morning. Many travelers say they missed their flights due to the long wait times.

The airport's media relations manager Perry Cooper called the situation ""very unusual.""

""It was a high volume day of passengers which was one of our largest since the pandemic. In addition we saw a large volume of cruise buses dropping off passengers from the end of the season ship and arrivals. Several factors could be involved in the situation"" said Cooper.

Cooper said the longest wait time the Port of Seattle recorded was 90 minutes. However TSA claims wait times did not pass 60 minutes. Travelers say they waited more than two hours.

""We got here about 9:50 a.m. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 12:30 p.m. and by the time we got through TSA it was 12:55 p.m."" said traveler Matt Macoleni.

""At 9:20 a.m. we were still in that line at 9:40 a.m. we were in that line. We were there all the way up until 10:40 a.m. I remember checking my watch our flight was already gone and we were in the line"" said traveler Ken Collins.

TSA confirmed there were no staffing shortages Sunday and some staff worked mandatory overtime. Twenty-seven of the 29 security lanes were open during the peak period which was 8:15 am. to noon.

Roughly 4000 cruise ship passengers were dropped off every hour according to TSA.

TSA expects Monday to be another busy day at SEA Airport with a similar number of travelers. Sunday saw roughly 60000 travelers and at least 56000 travelers are expected Monday.

The Port encourages travelers to use the SEA Spot Saver which allows travelers to save a spot in the security line.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMTkvaG93LW11Y2gtZG9lcy1pdC1jb3N0LXRvLXZpc2l0LWJodXRhbi0yMDAtYS1kYXktcGx1cy10cmF2ZWwtY29zdHMtLmh0bWzSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wOS8xOS9ob3ctbXVjaC1kb2VzLWl0LWNvc3QtdG8tdmlzaXQtYmh1dGFuLTIwMC1hLWRheS1wbHVzLXRyYXZlbC1jb3N0cy0uaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You can visit Bhutan again ‚Äî if you're willing to cough up $200 a day in fees,"

The Kingdom of Bhutan is reopening to tourists on Friday with a hefty hike to its daily tourist tax. Before the country closed its borders in March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic travelers to Bhutan were required to pay a minimum daily package rate of $200-$250 ‚Äî depending on the time of year. The rate often included hotel food transportation and tour guide costs as well as a mandatory $65 Sustainable Development Fee. But in late June Bhutan passed a Tourism Levy Bill that eliminated the minimum daily package rate in favor of raising the Sustainable Development Fee from $65 to $200 per person per day. Travel costs ‚Äî for hotels and food for example ‚Äî are not covered by the fee.

The country is providing a fee discount for families said Raju Rai the CEO of Heavenly Bhutan Travels. ""It is 50% for children between 6-12 years [old] and ... free for children 5 years and below"" he said.

'An active contribution'

Bhutan and supporters of the new policy say the move is in line with the country's continued goal to attract ""high value low volume"" tourism. To experience the country ‚Äî which is famous for providing travelers a rare glimpse of authenticity in a world replete with tourist traps ‚Äî visitors must ""make an active contribution to Bhutan's economic social and cultural development"" according to the corporate website for the Tourism Council of Bhutan. The Tourism Council said the fees will go toward upgrading infrastructure training workers in the travel industry preserving cultural traditions protecting the environment and creating jobs that provide fair wages and working conditions.

Sam Blyth chair of The Bhutan Canada Foundation and founder of the Trans Bhutan Trail said the fees will go directly to help local communities. ""The money collected by [the] government will then be directed back into the communities and to support health and education which are free to all Bhutanese"" he said.

Will travelers benefit?

Travelers too will benefit from the increased fees according to the Tourism Council. Standards and certifications for hotels and tour operators will be revised which will improve travelers' experiences it said. Plus travelers will have more flexibility in planning and booking their own trips it said. The Tourism Council notes that the minimum daily package rate ""had its limitations. Tourists for instance often had to choose from packaged tours offered by tour operators which controlled the travel experience for them. By doing away with [it] ‚Ä¶ tourists will be able to engage their desired service providers directly and pay for their services accordingly.""

Tour guides are no longer mandatory for all trips but they are required for travelers who plan to trek or go beyond the cities of Thimphu and Paro according to the Council. Travel agencies who can get visas for travelers also collect payment for the sustainability fees said Sarah-Leigh Shenton the marketing director at the travel agency Red Savannah. ""All administration is handled by our team and our clients do not have to make payments locally.""

Critics versus supporters

Critics argue Bhutan's increased tourist tax is ""elitist"" by further closing the door to budget travelers who dream of visiting Bhutan. Still more say the new policy will disproportionately affect travel agencies that cater to budget-friendly travelers. Others are critical of the timing stating the new rules will discourage travelers from visiting at a time when the country's tourism industry is reeling from a 2.5-year border closure. However the Tourism Council of Bhutan said the pandemic provided the right time ""to reset the sector."" It also hinted it may welcome a slow return of travelers stating ""The gradual return of tourists will allow for the progressive upgrading of infrastructure and services.""

Sam Blyth said he has hiked extensively through Bhutan for the past 30 years. He is the founder of the Trans Bhutan Trail a not-for-profit company that helped revitalize a 250-mile ancient trail that traverses the center of the country.

What if we told you there was a way to knock them out in one fell swoop?

Enter the around-the-world private jet journey.

On these trips guests travel in groups to the most famous destinations in the world accompanied by a full staff that usually includes a tour manager a private chef for the flights and a doctor plus on-the-ground travel managers.

It's not entirely unlike like a high-end cruise or a land tour ‚Äî except the transportation is by private jet of course.

Travelers spend a few days in each destination choosing from a list of excursions ‚Äî or in some cases charting their own course with a private driver or local guide organized by the tour operator. At night guests enjoy lodging at luxury hotels save for a few red-eye flights.

""For many of our clients the most finite resource is time and the around-the-world private jet journeys are a great way to 'check the boxes' of some of the most popular attractions without extending their stay in a destination in which they might not be as interested"" said travel advisor Maggie Jones of KK Travels Worldwide a Virtuoso member.

""Since the pandemic a fair amount of our clients are coming to us and wanting to complete their bucket-list trips sooner rather than later and it has been incredibly special to be able to present this type of travel as an option for them.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly these experiences do have a pretty hefty price tag but can you put a price on having one company handle all your travel arrangements to some of the world's most legendary sites? And that's not to mention the benefit of avoiding commercial air travel. Plus these journeys are frequently all-inclusive so everything from meals to lodging to excursions is included with the rate.

Whether you're more interested in historic sites like Chile's Easter Island or wildlife-centric ones like Tanzania's Serengeti there's a private jet journey out there that will speak to you.

Four Seasons Private Jet Ancient Explorer

The Four Seasons private jet stops at archaeological sites from Easter Island to the Taj Mahal. FOUR SEASONS

For the history lover this private jet journey offered by Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts makes nine stops at some of the world's most incredible archaeological sites: Chile's Easter Island and Egypt's Great Pyramids of Giza to name two. But the journey also includes stops in bustling metropolises like Mexico City and natural wonders like Australia's Great Barrier Reef and Jordan's Wadi Rum desert valley. Guests travel in the Four Seasons' own Boeing 757 outfitted with 52 lie-flat business-class seats and a steam oven so the jet's executive chef can prepare gourmet meals on board. The itinerary includes stays at Four Seasons properties around the world of course. The 24-day itinerary can be booked from $190000 per person and there are typically one or two departures a year (the next journey kicks off on Sept. 29). (Now if only Four Seasons had a loyalty program.)

Abercrombie & Kent Private Jet Journeys Wildlife Safari

Abercrombie & Kent's Wildlife Safari is a must for all animal lovers. ABERCROMBIE & KENT

For the eight-stop journey A&K charters a Boeing 757 with all lie-flat business-class seats which includes an onboard chef and free Wi-Fi where available.

National Geographic Expeditions: Around the World by Private Jet

National Geographic will take you around the world with historians anthropologists and photographers to 10 different UNESCO World Heritage Sites. NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPEDITIONS/FACEBOOK

Travel with National Geographic experts including historians anthropologists and photographers on an incredible private-jet journey that visits 10 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The adventure begins in Washington D.C. and includes stops at ancient sites like Machu Picchu in Peru Easter Island in Chile and Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Sprinkle in a few warm-weather stops in the Pacific throughout this first leg then you're off to the Himalayas. Up next is the Taj Mahal in India followed by a trip across Africa and the Middle East. National Geographic's Boeing 757 has spacious leather seats for up to 75 guests though they're not lie-flat. They do however recline 45 degrees which is reasonable enough given that you'll be spending most nights in luxury hotels around the world including La Mamounia in Marrakech Morocco and the Four Seasons Safari Lodge Serengeti in Tanzania. Similar to other itineraries this expedition spans 24 days and starts at a cool $94995 per person. Approximately six National Geographic Expeditions are available every year with the next one departing on Sept. 29.

TCS World Travel: World Less Traveled

TCS WORLD TRAVEL/FACEBOOK

For travelers who have already seen many of the world's top highlights and want to try something a little different for a grand around-the-world trip TCS's World Less Traveled private jet itinerary to five of the most intriguing ""emerging destinations"" is a must-book. The trip starts and ends in London and stops in Dakar Senegal; Salvador Brazil; Lom√© Togo; AlUla Saudi Arabia; and Tunis Tunisia. Of course none of these destinations are new ‚Äî in fact many have been around for thousands of years ‚Äî but they are often less visited by travelers. This trip is particularly suitable for art lovers as both ancient and contemporary art plays a big role in each of the destinations. The journey is flown on an Airbus A321neo-LR with 52 lie-flat seats. Book your spot on the once-a-year 15-day trip from $150000 per person. The next tour leaves on Feb. 11 2023.

Road Scholar: Discover the World by Private Plane

ANDREW DAVIS/ROADSCHOLAR

Another itinerary that starts and concludes in London Road Scholar's private jet trip hits many of the world's most iconic sites: England's Stonehenge Jordan's Petra and India's Amber Fort in Jaipur among them. But we also applaud this itinerary's slightly more off-the-beaten-path stops including the Jantar Mantar observatory (also in Jaipur) and the Mutrah Souq in Muscat Oman. The airborne part of the journey takes place in a Boeing 767 with 54 lie-flat seats while the landside journey includes stays at lauded luxury properties like The Oberoi in New Delhi and Sofitel Angkor Phokeethra Golf and Spa Resort in Siem Reap Cambodia. One of the bonuses with this itinerary is that there's no single supplement for solo travelers and there are often deals for business-class airfare to and from London. Spots on the 21-day expedition which is held three times a year start at $62999 per person. The next trip kicks off on April 17 2023.

Aman The Grandest Tour

Amanoi is one of the destinations apart of The Grandest Tour with Aman. JOHN W. MCDERMOTT/AMAN

If you're a fan of the luxury hotel brand Aman this around-the-world journey is the best way to experience some of its top properties ‚Äî and the incredible destinations in which they're located. This tour begins in Japan before traveling to several destinations in Southeast Asia followed by Bhutan and India with a conclusion in Europe (the specific destinations change each trip). While most around-the-world private-jet journeys are not actually all that private Aman ensures its program is: Just 18 guests can join each trip cohosted by Remote Lands and each group on the tour has its own driver for excursions. As such you might not find it too surprising that Aman's aircraft isn't an all-business-class commercial jet but a true corporate one. More specifically it flies the Airbus ACJ3189 the business counterpart to the A319 which has a lounge configuration. The Grandest Tour from Aman spans 21 days and the next trip departs on Oct. 12. The cost per person is $152888 ($305776 per couple or $196776 per single for a solo traveler with a single supplement).



Smithsonian Journeys: Around the World by Private Jet: A Classic Journey

Leave it to a travel company founded out of the iconic Smithsonian Institution to create a nine-stop around-the-world private jet journey that combines the best of history culture and nature in a single trip. You can expect to visit all the heavy hitters in the archaeological world (Machu Picchu Easter Island the Great Pyramids Angkor Wat and Petra among them) as well as natural hotspots like the Great Barrier Reef and Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania. Smithsonian Journeys utilizes two aircraft for these journeys depending on the specific itinerary: an Airbus A321 and a Boeing 757 each of which is outfitted with 52 and 48 lie-flat seats respectively. Smithsonian's around-the-world itineraries last for 24 days generally take place three or four times a year and start at $109950 per person.

Art in Voyage: 28-day Magellan Odyssey World Tour

As you've probably ascertained most private-jet world tours visit the same destinations. And while those stops are all magnificent what's special about Art in Voyage's month-long journey is its somewhat alternative stops. That includes Chile's Atacama desert (one of the best places on Earth for stargazing); New Zealand for adventure activities such as helicopter rides catamaran tours and white-water rafting; and Bordeaux France for a culinary immersion and a ride in a vintage Porsche Bentley Lamborghini or Ferrari. The 10-stop itinerary does include some of the more typical main attractions too such as Petra and Tanzania's Serengeti. It's really the blend of destinations that makes this itinerary stand out. While Art in Voyage hasn't yet selected an aircraft for this journey travelers can expect to be on a private all-business-class aircraft.

She has studied the structure and evolution of stars galaxies and the universe and published more than 1000 works including research papers in astronomy astrophysics the history of science and scientometrics ‚Äì the field concerned with measuring scientific outputs ‚Äì as well book reviews and biographies. She has co-edited The Sky Is for Everyone a new collection of 37 autobiographical essays by distinguished female astronomers including herself. Spanning a range of generations and nationalities each tells of the barriers they have overcome to change the face of modern astronomy.

What got you into astronomy?

It wasn‚Äôt a love of stars: I grew up in Los Angeles very nearsighted and never saw the night sky. I really wanted to be an Egyptologist but the University of California Los Angeles [UCLA] didn‚Äôt have an archaeology major. My father looked at the catalogue and saw astronomy. I enrolled in an astronomy-math double degree but that got moved to the school of engineering which wasn‚Äôt terribly welcoming to women so I switched to astronomy-physics. I started at UCLA in 1961 in the gifted students‚Äô programme.

In 1962 you were featured in a Life magazine article Behind a Lovely Face a 180 IQ. Where did that lead?

As a result I was approached by a publicity agency looking for some way to bring up the ratings of what was going to be the last year of the Twilight Zone programmes. In my year being Miss Twilight Zone I toured 10 cities where television ratings were taken doing newspaper radio and television interviews. The shtick was that I was reading the scripts for accuracy. Some of my suggestions were taken for instance that there is a difference between a solar system and a galaxy. It brought in some extra much-needed pennies.

Feynman‚Äôs wife often brought us orange juice and cookies and I didn‚Äôt want to be naked on the couch with him when she did

You started graduate school at the prestigious California Institute of Technology or Caltech in 1964 when you were not quite 21. You were awarded your joint master‚Äôs in physics and astronomy in 1965 and your PhD in astronomy in 1968. Was it hard getting in?

I hadn‚Äôt quite realised that they admitted women only under exceptional circumstances. My exceptional circumstance was that my fellowship required me to go someplace other than my undergraduate institution and I didn‚Äôt want to leave home (Caltech and UCLA were the only two places in southern California with astronomy majors). There were 14 women on the entire campus when I arrived and the two women who arrived ahead of me in astronomy both came with their husbands.

It seems Caltech was a hotbed of seduction. You became friendly with the physicist Richard Feynman by modelling for him‚Ä¶

I had quickly noticed in both my undergraduate and graduate classes there were a lot of nice men ‚Äì students and faculty. The astronomy professor who became my PhD adviser ‚Äì Guido M√ºnch ‚Äì and I were lovers for about three years until I left Caltech.

Feynman was learning to draw and he‚Äôd seen me walking across campus and decided: ‚ÄúI want that one.‚Äù He saw M√ºnch coming out of the building I had gone into and went up to him and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hunting perhaps you know the quarry.‚Äù M√ºnch brought Feynman to my office and introduced us.

Feynman paid me $5.50 an hour (a lot then) plus all the physics I could swallow. His studio was in the basement of his house in Altadena and I used to go there Tuesday evenings for a couple of hours. Sometimes I posed nude. Sometimes we cuddled but innocently. I recall once he suggested we cuddle on the couch and I said I didn‚Äôt think we really wanted to do that. His wife quite often brought us orange juice and cookies and I didn‚Äôt want to be naked on the couch with Feynman when she did.

Wasn‚Äôt it creepy to be involved with these professors? There was a big power imbalance.

I enjoyed the company of men who liked me. I was never aware of a power imbalance; I could always just walk away. Of course it would get us all fired today!

You have published hundreds of research papers but perhaps your colleagues know you best for your amusing must-read annual summaries of astrophysics research which you undertook for 16 years starting in 1991. How deliberate was the humour?

I couldn‚Äôt help [the jokes]. I am told that if we who are on the autism spectrum ‚Äì and I would say I am slightly Aspergerish ‚Äì simply describe things the way we see them it strikes many other people as amusing. But some of the footnotes were designed to be funny. I described distinguished colleagues by pseudonyms such as ‚Äúthe rotund musician‚Äù or ‚Äúthe keen amateur dentist‚Äù. I made enemies both by not citing people and by citing them because quite often I picked out something from their paper which was not what they had primarily intended. It was said that each time [a summary] came out you could see the Princeton astronomers tiptoeing into the library late at night to see if they had been mentioned.

How have things changed for female astronomers?

The first women in astronomy came in through a father brother or husband and some almost certainly married in order to do science. Then came being a human computer [which involved doing calculations by hand and later machine]. These women didn‚Äôt necessarily fall in love with astronomy but it was an interesting job that a college-educated woman could do that wasn‚Äôt teaching or nursing. Then in the US driven by post-Sputnik concerns graduate programmes in space-related fields grew rapidly. They were so desperate to expand they even hired women faculty! Today roughly 30-40% of astronomy graduate students are female though that lessens up the hierarchy.

Which female astronomers have been overlooked for a Nobel prize?

Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin discovered that stars are made of hydrogen and helium. But she wasn‚Äôt believed until it was confirmed by men. Jocelyn Bell (later Bell Burnell) was a PhD student when she participated in the discovery of pulsars but the resultant share of the Nobel prize was awarded only to her male supervisor. In contrast the male PhD student who recognised the signal from the first binary pulsar shared the prize with his adviser.

Various female astronomers in the book note some shockingly sexist behaviour and at least one details being sexually harassed in an elevator. You must have experienced some of this in your working life but you don‚Äôt seem too riled about men behaving badly‚Ä¶

Clearly ‚Äúmen behaving badly‚Äù has been a major problem for some of my colleagues and I don‚Äôt want to seem to be defending law-breakers. I don‚Äôt feel that I have ever been sexually harassed. I am friends with some senior male scientists who‚Äôve been accused of being seriously inappropriate and I just find it hard to believe. I think perhaps some things can feel very different to different women.

What words of advice would you give young women who want an astronomy career?

Nearly everybody says: follow your passion. My view is: find something you‚Äôre good enough at to earn your living and do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ATLANTA ‚Äî The Atlanta Braves are heading to the White House next week.

President Joe Biden invited the World Series champions to Washington D.C. on Sept. 26 at 11:30 a.m. to celebrate their first title since 1995.

The Braves beat the Houston Astros last year. It is tradition for sports teams to visit the White House after winning championships.

The 2021 postseason was not expected to finish the way it did - not for these Braves who only won 88 games and were without arguably their best player Ronald Acu√±a after his injury.

The team however despite their less-than-sterling resume had something else that made them special beyond just wins and stats - they had a team spirit and a gritty resolve that showed up time and time again.

They beat the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLDS a quality opponent and then overcame the heavily-favored defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.

And then in the World Series they beat the Houston Astros in six games to win their first pennant in 26 years.

It is unclear if any players from that team no longer on the Braves will be in attendance at the White House visit. Freddie Freeman and the Dodgers however also have an off day on the 26th.

Now this year's Braves team hopes to make it back-to-back trips to the White House. We'll wait and see.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9tbGIvcGhpbGxpZXMvZ2FtZS1kYXkvcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLXBoaWxsaWVzLWZhbGwtYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMtcG90ZW50aWFsLXdpbGQtY2FyZC1yb3VuZC1wcmV2aWV3LXJlY2Fw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phillies Fall to Braves in First Game of Potential Wild Card Round Preview,"The Atlanta Braves came from behind to beat the Philadelphia Phillies with a six-run bottom of the eighth.

Were the regular season to end today the Philadelphia Phillies and Atlanta Braves would face off in a best-of-three Wild Card series at Truist Park in Atlanta. As such this weekend‚Äôs series serves a potential preview of sorts for the Phillies‚Äô first playoff appearance in over a decade.

A mid-September series lacks the stakes of postseason baseball and of course the lineups and pitching matchups do not look exactly how they would in October. Even so if Philadelphia could pull off a series win it would give them an extra boost of momentum going forward.

Over the first seven innings it looked like the Phillies might come out victorious in game one.

The offense could only muster two runs but when Max Fried is on the mound you take what you can get. The Braves lefty has been one of the very best pitchers in the National League this season and to score off Fried twice and drive him out of the game after only six innings pitched is an accomplishment in and of itself.

The first run came on Kyle Schwarber‚Äôs league-leading 39th home run of the year. With one more long ball he‚Äôll become the first Phillie since Ryan Howard to hit 40 in one season. Philadelphia took a 1-0 lead in the top of the fourth.

Later on that inning however was a bit of a scary moment as Bryce Harper fouled a ball off his own knee and fell to the ground in pain. He was able to stand back up and continue the game although his knee clearly bothered him throughout. Hopefully in such a case no news is good news and the reigning MVP is able to shake it off and keep going.

The following inning Jean Segura followed Schwarber up with a solo shot of his own putting Philadelphia on top 2-0. Those two runs were all they could manage that night but with the way Ranger Su√°rez was pitching it looked like that might be enough.

Su√°rez went six innings striking out four and allowing just two hits and one run. It wasn‚Äôt his most dominant outing of the year but against an opponent as tough as the Braves it was an impressive performance and it helped push aside any concerns that the young pitcher had hit a wall late in the season.

The southpaw got some help on an incredible sliding catch from right fielder Dalton Guthrie but most of the credit goes to Su√°rez himself. Other than one home run allowed to William Contreras the 27-year-old kept the defending World Champs off the board for six solid frames.

When Su√°rez left after the sixth inning the Phillies seemed to be in a good position. Their best bullpen arms were well rested and the trio of Jos√© Alvarado Seranthony Dom√≠nguez and David Robertson was coming in to finish things off.

Unfortunately things didn‚Äôt quite work out that way. Alvarado got his job done in the seventh but Dom√≠nguez struggled in the eighth looking far from the shutdown reliever he has been for most of the season.

After walking Eddie Rosario to open the frame he allowed a go-ahead homer to Ronald Acu√±a Jr.

He then got the first out before allowing a double to Austin Riley. With a man in scoring position Dom√≠nguez struck out Matt Olson walked Travis d‚ÄôArnaud and allowed a two-out single to William Contreras giving the Braves a 4-2 lead.

At that point Rob Thomson knew something was up with his star reliever and he walked to the mound for a pitching change. Nick Nelson entered needing only one out to stop the bleeding but it wouldn‚Äôt be that easy. Nelson allowed an RBI single to Michael Harris Jr. and a double to Ozzie Albies before finally striking out Eddie Rosario to end the eighth.

All in all Atlanta batted around the order scoring six and taking a commanding 7-2 lead.

The Phillies stepped out for their at-bats in the ninth but all the good feelings were gone. Just an inning ago it looked like they might win game one of this important Wild Card round preview. With a six-run eighth inning however the Braves wiped the smiles off their faces. Philadelphia went down quickly to end the ballgame.

The two teams go back at it on Saturday evening at Truist Park and this time the Phillies have the definitive pitching advantage. Aaron Nola takes the mound opposite Jake Odorizzi at 7:20 p.m. EST hoping to even up the series at one game apiece.

Funding for these programs is part of the Biden administration's Climate Smart Agriculture Initiative designed to support pilot programs that will help farmers transition to sustainable farming practices establish new markets to create and grow revenue sources and to verify and report data that proves to consumers that crops were produced sustainably Vilsack said.

""Farmers ranchers producers ... around this country fully understand and appreciate the challenges of climate change probably better than just about anybody on the planet"" Vilsack said Friday during a visit to Isbell Farms in England.

""They deal with it every single day they deal with it in the form of mega droughts in some parts of our country forest fires in other parts of our country major floods that take place periodically and with greater frequency and intensity ... windstorms hurricanes the whole nine yards.""

""They also know that they have a responsibility which they take very seriously and that responsibility is to be the stewards of our land and water"" Vilsack said.

USA Rice Federation Winrock International and Tyson Foods will take the lead on major contracts worth at least $160 million in total.

Those projects will be geared mostly toward rice production a few other row crops and cattle and poultry.

Vilsack announced earlier this year the USDA had allocated $1 billion to its Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program to be divided into two funding pools but the Biden-Harris administration increased total funding to roughly $3.5 billion because of higher demand from applicants.

The USDA is investing up to $2.8 billion into 70 projects for the first funding pool to support 'climate-smart' projects; 20 of those projects are expected to affect Arkansas.

An estimated 50000 farmers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico will take part in the programs Vilsack said and more than 55 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent will be sequestered over the five-year terms of all 70 projects.

Proposals for the projects include plans to get matching funds up to 50% of federal investments on average from non-federal sources the USDA release stated.

Funding for the program will come in two phases from the USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. Projects chosen for the second funding pool will be announced later this year.

USA Rice Federation will get $80 million for its Rice Stewardship Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities project to help farmers adopt conservation practices that will reduce their water usage when growing rice and also help them try to reduce methane a greenhouse gas emission.

""For this particular project we're looking at 40000 acres impacted 25% that is earmarked specifically for historically underserved producers and what that will do is to enable all of those producers to enable climate-smart practices"" Isbell Farms partner and rice farmer Mark Isbell said.

""We're still going to impact water quality we're still going to impact air quality we're still going to impact soil health but we're also going to diminish greenhouse gases and that is going to have a substantial impact on the climate in the future"" Isbell said.

Isbell Farms produces nearly 3000 acres of rice annually using zero-grade technology to reduce water and land use and increase efficiency.

USA Rice is working with Memphis-based Ducks Unlimited Walmart the National Black Grower's Council Missouri-based Anheuser-Busch Arkansas-based Riceland Foods -- a USA Rice member -- Arva Intelligence the University of Arkansas and others for the project.

""The Rice Federation project was the number one scored project of all of the various grant [proposals] that were submitted"" Vilsack said.

Winrock International is getting $20 million to help farmers -- particularly historically underserved producers -- adopt sustainable farming practices.

Winrock is also working with Riceland Foods and Arva Intelligence as well as the Intertribal Agriculture Council.

Springdale-based Tyson Foods Inc. will get $60 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration in beef production and row crops for livestock feed like corn and to provide technical assistance and incentive payments to small and underserved producers.

Tyson is working with Bayer; McDonald's; Scoular an agriculture supply chain solutions company; Where Food Comes From a third-party food verification company; Iowa Select the eighth-largest pork producer in the United States; certain Native American Tribal communities; and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development of which Tyson is a member.

Highland's Lockheed Martin and the other major defense manufacturers located there are constructing weapons key to turning around the war in Ukraine say military generals and other experts.

And Camden population 10300 is working to shore up a dwindling downtown and other amenities to maintain the area's most important industry -- the launchers missiles and defense weapons built by 2800 workers at Highland.

Lockheed's HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) made in Camden has ""been key to the turnaround in Ukraine no doubt about it"" said retired U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark of Little Rock in an interview last week .

The former NATO Supreme Allied Commander now strategic adviser still has working ties to Ukraine. He had just returned from the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv.

HIMARS serves as ""a substitute for the Ukrainian Air Force"" Clark said. The missiles are satellite guided with a 200-pound explosive warhead that travels about 50 miles he said. It's accurate within about 10 feet military experts say.

""It's a very easy-to-use system usually mounted on a truck"" Clark said. ""It does what is called 'Shoot and Scoot.' It's very hard for the enemy to take out in advance. It's also able to get away after the rocket is fired.""

The artillery rocket system is built only at Lockheed's installation in south Arkansas according to Aaron Huckaby site director of Lockheed's Camden operations.

Military leaders including Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have appeared in international news reports in recent weeks applauding the HIMARS successes in Ukraine. HIMARS-launched missiles by last month had struck more than 400 Russian targets according to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Ukranian defense authorities have said the weapon has far exceeded expectations. It's been instrumental in reclaiming 1158 square miles of formerly Russian-occupied territory.

The attention has spilled over to HIMARS' builders in Arkansas and Camden as its city of origin.

A CBS ""Sunday Morning"" broadcast Sept. 4 talked about the weapon's production in rural south Arkansas. Politico a politics and policy news website on Sept. 9 examined Camden and Highland Industrial Park in a magazine-length article ""The Struggling Arkansas Town That Helped Stop Russia in Its Tracks.""

Two top military officials -- William LaPlante undersecretary for defense and Assistant Secretary of the Army Doug Bush -- visited Highland and Lockheed Martin late last month for an announcement regarding HIMARS and Lockheed's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS.

""We have received nearly $400 million to replenish HIMARS and GMLRS"" in defense department stockpiles LaPlante said according to a Camden News newspaper report. ""In addition we are planning nearly $200 million to expand and accelerate production...""

LaPlante and Bush also thanked Lockheed workers for the ""impact their efforts are having on the battlefield"" in Ukraine.

When Ramona Crain a real estate agent in Camden read the Politico article she was ""very pleased"" at the attention for the Camden area and its defense contractor industry.

""I had known by hearing around town that some of the industries were producing weapons for the fight in Ukraine"" she said. ""I am proud of their contribution. Many hard-working individuals are contributing to the success of these plants.""

Still Crain was surprised in some ways at all the recognition. The defense manufacturers don't get talked about a lot in Camden she said. And someone driving through the city wouldn't necessarily know the giant installation is a few miles outside.

""They're like a quiet group of defense industries that are doing a good job"" she said.

OUT OF THE CONVERSATION

Travel northeast from Camden on U.S. 79 Business cross the Ouachita River and rural countryside and -- at about East Camden population 798 -- turn onto U.S. 278 then Arkansas 274 to motor into Highland Industrial Park's 18780 acres.

At the entrance pass a hulking orange-and-tan billboard advertising the industrial park's 25-plus tenants.

Among the largest: Lockheed Martin -- ""We never forget who we're working for;"" Aerojet Rocketdyne; General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems; Raytheon Missiles and Defense.

A white-and-blue Lockheed building sits alongside the billboard across from the Highland Industrial Park administrative building.

The park also includes SAU Tech community college which trains workers including engineers and Arkansas' state fire and police training academies.

Most tenants according to John Schaffitzel the industrial park's president feed the defense industry.

Recent national attention on the Lockheed Martin Camden workforce ""has been nice"" site director Huckaby said in a digital interview .

His company which occupies more than 2000 acres at Highland has built more than 550 HIMARS ""from ground up -- truck chassis launcher that can fire various munitions"" he said. ""Some other sub-components are produced by our supply base. We have a number of suppliers across Arkansas and the nation.""

Ukraine has 16 HIMARS systems and wants more according to news accounts. The Pentagon announced plans last month to build 500. Lockheed doesn't divulge the HIMARS system's cost.

Huckaby said he like many employers worries about workforce development and retention. He wants to be more creative in identifying skilled and diverse talent while attracting and retaining the best.

Like many other companies at Highland Park Lockheed works four 10-hour days Monday through Thursday unless overtime is required. That helps workers who drive in from El Dorado Hot Springs Arkadelphia and other areas to work at the plants.

Pay and benefits are a big attraction.

Lockheed ranked the nation's largest defense contractor describes its pay only as ""competitive and fair."" Camden business leaders guess the lowest starting salary at $15 per hour with pay for engineers and other senior and highly trained staff climbing into ""six figures.""

Benefits surpass many Arkansas employers they say.

In addition to health insurance and a retirement plan Lockheed awards tuition assistance of $7500 to $12500 per year and up to four weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave according to a company spokesman.

Huckaby would like to see the Camden area offer workers better quality day care schools housing and other amenities which are issues his employees talk about ""on an ongoing basis.""

When he meets with state business and government leaders he sees ""a lot of momentum"" around growth in Northwest Arkansas and the Little Rock-Central Arkansas area. ""I think South Arkansas is missing from that conversation in a lot of ways"" he said.

Still Lockheed Camden has ""a healthy business and a healthy backlog"" Huckaby said. The company in June 2019 announced a $142 million investment in its Camden operation.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY

Defense contractors Lockheed Aerojet and others have built defense department weapons near Camden for decades.

Highland Industrial Park privately owned traces its history back to World War II as a U.S. Navy installation.

World-War-II era buildings still huddle close to high-tech factories. The site contains about 640 earth-covered munitions storage bunkers from its military days according to industrial park officials. They're handy for use by missile manufacturers.

After the Navy's Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot shut down in the late 1950s the Brown family of Texas bought 25000 acres Schaffitzel said. Highland Resources Inc. a subsidiary of Brown Engineering has operated the industrial park since 1968 he said.

Years ago Camden residents say it wasn't too difficult to get inside the defense industries at Highland Industrial Park if they had business there. But stepped-up security has made access more difficult. Lockheed and Aerojet declined Arkansas Democrat-Gazette requests to come inside their plants.

Defense manufacturing plants at Highland today sit behind individual wire-topped fences and guardhouses.

Lockheed and Aerojet are the largest tenants each with more than 1000 employees according to company spokesmen.

Aerojet's Camden operation on almost 2000 acres produces 75000 solid rocket motors a year to power defense systems including the Javelin Stinger Patriot Missile and other missile defense and tactical systems according to a company spokeswoman.

General Dynamics builds air-to-ground rockets and warheads. Raytheon constructs components for Navy missiles.

The Arkansas Economic Development Commission lists aerospace and aviation which includes defense industries as Arkansas' No. 1 export. The commission's website also describes Highland as one of the nation's ""fastest growing defense corridors.""

But unlike Walmart Tyson Foods JB Hunt Trucking and Dillard's Highland Industrial Park is hardly a familiar name across the state.

Asked how well-known is the Camden-area installation that builds launchers missiles and other military weapons Schaffitzel who has been on his job almost a year said he isn't sure.

""Is it highly known?"" he said. ""I don't know that they [defense contractors] want it to be highly known.""

Although state business and economic development officials know the industrial park well more widely it ""has been kind of a well-kept secret"" said James Lee Silliman executive director of the Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation.

""I don't know if that's by design.""

CAMDEN COMEBACK?

Decorative banners in downtown Camden recall the days of steamboats on the Quachita River.

Nearby a new mural on a renovated apartment building shouts rockets missiles and defense workers.

Camden settled in the early 1800s was a paper mill town for decades until International Paper Co. closed here in 2001. Now residents say it's a city that ""builds bombs.""

By all accounts the Camden area struggles with the same problems of other communities in the rural South and Midwest: declining population worries about access to education opportunities good-paying jobs medical care amenities.

Camden's defense workers are ""very important to the economy. They're transferring in buying homes settling in helping us build our community"" said Tammy George principal broker at Century 21 Campbell & Company.

She sees ""recent development and improvements in our downtown area new retail and restaurants. We're really pleased to see some growth.""

Still she doesn't know of any new homes currently under construction. And she remembers Camden in the 1970s nearly 50% larger with a population of about 15000 boasting stores such as Watts J.C. Penney Montgomery Ward Bealls and Gibson's that are gone now.

Lockheed's Huckaby said Camden's evolution may look better to those who have moved in more recently. The past 10 years have shown ""increases in the amenities and downtown"" residents tell him.

Highland Park's Schaffitzel said he pitches quality of life in the river city.

""The energy in downtown Camden is pretty amazing"" he said. ""They have First Friday events that draw 2000 or 3000 out in the streets."" He points to new restaurants like the Postmasters Grill in an historic renovated post office building.

'BOOM MODE'

Jim Golden who owns Jim Golden Ford in Camden counts on business from the defense companies and their workers. He also sees deeper inside the local military weapons industry than most residents as president of the Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development board.

In Golden's view ""the economy is fantastic in Camden right now due to the influx of aerospace jobs. It is very very good for Camden and very very good for this business. A lot of people work out there they buy vehicles from me I service their vehicles.""

""If it wasn't for these industrial plants this Ford place probably wouldn't be here"" he said. ""Or if it was it would be very small.""

Silliman Camden Area Industrial Development Corporation's executive director believes the area's military weapons builders are ""in a boom mode. The companies are all busy right now and have been. I can only speculate that a lot of the inventories will be replenished. It sounds like there's going to be steady production for a while"" he said.

Meanwhile attention on Camden's defense weapons industry and the city itself is mostly encouraging said many interviewed.

Clark whose family moved to Little Rock from Chicago when he was a child said defense industries chose Camden and Arkansas for good reasons.

After defense contractors were forced to shrink their operations at the end of the Cold War ""these companies decided where the best places were to concentrate their manufacturing. Camden fit the bill based on high-quality workforce and low cost"" he said.

""This is representative of the best of Arkansas"" Clark said. ""We have a lot of high-quality people here. They're stable love their families work hard and pay attention to what they're doing.""

Ford dealership owner Golden says that when foreign governments say they're grateful to Arkansas for life-saving weapons produced at Camden he's ""really proud"" of where he lives.

Defense plant workers and other area residents ""realize they're doing something special"" Golden said. ""They do.""

Inflation has made it hard to buy much with a buck these days.

$1 pizza has disappeared. Dollar stores aren‚Äôt dollar stores anymore.

So wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to start paying with $2 bills instead?

‚ÄúIf you had a $2 bill perfect‚Äù said Heather McCabe a writer and $2 bill evangelist who runs the blog Two Buckaroo chronicling her spending with twos and other people‚Äôs reactions. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very useful thing to pay for a small amount.‚Äù

Yet the $2 note is the unloved child of paper currency.

It‚Äôs considered a curiosity to some and scorned by others in the United States. The myths around the $2 bill ‚Äî nicknamed ‚ÄúTom‚Äù by fans because it features Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs portrait on the front ‚Äî are endless. Many Americans think $2 bills are rare are not printed anymore or have gone out of circulation.

Wrong.

$2 bills are lighter to carry around in our wallets than ones cleaner and more efficient. MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle/Getty Images

The Treasury Department‚Äôs Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) will print up to 204 million $2 bills this year based on an annual order from the Federal Reserve System. There were 1.4 billion $2 bills in circulation in 2020 according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve.

But $2 bills account for just 0.001% of the value of the $2 trillion worth of currency in circulation.

BEP doesn‚Äôt have to request new $2 bills each year like it does for other bills. That‚Äôs because $2 bills are used so infrequently and last longer in circulation. The Fed orders them every few years and works down the inventory.

‚ÄúMany Americans have pretty dubious assumptions about the $2 bill. Nothing happened to the $2 bill. It‚Äôs still being made. It‚Äôs being circulated‚Äù McCabe said. ‚ÄúAmericans misunderstand their own currency to the extent they don‚Äôt use it.‚Äù

Bad luck

The United States first issued $2 bills beginning in 1862 around the time the federal government first started printing paper money. Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs portrait was on the two until a new series was printed in 1869 with Jefferson.

But the deuce was unpopular and never gained a foothold with the public.

A major reason: The the $2 bill was considered bad luck. Superstitious people would rip off the corners of the bill to ‚Äúreverse the curse‚Äù making the bills unfit to use.

‚ÄúHe who sits in a game of chance with a two-dollar bill in his pocket is thought to be saddled with a jinx‚Äù the New York Times said in a 1925 article. ‚ÄúThey have been avoided as ill-starred.‚Äù

The two was also known for keeping controversial company. It was associated with gambling where it was the standard bet at racetracks and prostitution.

And during the nineteenth century crony candidates frequently used $2 bills to bribe voters. Someone holding a $2 bill was thought to have sold a vote to a crooked politician.

The Treasury Department during the 1900s tried unsuccessfully several times to popularize the use of the $2 bill. In 1966 it gave up and discontinued printing the bills ‚Äúbecause a lack of public demand.‚Äù

But a decade later as the United States approached the bicentennial the Treasury designed a new $2 bill series with a portrait of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back.

The aim was to cut the number of $1 bills in circulation and save the Treasury money on production costs.

But the relaunch in 1976 failed. People viewed the new version as a collector‚Äôs item and hoarded them instead of going out and spending them.

The Postal Service offered to stamp them only on April 13 the first day they were issued in honor of Jefferson‚Äôs birthday unintentionally adding to the idea that they were commemorative bills -‚Äî a misconception that continues to this day.

‚ÄúThe press and public now tend to link the $2 bill with the Susan B. Anthony dollar under the general heading of ‚Äòfiascos‚Äô‚Äù the New York Times said in 1981.

There‚Äôs no rational reason why $2 bills aren‚Äôt as popular as other bills said Paolo Pasquariello a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. But people exhibit a preference for multiples of 1 and 5 he said.

Another reason $2 bills never took off: Cash registers invented in the late 1800s were never designed with a place to hold them so cashiers didn‚Äôt know where to stash them.

‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt an alteration of cash registers for $2 bills‚Äù said Heather McCabe. ‚ÄúThe infrastructure of paying for things didn‚Äôt change. There was not an adjustment of how people work with that bill.‚Äù

If cash registers had a familiar slot for $2 bills the bill would be more popular she argued.

$2 subculture

But there are people who swear by $2 bills. In fact communities and subcultures have developed around them.

US Air Force pilots who fly U-2 spy planes always keep a $2 bill in their flight suits.

Since the 1970s fans of Clemson University‚Äôs Tigers football team have paid and tipped with $2 bills -‚Äî ‚ÄúTiger Twos‚Äù ‚Äî in other cities‚Äô restaurants bars shops and hotels. The tradition started as a way to prove to Georgia Tech in Atlanta that it would benefit the city to schedule games against Clemson.

‚ÄúThere is a degree of popularity to them. There is a sense of excitement‚Äù said Jesse Kraft a curator at the American Numismatic Society. ‚ÄúBut as far as putting them back into circulation that‚Äôs the key that‚Äôs missing.‚Äù

Kraft is a proponent of adopting $2 bills more widely.

He notes that it‚Äôs about half as expensive for the Treasury to print a $2 bill than higher denominations which come with costlier security features on the paper. It‚Äôs also more efficient to print $2 bills than $1 bills because the Treasury can print twice as much for the same amount of money and requires less storage.

John Bennardo who made a 2015 film about $2 bills called ‚ÄúThe Two Dollar Bill Documentary‚Äù has made it his mission to ‚Äúeducate people and enlighten them and start using $2 bills in their life.‚Äù

In short he concludes $2 bills are underappreciated in the United States and a way for strangers to meet and engage.

‚ÄúYou will get remembered if you use a $2 bill‚Äù Bennardo said. ‚ÄúIt has this ability to connect people in way that other bills don‚Äôt. It opens up a dialogue between you and the cashier.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a practical bill with inflation. But it‚Äôs social currency as well.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5weW1udHMuY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwtZmlyc3QtYmFua2luZy8yMDIyL3VzLWZpbnRlY2gtd2F5YXBheS1sYXVuY2hlcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJhbmstdHJhbnNmZXItYXBwLWFpbWVkLWF0LWFmcmljYW4taW1taWdyYW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US FinTech WayaPay Launches Digital Bank Transfer App Aimed at African Immigrants,"WayaPay which describes itself as a Kenyan FinTech based in the United States says it has launched its full-service digital bank and money-transfer app tailored to the needs of immigrants from Africa.

Kenya‚Äôs ambassador to the United States Lazarus Amayo joined in the launch festivities on Sept. 16 in Washington D.C. in Washington D.C. according to Mwakilishi News.

The app was co-founded by Dr. David Wachira and Hempstone Maroria according to WayaPay. Amayo said the app and bank have all their required U.S. approvals the company‚Äôs announcement states.

The app allows free money transfers to other users and purchasing through bank cards linked to the app. The company states that users of the app can open bank accounts ‚Äúwithin minutes‚Äù and send money to mobile wallets in more than 10 countries in Africa.

‚ÄúWayaPay‚Äôs goal is to provide unlimited financial access and opportunities to everyone especially those that are underserved overlooked and misunderstood by the traditional banking systems globally with an initial focus on people living and working outside their home countries‚Äù WayaPay states on its website.

The app according to the company will allow easy transfer of funds from U.S. banks to WayaPay users. The company stated that a result will be that African immigrants will have a chance to ‚Äúbe more financially secure and financially included in the countries where they work and live.‚Äù

‚ÄúMobile money is one of the biggest African success stories. Waya wants to bring the convenience of transacting on mobile money to banking in the U.S. enabling users to transact with each other while enabling the diaspora to send money to Africa in a fast convenient and affordable way‚Äù Maroria said in a prepared statement.

PYMNTS noted that in some African countries ‚Äî Nigeria for example ‚Äî the market for banking apps could be huge because far more people have mobile devices than have bank accounts.

Wachira who used to be an official at the World Bank said Africans around the world send $50 billion home every year but lose $3 billion to unexpected fees and high rates on foreign exchange calculations.

Israel who is based in Tel Aviv was in Fort Worth to share his ideas with local leaders.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. For the unabridged version please listen to the audio file attached to this article

Bob Francis: How did you get in this field?

Haim Israel: I‚Äôve been head of thematics for give or take four years. I‚Äôve been with the bank 18 years now. I joined in 2004. At the time I was the head of the Israeli research team. Starting from 2009 I started covering telecoms and emerging telecoms. And my previous position before heading thematics was the head of emerging TMT (telecom media and technology) research team. Before that I was in an Israeli local broker house a small one and then jumped to what used to be Merrill Lynch at the time.

Francis: If you‚Äôve been covering technology and this a few years before you joined but the year 2000 there was a big drop off in technology stocks. Maybe it was ‚Äô99 2000 somewhere in there.

Israel: What thematic is and what we do and I really would like to draw the parallel to 2000 because that‚Äôs a great question. So what we do in thematics we try to look at the future. You can look at it as the futuristic position of the bank. What our world is going to look like in 10 15 20 years from today? What are the big mega trends which can impact it good and bad?. We‚Äôre not just talking about good things that might happen but unfortunately some of the mega trends are not good at all.



So when we talk about those kinds of mega trends there are three categories that we look at:

Innovation. So technology like big data AI robotics cybersecurity privacy and so on and so on.

The second category for us is people. Everything that has to do with demographics Gen Z millennials inequality aging education. Everything that is really around how our society is going to look like.

And the third one is Earth. Everything that is impacting our planet. So climate change energy transition climate wars as we call it hydrogen water waste and so on and so on. All those those are the things that we look at.



In 2000 there was a big bubble. And then yes it burst and we saw a downturn in technology. But I didn‚Äôt see that as a bubble. I actually saw that as a natural evolution of what used to be a bubble before that. So many different companies raised and had crazy valuations and so on. But the companies that survived this crisis actually became stronger much stronger.



So from 2000 we got Google and we got Apple and Amazon and we got PayPal and got all the big companies of today.



So I think that no we are right now in a market downturn and we are heading into our world of inflation and high interest rates and you see markets being very choppy. Companies that will survive this cycle I think will just come stronger. And so I really draw the parallel to 2000.

Francis: That‚Äôs interesting. Before 2000 Amazon was big but it was nothing like it is now. And I would say the same thing for Apple and they hadn‚Äôt yet introduced some of their big innovations.

Israel: Yes 2000 gave it to them. So no the technology the internet everything that‚Ä¶ We need to remember that yes the bubble burst but the internet stayed. And the internet and digital and online all that stuff helped us hook up to the iPhone and all the revolutions of Amazon and Facebook and social media and whatever everything that happened happened on the back of that.

Francis: What have you been talking to clients about now? What are the big ideas that you‚Äôre talking to them about in terms of change?

Israel: There are a couple of things that are really impacting our world right now. The first one is energy transition. We are heading into a world of energy transition partly because of the geopolitical events that we‚Äôre seeing right now because of the war in Ukraine. One of the key themes that came from the war in Ukraine is energy independence and self-reliance and accelerating the process of de-globalization. That means we are heading into a world where every country has to look closely at their natural resources and their relative advantages and leverage them and be less and less dependent on other countries. That of course leads to a process of de-globalization getting access to resources developing resources bringing operations back home rather than just relying on other countries. Same time it applies also to energy.

We need to remember that most of the world close to 80% of the planet is importing oil not exporting oil. So we are seeing countries moving very fast to alternative energy. Now alternative energy can be green energy can be other forms of energy can be developing of their own resources. Not necessarily renewable energy but the process eventually will accelerate dramatically investments in renewable energy and decrease the prices and invest and increase investment in infrastructure.

And the interesting thing is that it‚Äôs less to do with the question of whether we do or do not have a climate change problem. That‚Äôs something irrelevant. This is happening because of the geopolitical landscape right now and the need to be less dependent on fossil fuels. Because renewable energy is cheaper and getting cheaper with it when scalability is increasing.



Again that is really dependent on different technologies and different regions and whatever. But we‚Äôre talking about 20 to 30% cheaper. And so countries have an interest to move there. It‚Äôs cheaper and it makes me independent. So that‚Äôs why we are heading into a world of energy transition. And eventually I think we‚Äôll move closer to net zero. Not necessarily because of the debate do we need to save our planet yes or no?

Francis: That‚Äôs going to have some fallout consequences obviously as well right?

Israel: Yes. It has consequences on oil. We believe that we are long term reaching peak oil. It might take a decade it might take more but the demand for oil will never ever disappear. It‚Äôs very clear we need to understand that. We‚Äôll always rely on oil and fossil fuels for a very long time but the portion of oil will go down compared to other forms of energy.

And I think that it will probably peak this decade. Some estimates are already talking as soon as 2027 2028. And the portion will start to go down. So of course it has huge implications for countries which are relying on fossil fuel as their source of export Russia for example. And it has implications on the balance of power.

And the theme that we call because of that we call it climate wars. This is an important theme that we cover. What do we mean? Because of those trends that we‚Äôve seen of just that countries are moving to other forms of energy you‚Äôre starting to see that the big superpowers meaning China Europe and the United States are racing over to clean tech. Who will dominate clean technology? Because if you do dominate clean technology you control the future. If oil eventually is peaking I want to move to the next big thing. Now let‚Äôs compare to like who decades and decades ago who controlled oil. World supremacy goes through dominance in clean energy and clean tech. And China is today leader by far investing in all sorts of renewable energy wind solar batteries capacity EVs everything you can think of. Europe is not that far behind and the U.S. has to close the gap and is closing the gap. It‚Äôs starting to close the gap.

There are trillions of dollars on the line there‚Äôs world supremacy on the line and we see that accelerating all the time. So access to resources no you want renewable energy you need batteries you need lithium you need nickel you need all these stuff. So access to batteries supply lines technology R&D. Everything around that they use you see there‚Äôs a massive race to who will dominate it. Now that‚Äôs interesting because that‚Äôs actually a chicken and egg issue. Because the faster the superpowers are rushing to control clean tech the faster peak oil is coming. And again the idea is a geopolitical fight over here war over here. So again there‚Äôs this climate war thing that I think is happening. So the war in Ukraine has accelerated that. That started before the war. But now that because countries are moving rushing to diversify the energy sources the dependency on whoever controls cleantech is increasing.

Francis: We‚Äôre talking about some minerals involved here too that are currently I think only produced primarily in China.

Israel: They‚Äôre mined in different places of the world. But you‚Äôre right because the mines are controlled directly or indirectly by China. For example cobalt is mined in the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo) but China has a lot of leverage on that cohort.

Same thing with lithium. There are two things that are happening. First of all China today controls 40% of all rare earth metals directly. Indirectly this number can reach as high as 80%. Second thing is the refining of this material. So it‚Äôs not just enough to mine lithium you need to refine it. And 80% of all refineries are in China. Because those supply lines that are mining in Chile refined in China it‚Äôs completely inefficient. I don‚Äôt need to refine in China. And you know that when you buy an electric car it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a Tesla or an EV or whatever when you buy an electric car the lithium in your battery has to travel 50000 miles up to 50000 miles before you even start driving. It‚Äôs mined in Chile refined in China the cathodes are done in Japan assembly is done in the United States and then the selling is done in Europe. Completely completely inefficient.

Francis: Sounds like it.

Israel: The idea is that no countries like the United States are waking up saying ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù A) I don‚Äôt want to be reliant on China. B) I can decrease cost dramatically. So it‚Äôs mined in Chile. The mine is where the mine is you can‚Äôt move it. But all the other processes why not do it on U.S. soil or closer to home? And by cutting down dramatically the supply lines and as a result the cost as well. That could be a very deflationary process in the end because this deglobalization trend that we are seeing right now is making every country examine supply lines examine their advantages. They can‚Äôt bring everything back home. They‚Äôll never bring everything back home. They can‚Äôt. But whatever they can makes economic sense ‚Äì they‚Äôll do it. That‚Äôs I think a very deflationary process we‚Äôre saying.

Francis: They just held their opening three months ago a company MP Material they own a mine in California and they‚Äôre making the magnets going to make the magnets here in Fort Worth for the electric motors. And I realize that‚Äôs a small piece of the supply chain but ‚Äì

Israel: Yes that is just one side of it yes. I can‚Äôt remember the exact number. I think it‚Äôs like when you do that there are 80 different processes on the way done in different countries and different regions. I think it was 80 I‚Äôm not sure. But a lot of it was completely inefficient. Plus we are heading into an environment right now of slowdown of slower economic activity. If I can bring an operation back home and support employment I‚Äôll do that. A lot of it‚Äôs been based on automation it‚Äôs going to be based on new supply lines and new production facilities. So you always start to see that all over the world.

Francis: Sounds like you‚Äôre saying we need a Henry Ford of the electric car industry that will build something like he did the Rouge plant where he built made the steel and built the cars is all in one giant process.

Israel: Tesla was mumbling recently about building a lithium facility I think it was in Louisiana or something. They said exactly this ‚ÄúWhy do I need to start buying lithium from other places? And the quality is very different and then I‚Äôm relying on other countries and then I‚Äôm refining in other countries and there‚Äôs a lot of different elements in the production that I have no control over if I can do it back home.‚Äù Because I need to think about them they think about vertically. So the Henry Ford example is really good because he thought vertically.

Francis: We‚Äôve certainly seen issues with the supply chain around the world anyway in the past few years.

Israel: It started before Ukraine. Ukraine just accelerated this whole trend. Though again we can‚Äôt de-globalize. We still live in one big world and know everyone is trading with everybody but all supply lines will be examined and viewed and operations are going to be brought back home. And that‚Äôs the reassuring bring back home. That‚Äôs one thing.

The other thing which we‚Äôre actually seeing which is quite interesting is not just reshoring it‚Äôs what we call friendshoring. Because I can‚Äôt bring everything back home but if I can start buying stuff from friends countries that I trust rather than countries I don‚Äôt trust that‚Äôs another trend that we‚Äôre seeing right now. I know we spoke about batteries. You can rely on lithium which as I said a big part of the supply lines is all over the world and in different countries in Russia and in China and whatever. Or maybe I can replace that with phosphates which eventually I have at home or I have it in Canada. I trust Canada much more than I trust Russia with all due respect.

Yeah so that‚Äôs another trend that we‚Äôre seeing right now. But I think the broad line here is that this whole independence theme is getting a lot of momentum. The bottom line is I think it‚Äôs going to create it will change the supply line dramatically composition how we do things and so on and eventually economics.

Francis: And eventually there‚Äôll be some companies rising up like Amazon or Apple or someone who will dominate this area probably.

Israel: You see the big are getting bigger. And now you live in a world where cash is king. If I have cash and a lot of cash which I‚Äôll deploy it or buy stuff invest in stuff yes. So yes you will. You can see now the Google of lithium. I have no idea what‚Äôs going to be but you‚Äôll see that controlling the supply lines.

Francis: When do you see this happening? You mentioned the war in Ukraine and right before that we had COVID which also accelerated some trends. Working at home we‚Äôve talked about it for years and then it became a reality. And the war in Ukraine it really disrupted the supply lines to Europe in particular for energy. So some of these trends could accelerate but you have a timeframe?

Israel: Usually we talk about between five to 10 years. But every time you are so right because every time we say 10 years it happened before that. For example I‚Äôll give you now when I started covering thematics we thought that we‚Äôre going to get to 100% of new cars will be EVs by 2040. Now we are talking about 2030 2028 so the timeline is getting shorter and shorter all the time. And what we call techceleration the acceleration of trends because of technology. And now we have to also have geopolitics which accelerates right now.

And that‚Äôs why we say that the short term and the long term don‚Äôt exist anymore. Because think about it you get in the last two years COVID now we all stayed at home Ukraine inflation everything happened in two years. No the world has every time something big massive happens those are defining moments.

Francis: Can I ask how you see the political reaction to these changes? Are you seeing changes in laws or in the government and in terms of that they recognize this is happening?

Israel: Definitely. A lot of the stuff we‚Äôve seen recently in the United States the Inflation Reduction Act is aimed for that. We saw before that the semiconductors act. I am not exporting semiconductors technology outside without supervision and so on. Plus I‚Äôm incentivizing the semiconductors industry to manufacture back in my country. We saw the Fit for 55 bill in Europe that from here onwards whatever‚Äôs been imported to Europe has to go through a process of carbonization. And we have to see exactly what is the carbon footprint for each and everything and put carbon taxes on top of it. We saw the Versailles Declaration Committee in Europe how do I increase dramatically different industries in Europe? Semiconductors technology FinTech healthcare. Countries are putting a lot of regulation out there right now to defend and to bring back operations back home and defend their technologies.

Francis: Is there a cybersecurity component to this as well?

Israel: Oh yes big time. And we actually know I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôve mentioned it because for us this is probably one of the key themes out there when I look at the future about cybersecurity. We call it actually the beast that cannot be controlled anymore.

The beast that cannot be controlled anymore. It‚Äôs become way too big to ignore.

Just let me give you the numbers. The numbers are in 2014 there were 122000 cyber attacks all over the world every week. In 2017 this number jumped to 17 million. 2023 100 million. And the initial number we calculated for 2021 was 1.8 billion cyber attacks every week all over the world and a detection rate of 0.05%. You will never know. Most chances you will never know you‚Äôve been hacked. So I always say that the world has been divided into two people that got hacked and people that have no idea they got hacked. That‚Äôs as simple as it is.

And why now? And I‚Äôm so happy you raised that because what happened now is the war in Ukraine. Now it‚Äôs very clear and I think that although it was before that but now it‚Äôs so obvious that this is not just my problem or my organization‚Äôs problem Bank of America problem. Now it‚Äôs a national security problem. And we‚Äôve seen attacks on national critical infrastructure on a daily basis everywhere and all over the world. This is how wars are being fought. We saw that happening in Ukraine we saw hackers everywhere. We saw that on facilities in the United States. It‚Äôs huge. And it‚Äôs just becoming bigger and bigger.

And let me just give you one example how much we‚Äôre not focusing on that. So if we take the total economic damage of extreme weather of climate change in 2021 extreme weather immigration everything that happened because of climate change $3 trillion 2021. Cybersecurity has reached six. Two times and growing two times faster. So no one‚Äôs really focusing on that. And the numbers are as I said the numbers are scary in terms of how much. 92% of all eCommerce traffic are hackers. 92%.

Francis: That‚Äôs like saying take the freeway so you would have eight people who were actually going to work and 92 of them are thieves basically.

Israel: Trying to steal those 8%. Exactly those eight cars.

Francis: I know a guy who owns a cybersecurity company and he said he doesn‚Äôt have to do any advertising. He just gets calls every day basically.

Israel: Yeah. It just comes. Now there‚Äôs a saying it‚Äôs very difficult for companies to invest in cybersecurity because it‚Äôs an intangible threat. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to get tomorrow I don‚Äôt know what flood and I have to defend on that. It‚Äôs an intangible threat. And unfortunately you don‚Äôt think about it but it happens. It happens. So now finally there‚Äôs a big wake up call that we see in companies left and right defending themselves.

Francis: That‚Äôs quite a statistic.

Israel: We should talk about the moonshots about the future technologies.

So for us we define moonshots as technologies which are going to change the world but have not been commercialized yet so they‚Äôre in their development stage.

So we‚Äôve mapped 14 of these. Quantum computing is one of them. I personally think that quantum computing is a revolution that‚Äôs going to be bigger than fire and bigger than all the revolutions that humanity has seen. This is the machine that can change it all. Look at 2019. In 2019 Google announced quantum supremacy. Their announcement and I‚Äôm not saying if they‚Äôre right or wrong but their official announcement was that in 200 seconds their quantum computer made more calculations than the IBM supercomputer the fastest computer on the planet today will make in 10000 years.

Francis: Wow.

Israel: That‚Äôs their announcement. I‚Äôm not saying the right or wrong but they officially announced it. That shows the power of the machine. So it can change everything from pharmaceuticals developing drugs in seconds and do calculations very very complicated calculations on everything on genomics on big data sets on cybersecurity. That‚Äôs technically a machine that can hack everything. So it will change everything. We‚Äôre a big big believer in that. That‚Äôs one moonshot.

Couple of other examples. The metaverse. And not necessarily what you‚Äôre picturing for gaming or socializing but for us the cool applications are actually the industrial side of things. And we saw a lot of announcements done recently at Boeing that they‚Äôre going to develop the next plane on the metaverse of being a virtual marketplace where all the engineers will meet and exchange opinions and so on and have virtual models and so on. So they said the next plane if it‚Äôs going to be developed like this the costs are going to go down by 15%. That‚Äôs amazing.

And Ericsson which is a telecom equipment company tower company announced that they‚Äôre going to develop their next generation of towers and network first of all in the metaverse before they will go test it live. And Dyson the same thing the vacuum cleaner company. Dyson Hyundai have signed an agreement I think it was with Roblox. Roblox will build their own metaverse for Hyundai and Hyundai will build up the next generation of cars and future mobility on the metaverse first. So you see that the industrial segment actually took that as a great tool for efficiency for development for planning and so on rather than just not what we picture as gaming and socializing and buying real estate with places and I don‚Äôt know what. So this is what I think it‚Äôs actually quite a fascinating theme.

The other one nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion. The first nuclear fusion for cities is about to be launched in 2025 in ITER. It‚Äôs called ITER in France. But what it means it means that‚Ä¶ First of all what is nuclear fusion? Nuclear fusion is the holy grail of energy. It means that you have an unlimited amount of energy. The process that is being done basically in the sun. Unlimited amount of energy all clean and never ending. The first plant is going to come in 2025 but it‚Äôs not going to be operational at least up until the middle of the next decade. It‚Äôs just going to start creating plasma. I don‚Äôt want to get into too many technicalities but those plasma cannot be contained.

They‚Äôre expecting that by the middle of next decade it will be fully operational. And according to our calculations they can power the world or a nuclear fusion facility can power the world with the same amount of material nuclear material nuclear fuel that is equal to 11 barrels of oil. So that shows you how much energy can be created for this thing. It‚Äôs all clean. This is the holy grail but we‚Äôll see still.

Francis: And who is doing that?

Israel: ITER is a combination of all European countries. It‚Äôs not a private company. I don‚Äôt know even how many billions of dollars have been sucked into this project and keep delaying the timeline. But it‚Äôs fascinating if it‚Äôs going to work out. This is going to change-

Francis: I thought they had announced some sort of breakthrough recently.

Israel: Yeah it‚Äôs on plasma on plasma creation. But they can‚Äôt contain the plasma. They have no idea how to contain it. And that‚Äôs actually easy enough if you link it with quantum computing. That could be fascinating. Because the biggest problem in containing plasma is the amount of sheer calculation that you need to do. That‚Äôs where a lot of things are so there‚Äôs been companies like Deep Mind which came up with an AI machine learning base that actually can think about how to contain this plasma. But if those two technologies are going to be parallelly commercialized the possibilities are endless. That‚Äôs another one.

What else? We call it the nano satellites. It‚Äôs already happening. It‚Äôs not really a moonshot because this is actually a technology which we see as a technology which has already been commercialized. Starlink in Ukraine is a great example. So what we are talking about is satellites which are as big as the palm of your hand that can give you all the communication you need. And they‚Äôve already been sent by the thousands into space and we‚Äôve seen that they are already providing all your communication needs. Now Ukraine was unfortunately a case study but think about Africa that you don‚Äôt need to deploy massive infrastructure but that still can supply broadband to people everywhere. So it has a huge opportunity to change the world. So again we‚Äôre a big believer that‚Äôs actually a technology that‚Äôs already starting. Again it‚Äôs not really a moonshot. So you see Starlink you see how the companies already start to deploy those thousands of nano satellites in space.

Francis: And several companies are working on that?

Israel: There‚Äôs many Starlink is just one. There are a few. 6G is another moonshot we think. 6G is an interesting concept because 6G actually shows you how fast the world is progressing. So we believe that by 2028 5G is just not going to be enough. We are creating so much data that we are reaching full capacity of 5G. The amount of data that we‚Äôre creating every day is just humongous. The number is 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. Quintillion is a million trillion. And this number is multiplying itself every two years. So we are in a stage where we are seeing it developing the sheer amount of data is developing so fast that 5G is just not going to be enough.

So actually 5G that we always thought that going to be technology that‚Äôs going to change it all and going to change everything it‚Äôs probably going to be the shortest-lived G and will be replaced before it will be really fully globally deployed by 6G.

And 6G has depends on how or who‚Äôs defining it but anywhere between 100 to 1000 more capacity than 5G. AI embedded capabilities in it so they can do calculations. And then data trafficking the network can do it alone you don‚Äôt need human intervention. It can handle complex data. The complex data we defined as data that is being generated on other platforms would have to communicate. So for example a connected car. The car generates a lot of data but needs to communicate with all the traffic lights and the other cars and sensors and whatever. And that‚Äôs what the concept we create that we call the complex data. So 6G is one of those technologies.

I think those are the key ones that I would highlight.

Francis: Those are fascinating. And in a way it looks like we‚Äôre coming up with technologies to solve problems. You mentioned the amount of data that we manufacture it looks like we‚Äôre looking for ways to take that data and actually put it to use in some ways.

Israel: Yeah and that‚Äôs really interesting Bob because right now we are generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. You know how much we‚Äôre using out of those 2.5?

Francis: Probably a minuscule amount.

Israel: 1%. We are throwing away 99% of global data. We are not using it. So all those technologies can start using more than 1%. So think about the world that global data is multiplying faster and faster. In 2000 it was every 15 years it was doubling. In 2010 every six years. Now we are talking about every two years. Plus we are going to use 2% 3% 4%. So the rate of acceleration we‚Äôre just starting it. We didn‚Äôt see anything yet. That‚Äôs the beauty of it. So I‚Äôm really excited about it.

""We have no evidence that the incident involved access to sensitive user data (like trip history)"" the company said. ""All of our services including Uber Uber Eats Uber Freight and the Uber Driver app are operational.""

The ride-hailing company also said it's brought back online all the internal software tools it took down previously as a precaution reiterating it's notified law enforcement of the matter.

It's not immediately clear if the incident resulted in the theft of any other information or how long the intruder was inside Uber's network.

Uber has not provided more specifics of how the incident played out beyond saying its investigation and response efforts are ongoing. But independent security researcher Bill Demirkapi characterized the company's ""no evidence"" stance as ""sketchy.""

""'No evidence' could mean the attacker did have access Uber just hasn't found evidence that the attacker *used* that access for 'sensitive' user data"" Demirkapi said. ""Explicitly saying 'sensitive' user data rather than user data overall is also weird.""

The breach allegedly involved a lone hacker an 18-year-old teenager tricking an Uber employee into providing account access by social engineering the victim into accepting a multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt that allowed the attacker to register their own device.

Upon gaining an initial foothold the attacker found an internal network share that contained PowerShell scripts with privileged admin credentials granting carte blanche access to other critical systems including AWS Google Cloud Platform OneLogin SentinelOne incident response portal and Slack.

Singapore-based Group-IB's follow-up analysis of downloaded artifacts as captured in some of the screenshots shared by the threat actor has revealed them to be logs gathered from info-stealing malware that were put up for sale just days before on the cybercriminal underground.

""These logs were put up for sale on September 12 and 14 which means that this was very fresh data because the hack that utilized them was revealed from 15 to 16 September"" the cybersecurity firm said adding the logs contained authorization information for OneLogin.

""These logs indicate that at least two Uber employees (from Indonesia and Brazil) have been infected by stealer malware: Raccoon and Vidar stealers"" Group-IB said suggesting the hacker may also have attempted to use the purchased stolen data to advance through Uber's network.

Worryingly as revealed by security researcher Sam Curry the teen hacker is also said to have gotten hold of privately disclosed vulnerability reports submitted via HackerOne as part of Uber's bug bounty program.

HackerOne has since moved to disable Uber's account but the unauthorized access to unpatched security flaws in the platform could pose a huge security risk to the San Francisco-based firm should the hacker opt to sell the information to other threat actors for a quick profit.

So far the attacker's motivations behind the breach are unclear although a message posted by the hacker announcing the breach on Slack included a call for higher pay for Uber's drivers.

A separate report from The Washington Post noted that the attacker broke into the company's networks for fun and might leak the company's source code in a matter of months while describing Uber's security as ""awful.""

""Many times we only talk about APTs like nation states and we forget about other threat actors including disgruntled employees insiders and like in this case hacktivists"" Ismael Valenzuela Espejo vice president of threat research and intelligence at BlackBerry said.

""Organizations should include these as part of their threat modeling exercises to determine who may have a motivation to attack the company their skill level and capabilities and what the impact could be according to that analysis.""

The attack targeting Uber as well as the recent string of incidents against Twilio Cloudflare Cisco and LastPass illustrates how social engineering continues to be a persistent thorn in the flesh for organizations.

It also shows that all it takes for a breach to take place is an employee to share their login credentials proving that password-based authentication is a weak link in account security.

""Once again we see that a company's security is only as good as their most vulnerable employees"" Masha Sedova co-founder and president of Elevate Security said in a statement.

""We need to think beyond generic training instead let's pair our riskiest employees with more specific protective controls. As long as we continue to address cybersecurity as solely a technical challenge we will continue to lose this battle"" Sedova added.

Episodes like these are also proof that Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) codes ‚Äì typically generated via authenticator apps or sent as SMS messages ‚Äì are inadequate at securing 2FA roadblocks.

One way to counter such threats is the use of phishing-resistant FIDO2-compliant physical security keys which drops passwords in favor of an external hardware device that handles the authentication.

""MFA providers should *by default* automatically lock accounts out temporarily when too many prompts are sent in a short period of time"" Demirkapi alternatively suggested urging organizations to limit privileged access.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjIvMDkvMTgvdWJlci1kYXRhLWJyZWFjaC1oYWNrZWQtcGhpc2hpbmcvMTA0MTk3NjEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber data breach: Employee apparently tricked into sharing credentials,"Frank Bajak

Associated Press

The ride-hailing service Uber said Friday that all its services were operational following what security professionals are calling a major data breach claiming there was no evidence the hacker got access to sensitive user data.

But the breach apparently by a lone hacker put the spotlight on an increasingly effective break-in routine involving social engineering: The hacker apparently gained access posing as a colleague tricking an Uber employee into surrendering their credentials.

They were then able to locate passwords on the network that got them the level of privileged access reserved for system administrators.

The potential damage was serious: Screenshots the hacker shared with security researchers indicate they obtained full access to the cloud-based systems where Uber stores sensitive customer and financial data.

It is not known how much data the hacker stole or how long they were inside Uber's network. Two researchers who communicated directly with the person ‚Äì who self-identified as an 18-year-old to one of them ‚Äì said they appeared interested in publicity. There was no indication they destroyed data.

But files shared with the researchers and posted widely on Twitter and other social media indicated the hacker was able to access Uber's most crucial internal systems.

‚ÄúIt was really bad the access he had. It's awful‚Äù said Corben Leo one of the researchers who chatted with the hacker online.

Cybersecurity community reacts

The cybersecurity community's online reaction ‚Äì Uber also suffered a serious 2016 breach ‚Äì was harsh.

The hack ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt sophisticated or complicated and clearly hinged on multiple big systemic security culture and engineering failures‚Äù tweeted Lesley Carhart incident response director of Dragos Inc. which specializes in industrial-control systems.

Leo said screenshots the hacker shared showed the intruder got access to systems stored on Amazon and Google cloud-based servers where Uber keeps source code financial data and customer data such as driver's licenses.

‚ÄúIf he had keys to the kingdom he could start stopping services. He could delete stuff. He could download customer data change people‚Äôs passwords‚Äù said Leo a researcher and head of business development at the security company Zellic.

Screenshots the hacker shared ‚Äì many of which found their way online ‚Äì showed sensitive financial data and internal databases accessed. Also widely circulating online: The hacker announcing the breach Thursday on Uber's internal Slack collaboration system.

Leo along with Sam Curry an engineer with Yuga Labs who also communicated with the hacker said there was no indication that the hacker had done any damage or was interested in anything more than publicity.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs a young hacker because he wants what 99% of what young hackers want which is fame‚Äù Leo said.

Uber: no evidence hacker accessed sensitive user data

Curry said he spoke to several Uber employees Thursday who said they were ‚Äúworking to lock down everything internally‚Äù to restrict the hacker‚Äôs access. That included the San Francisco company‚Äôs Slack network he said.

In a statement posted online Friday Uber said ‚Äúinternal software tools that we took down as a precaution yesterday are coming back online.‚Äù

It said all its services ‚Äì including Uber Eats and Uber Freight ‚Äì were operational and that it had notified law enforcement. The FBI said via email that it is ""aware of the cyber incident involving Uber and our assistance to the company is ongoing.‚Äù

Uber said there was no evidence that the intruder accessed ‚Äúsensitive user data‚Äù such as trip history but did not respond to questions from The Associated Press including about whether data was stored encrypted.

Uber safety report:Uber details nearly 4000 incidents of sexual assault misconduct in latest safety report

Curry and Leo said the hacker did not indicate how much data was copied. Uber did not recommend any specific actions for its users such as changing passwords.

The hacker alerted the researchers to the intrusion Thursday by using an internal Uber account on the company‚Äôs network used to post vulnerabilities identified through its bug-bounty program which pays ethical hackers to ferret out network weaknesses.

After commenting on those posts the hacker provided a Telegram account address. Curry and other researchers then engaged them in a separate conversation where the intruder provided the screenshots as proof.

The AP attempted to contact the hacker at the Telegram account but received no response.

'Most orgs in the world could be hacked'

Screenshots posted online appeared to confirm what the researchers said the hacker claimed: That they obtained privileged access to Uber‚Äôs most critical systems through social engineering.

The apparent scenario:

The hacker first obtained the password of an Uber employee likely through phishing. The hacker then bombarded the employee with push notifications asking they confirm a remote log-in to their account. When the employee did not respond the hacker reached out via WhatsApp posing as a fellow worker from the IT department and expressing urgency. Ultimately the employee caved and confirmed with a mouse click.

Social engineering is a popular hacking strategy as humans tend to be the weakest link in any network. Teenagers used it in 2020 to hack Twitter and it has more recently been used in hacks of the tech companies Twilio and Cloudflare said Rachel Tobac CEO of SocialProof Security which specializes in training workers not to fall victim to social engineering.

‚ÄúThe hard truth is that most orgs in the world could be hacked in the exact way Uber was just hacked‚Äù Tobac tweeted. In an interview she said ‚Äúeven super tech savvy people fall for social engineering methods every day.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttackers are getting better at by-passing or hi-jacking MFA (multi-factor authentication)‚Äù said Ryan Sherstobitoff a senior threat analyst at SecurityScorecard.

That's why many security professionals advocate the use of so-called FIDO physical security keys for user authentication. Adoption of such hardware has been spotty among tech companies however.

The hack also highlighted the need for real-time monitoring in cloud-based systems to better detect intruders said Tom Kellermann of Contrast Security. ‚ÄúMuch more attention must be paid to protecting clouds from within‚Äù because a single master key can typically unlock all their doors.

In 2017 Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle an FTC lawsuit that accused the company of using exaggerated earnings claims to recruit prospective drivers. Since then Uber and its main competitor Lyft have offered only general compensation estimations on their driver-info pages.

So if you‚Äôre considering signing on with either company how much can you really expect to make? The answer that GOBankingRates got from real-life side hustlers is pretty much in line with the one that both companies spell out on their websites: it depends. Let‚Äôs explore the situation.

Estimated Earnings Data Is All Over the Place

According to the top career and salary data sites if you drive for Uber or Lyft you‚Äôll be either wealthy almost broke or something in between.

Salary.com gives almost identical annual earnings ranges for both rideshare companies:

Uber: $25366 in the 10th percentile to $53259 in the 90th percentile with a median of $37402

Lyft: $25367 in the 10th percentile to $53260 in the 90th percentile with a median of $37403

Glassdoor gives a difficult-to-believe average of more than $75000 about double the Salary.com median and more than twice the $32645 that Indeed cites as the average. It says that the top-earning drivers pull in $185000 a year. ZipRecruiter says the average is more like $50000.

Many Variables Will Determine Your Earnings

Both Uber and Lyft clearly state that earnings vary based on a long list of variables. The drivers who can plan for those variables and work them to their advantage are the ones who earn the most.

‚ÄúAs an Uber or Lyft driver my earnings depend on a number of factors‚Äù said RideFAQs founder Todd Bissell who has been driving for both Uber and Lyft since 2018. ‚ÄúThe most important factor is the number of rides I give. Other factors include the time of day the demand for rides and the length of the ride. If I give an average of 10 rides per hour I make around $20 per hour. According to this estimate I earn about $160 per day or $800 per week. Of course these numbers vary depending on the factors mentioned above.‚Äù

Location Is the Biggest Individual Factor

An extra $3200 per month would be a welcome boost for just about everyone but two different drivers who work the same number of hours can earn a much different wage depending on what kinds of rides they‚Äôre giving and most importantly where they‚Äôre giving them.

Story continues

‚ÄúAs a driver for Uber or Lyft you can expect to earn a good wage‚Äù said Bissell. ‚ÄúHowever how much you earn will depend on a number of factors including the city you drive in the amount of time you spend driving and the number of fares you pick up.‚Äù

Rideshare driver assistant Gridwise used data from its own app to identify the best-paying cities for Uber and Lyft drivers. Its methodology included the cost of gas and insurance which affect net pay the most. Therefore San Francisco was removed from the list despite being in the top five because the cost of gas is so expensive in California.

These are the highest-paying metro areas in America in terms of hourly earnings:

Pittsburgh: $26.44

Chicago: $29.10

Denver: $29.28

Portland: $30.72

Boston: $32.54

Those cities however are outliers.

‚ÄúIn general Uber and Lyft drivers in large cities can expect to earn $15-$20 per hour‚Äù said Bissell. ‚ÄúIn smaller cities earnings may be lower but there are also fewer expenses associated with driving such as gas and parking.‚Äù

No Matter the City Savvy Drivers Always Earn the Most

Both Uber and Lyft outline strategies for making the most money as a driver like using the app to work when and where demand is highest.

‚ÄúThe best way to maximize your earnings as a driver is to drive during peak times such as during rush hour or on weekends‚Äù said Bissell. ‚ÄúYou can also earn more by picking up multiple fares in a short period of time.‚Äù

Smart drivers also pursue big events holidays and other peak surge times.

‚ÄúOn high-volume nights like New Year‚Äôs Eve I could make $300 an hour‚Äù said life coach Star Staubach who has driven for Lyft for several years. ‚ÄúIn order to make a living wage you‚Äôve got to be willing to put in the hours and be strategic about driving ‚Äî hitting peak times driving the crowds for concerts NFL game days and holidays.‚Äù

No matter how much you earn of course any job is always better if you enjoy what you do.

‚ÄúDriving for Lyft and Uber was the greatest social experiment I‚Äôve ever experienced‚Äù said Staubach. ‚ÄúI came across a wide slice of life and loved it.‚Äù

News of Senfield‚Äôs death sent shock waves through the UT campus and his hometown of Orchard Park New York.

Carson Senfield was shot and killed as he tried to get into the wrong car according to the Tampa Police Department. Photo is courtesy of the Orchard Park School District.

David Lillec the superintendent of the Orchard Park School District released a photo of Senfield and share the following statement:

""It saddens me greatly to inform you that the Orchard Park community has suffered a tragic loss as Carson Senfield a 2021 graduate of Orchard Park High School passed away today.

The brand launches with the U.S.‚Äô largest specialty beauty retailer digitally on Sunday and will go into 715 doors nationally on Oct. 16.

Despite the brand‚Äôs age ‚Äî it only launched earlier this year ‚Äî it has already hit $9 million in retail sales via its existing partnership with Target and is on track to hit $15 million for its first year there the brand confirmed to WWD.

Byoma is owned by Future Beauty Labs the parent company behind Tan-Luxe Tanologist and Isle of Paradise. The company‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Marc Elrick told WWD it was born out of consumer insights.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a consumer-led business‚Äù he said of the brand‚Äôs inception. ‚ÄúDuring the pandemic we noticed internally and what we saw on social was the consumer over-exfoliating. With the rise of DermTok and a lot of conflicting information out there I felt like the consumer was more informed but maybe more confused.

‚ÄúWhen we looked at the data insights as well as our own social media platforms we noticed it was a really big problem‚Äù he continued.

Social media‚Äôs role in the brand‚Äôs creation didn‚Äôt end there. The brand which houses its formulas in Gen Z-friendly vibrantly colored packaging has already gained 200000 social media followers. Its Moisturizing Gel Cream is the brand‚Äôs top seller given its TikTok virality status with 1.7 million views.

The brand‚Äôs offerings include a cleanser three serums the moisturizer and a hydrating trio kit. Each product incorporates a proprietary barrier-health complex with ceramides cholesterol and fatty acids at optimal ratios. Prices range from $12.99 to $24.99 and the full assortment will be available at Ulta.

As reported by WWD Ulta Beauty is winning with the Gen Z consumer. A Piper Sandler survey cited the retailer as the top retailer for the cohort nabbing 48 percent mindshare.

Though the brand plays well with younger consumers Elrick stressed that Byoma‚Äôs appeal spans demographics. ‚ÄúEvery single person has a skin barrier and every single person can benefit from barrier care whether your barrier is compromised or not‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve noticed from the data we‚Äôre starting to get back from our retailers is that it‚Äôs appealing to a much broader demographic.‚Äù Byoma also over-indexes with Gen X.

‚ÄúOur vision is to build the next CeraVe‚Äù Elrick continued. ‚ÄúWith the demand we‚Äôve had from retailers globally and the roadmap that we‚Äôve built we will absolutely get there.‚Äù

The brand which recently expanded across European markets anticipates it will exceed between $300 million and $500 million in retail sales in the next three years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDkxODAwNTAyNC9lbi9GdXR1cmUtQmVhdXR5LUxhYnMtQW5ub3VuY2VzLUJZT01BJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1SZXRhaWwtRXhwYW5zaW9uLUludG8tVWx0YS1CZWF1dHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future Beauty Labs Announces BYOMA's Retail Expansion Into Ulta Beauty,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following its explosive success in the US and UK skincare innovation house Future Beauty Labs announces the retail expansion of its award-winning skincare line BYOMA into Ulta Beauty.

Cosmetics prices rose by 2.3% between July to August 2022 according to market research firm NPD Group.

The recent increase is the largest price hike in the cosmetics industry since December 2006.

The pressure on prices will remain high says Ulta's VP of Merchandising.

With more people returning back to school the office or even gathering in person for the first since the pandemic the pressure to quite literally put your best face forward seems higher than ever.

Prices for makeup bath and nail products increased by 2.6% from July to August 2022 according to data from market research firm NPD reported by Bloomberg. That's the biggest price hike since 2006.

NPD's report also found that beauty was the only category that grew on a unit sales basis between July 2021 and July 2022 indicating that growing costs have not dampened demand.

Changes in cosmetics prices over the past five years based on data from the consumer price index via U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Andy Kiersz

Maria Salcedo senior vice president of merchandising for national beauty chain Ulta said demand for cosmetics remains strong despite price hikes.

""Consumers continue to adjust to inflation pressures by spending thoughtfully on what's valuable and important to them including beauty"" Salcedo told Insider by email. ""We executed some price increases throughout the first half of the year which is common across retail and beauty. We continue to expect pricing pressure compared to historical trends.""

In late August Coty ‚Äî a multinational beauty company that owns brands like Sally Hansen Covergirl and Kylie Cosmetics ‚Äî instituted its second round of price increases for the year.

The robust demand for cosmetics amid an economic downturn isn't a new trend however.

During the recession of 2001 Leonard Lauder heir of makeup mogul Estee Lauder is said to have coined the term ""Lipstick Index."" Lauder had noticed that despite an eight-month downturn during which employment fell by 1.3 million lipstick sales were up.

The idea is that products like lipstick can lift peoples' spirits even during hard times. The relatively lower price point ‚Äî compared to splurges like cars homes or expensive vacations ‚Äî makes the category feel like an ""affordable luxury.""

Others believe demand is strong because cosmetics and personal care products are a necessity.

""You are not going to stop cleansing or moisturizing your face in a recession but you might look for a lower-cost solution available at a drugstore or Target vs at a high-end spa"" Krista Moatz a beauty investor and founder of the beauty lifestyle and entertainment site Popsugar told Insider by email.

I have been ""Keeping Up With"" Kylie Jenner's brand Kylie Cosmetics since the brand's very first drop. As a lipstick enthusiast those two-piece lip kits are an absolute essential in my makeup bag. I am always eating drinking and talking. If I want a lipstick that lasts through all that liquid lipstick is the way to go because it stays put without any worry. If you want color that stays on your lips instead of transferring liquid lipstick is definitely the right choice. If you're a huge fan of PDA then liquid lipstick is what you need to keep your glam intact post-makeout.

These two-piece lip kits have gorgeous shades and remarkable staying power without feeling dry on my lips. There are so many celebrity beauty brands these days but the Kylie Cosmetics Matte Lip Kits are truly in a league of their own. There's a 24-hour flash sale at Ulta. You can get these two-piece sets for just $16 which means you'll get each item for $8.

If you already know what's up jump on this deal and add some lip kits to your cart before they sell out. If you're not familiar with Kylie Cosmetics I strongly encourage you to check these out. I'm not gonna lie I love them all but I do have my favorite hues. I think Mary Jo K is the ideal shade of red. Kristen is my absolute favorite lip kit a pink with some brown undertones (I always make sure I have two of these so I never run out). I love Exposed for a classic nude lip. In all honesty I can give you my review for every single shade but I will let you pick your new favorite on your own."

The current contract for UPS truck drivers and delivery employees started on Aug. 1 2018. It is set to expire on July 31 2023 but before it does teamsters are asking for more benefits.

Represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters labor union UPS employees are counting down till Aug. 1 2023 to start their strike if the company doesn‚Äôt level with them.

Employees have been demanding for months that UPS provide better pay and more benefits especially for part-time workers.

UPS said that its employees can make up to an average of $93000 after working four years according to a press release. However job search services like ZipRecruiter report that the average salary of a UPS delivery worker tends to be around $38000 which is much lower than what UPS said.

Through the COVID-19 pandemic UPS raised hourly wages from $15.33 to $18 to keep workers from leaving. Although workers were told this change would be permanent at the time UPS later told employees that it will be changing hourly wages back to $15.33.

The pay cut may make it difficult for workers who relied on the increased pay to get by especially as the United States experiences high inflation.

‚ÄúWith inflation $15.33 an hour is tough for workers and their families‚Äù Alex Sanchez who works part-time for UPS told The Guardian. ‚ÄúI work two jobs in order to make ends meet. I‚Äôm a married father of three. The $3 cut really takes a toll on our family‚Äôs budget.‚Äù

Additionally following an intense nationwide heat wave over the summer the demand for air conditioning in delivery trucks grew. Drivers may deliver between 150 to 300 packages per day.

The heat-related death of 24-year-old UPS driver Esteban Chavez raised awareness of the lack of air conditioning in the company‚Äôs delivery trucks. Matt Leichenger who delivers packages in Brooklyn tweeted about UPS denying his fan installation request for his truck.

To help get their voices heard more UPS employees are joining the Teamsters union. Sean O‚ÄôBrien who serves as the union‚Äôs president is aware of the upcoming ‚Äúbig fight‚Äù with UPS.

‚ÄúWe need everyone to join us as we take on the company in negotiations‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien told union members in Montana according to a press release. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to mobilize and send a message that UPS Teamsters are united and ready to fight for a strong contract in 2023.‚Äù

The last time UPS workers held a strike was in 1997 and it lasted two weeks. If a new strike does happen it is projected to become one of the biggest labor strikes in the nation‚Äôs history.

With strikes and unionizations happening in major companies like coffeehouse chain Starbucks Corp. and supermarket chain Trader Joe‚Äôs UPS workers are also gaining more confidence in standing up to the company.

A strike may bring trouble to American customers. UPS delivers 21.5 million packages and transports 6% of the U.S. gross domestic product both on a yearly basis.

Even if UPS‚Äô competitors ‚Äî such as Amazon.com Inc. FedEx Corp. and the U.S. Postal Service ‚Äî were to take over the delivery of these packages there still wouldn‚Äôt be enough workers to deliver them according to an analysis by CNN.

With online shopping habits rising reliance on package delivery services is also rising. Consumers would expect long delays or even lost packages since UPS would be running shortstaffed with non-union employees thus creating frustration.

‚ÄúUPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees customers and the communities where we live and work‚Äù UPS said in a statement as reported by CNN. ‚ÄúWe believe we‚Äôll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that‚Äôs good for everyone.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FzMXN0ZnJlZWRvbS5vcmcvY29udGVudC91cHMtZnVydGhlci1jbGFtcHMtZG93bi1vbi1maXJlYXJtcy1zaGlwbWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPS Further Clamps Down on Firearms Shipments | An Official Journal Of The NRA,"The United Parcel Service (UPS) has followed up its decision to enforce the new Biden administration rule on gun parts a month before it took effect with a new restrictive firearms shipping policy that could prove troublesome to gunmakers and gun owners.

The new UPS Tariff/Terms and Conditions of Service indicates that only licensed dealers importers manufacturers and collectors will be able to ship firearms products or parts via UPS.

‚ÄúPackages containing firearms (as defined by Title 18 Chapter 44 and Title 26 Chapter 53 of the United States Code) and firearms parts that do not constitute firearms as defined by federal law (together ‚ÄúFirearms Products‚Äù) are accepted for transportation only as a contractual service and only from Shippers who are licensed importers licensed manufacturers licensed dealers or licensed collectors (as defined in Title 18 Chapter 44 of the United States Code)‚Äù the terms read.

According to letters sent to some manufacturers by UPS one requirement for shipping with UPS is that gunmakers sign a written UPS Firearms Agreement for shipping firearms and firearm parts. The UPS Handguns Exception Agreement which is required for shipping handguns and is only good for one year spells out some strict requirements that if not met could end in quick termination by UPS.

One stipulation of the handgun agreement which was shared with us by a manufacturer who wished to remain anonymous stated: ‚ÄúCustomer agrees to ship an average of fifty (50) or more handguns shipments per day via UPS. In the event this volume commitment is not maintained during the Term of this Agreement UPS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on ten (10) days‚Äô notice.‚Äù

Of course this could have a negative impact on small manufacturers who typically don‚Äôt ship that many guns. Also high-end custom gunmakers who also deal in much smaller numbers could be negatively impacted by it.

Per UPS‚Äôs new Agreement For Transporting Firearms Or Firearms Parts the company can unilaterally decide if they don‚Äôt want to continue in a contract with a manufacturer whether or not the manufacturer has done anything wrong or agrees with that decision.

‚ÄúUPS may suspend or terminate delivery services for Shipper or terminate this Agreement immediately and cease providing service if UPS determines in its sole and unlimited discretion that such action is prudent or necessary‚Äù the agreement reads.

Despite the fact that all requirements are spelled out in the agreement the company also reserves the right to change the rules of the game at any time without input from manufacturers.

‚ÄúUPS may modify or amend any requirements for Firearm Products Shipments at any time‚Äù the agreement states. ‚ÄúBy tendering Firearm Products Shipments to UPS for shipment Shipper agrees to be bound by UPS‚Äôs requirements in effect at the time of shipping.‚Äù

The latest changes along with the earlier decision on shipping gun parts are likely a result of a strongly worded letter sent on May 19 to UPS Federal Express the U.S. Postal Service and trucking and rail carriers by five anti-gun U.S. senators blaming shipping companies for playing a part in the country‚Äôs criminal violence problem.

TikToker Mykol Gummings (@mykol_gummings) shared a secondary video to let his viewers know that the CEO of United Parcel Service sent him a challenge coin for his promotion of the company‚Äôs high rate of worker compensation.

‚ÄúThis is too dope‚Äù he says in the video. ‚ÄúThe UPS CEO just sent me a letter. It reads ‚ÄòDear Mykol I watched the awesome TikTok video of you sharing how well UPS drivers are compensated. Please let me know that video made my day. I want to personally express my gratitude to you for being a terrific brand ambassador. Thank you for helping spread the word about how UPS is a great place to work. As a small token of appreciation please accept this UPS challenge coin reserved for UPSers who go above and beyond.‚Äù‚Äù

While he appreciated the challenge coin he shared that he still expected additional compensation for the video tagging UPS in the caption.

‚ÄúShout out to UPS‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI still want my check though.‚Äù

Some viewers thought Gummings should have received additional compensation for advertising the company.

‚ÄúThey gave you a coin bruh?‚Äù one commenter wrote. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt give you a raise.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn if it were my company and I were that grateful I‚Äôd send him a bonus not a friggin coin‚Äù another said. ‚ÄúBut awesome they showed appreciation to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy man giving them free marketing and they compensate him with a medal?‚Äù a third viewer added. ‚ÄúYou deserve a raise.‚Äù

I returned home with seven pieces of bread when this amount used to be enough for 14.‚Äù

In the district of Pichacani in Peru‚Äôs southern province of Puno many are struggling with rising costs of living. Located at 3900 meters above sea level the climate in Pichacani is characterized by low temperatures strong winds and intense precipitation. These conditions pose a challenge for small-scale agriculture which along with animal herding contributes to people‚Äôs livelihoods. Recent price increases in food and fuel represent an additional stress for families just emerging from the hardships of the pandemic making it necessary to adopt strategies to mitigate hunger in the midst of an economic and political crisis in the country.

Efforts to address high rates of childhood anemia and malnutrition in the province of Puno have stalled due to the pandemic and could be made more difficult with the elevated cost of food. Faced with economic uncertainty the news of the arrival of monkeypox and the fourth wave of Covid-19 was no longer cause for surprise or concern because the main worry on people‚Äôs minds was the provision of the family food basket and meeting basic needs.

We spoke with small scale farmers in Puno earlier this year about how they are coping with the increased cost of living and food insecurity in the region. At the end of the May harvest peasant producers had to spend more for foods that they were used to sharing at the family table. The high cost of agricultural products affected the family economy while spikes in the cost of fuel brought with it an increase in bus fares freight for the transport of goods tractor rentals and equipment used in agricultural activity. These costs doubled and rural families had to absorb production expenses that were not foreseen in the previous agricultural season.

Challenges to Traditional Food Systems

The food crisis in the first quarter of 2022 disrupted already vulnerable food systems in the highlands making more evident the lack of machinery and equipment for the transformation of agricultural products the effects of climate change and the government‚Äôs inadequate management of resources in the agricultural and livestock sector. With the increase in food costs the day's wages were only enough to buy a few products and families worried about the threat of famine and other economic difficulties. In the local primary school when teachers asked students to bring fruit for snack time not everyone had the means to bring something to eat. In their homes there were days when the foods that are essential for children‚Äôs development and nutrition were out of reach for many families. Many families were forced to seek additional income to cover the rising expenses of the family food basket.

Adding to the setbacks of the 2022 agricultural season inclement weather such as frost and hailstorms affected the potato oca (a variety of Andean tuber) and quinoa crops. In previous years the oca harvest was good and there were large potatoes for consumption but this year most farmers harvested only medium and small potatoes. In addition to providing sustenance large potatoes can be used to barter for meat alpaca fiber or dairy products. But with smaller potatoes the only alternative was to make chu√±o a process that consists of dehydrating potatoes to preserve them. This ancient food is still consumed in the Andes and helps families mitigate the impact of food insecurity. Both chu√±o and potatoes are present in soups (chairo) stews and many other typical dishes. The highland‚Äôs low overnight temperatures and intense sunlight during the day allow the elaboration of this product in its various presentations such as tunta or moraya‚Äîwhite chu√±o or black chu√±o. By making chu√±o a portion of the harvest can be preserved for future consumption.

Many of the locally produced foods such as quinoa ca√±ihua (an Andean grain) wheat potatoes and oca consumed by rural communities are rich in nutrients. Farmers complement these traditional agricultural products with dairy and vegetables usually purchased in local markets. With support from FONCODES (Fondo de Cooperaci√≥n para el Desarrollo Social) vegetable gardens or biohuertos provide an alternative for families to grow their own foods. Although this project was put on hold due to problems with project management some families continue to maintain biohuertos on their own.

Many small farmers and agronomists that we spoke to attributed the problems with agricultural production to a lack of government investment at the central regional and local levels. Inadequate government support was especially disillusioning to those who voted for Pedro Castillo in the last presidential election. A former schoolteacher and union leader with a rural background Castillo promised a ‚Äúsecond agrarian reform‚Äù that would benefit small producers.

According to one community member ‚Äúfor agriculture it has only been false promises. Everything has gone up there is no support for Puno which supported [Castillo]. He should support the countryside with projects.‚Äù Since the start of his presidency in July 2021 constant changes in his cabinet‚Äîincluding five agriculture ministers in 10 months‚Äîas well as corruption allegations and the opposition‚Äôs continued efforts to oust him have created social and political instability at a time when rural communities most need assistance.

One of the few sources of government support during the pandemic were ‚Äúbonos‚Äù (cash transfers of between s./350 and s./700 or $90 to $180) given to low-income families. Some of these payments continued into 2022 and the government started distributing food vouchers of s./270 ($70) to offset high food prices in August. According to our interviewees the pandemic vouchers helped cover some basic expenses like payments for phones electricity water and school fees but they were not enough to make up for the higher cost of food.

Another challenge for rural families in post-pandemic times has been the increased cost of gas with the price of a gas cylinder increasing from s./30 to around s./60 ($15.50). As a result families in rural areas returned to cooking with cow manure (bosta) and firewood. Even in cities smoke coming from houses could be glimpsed in the distance a sign that they were preparing food. This was not a common sight before‚Äî most families only used gas rather than collecting manure and cooking with a traditional clay stove. But now in cities like Puno and Juliaca dung has been commercialized again and people use wood stoves on terraces in the street or on patios to prepare their food.

Between Rural and Urban Life

For many people striving to feed their families the only option has been to reduce their food rations. At the beginning of the pandemic some returned to rural areas. At first living in the countryside was a survival strategy. However this turned out to be complicated for those people who made their lives in big cities where they had access to basic services. Children who were in school required internet electricity media and telephone services. These communication gaps and barriers made it difficult to stay in rural areas.

For grandparents the return of their family members to the countryside was a dream come true. But it created additional challenges for unemployed heads of households who were forced to return to the city in search of new work opportunities. Yet the elderly also do their part working the land to produce food and safeguarding seeds and knowledge. Seed saving contributes to food sovereignty and the use of manual tools and traditional agricultural methods reduce production costs without relying on costly fertilizers or farm equipment rentals which have also gone up in price.

For the families of the altiplano agriculture is fundamental. In the Aymara tradition farmers make ritual offerings to the Pachamama as thanks for protecting them from hunger and providing nutritious food. Given the circumstances that the world is going through‚Äîfrom climate change to the war in Ukraine‚Äîfamily farming the raising of sheep and alpacas the sale of cow's milk and the making of handicrafts represent important ways of securing basic necessities in rural areas.

Traditional agriculture including the locally produced foods that make up the Andean diet can contribute to household food security in times of economic uncertainty and disruptions to the global food system. However the neglect of the agricultural sector by the government and low agricultural yields continue to pose significant challenges for small farmers. The rising costs of production and appealing employment opportunities in the city also disrupt the viability of small-scale agriculture. Still in spite of these challenges rural families persevere sustaining their traditional ways of life in the countryside.

United has recently made significant changes to its Family Medicare Policy and Super Top-Up Medicare Policy. I discuss why we purchased the revised top-up cover with Rs. 95 lakhs sum insured in this article. If you are looking to buy base or super top-up health insurance this may be useful: Select the right health insurance policy with these free resources.

Warning: The following is not a recommendation of United India health insurance policies. Please select one as per your personal circumstances.

In Sep 2021 we reported the New features introduced in United India Insurance Family Medicare Policy. The most significant change is the In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover for a sum insured of Rs. 5 Lacs and above comes with ‚Äú1% of Sum Insured or Single Occupancy Standard AirConditioned Room Charges whichever is higher‚Äù.

This effectively means no room rent sub-limit for a single standard AC room. Also there is no limit on ICU rent. The maximum sum insured has been revised from Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs. These are welcome features in a PSU insurance policy. The biggest criticism of PSU policies has been removed by these changes in my opinion.

So last year I revised the cover for myself my wife and my son to Rs. 25 lakhs. This is an individual cover. The latest costs are listed below.

The above changes are only for the family medicare policy. The individual health insurance policy was not yet revised at the time of writing.

United India also removed the room rent limits on their Super Top Up plans by then. In Feb 2022 they launched a revised Super Top Up Cover with Rs. 95 lakhs sum insured. The key changes are:

There are no room rent or ICU rent sub-limits. The revised sum insured and threshold limits (aka deductible in brackets) are given below. 3 Lacs 5 Lacs (2 Lacs)

3 Lacs 5 Lacs 7 Lacs (3 Lacs)

5 Lacs 10 Lacs 15 Lacs 20 Lacs 45 Lacs 70 Lacs 95 Lacs (5 Lacs)

10 Lacs 15 Lacs 20 Lacs 40 Lacs 65 Lacs 90 Lacs (10 Lacs)

15 Lacs 35 Lacs 60 Lacs 85 Lacs (15 Lacs)

20 Lacs 30 Lacs 55 Lacs 80 Lacs (20 Lacs)

25 Lacs 50 Lacs 75 Lacs (25 Lacs)

New Policy Names: (links point to policy wording pdf files).

Our United India policy: We have held this policy from 2006 onwards and processed five claims: thrice for my mother once for me and once for my son. The claim processing experience has been smooth to combative (complaints to United‚Äôs grievance portal are handled reasonably fast).

Over a lifetime we are liable to make many claims for our family and we should know how to fight our case. Yes the guy who sold the policy will say he will help you process claims but it is naive to believe such deal-closers.

One lesson I have learnt the hard way is always opt for cashless if the admission is in a network hospital. Try to get admitted to a network hospital when possible.

I fully appreciate that not everyone can afford the high premiums mentioned below. Health insurance purchase is primarily governed by affordability.

Why we increased the base policy to Rs. 25 lakhs even though the super top-up has a deductible of only Rs. 5 lakhs?

To reduce the chance of invoking the top-up policy. Top-up policy claim processing is a pain even from the same insurer.

With Rs. 25 lakhs we can opt for a comfortable single room (better than a standard ac room) as per the ‚Äú1% of Sum Insured‚Äù clause.

Why we increased the super top-up to Rs. 95 lakhs: Unlike the base policy which is an individual cover this is a floater cover. So the higher the better. Also the cost will not be too high since Rs. 5 lakh is deductible.

Insurance details:

All costs include GST and no claim discounts. The enhanced United Super Top cover begins on 1st Nov 2022. The annual recurring deposit meant for paying premiums matures in September each year so the renewal is made then.

Group health insurance offered by employer Rs. 3L. It can be enhanced up to 7L but I chose not. We have made one claim with it ‚Äì pregnancy which United does not cover.

United Family Medicare: Rs. 25L each for myself (age 48) my wife (age 46) and my son (age 12). Total cost: Rs. 68007/-

United Family Medicare: Rs. 6L for my mon (aged 75): Rs. 43986/-

United India Super Top Floater: Rs. 95 Lakhs with Rs. 5 lakh deductible (threshold) for myself my son and my wife. The premium is Rs. 24163

United India Super Top Floater: Rs. 15 lakhs cover with Rs. 5 lakhs deductible. The premium is Rs. 14868

Notice the difference in cost due to my mom‚Äôs age.

In addition before the above changes from United I got a base and super top-up policy for my wife and son with no room rent limits from private insurers: See: Why we purchased a 2nd set of base & super top-up health insurance policies.

Future Generali Health Total Plan for 10 Lakhs for wife and son with a voluntary deductible of Rs. 50000. Total premium: Rs. 11500.

Liberty Health Connect Supra Super top-up policy for one crore (floater)with a 10 lakh deductible. Premium is Rs. 1400. We will continue these two policies just in case.

Caution: Do not get enticed by the low premiums private players offer especially for top-up plans. Their market share is low and their claims history is also low. As they sell more policies they will pay out more claims incur more losses and hike the premiums for everyone. Star Health is a good example of this. See: How to get claim settlement ratio for health insurers?

It may be far from rational but I deeply distrust private insurers and ever deeper distrust of all agents. Therefore I would rather pay a higher premium to an insurer that pays out many claims (PSU typically pays out more than the total premiums received each year).

Many readers have asked ‚ÄúIs this not a bit too much premium to pay? Are you not making a song and dance about health insurance?‚Äù Hospital bills are one of the biggest net worth destroyers. So the goal is to protect our net worth by spending a fraction of it (or a fraction of annual income). When you see things from the right perspective most expenses look diminutive. What is expensive or not expensive is a point of view.",,,,,,

Unless you‚Äôre a hedge fund manager or you have money to burn that‚Äôs your best bet most financial planners say. Individual companies can crater just as often as they soar and the risk is just too great for nonprofessionals.

Many members of Congress ignore that advice even if they handle legislation that affects companies‚Äô fortunes. That causes both conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflict. Neither is good.

After a few high-profile cases of legislators making well-timed trades based on government information about COVID-19 (we‚Äôre looking at you Richard Burr) The New York Times this week gave congressional trading the full data-dive treatment examining trades for every member between 2019 to 2021.

They found 97 legislators out of 535 with dicey deals done by themselves or by family members including two of Oregon‚Äôs longest-serving Democratic leaders: U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer.

Wyden made the list because his wife bought and sold shares of Exxon Mobil and Shell while he sat on committees that handled energy issues the Times said. Wyden also made trades in companies run by executives who testified before the Senate Finance Committee while Wyden was the top Democrat on the committee the Times said.

A spokesman for Wyden told the Times that he and his wife keep their finances separate.

Blumenauer made the list because of trades by his wife too the Times said. She traded shares of CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group both of which offer Medicare Advantage plans. Blumenauer sits on the House Ways and Means Committee which has authority over Medicare the Times reported.

Blumenauer himself purchased stock in defense company Raytheon on Feb. 24 the day Russia invaded Ukraine the Times said. He sold the shares on March 14 the Times said. Among other weaponry Raytheon makes the Tomahawk cruise missile.

The trade was the result of a ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù Blumenauer‚Äôs office said.

‚ÄùThe congressman has long believed that members of Congress should not trade individual stocks‚Äù a Blumenauer spokesperson told the Times. ‚ÄúDue to a miscommunication his financial advisers purchased some stock on his behalf. When this was reported to him he immediately ordered it sold (at a loss) and gave unequivocal direction that he should not hold any individual stock.‚Äù

Recent filings show that Blumenauer‚Äôs wife still owns stock the Times said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWVmaGVhbHRoY2FyZWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS5jb20vdmlldy9tZWQtbW92ZXMtaGVucnktZm9yZC1oZWFsdGgtc3lzdGVtLWFwcG9pbnRzLXZldGVyYW4tbGVhZGVyLWFzLWNlby1hbmQtbW9yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MED MOVES: Henry Ford Health System appoints veteran leader as CEO and more,"Robert Riney

Thailand‚Äôs National Health Security Office (NHSO) has made available primary medical care facilities to provide services to patients under the ‚Äúgold card‚Äù system after the office decided to terminate its contracts with Bangkok‚Äôs nine private hospitals effective October 1st.

The hospitals are Mahesak Bang Na General 1 Navaminthra Petcharavej Kluaynamthai Phaet Panya Bangmod Kluaynamthai 2 and Prachapat.

NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr. Lalitaya Kongkam explained that the private hospitals had been contracted to care for 696103 patients covered by the government‚Äôs ‚Äúgold card‚Äù or universal health care scheme but only 62331 of them (9%) including 24058 suffering with chronic diseases sought medical services at such facilities.

She assured however that these patients will continue to receive medical care because the NHSO has entered into contracts with community clinics and pharmacies and arranged for primary care facilities to provide medical services to people covered by the ‚Äúgold card‚Äù health scheme adding that telemedicine has also been introduced as another option.

Dr. Lalitya said that after October 1st patients who are still hospitalised at the nine hospitals affected will continue to be treated there until they recover. In the cases of chronic patients such as those waiting for operations or who have to receive chemo or radiation therapy she said that the NHSO has already arranged for other medical facilities to look after them.

She advised patients who have been treated at these nine hospitals to ask for their medical records from their hospitals. The NHSO will do likewise so it can refer the patients to the new medical facilities.

The patients or those who have registered to receive medical care at the nine hospitals are also advised to apply for medical care at other medical facilities in their localities.

In case there are no such facilities Dr. Lalitya said they should not be worried because the NHSO is trying to find new medical facilities for them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzZGFpbHlhZnJpY2EuY29tL2JkL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS9oZWFsdGgvbmhpZi1pbi10YWxrcy1vbi1tb2JpbGUtbG9hbi1wYWNrYWdlcy10by1mdW5kLXByZW1pdW1zLTM5NTMyMTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NHIF in talks on mobile loan packages to fund premiums,"The National Social Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) is negotiating a deal with banks and mobile service providers to extend medical cover loans in an effort to boost compliance.

NHIF board chairman Lewis Nguyai says the fund wants mobile service providers and banks to advance money to contributors to clear their annual contributions and recover the same monthly through a salary checkoff system.

‚ÄúWe are negotiating with banks and mobile service providers to have an arrangement where principal members can access a Sh6000 loan to pay their annual premium at once and have Sh600 deducted monthly from their salaries or income‚Äù Mr Nguyai told the Business Daily.

Banks and mobile telephone companies have been issuing loans to subscribers through applications.

The NHIF is seeking to tap the wide network to enhance its collections from Kenyans seeking medical cover.

He said the breakthrough with mobile money lenders and banks will see those who make monthly contributions to the NHIF kitty and are non-employed pay their annual subscriptions with ease.

‚ÄúThis will make it easy for those making monthly contributions to pay at once and have the mobile money lenders or banks deduct from their income‚Äù Mr Nguyai said.

He said NHIF has Self-care platforms that empower all subscribers to manage their services at their fingertips from anywhere anytime on any device.

‚ÄúMembers can receive updates and status on their accounts. The platforms also serve as a marketing strategy to attract new members in a mission to serve the whole population and achieve Universal Health Care.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm11c2NhdGRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE3LzE4LW9mLWhvc3BpdGFsaXNhdGlvbnMtaW4tcmVnaW9uLWR1ZS10by1tZWRpY2FsLW5lZ2xpZ2VuY2Utc2F5cy13aG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,18% of hospitalisations in region due to medical negligence says WHO,"By OUR CORRESPONDENT

Muscat ‚Äì Medication harm accounts for 50 per cent of the overall preventable consequence in medical care making it an urgent global public health concern according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

It also causes a huge global financial burden contributing nine per cent of total avoidable costs due to suboptimal medicine use or the equivalent of US$42bn of global total health expenditure.

In the Eastern Mediterranean Region therapeutic and medication errors account for 34 per cent of the total number of adverse events.

Data also show that up to 18 per cent of hospital admissions in the region are associated with severe patient harm due to management of care 80 per cent of which are preventable said Dr Ahmed al Mandhari WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean on the World Patient Safety Day marked on September 17.

This year ‚ÄòMedication Safety‚Äô has been selected as the theme for World Patient Safety Day under the slogan ‚ÄòMedication Without Harm‚Äô with a call to ‚ÄòKnow Check and Ask‚Äô actions.

The Ministry of Health in Oman is organising several programmes to spread awareness on the issue besides illuminating its hospitals in orange to mark the day.

A special event will be organised on September 21 from 3pm to 8pm for the cause at City Centre Muscat.

According to Dr Mandhari medication errors occur when weak medication systems and/or human factors such as fatigue poor environmental conditions or staff shortages affect prescribing transcribing dispensing administration and monitoring practices which can then result in severe harm disability and even death.

‚ÄúIn low- and middle-income countries current estimates suggest that 134mn adverse events occur in hospitals contributing to around 2.6mn patient deaths every year. While in high-income countries one in every ten patients is harmed while receiving hospital care‚Äù he said.

Patients living in low-income countries experience twice as many disability-adjusted life years lost due to medication-related harm than those in high-income countries. This happens due to an uneven implementation of available interventions that could reduce the frequency and impact of medication errors.

A significant consequence of unsafe healthcare is the psychological cost to patients and their families added Dr Mandhari. ‚ÄúThe resulting human suffering emotional impact and loss of trust in the health system hamper the utilisation of health services jeopardising efforts to increase access to health services.‚Äù

The highest rates of preventable medication-related harm occur in elderly patient care settings (11 per cent) followed by intensive care (7 per cent) highly specialised or surgical care (6 per cent) and emergency medicine (5 per cent ) and at least 26 per cent of preventable medication harm is clinically severe or life-threatening. During pharmaceutical care most harm occurs in prescribing and monitoring medications.

Dr Mandhari said that the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the risk of medication errors and medication-induced harm. ‚ÄúDelivering safe care and ensuring patient safety is more complex in emergency contexts especially in countries in the region that face conditions of insecurity conflict and vulnerability. Universal health coverage depends on the ability of the health system to provide safe timely and effective services to all people everywhere including in emergency settings.‚Äù

World Patient Safety Day aims to engage the public increase awareness and enhance understanding of the burden of unsafe care and the ways to promote patient safety as a cornerstone of modern healthcare.

To help spread awareness Dr Mandhari called upon everyone including ‚Äúgovernments nongovernmental organisations professional organisations civil society patient organisations academia and research institutes to join the global campaign by lighting up iconic monuments in orange and organising international national and local activities and events on and around September 17.‚Äù",,,,,,

Antes de 2020 los vendedores de la zona aprovechaban el flujo de veh√≠culos para ofrecer estos productos. En Guatemala el comercio informal ha sido uno de los medios de subsistencia de numerosas familias; con las ventas que realizan en conjunto cubren sus necesidades m√°s b√°sicas en el d√≠a a d√≠a. Seg√∫n la Encuesta Nacional de Empleo e Ingresos (INEI 2021) la tasa de informalidad en este sector en octubre de 2021 constitu√≠a el 73.71 %.

En San Crist√≥bal Totonicap√°n el inicio de la construcci√≥n del megaproyecto de paso a desnivel en Cuatro Caminos en febrero del 2020 ha provocado que las filas de veh√≠culos se hagan m√°s largas. Desde tempranas horas los vendedores ubican sus productos a un costado de la ruta que va desde Quetzaltenango al punto de Cuatro Caminos divididos en peque√±os sectores de dos metros. Son peque√±as ¬´champas¬ª de l√°mina con mesas de madera en su interior y sin puertas. Una sola champa aglutina a varias familias y les sirve para exponer su producto para descansar y surtir una canasta que usan para la venta.

Mientras algunos familiares incluidas ni√±as y ni√±os cuidan el puesto esperando que alguien les pida una bolsa de roscas gaseosas o golosinas antes de subirse a los buses para emprender o continuar el viaje otras y otros caminan con esa canasta surtida en medio de las filas de veh√≠culos y suben a los buses desde Cuatro Caminos hacia el punto conocido como La Morer√≠a para ofrecer sus productos.

En los 28 meses que lleva el proyecto ha aumentado el tr√°fico vehicular y a la par han iniciado las construcciones de hoteles restaurantes y locales nuevos que amenazan con pronto suplantar las ventas de los comerciantes informales de la zona.

Blistering crop-withering temperatures that also risk the health of agricultural workers could threaten swathes of global food production by 2045 as the world warms an industry analysis warned Thursday.

Climate change is already stoking heatwaves and other extreme weather events across the world with hot spells from India to Europe this year expected to hit crop yields.

Temperature spikes are causing mounting concern for health particularly for those working outside in sweltering conditions which is especially dangerous when humidity levels are high.

The latest assessment by risk company Verisk Maplecroft brings those two threats together to calculate that heat stress already poses an ‚Äúextreme risk‚Äù to agriculture in 20 countries including agricultural giant India.

But the coming decades are expected to expand the threat to 64 nations by 2045 ‚Äî representing 71 percent of current global food production ‚Äî including major economies China India Brazil and the United States.

‚ÄúWith the rise in global temperatures and rise in global heat stress we‚Äôre going to see crops in more temperate countries as well start being affected by this‚Äù said Will Nichols head of climate and resilience at Verisk Maplecroft.

Rice is particularly at risk the assessment said with other crops like cocoa and even tomatoes also singled out as of concern.

‚Äì Growing risk ‚Äì

Maplecroft‚Äôs new heat stress dataset using global temperature data from the UK Met Office feeds into its wider risk assessments of countries around the world.

It is based on a worst-case emissions scenario leading to around 2 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels as soon as 2045.

However the authors stress that in projections to mid-century even scenarios that assume higher levels of carbon-cutting action could still result in temperatures nearing 2C.

India ‚Äî responsible for 12 percent of global food production in 2020 and heavily reliant on outdoor labour productivity ‚Äî is already rated as at extreme risk the only major agricultural nation in that category at current temperatures.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very real worry that people in rural areas which are obviously highly dependent on agriculture are going to be much more vulnerable to these kinds of heat events going forward‚Äù Nichols told AFP.

That could impact productivity and in turn exports ‚Äî and have potentially ‚Äúcascading‚Äù knock-on effects on issues such as the country‚Äôs credit rating and even political stability he said.

By 2045 the list grows much longer.

Nine of the top ten countries affected in 2045 are in Africa with the world‚Äôs second largest cocoa producer Ghana as well as Togo and Central African Republic receiving the worst possible risk score.

The top 20 at-risk countries in the coming decades include key Southeast Asian rice exporters Cambodia Thailand and Vietnam the authors said noting that rice farmers in central Vietnam have already taken to working at night to avoid the high temperatures.

The assessment highlights that major economies like the US and China could also see extreme risk to agriculture in 2045 although in these large countries the impacts vary by region.

Meanwhile Europe accounts for seven of the 10 countries set to see the largest increase in risk by 2045.

‚ÄúI think what it reinforces is that even though a lot of us are sort of sitting in sort of Western countries where we might think we‚Äôre a bit more insulated from some of these threats actually we are not necessarily‚Äù Nichols said.

‚ÄúBoth in terms of the sort of physical risks that we‚Äôre facing but also in terms of the kind of knock on effects down the supply chain.‚Äù AFP",,,,,,,,,,,,

Which would be telecom stocks right?

Maybe not.

The truth is that telecom stocks ‚Äî there are really only three biggies these days; AT&T (T) Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS) ‚Äî aren‚Äôt what they used to be. Some say that has to do with their disastrous forays into the world of media but it‚Äôs probably more a matter of failed execution and the maturation of the business.

First the media math. Remember that within a two-week period in May of last year both AT&T and Verizon jettisoned WarnerMedia and Yahoo their respective content properties (yes the latter owns my employer Yahoo Finance). These moves were made to rid the data-driven left-brain telcos of frivolous flowery ‚Äî never mind costly ‚Äî media businesses. Getting out of content the thinking went would allow the telephone companies‚Äô distribution businesses to run full-out and unfettered which would presumably be a boon to shareholders.

‚ÄúMy days are a little bit more predictable than they were a couple of years ago‚Äù AT&T CEO John Stankey told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi this week. ‚ÄúThat's one of the reasons why we made the decision to do what we're doing. I didn't think I could do my best work or the broader management team could do their best work if we were trying to fight too many battles on too many different fronts. We are a more focused company today. We're executing each week better than we were the week before but we still have room to go.‚Äù

For sure on that last point.

Since May 15 2021 roughly when these announcements were made Verizon‚Äôs stock is down 18% and AT&T is down 19%. The S&P is only off 4%. The stocks still underperform the market after factoring in their 6% plus dividend yields.

Perhaps that‚Äôs surprising given these companies made game-changing announcements ‚Äî particularly in the case of AT&T as its divestment of content was a much bigger move relative to the size of its overall business. It‚Äôs also surprising since both AT&T and Verizon stocks sport generous dividend yields which ideally would bolster the shares during a market downturn.

Did deep-sixing the content businesses help the telcos‚Äô stocks? No it did not.

Before we get more into that let‚Äôs first consider T-Mobile once ridiculed (and still loathed) by the Big Two for its over-the-top former CEO John Legere and its garish (yet effective) pink branding. Legere stepped down two years ago but guess what T-Mobile is now ascendent if not triumphant. Barron‚Äôs recently pointed out that T-Mobile has a bigger market cap ($177 billion) than Verizon ($173 billion) or AT&T ($119 billion). True both Verizon and AT&T are more leveraged so that the overall enterprise value of the two older companies is bigger. But the fact remains that T-Mobile stock has trounced Verizon and AT&T ‚Äî and the market ‚Äî over the past five years.

Why is that? In a word execution. T-Mobile merged with Sprint priced aggressively to build market share and most importantly improved its network.

‚ÄúTMUS 5g network is probably 18 months ahead of AT&T and Verizon's if not a little more‚Äù says Keith Snyder an industry analyst at CFRA. ‚Äú[AT&T‚Äôs and Verizon‚Äôs] balance sheets are bad. Those two companies combined have about $300 billion that they need to get off their balance sheet at some point. Meanwhile they need to spend very heavily on network deployments and new spectrum.‚Äù

And another thing: ‚ÄúVerizon's stock price is lower than it was 20 years ago. AT&T's stock price is lower than it was 20 years ago‚Äù says veteran industry analyst Craig Moffett. ‚ÄúGranted they've paid dividends but the total return by owning those stocks has been less than what you would have gotten from a corporate bond.""

Someone‚Äôs made money here though. As this 2017 McKinsey report points out internet giants Amazon Google and Facebook have built up massive businesses on the networks of AT&T and Verizon. The combined market caps of those three tech giants ‚Äî $3 trillion ‚Äî is 6.4 times that of the three telcos' $469 billion.

So did AT&T and Verizon blow it by not being able to marry content with distribution? Moffett thinks that‚Äôs a red herring.

‚ÄúI'm not sure ‚Äòthe tug and sway between content and distribution‚Äô has ever been a terribly relevant thesis‚Äù Moffett says. ‚ÄúIt's one of those things that people like to talk about but it doesn't really have all that much real-world application. Partially the problem with trying to be vertically integrated is that the law frowns on it. So there's limitations on what you could do. You could theoretically make content exclusive and that sort of thing but as carriers you generally aren't allowed to do that. So there isn't really any particular strategic logic for being vertically integrated.‚Äù

To Moffett it‚Äôs more a matter of two companies with declining businesses and bloated balance sheets that will struggle to pay their dividend down the road. AT&T already cut its dividend as part of its divestiture of the media business earlier this year.

As for the companies‚Äô path forward: ‚ÄúThey're not going to go bankrupt‚Äù Snyder says. ‚ÄúThey're established their businesses are generating cash. It's just that they need to rethink what they're doing.‚Äù Moffett offers a more succinct prognosis: ‚ÄúIt's terrible.‚Äù

On the other hand both analysts are sanguine about T-Mobile which they say will continue to grow at the incumbents‚Äô expense.

Is there any optimism to be had AT&T or Verizon? ‚ÄúThe bull case for Verizon or AT&T is that expectations are so low that the stocks have nowhere to go but up‚Äù Moffett says. ‚ÄúAnd as long as they maintain the dividend that thesis could perhaps work.‚Äù But then he adds: ‚ÄúThe problem is as we've seen so often with these companies if they can't generate any growth then the sustainability of the dividend eventually is in doubt.‚Äù

For Verizon and AT&T it‚Äôs not a great position to be in. Turns out even big splashy media deals couldn't help them.

But for this month the first Monday was Labor Day so the release came the very next day  Tuesday September 5th. Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro users were looking forward to the update which among other things included a fix to stop a bug that was causing many handsets to become intolerably hot with an extreme battery drain.

Not all Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro users received the September update. Here's why







Even though many owners of the Pixel 6 series phones (we are not including the Pixel 6a here for reasons we will discuss later) did receive the update in a timely fashion many (including this writer) have yet to get the update. From experience I've usually been able to update my Pixel 2 XL or Pixel 6 Pro no later than the second day after an update was announced.





As a result we sensed that something was not right with the update  and sure enough the other day Google announced that new updates were just sent out for the Verizon ""branded"" Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The new build numbers are as follows:





Pixel 6 Pro (Verizon): TP1A.220905.004.A1

Pixel 6 (Verizon): TP1A.220905.004.A1





To check for the update on your Pixel phone go to Settings > System > System update .







So if you never received the September update for your Pixel 6 series phone and you're a Verizon customer now you know why. Something was wrong with the update and a new one has been pushed out. If it doesn't arrive soon you can always join the Android 13 QPR1 Beta. This is the beta program for the December Pixel Quarterly Feature Drop. Keep in mind that you'll need to stay in the beta program until the stable version of the Quarterly Feature Drop is released in December or else you'll have to wipe your phone first.







To join the Android 13 QPR1 Beta go to www.google.com/android/beta or tap on this link . Then tap on the box that reads ""View your eligible devices"" and you'll see a photo of your Pixel model. Underneath it will be a prompt that says ""Opt in."" Tap on it and within 24 hours you will receive the update for your phone. The Android 13 QPR1 Beta includes the September security patch.

Now what about the Pixel 6a mid-ranger?







Settings > System > System update . Now let's talk about the Pixel 6a. It was known from the time that Google announced the release on September 6th that the mid-ranger's September release was being delayed. Last week Google also released the September update for the Pixel 6a with the build number TP1A.220905.004.A2. Again you can check for it by going to





For those who did not receive the update earlier this month the update has four headings for Battery and Charging Biometrics Bluetooth and User Interface. Under the first category the update includes a fix for an ""issue occasionally causing increased battery drain from certain launcher background activities.""



Under the category of Biometrics Google improves the under-display fingerprint sensor for the Pixel 6a. And in the Bluetooth section we learn that the update exterminates a bug that prevented certain Bluetooth devices from connecting to Pixel devices. And the last fix under the category of User Interface exterminates a bug that caused notifications ""to appear truncated on the lock screen.""





So now hopefully Verizon customers with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro receive their missing update and all Pixel 6a users get theirs too if they haven't received it yet And to reiterate if you're tired of waiting or you are not a Verizon customer there is a workaround in the Android 13 QPR1 Beta. Just remember to back up your data first and when the December Feature Drop is made (tentatively on December 5th) you'll be given a little time to opt out of the beta program without a data wipe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvbmNhYS1mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL2FjYy1uZXR3b3JrLWNoYW5uZWwtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW1zL3NieTY4OGtjeDJrYWdpaWlpYmJ3b21matIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What channel is ACC Network?

She hopes to raise awareness about fraudsters and keep other job-seekers safe.

Callie Heim was thrilled to start her marketing job with Waymo the buzzy self-driving car company earlier this summer. She'd had a tough year ‚Äî her mom recently passed away she moved back home and she was adjusting to life after college. The job offer felt like a turning point: ""I was at my lowest of lows and felt like I was on the come-up of some good things"" the 22-year-old Towson University grad tells CNBC Make It. But elation quickly faded when she got a message from her new employer: Before she started she'd have to buy her own laptop and work phone from a company portal and they'd send her a check to cover the costs. When the check arrived in the mail the alarm bells sounded off. Heim had been scammed by a fake job listing.

'I went from excited to devastated in a month'

In a series of TikTok videos that have since gone viral Heim recounts how she applied to the job via LinkedIn's ""Easy Apply"" function and went through what felt like a normal even promising interview process. First she answered a few questions about her marketing background through Wire an encrypted messaging app she was asked to download (a red flag she now says). She was invited to a phone interview the next day where the interviewer said the job would entail getting a computer and phone to do her job remotely. She then got another phone call the day after with an offer (red flag No. 2 Heim says). After a few more conversations Heim filled out some employment forms submitted a scan of her driver's license and sent over her bank information to get set up for direct deposit. Then she was told she'd need to buy her home equipment upfront and then be reimbursed for it later. In reality this is what's known as a fake check scam where scammers hope you'll send them money and ""reimburse"" you with a bad check. Sometimes they'll send a check first tell you to deposit it and hope you buy your equipment (in reality send them money) before the check bounces. Thankfully Heim realized the scam once the check arrived (""it looked so photoshopped"" she says) and before she actually sent any money to the scammers. But she did have to immediately close her compromised bank account and freeze her credit line. Heim describes the experience as humiliating and a shot to her confidence. She also felt embarrassed that the news she was so excited for and shared widely with friends and family wasn't real. ""I went from excited to devastated in a month"" Heim says. The experience has been emotionally draining to say the very least but Heim considers herself lucky that she didn't lose any money in the process.

Red flags of a job scam

Americans were scammed out of $86 million due to fake business and job opportunities in the second quarter of 2022 according to the Federal Trade Commission. People reported nearly 21600 incidents of business and job opportunity scams during that time with roughly a third of those resulting in a financial loss. Employment-related scams have been a persistent problem but rose in 2020 as criminals took advantage of people who lost work due to Covid Rhonda Perkins an attorney and chief of staff for the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices told CNBC Make It in June. Job scams take a variety of forms: Bad actors could pose as a staffing or temp agency and require a fee for their services; list fake mystery shopping government or postal jobs; or post re-shipping and re-skilling scams on the false promise of making money from home. Or they might imitate a reputable employer and create a fake website or post fake listings on job-search sites like what happened to Heim. The FBI says these are some warning signs to look out for through the hiring process: Interviews are not conducted in-person or through a secure video call but rather on a teleconferencing app using an email address instead of a phone number

Potential employers contact victims through non-company email domains and teleconference applications

Potential employers require employees to purchase start-up equipment from the company or pay for background screenings

Potential employers request credit card information

Job postings appear on job boards but not on the company's website

Recruiters or managers don't have profiles on the job board or the profiles do not seem to fit their roles

Lessons learned

After getting scammed Heim took a few weeks off from applying to jobs but is back on the market with new vigilance. For one she makes sure to verify that any job posting she sees on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor match up with one on the company's website. But that can be tricky since anyone can spoof a real website ‚Äî the scam she fell for was modeled after a real job listed on Waymo's hiring page ‚Äî so you have to be extra cautious she says. Take it a step further by looking up the name of the company or the person who's contacting you plus the words ""scam"" ""review"" or ""complaint"" Perkins says. Run the company or staffing agency through the Better Business Bureau's directory. You can also contact the employer directly using information you've found on your own (as in not an email or phone number provided to you through an unsolicited message) to verify the legitimacy of the job and how to apply. ""It's tempting to use LinkedIn's 'Easy Apply' to rapidly apply to a bunch of jobs but if you take the time to write your cover letters and reach out to the company directly you might have more success"" Heim adds. She also knows that ""if anyone is asking for your for financial information before you're hired that's a no-go."" Employers will only ask for your Social Security number after you're hired and you should still be vigilant to confirm their identity in-person or over video before you share it. ""It's the worst way to learn a lesson but it taught me about being na√Øve on the internet"" Heim adds. ""You never know who you're actually talking to.""

Posted on: September 17 2022 05:59h.

Last updated on: September 19 2022 01:56h.

Due in large part to rising interest rates the real estate sector is sagging. But casino real estate investment trusts (REITs) are shining bright amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The Las Vegas Strip seen above where VICI Properties is the biggest landlord. A research firm is bullish on casino REITs. (Image: KTNV)

The widely followed FTSE Nareit Equity REITs Index is down 20.31% year-to-date. But Gaming and Leisure Properties (NASDAQ:GLPI) and VICI Properties ‚Äî the two publicly traded gaming REITs ‚Äî are higher by 0.06% and 11% respectively. Casino landlords are the only segment of the broader real estate sector generating positive returns this year.

Casino REITs are the lone property sector in positive territory this year benefiting from an upward valuation ‚Äòre-rating‚Äô and hard-earned mainstream institutional acceptance after many years of strong operational execution‚Äù according to Hoya Capital research.

VICI and GLPI approach casino real estate fashion in divergent fashion. The former is the largest landlord on the Las Vegas Strip among other holdings while the latter prefers to own regional casino property assets.

Casino REITs Superior Inflation Protection

Inflation of which the US economy has plenty is often a catalyst for real estate stocks. This year Gaming and Leisure and VICI are living up to that billing.

Casino REITs have become a favorite for investors seeking inflation-hedged assets. VICI boasts inflation-linked escalators on 96% of its leases while GLPI benefits from indirect inflation hedges linked to tenant performance‚Äù noted Hoya Capital.

GLPI and VICI are what‚Äôs known as triple-net REITs meaning the lease terms they sign with clients are usually far longer than what‚Äôs seen in other commercial real estate segments.

Market participants tend to treat triple-net REITs on par with longer-dated bonds meaning these stocks can be vulnerable to rising interest rates. This year however investors are focusing more on the inflation-fighting advantages GLPI and VICI offer.

‚ÄúDespite their ultra-long term triple net lease structures casino REITs are better protected from inflation than many initially presumed‚Äù added Hoya. ‚ÄúInflation sensitivity is driven by several interacting factors including external growth potential lease structure and term tenant credit quality and the cyclicality of the underlying property type.‚Äù

Casino REITs Love Good Deals

The current iterations of GLPI and VICI are the result of deal-making. Lots of it. VICI has a knack for acquiring gaming assets with both large and small price tags and is agnostic in terms of geography. For its part GLPI largely eschews the volatility of Las Vegas Strip real estate owning only the Tropicana there. But the REIT has a knack for smart buys.

Since 2016 GLPI VICI and MGM Growth Properties acquired by VICI purchased approximately $50 billion worth of assets. There‚Äôs room for that figure to grow in the years ahead as casino operators look to monetize property assets and generate cash for other uses.

‚ÄúCasino REITs now own 100 of the roughly 250-300 ‚Äòinvestment grade‚Äô commercial casinos in the United States one of the highest concentrations of REIT ownership within any property sector‚Äù concluded Hoya.",,,,,,,,,,,,

No travellers with Indian passports need to apply for a Japan visa before departure. When is the best time to visit Mount Fuji?

Winter is the best time to visit Mount Fuji. December and January are the best months. Is there a specific Japanese visa for digital nomads?

There aren‚Äôt any specific Japanese visa programmes for digital nomads or freelancers.

In an interesting turn of events Japan is likely to lift the previously placed ban on individual tourist visa requirements. This will most probably come into practice in October.At present foreign visitors visiting Japan are required to book guided tours to get a visa to enter the country. This process is not only time-consuming but highly unappealing as well. But come October things will hopefully change for tourists wishing to visit the country.In November last year Japan had an almost full ban on new foreign visitors to Japan. But this rule eased up a bit in March this year which saw the Japanese government allowing completely supervised entry for business travellers and international students.Recently Japan increased the daily entry cap to 50 000 from 20000. Japan is expected to remove the daily entry cap altogether by October. The nation has also removed the compulsory pre-departure COVID-19 tests.Japan is also expected to resume visa-free entry for short-term travelers from a number of countries. Before this the old visa rule allowed people from 68 countries to stay in Japan up to 90 days without a visa. The country is expected to resume this rule from October onwards.

Moses ‚ÄúShyne‚Äù Barrow this week claimed that residents support the employment opportunities that come from investment.

by Khaila Gentle

GALES POINT MANATEE Stann Creek District Tues. Sept. 13 2022

The responses of villagers in Gales Point Manatee to efforts by Vulcan Materials Company to establish a mining operation in the area have been reported by local media on numerous occasions over the past few weeks. And after August 20 when a meeting was held in the village it was found that a vast majority of the residents are not in support of the company‚Äôs proposed mining project. According to the Leader of the Opposition Hon. Moses ‚ÄúShyne‚Äù Barrow however there are still many residents who are hoping for employment and other opportunities that come from investments like Vulcan‚Äôs.

The Opposition Leader accompanied by former Belmopan area rep John Saldivar and Senator Beverly Williams visited the village this week and spoke with residents about their views on the American mining company.

‚ÄúThe UDP Shadow Cabinet believes strongly in the policy of balancing the need for economic development with the need to protect the environment‚Äù wrote the Opposition Leader on his official Facebook page on Monday.

In that post Hon. Barrow also suggested that the villagers of Gales Point might be divided on whether or not they support the mining company noting that many residents agree with the aforementioned policy of balance. Just last week there were reports of a pro-Vulcan protest taking place in the village with those residents expressing the view that the company‚Äôs project would provide much-needed jobs. Still added Hon. Barrow in his post there were those who during his visit opposed the project for various reasons including its potential for causing environmental damage.

Despite the Leader of the Opposition‚Äôs suggestion that the village may be more divided than has been reported however the chairman of the Gales Point village council Jason Altschaft says otherwise.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working on this for over three years now. We‚Äôve had plenty of meetings on this situation and we definitely know that the village is not for this kind of economic activity‚Äù stated Altschaft in an interview with KREM News‚Äô Marisol Amaya.

Altschaft in speaking about the visit said that it almost felt as if the three UDP members had come to promote Vulcan‚Äôs mining project‚Äîpossibly for political reasons.

The company following their mostly unsuccessful meeting with villagers on August 20 issued a letter to the people of Gales Point stating that it would begin providing jobs to the villagers that would pay ‚Äúa minimum of double the current minimum wage.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost of the people that are working for Vulcan now just happen to be UDP. And those are the same people that have been getting the jobs all along so we understand why they don‚Äôt want to lose those potential jobs‚Äù Altschaft said.

According to the village council chairman the visiting UDP members were asking a lot of questions about Vulcan‚Äîparticularly whether more people were in support of the project than what has been reported in the news.

The visit took place just one week after Cabinet affirmed its policy decision that no mining activity would be undertaken in the Gales Point area ‚Äúhaving regard to the surrounding communities‚Äô concerns.‚Äù

According to the Opposition Leader the UDP believes however that the Government of Belize should not close its doors on investors even though it should not ignore the concerns of environmentalists.

‚ÄúBut most importantly we must always put the socioeconomic well-being of our Belizean people first and foremost‚Äù he added.

But while the people of Gales Point do look forward to job opportunities the village chairman says that their focus is on eco-tourism.

‚ÄúWe are an untouched jewel. This is really what we‚Äôre focusing on‚Äù Altschaft said.

The UDP has stated that it looks forward to meeting with Vulcan to get their perspective as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Khoury thought about it and answered ""Maybe in a five-game stretch.""

On Saturday the Raider duo decided to create their own history.

Khoury and Davis Sullivan put on a show for the hometown fans as SBR throttled visiting Lawrence 48-22 in a non-league matchup at Somerset Berkley Regional High School.

""Honestly after losing last week all week we were preparing for this team and only this team"" Davis Sullivan said. ""We kind of put it all together this week.""

Khoury tallied three touchdowns and rushed for a game-high 147 yards on 18 carries. Not to be outdone Davis Sullivan added a pair of touchdowns and rushed for 131 yards including 103 yards in the second half.

""They both had great games today"" Raiders head coach Nick Freitas said. ""They each have different slashing styles. Ashton is the new back and we're glad he's healthy this year.""

Freitas said that the first day of camp his base offense has been firing on all cylinders.

FOOTBALL PREVIEW:'It feels normal this year': Somerset Berkley football team ready to make noise in 2022

""It allowed me to work on things that can be effected in games"" he said. ""We spent a lot of time with the sleds this week the whole team in three-point stance. We want to make sure we know our [strength] know the play and know the count.""

The big momentum shift of the game came late in the second quarter. Normally a run heavy team Freitas went to the air of four consecutive passes.

After a run Freitas signaled for another pass that resulted in touchdown. The two-point conversion was successful and SBR tied the game at 16-16 with 2:13 remaining before halftime.

""I don't know what I was thinking"" Freitas laughed. ""It felt weird.""

The Raiders (1-1) went back to the ground in the second half and pounded the ball down the throats of the Lancers. The defense also picked up their intensity holding Lawrence to just six points.

""My good friend Matt Baldwin really put in that effort on the defensive side"" Khoury said. He balled out on defense and offense. It came down to execution and we're just fast people.""

Last season SBR dropped its game to the Lancers 27-6. This time around the Raiders took it to Lawrence in a big way.

""This is what we expect from our team"" Davis Sullivan said.

How it happened

The Lancers (0-1) got off to a fast start when junior running back Jayzius Perez broke a 73-yard run on the very first play. But the Raiders stuffed Lawrence on a fourth down play.

SBR drove inside Lancer territory on its drive but failed to convert a fake punt.

Lawrence then went quickly in front on five plays. Quarterback Jayden Abreu's screen pass to Yorlando Tilleria went the distance from 41 yards out. Perez scored the two-point conversion and led 8-0 with 35 second left in the first quarter.

The Raiders responded on their next drive. Khoury capped off a seven-play drive with a 21 yard run and the lead was cut to 8-6. Davis Sullivan added the two-point.

Perez added a one-yard touchdown to put the Lancers in front 14-8. Jadiel Gomez took in the two-point conversion as Lawrence held a 16-8 advantage.

Starting at their own 32 senior quarterback Owen Meehan completed five passes late in the second quarter including two to Ian Sullivan (two receptions 32 yards) Khoury and then a 13-yard strike with Davis Sullivan to bring the Raiders closer at 16-16 after a successful two-point conversion.

In the second half Khoury and Davis Sullivan took over the game.

Khoury broke free for a 37-yard touchdown to give SBR the lead at 22-16. Davis Sullivan added the two-point conversion. Abreu got the Lancers close with 26-yard touchdown run but Perez was stopped on the two-point conversion.

On the next possession Davis Sullivan took a handoff up the middle and juke a defender out of his socks en route to a 53-yard touchdown run to give the Raiders a 32-22 lead after Khoury's two-point conversion.

Meehan added a short touchdown late in the third quarter and Khoury's two yard touchdown with 5:55 left in the fourth to cap the scoring.

They were involved in a romantic relationship behind the scenes.

Saved by the Bell was one of the defining TV shows of the ‚Äô90s. A sitcom that became popular thanks to its lighthearted teen storylines it also broached serious topics affecting young people. It ran for four seasons making celebrities out of actors Mark-Paul Gosselaar Mario Lopez Dustin Diamond and Elizabeth Berkley. What viewers couldn‚Äôt have known was that Gosselaar and Berkley were more than just co-stars. The two Saved by the Bell cast members were involved in a romantic relationship behind the scenes.

Saved by the Bell starred Gosselaar as Zack Morris a musically talented student also active in sports at his school. With his best friend Samuel ‚ÄúScreech‚Äù Powers Zach became one of the most popular characters on any TV program. Berkley portrayed Jessie Spano an outspoken straight-A student quick to stand up for women‚Äôs rights.

The young castmates worked closely while filming episodes of Saved by the Bell. And though four years isn‚Äôt an incredibly long time for a show to run on television Gosselaar and Berkley spent their formative years on the program. Ultimately it led the two young stars to form a romantic relationship one they hid from everyone else on set.

In 2019 Mark-Paul Gosselaar opened up about the secret romance saying it was inevitable that he and Berkley became romantically involved.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre working on a set and we were young there‚Äôs no one around really. I mean you work and live in a bubble‚Äù he revealed to Anna Faris on her podcast Anna Faris Is Unqualified.

Gosselaar noted that dating as a young actor was challenging because options were limited.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in your cars and you come to set and you do your work and you‚Äôre with these beautiful women and then you go back in your car‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not going to school so you don‚Äôt have a lot of choices.‚Äù

The actor admitted he also didn‚Äôt get out much partly because his mother drove him to the set every day.

In the end Gosselaar and Berkley ended their romance and later married other people.

According to IMDb Gosselaar has been married twice. His first marriage was to Lisa Ann Russell from 1996 until 2011. In 2012 following his divorce from Russell he married Catriona McGinn. The two are still together.

As for Berkley the actor married fellow performer Greg Lauren in 2003 and the couple remains happily married.

In an interview producer Peter Enger revealed that ‚Äúeverybody dated everybody else except Screech‚Äù and that Tiffani Thiessen dated Gosselaar and Mario Lopez at different points throughout the show‚Äôs history.

Investing in the stock market this year has been a roller coaster ride for investors. High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have weighed on asset prices. The latest inflation numbers are out showing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.3% from August last year -- higher than economists expected.

There's no telling where inflation or the economy will go in the coming months. However history tells us that quality companies that pay out dividends consistently can be an excellent source of income.

One no-brainer dividend stock you can buy today is Realty Income (O -0.16%) the real estate stock that pays investors a monthly dividend. Realty Income has a solid business that can weather economic storms -- here's why the company is so durable.

Realty Income's high occupancy rate makes its business dependable

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages properties using long-term lease agreements. It manages over 11000 properties with clients including CVS Health Walgreens Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

Realty Income uses a triple-net lease with clients which makes those clients responsible for taxes maintenance and insurance on the properties. This common practice in single-occupancy commercial real estate lowers tenant rents and reduces Realty Income's financial responsibility for the building. While this leasing model can be risky at the individual building level because of vacancy risk (it's either 100% or 0% occupied) Realty Income mitigates this risk by spreading it across thousands of properties. That and a majority of its biggest clients have an investment-grade credit rating.

What makes Realty Income special is its high occupancy levels on its properties for over 25 years now. Going back to 1998 Realty Income has had a median occupancy level of 98% -- outpacing other REITs in the S&P 500 whose median occupancy is 94% in that same time.

Here's how it selects its properties

Realty Income occupancy rates have stayed consistent through different economic conditions including the Great Recession in 2008 which weighed heavily on real estate and other assets. The REIT leverages its 53 years in the business and takes a measured approach to its lease agreements.

For one the initial lease term is longer than average with its initial term being over 10 years -- helping Realty generate more dependable cash flow over time by using a longer initial lease term. Another attractive feature is that nearly 86% of its leases have built-in rent escalators tied to inflation or fixed increases which can also make this an attractive inflation hedge.

Two Realty Income can leverage its vast array of data to analyze new or existing opportunities that look attractive. The company whittles down its investment opportunities by looking at long-term industry trends that show the businesses it leases to are sustainable. It also analyzes the geographies of its properties to ensure they have attractive characteristics like being near major metropolitan areas.

For example 85% of the population in the U.S. lives within three miles of the company's pharmacy clients CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Walgreens plans to build 1000 doctor's offices by 2027 presenting an opportunity for Realty Income to grow as its clients grow.

A safe dividend stock you can count on

Realty Income concentrates 84% of its portfolio on retail properties. One way it manages this risk is by diversifying across industries. Its highest exposure is to grocery stores which generate 10.5% of its annualized rent followed by convenience stores (9.2%) and dollar stores (7.2%).

This diversification and its strict selection process all add up to Realty Income being a dividend stock you can trust. For 27 years Realty Income has increased its dividend payout to investors affirming its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 76.5% -- a conservative ratio that will allow it to maintain its dividend and have enough capital to finance future property acquisitions.

With its 4.4% dividend yield and monthly dividend payouts investors in search of passive income can't go wrong with Realty Income stock.",,,,,,,,,

HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change.

Dad sneakers as they‚Äôve affectionately been meme-ified are still going strong. You‚Äôll know them by their off-the-clock look ‚Äì prioritizing comfort and sensibility usually employing a puffy sole and boxy fit. Nike Monarchs and New Balance 993s are classics but the champ of this look is Hoka.



Hoka One One founded in 2009 by two footwear designers Nicolas Mermoud and Jean-Luc Diard was created with runners in mind. Thanks to the shoes‚Äô enormous ultra-cushioned soles and legendary comfort the brand took off attracting acclaim from athletes podiatrists and celebrities. Arguably the only hitch with Hoka‚Äôs kicks is their price tag ‚Äî most pairs ring in between $150 and $200.

If you‚Äôre not quite ready to pony up the cash I‚Äôve got some good news.

Walmart Avia Hightail sneakers available at Walmart.

Clocking in just under $28 Walmart‚Äôs Avia Hightail running sneakers look uncannily like Hoka‚Äôs Clifton 8s. The Avia sneaks are available in several colors but the tonal lavender pair and navy pair with an orange gradient trim really pass the Hoka vibe test. Their seamless breathable mesh uppers and molded lightweight EVA soles go toe-to-toe with the originals too.

Online reviewers and TikTok-ers alike are raving about the stylish similarities. ‚ÄúI found them on TikTok before buying and heard several reviews about how comfortable they were. I had been wanting some Hoka running shoes for comfort but was not a fan of the price‚Äù wrote a reviewer named Brooklyn. ‚ÄúOnce I purchased these I have been obsessed! They are so stylish and comfortable for ONLY $20!‚Äù Reviewer Shannon32 notes that ‚Äúthe style looks athletic but still fashionable these could be worn to the gym or casually. I like how plush the sole of the shoe is it allows for a softer impact when running or being active.‚Äù

With a 4.4-star rating and 123 customer reviews they‚Äôve left most customers satisfied with their fit comfort and style. Several reviewers mentioned scooping up the shoe in more than one color. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to get like eight more pairs‚Äù said user Lauren Watson in a recent unboxing TikTok.) Others suffering from foot pain and plantar fasciitis praised the sneaker‚Äôs supportive properties.

Courtesy of Walmart

""Be Your Own Model"" is Walmart's next phase of personalizing the online clothes shopping experience.

The retail giant acquired virtual try-on platform Zeekit in 2021.

Shoppers can upload a photo of themselves if they wish to try on the 270000-plus items available.

Walmart is offering consumers a more intimate online shopping experience via a virtual try-on tool that allows users to see how clothes look on their own bodies.

The new feature ‚Äî which launched on Thursday to iOS users on the Walmart app ‚Äî comes after the retail giant acquired virtual fitting room startup Zeekit in 2021. In March Walmart debuted its ""Choose My Model"" technology which allows customers to choose between 50 models of varying sizes to see how clothes fit on a body similar to theirs.

Now in its next phase ""Be Your Own Model"" users can try on more than 270000 items on their own bodies ‚Äî but they'll be required to strip down to underwear or tight-fitting clothing first in order for the feature to work accurately.

""This experience allows customers to use their own photo to better visualize how clothing will look on them and creates a gamification of shopping that we believe will be very compelling to the customer"" Denise Incandela Walmart's executive vice president of apparel and private brands said in a statement.

More modest users still have options. In the Walmart app users can decide whether they'd like to see clothes on a model of their choice or become a model themselves according to an explainer video from the company.

Unlike prior technology that would lay a photo on top of another for virtual try-ons Walmart says ""Be Your Own Model"" uses algorithms and machine learning to simulate a more realistic fit.

""Walmart is the first to offer a virtual try-on experience for apparel brands at scale and it's the most realistic application I have seen"" Incandela said.

Walmart is the latest retailer to jump on the virtual try-on trend. In August Amazon launched an augmented reality service that allows customers to try on shoes virtually and other retailers like Macy's and Adidas have also previously worked with Zeekit to experiment with virtual reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vZXNwb3J0cy1uZXdzLTU0LW1pbGxpb24tbWFuLW1yYmVhc3QtdGFrZXMtb3Zlci1ldmVyeS13YWxtYXJ0LWFjcm9zcy1hbWVyaWNhLXdpdGgtYW4taXJyZXNpc3RpYmxlLWZlYXN0YWJsZXMtbW92ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$54 Million Man MrBeast Takes Over Every Walmart Across America With an Irresistible Feastables Move,"This year has been huge for MrBeast so far. First he reached the epic milestone of 100 million subscribers on his main YouTube channel. Then he also took major steps in his businesses like starting the first Beast Burger outlet and now Feastables chocolates being made available at Walmart.

The 24-year-old started Feastables in January 2022 in hopes of delivering the highest-quality chocolate to the masses. Further he included the prize to be part of his viral Chocolate Factory video to promote his new business. Since its release Jimmy Donaldson‚Äôs chocolates have seen positive growth in profits.

Fans can get their Feastables chocolates from Walmart

Fans had reported seeing Feastable chocolates in their nearby Walmart stores for the past few weeks. Eventually MrBeast officially announced that his chocolates would be available at all Walmart stores across the US. Earlier these chocolates were only available online through the official Feastables or Walmart site.

The 24-year-old further released a video on his subsidiary channel MrBeast 2. In the video Donaldson and his crewmate Nolan visited a Walmart and asked fans to taste and compare Feastables versus a Hershey‚Äôs chocolate bar. So after tasting both chocolates everyone favored Feastables over the other branded chocolate.

It seems MrBeast completed his quest of delivering high-quality chocolate for which he started this business. Moreover fans wouldn‚Äôt have to buy bundles of Feastables as they can buy only one from Walmart for $2.48. Also MrBeast shared about another product vegan Feastables cookies which will be exclusive to Walmart for $4.48.

MrBeast hosts a $10000 giveaway for Feastable buyers

Arguably no one can host a better giveaway than MrBeast. It won‚Äôt be wrong to say he took giveaways to another level as he easily gives away tons of money and exclusive prizes like cars and private islands. So how could he leave the opportunity not to host a giveaway to promote Feastables availability at Walmart?

In the recent video on MrBeast 2 the YouTuber shared about giving away $10000. However there are some eligibility requirements for winning the amount as fans need to share their Walmart bill for buying Feastables chocolates and share it by texting 69420. Then MrBeast will award the $10000 to a random person.

What You Need To Know At the D23 Expo Disney's fan convention Disney officials announced several upcoming projects coming to Disneyland



Several projects though were left out including the future of Tarzan's Treehouse MagicBands and Disneyland Forward



Disney officials have said Tarzan's Treehouse would be reimagined but did not disclose the theme



Anaheim officials said Disney plans to begin the city approval process for Disneyland Forward next year

At Disneyland Resort Disney plans to reimagine the Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure into the fictional city of San Fransokyo from ""Big Hero 6.""

The company is revamping Toontown including installing a new attraction called Mickey and Minnie's Railway. They are also planning to re-theme Splash Mountain into Tiana's Bayou Adventure. Plenty of meet-and-greets are coming including one with the Incredible Hulk and the Mandalorian with Grogu.

However while those projects are big news Disney Parks Chairman Josh D'Amaro stayed mum on the current status of some projects and upcoming projects rumored to be coming to the Disneyland parks.

Here are a few projects that D'Amaro did not discuss during his hours-long Disney parks panel at the D23 Expo:

MagicBands

MagicBands the wearable accessory commonly seen at Walt Disney World is slated to come to Disneyland sometime this year.

When exactly the public has yet to know. And D'Amaro made no mention of it during his presentation last Sunday.

Last year Disney officials announced that the Walt Disney World and Disney Cruise line-exclusive wearable technology that allows visitors to sync their theme park and resort activities would be coming to Disneyland Resort for the first time.

Worn on the wrist with different Disney-style designs the MagicBand and MyMagic+ contain an RFID chip that allows wearers to sync their theme park tickets hotel room key photo pass and even charge food and merchandise.

However since that announcement Disneyland fans have been waiting to hear when it'll debut and experience the magic no pun intended.

Tarzan's Treehouse

When visitors walk through Adventureland past the Jungle Cruise and Indiana Jones Adventure ride they used to see a towering faux tree that served as Tarzan's Treehouse.

The walkable attraction allowed visitors to explore the 80-foot tree cross a rope bridge and have a bird's eye view of parts of Disneyland.

But the attraction has been closed since September of last year and the area has since been cordoned off.

No one is certain about what Disney plans to do with the treehouse attraction that has been around since 1962 when it was the Swiss Family Treehouse. Disney re-themed it as Tarzan's Treehouse in 1999 when the animated film ""Tarzan"" debuted.

In April Disney officials told the Orange County Register they plan to reimagine the treehouse with a new theme and backstory.

Some Disney news sites have speculated that the new reimagining could lead to an ""Encanto""-themed area. In the popular film one of the characters has a bedroom atop a magical tree.

Disneyland Forward

While D'Amaro speculated several ""blue sky"" concepts of popular movies such as ""Zootopia"" ""Encanto"" and even an area for villains in several different parts of Walt Disney World those themed lands could easily be part of Disney's major plans in Anaheim.

In May Disney said they are working with the city of Anaheim to update their current master-plan agreement to expand the Disneyland Resort.

D'Amaro did not mention Disney's so-called Disneyland Forward project which would modify the current zoning of parts of Disney's vast properties in Anaheim and allow Disney to create a new entertainment and theme park district within its footprint.

If re-zoned this could lead to a new third theme park and/or hotels on top of the current ""Toy Story"" parking lot across the street from the Anaheim Convention Center.

Other parking lots along the west side of Disneyland Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney are prime for redevelopment. The area could house new Disney-themed hotels dining entertainment and the expansion of Disneyland and Disney California Adventure.

Anaheim city officials told Spectrum News Friday that the Disneyland Forward project is still in its early phases.

""We are likely to see Disney begin the process of city approval consideration in 2023"" said Mike Lyster an Anaheim spokesman to Spectrum News.

Disneyland officials did not return a Spectrum News message seeking comment or updates regarding the Disneyland Forward project Tarzan's Treehouse and MagicBands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2Rpc25leS13b3JsZC1oYXMtYS12aWxsYWlub3VzLWFuc3dlci1mb3ItdW5pdmVyc2FsLWVwaWMtdW5pdmVyc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World Has a Villainous Answer for Universal Epic Universe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/disney-world-has-a-villainous-answer-for-universal-epic-universe on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2Rpc25leS13b3JsZC1oYXMtYS12aWxsYWlub3VzLWFuc3dlci1mb3ItdW5pdmVyc2FsLWVwaWMtdW5pdmVyc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xpdHRsZS1tZXJtYWlkLXJhY2lzdC1iYWNrbGFzaC1oYWxsZS1iYWlsZXktZGlzbmV5LWNlYy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFnaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xpdHRsZS1tZXJtYWlkLXJhY2lzdC1iYWNrbGFzaC1oYWxsZS1iYWlsZXktZGlzbmV5LWNlYw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analysis: A definitive rebuttal to every racist 'Little Mermaid' argument,"CNN ‚Äî

Ever since Disney released the first look for its 2023 live-action remake of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù the internet has been sodden with wave after wave of racist critics complaining that Ariel the completely fictional underwater fish woman shouldn‚Äôt be Black. Hashtags like #notmyariel are bouncing around social media and YouTube hid the dislike counter on the official video after it was bombarded with racist comments and more than 1.5 million ‚Äúdislikes.‚Äù One group of critics went as far as to share a digitally altered version of the teaser that featured a White woman in place of the movie‚Äôs star Halle Bailey who they called a ‚Äúwoke actress.‚Äù

By now we know it‚Äôs not unusual to see racist responses whenever a person of color is cast in a role considered ‚Äútraditionally‚Äù White. While there are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike a movie these critics often hide their discomfort behind other thin arguments claiming historical or cultural accuracy or of all things science.

Here are some real arguments people have levied to protest the casting choice. The facts prove they just don‚Äôt hold water.

Claim: ‚ÄòThe Little Mermaid‚Äô is a Danish story therefore Ariel should be White

The original ‚ÄúLittle Mermaid‚Äù story was written by Hans Christian Andersen and first published in 1837. If we‚Äôre going to dignify this argument according to the text Ariel and the rest of her mermaid kin are from ‚Äúfar out in the ocean‚Äù (literally the opening lines of the story) at the ‚Äúbottom of the sea.‚Äù So not Denmark or anywhere near it.

If critics are truly worried about staying faithful to the original story we shouldn‚Äôt gloss over the original ending where the mermaid is instructed to kill her prince but throws the knife away in despair and dissolves into sea foam instead. Not to mention while the 1989 Disney version has a Prince Eric with bright blue peepers Anderson specifically described the prince as having ‚Äúcoal-black eyes‚Äù and ‚Äúraven hair.‚Äù (Also ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt even have a name in the original story isn‚Äôt real.)

Claim: Mermaids live under the sea and therefore would not have dark skin

Could be a mermaid who knows. @adopamanatee

‚ÄúFrom a scientific perspective it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean.‚Äù So says far-right pundit Matt Walsh who opined about the ‚ÄúLittle Mermaid‚Äù casting on ‚ÄúThe Matt Walsh Show.‚Äù He claims he framed the comment as a joke since he goes on to say that ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãnot only should the Little Mermaid be pale she should actually be translucent.‚Äù However the context of his comment is still racially charged and he still implies pale skin is closer to a ‚Äúscientific‚Äù mermaid than dark skin.

Again if we‚Äôre going to take an academic look at these unnecessary bits of discourse not all abyssal creatures are pale. Not all underwater creatures are pale. Also since mermaids also get close enough to the surface to see other humans if you want to look at it scientifically mermaids would probably have a specific type of pigmentation that allowed for both a deep sea and shallow water existence. We also know that centuries ago seafarers often mistook one particular animal for a mermaid: the manatee which is not pale. (Also ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù isn‚Äôt real.)

Claim: Mermaids are a European mythological figure and therefore Ariel should be White

Numerous Twitter scraps have cropped up with people trying to argue European folklore or even Homerian epics like ‚ÄúThe Odyssey‚Äù have some sort of monopoly on the idea of mermaids. In reality it‚Äôs fascinating to see how many different cultures throughout history have arrived at parallel folklorical themes. Humanoid creatures that dwell in the water are part of innumerable mythologies around the world.

East Asian and Oceanic folklore is replete with stories of underwater kingdoms and merpeople both good and evil from the Magindara in some Philippine regions to the tale of the Indian Princess Suriratna or Hwang-ok that reached South Korea. Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the classic ‚ÄúArabian Nights‚Äù collection which dates back more than a thousand years feature several accounts of sea-dwelling human creatures. In parts of continental Africa and among the African diaspora folklore describing water spirits oftentimes in the shape of beautiful women are common. According to Shona mythology in Zimbabwe the ‚Äúnjuzu‚Äù are mermaids who occupy lakes or rivers.

(Also not all Europeans are White. Also ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù isn‚Äôt real.)

Claim: Making Ariel Black is ruining childhoods and changing the character

On message boards and comment sections across the internet people are debating whether a new dark-skinned Ariel somehow negates or erases the classic 1989 version.

Disney‚Äôs 1989 ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù is still available to watch own and share. The animated character of Ariel is part of Disney‚Äôs wildly profitable ‚ÄúDisney Princess‚Äù franchise and her name and image are valuable and heavily trademarked Disney properties. The red-haired fair-skinned Ariel is here to stay.

Far from ruining childhoods many fans think making a different iteration of Ariel will only increase the Disney magic. Just look at the sweet reactions of young Black children and the praise of Disney icons like Jodi Benson the voice of the original Ariel.

Video Ad Feedback Videos of young Black girls reacting to 'Little Mermaid' trailer go viral 01:07 - Source: CNN

More importantly the remake of one film doesn‚Äôt erase the existence of the previous films: 1999‚Äôs Mr. Darcy and 2005‚Äôs Mr. Darcy live in harmony with every other character from the roughly 300 ‚ÄúPride and Prejudice‚Äù film remakes. Pennywise looks different in every ‚ÄúIt‚Äù iteration as does Frankenstein‚Äôs monster. The story of ‚ÄúCinderella‚Äù which predates even the famous Brothers Grimm version seems to have a different remake out every year. One notable version 1997‚Äôs ‚ÄúRodgers & Hammerstein‚Äôs Cinderella‚Äù featured a racially diverse cast that included singer Brandy as the first Black Cinderella and Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother. It aired on TV as part of the ‚ÄúWonderful World of Disney.‚Äù

While Disney has produced a very famous iteration of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù it isn‚Äôt the first only or universally definitive work. No one owns the concept of mermaids or what they look like. A White red-haired animated teenager is not the only version of ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù to exist.

Also ‚Äì and this is very important ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù isn‚Äôt real.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWVudGh1c2lhc3RzLXRoZW1lLXBhcmstbG9zdC1tYWdpY9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWVudGh1c2lhc3RzLXRoZW1lLXBhcmstbG9zdC1tYWdpYy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney World 'enthusiasts' say theme park has 'lost its magic',"A majority of ""self-described Disney World enthusiasts"" say the Florida theme park has ""lost its magic"" due to skyrocketing costs according to a recent study.

A study from gambling website Time2play surveyed 1927 ""Disney World enthusiasts"" and of those 68.3% reported that the price hikes make them feel like the theme park has ""lost its magic."" A whopping 92.6% reported that they believe the high costs for the park has made a vacation for the average family ""out of reach.""

A ticket for Disney World‚Äôs Magic Kingdom in 1971 was a total of $3.50 according to the study. When adjusting for inflation that would mean tickets would be about $25.60 today. Instead tickets for one Disney World park range from $109 to $159 per day according to the study.

Nearly 50% of respondents reported postponing a trip due to the price hikes.

All in Disney World veterans can expect to pay 35.7% more for their next trip compared to their last one Time2play found.

A chart posted to social media last year by a researcher at SJ Data Visualizations a U.K.-based firm shows that prices for Disney World have risen by at least 3871% since 1971 with prices rising at a more drastic rate in the early 1980s compared to its first decade.

Families spoke out about the prices earlier this year as traveling picked back up following coronavirus lockdowns and they expressed shock at the price hikes. One dad of two estimated he would be on the hook for a $4000 to $5000 bill even with one of his kids qualifying for free admission.

""I understand inflation and all of those things. I understand cost increases"" Kentucky father Matt Day told the Washington Post earlier this year on the high prices. ""I always had the impression that Disney was a family vacation destination and that impression is why I was surprised to see how expensive it truly was ‚Äî and how out of reach it is for most American families.""

""It‚Äôs really unprecedented"" said Len Testa president of theme-park trip-planning site Touring Plans told the Washington Post earlier this year. ""We haven‚Äôt seen this sort of anger about price hikes in ‚Äî we can‚Äôt remember the last time something like this caused this much anger from Disney fans.""

Discovery and NBCUniversal Could Merge in 2024,"Analysts think that a Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal merger could be in the near future according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Warner Bros. Discovery has been struggling specifically as CEO David Zaslav searches for a Kevin Feige figure to head their DC franchise. Analysts think that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts could take advantage of the situation and purchase Warner Bros. Discovery to merge with NBCUniversal.

An executive with knowledge of both companies told THR ‚ÄúObviously Peacock sucks. There are some good synergies. I‚Äôm sure [Roberts] is licking his chops because the [WBD] stock is so low. And I think that‚Äôs Zaslav‚Äôs endgame. Get the place sold.‚Äù

Meanwhile a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson has said ‚ÄúWe are building Warner Bros. Discovery for the long term.‚Äù

As ComicBook.com notes this merger couldn‚Äôt take place until April 2024 when Comcast has the right but not the obligation to sell its remaining 33% stock of Hulu to Disney. Roberts did suggest at the Goldman Sachs + Technology Conference that he would be open to instead buying Hulu outright.

‚ÄúI believe if Hulu was put up for sale Comcast would be interested [in buying it]‚Äù Roberts said. ‚ÄúSo would a lot of other tech and media companies. You would have a robust auction.‚Äù

Discovery NBCUniversal Merger Be Looming In The Future?,"No one has been able to figure out the riddle that is the DC Extended Cinematic Universe. To the point where it and the rest of Warner Bros. have been passed along from owner to owner who thinks they can figure it out and make some money. Each attempt the people in charge have looked ridiculous as the competitor thrives and runs a well-oiled machine. Now up to bat is Warner Bros. Discovery.

There was a lot of excitement when Discovery bought Warner Bros. becoming Warner Bros. Discovery. But all that has changed with many of the decisions that David Zaslav made. It started with a very limited showing at San Diego Comic-Con where attendees were information they already knew. But that‚Äôs ok DC Fandom has been very successful so that must be the plan right?

Nope just recently they also announced that DC Fandom has been canceled as they are looking forward to bringing the DC world to different in-person events. At this point DC fans are not holding their breaths.

In between he also made the huge decision of canceling Batgirl a film that was set to be released on HBO Max and was already in post-production. This decision along with a lack of information saw the majority of DC fans completely lose faith in Zaslav and Warner Bros. Discovery.

To make it worse you had the controversy with Ezra Miller who is supposed to be the feature in what may be what sets up the DCEU for the future. Could the film even be released? Then you have DC Film president Walter Hamada wanting out after Zaslav revealed his plans for the DCEU. Furthermore Warner Bros. Discovery has found it extremely challenging to find their ‚ÄúKevin Feige‚Äù for their superheroes. Which for any candidate would be a very unfair pair of shoes to fill immediately.

With Warner Bros. Discovery dealing with lots of debt skeptical investors and a fanbase that has lost faith in leadership is this something that Zaslav has the ability to fix? The Hollywood Reporter says that there may be much uncertainty from shareholders maybe even looking for an acquirer.

Industry observers now believe that another move waits for Warner Bros. Discovery in the future. But it‚Äôs important to note that a move like that couldn‚Äôt happen until spring 2024 due to the structure of the merger. At that point many believe that Comcast‚Äôs Brian Roberts will make a move to try and combine NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery.

This would give NBCUniversal the solid streaming service it has always looked for. Via The Hollywood Reporter they say an executive with knowledge of both companies says Zaslav‚Äôs endgame is to get the place sold. But a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson responded by saying that they are building the brand for the long term.

In the end we can be reacting to something that will never happen. To be fair change takes time and effort. It would be better to take a little more time and get it right. Rather than rush into trying to catch up with Marvel and fall on their faces (again). If it doesn‚Äôt work it might be a good idea to give NBCUniversal a shot. It is just very interesting to see that any major entertainment company would have such a hard time with some of the world‚Äôs most well-known properties like Superman Batman and Wonder Woman.

Would you like to see a major move like that from Warner Bros. Discovery? Or do you feel that we need to give them a fair shot before we bring out the torches and pitchforks? Let us know in the comment section below!

The rumor mill is cranking up in Hollywood as chatter gets louder that NBCUniversal might try to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. [See The Hollywood Reporter's Warner Bros. Discovery Has Bigger Problems Than Its DC Search.]

That acquisition could be a dream come true for theme park fans as it would give Universal's theme parks new access to many Warner Bros. franchises including a wide variety of horror IP for Halloween Horror Nights. But a takeover would not allow Universal to create attractions themed to what might be Warner Bros. crown jewels - DC and Looney Tunes.

Six Flags owns the theme park rights to DC and Looney Tunes and that deal would not change with NBCUniversal buying Warner Bros. Discovery just as Universal Orlando's deal with Marvel did not change when Disney bought Marvel. The only way for Universal to get access to DC and Looney Tunes would be to buy those rights from Six Flags or to buy Six Flags in its entirety. But NBCUniversal would have to have bought Warner Bros. Discovery already to make that second option work. Six Flags' contract for the DC and Looney Tunes rights states that if an entertainment company buys Six Flags the theme park rights to those characters revert to Warner Bros. [Who Really Owns the Theme Park Rights to the DC and Marvel Comic Characters?]

But what's the incentive for Universal's theme parks to go after DC? Universal Orlando already has the rights to Marvel and can keep them as long as the company wants. Disney has reached out to NBCUniversal multiple times to offer to acquire those rights for the Walt Disney World Resort and NBCUniversal in so many words has told Disney to go jump into the Toon Lagoon.

Now if Universal had access to the DC rights that might make the company willing to entertain an offer from Disney for the east coast Marvel rights. But unless Disney comes forward with something that Universal really needs the Mouse House is going to have to offer to write a very very large check to get NBCUniversal's attention.

And no the soon-to-expire theme park rights to The Simpsons are not compelling enough to get Universal to give up Marvel especially if NBCUniversal gets Warner Bros. Discovery and can swap in whatever Hanna-Barbera franchise it wants into those spaces. It's not difficult to imagine Hollywood's Springfield becoming Bedrock with the vehicles in The Simpsons Ride becoming the Flintstones' car. Or maybe a Willy Wonka land if Universal does not wish to return to its Hanna-Barbera days.

So what could Universal's theme parks get if NBCUniversal acquires Warner Bros. Discovery? In addition to Hanna-Barbera and Willy Wonka WBD controls Cartoon Network which could deepen Universal's lineup of characters to populate future kids' lands.

Warner Bros. Discovery also controls New Line Cinema which produced Austin Powers Dumb and Dumber Friday The Mask and Elf as well as Friday the 13th A Nightmare on Elm Street Final Destination IT and The Conjuring on the horror side.

A Warner Bros. deal probably does not give Universal the theme park rights to Middle-earth which are now controlled by Embracer Group. ['The Lord of the Rings' Gets a New Owner - Theme Park Deals Next?] Warner Bros. Discovery owns HBO however which brings Game of Thrones into play for the fantasy space.

Other Warner Bros. franchises with potential theme park value include Mad Max The Matrix Blade Runner and Beetlejuice which has appeared recently under license at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights. Warner Bros. also owns the rights to the Wizarding World which it has licensed to Universal but NBCUniversal parent Comcast would save a bundle on those licensing fees if they were just going from one division of the company to another.

But the biggest opportunity for Universal's theme parks might be on the capital side. A Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition would give NBCUniversal ownership of the Warner Bros. studio lot - and Warner Bros. Studio Tour - next door to Universal Studios Hollywood. That immediately gives Universal a second gate in California for its theme park visitors. Eventually Universal Parks leadership would need to make some hard decisions about how the Warner Bros. attraction would fit with its Universal Studios Hollywood neighbor next door while NBCUniversal leadership considers how access to the Warner Bros. studio lot and its soundstages might allow Universal Studios to reallocate more of its current USH studio space for theme park operations.

Ultimately if Comcast decides that NBCUniversal should bid for Warner Bros. Discovery once that opportunity opens in 2024 that decision will rest on the value of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets to NBCUniversal's studios streaming and linear networks with theme parks an afterthought. But this deal would create immense opportunities - and potential challenges - for Universal Parks & Resorts.

You better believe that Universal Parks management is thinking about them right now. So it's understandable that forward-thinking theme park fans might want to consider them too.

Discovery from its various rivals among the big media conglomerates it‚Äôs got to be how sparse a series of fucks the newly merged company seems to give about the concept of streaming.

What's on this week CC Share Subtitles Off

English view video What's on this week

We‚Äôve had plenty of examples of this fucklessness already of course starting with CEO David Zaslav‚Äôs brutal decision to kill off HBO Max -exclusive films like Batgirl and Scoob: Holiday Haunt. But see also a new report from THR focused in on the company‚Äôs approach to the hallowed principle of streaming exclusivity which many of the big streamers have spent billions assuming will be one of the key issues separating the Peacocks from the Tubis and what-have-you in the coming years . Everybody has to have their own catalog of content that‚Äôs theirs the idea goes and that doesn‚Äôt get shared out to the enemy. HBO Max though? HBO Max couldn‚Äôt give a crap about that stuff; if you want something from its library to license just name a price.

See for instance the company‚Äôs recent treatment of its Lord Of The Rings movies one of the biggest IP troves in WBD‚Äôs possession. T hat didn‚Äôt stop Warner from cheerfully licensing out the Peter Jackson films to Amazon Prime Video recently as part of a promotional push for Lord Of The Rings: Rings Of Power (which to be clear operates on a separate set of rights from the films disconnected from this licensing agreement). Amazon got a nice promo for its show Warner Bros. Discovery got a big stack of cash; it‚Äôs almost like we were back in the world of Netflix circa like 2012 when cross-company streaming partnerships were far more common.

Gunnar Wiedenfels Warner-Discovery‚Äôs newly minted CFO laid out the idea during a recent conference: ‚Äú We have a ton of content that has been sitting idly for just purely principle reasons‚Äù Wiedenfels said noting that the Amazon deal was a non-exclusivity window that might have even drawn some viewers back to HBO Max. It‚Äôs a surprisingly compelling philosophy asking basically what HBO Max actually gets from keeping a bunch of exclusive content locked away for itself .

Mind you the company‚Äôs transition into this mindset has been extremely ugly‚Äîbuzz- sawing through already commissioned (or nearly completed) projects and treating creators who were working for them in good faith like total garbage. There‚Äôs no reason beyond a frenzy for budget cuts that CEO David Zaslav couldn‚Äôt have rolled out this transition more humanely honoring the work that had already been ordered before walking back levels of exclusive content production. But nevertheless there‚Äôs something at least novel in seeing a company approach its intellectual property not as a bludgeon it can use to smash its enemies into submission which has been the norm in streaming since pretty much the moment Disney+ barged onto the scene.

Hell they might even be getting the DC Comics properties into it; as we previously reported several animated projects that were originally slated for HBO Max‚Äîmost notably Bruce Timm ‚Äôs much-anticipated Batman: Caped Crusader‚Äîare being shopped to other streamers. Netflix Amazon and Hulu are all biting and why not? It‚Äôs not like HBO Max needs this stuff.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaGVyb2ljaG9sbHl3b29kLmNvbS93YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktbmJjdW5pdmVyc2FsLXBvc3NpYmxlLW1lcmdlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Observers Speculate A Warner Bros. Discovery & NBCUniversal Merger,"Industry insiders are speculating that Warner Bros. Discovery may enter negotiations to merge with NBCUniversal in the future.

Ever since Warner Bros. Discovery became official earlier this year many DC Comics fans had some cautious optimism regarding the new direction for the franchise especially when it comes to the future of its film franchise with plans for a content vertical akin to Marvel Studios confirmed. However it didn‚Äôt take too long for the morale amongst fans and even the industry to take a downturn. With the cancellation of Batgirl and the removal of much of HBO Max‚Äôs original content among other decisions David Zaslav has become a controversial CEO and some speculate that with the stock becoming significantly lowered Zaslav has plans for the company to get sold.

When you also factor in the search for a Kevin Feige-esque leader to spearhead DC Films it‚Äôs clear that things are only getting more difficult especially after negotiations with Dan Lin fell apart. A leading talent representative told THR the following:

‚ÄúZaslav doesn‚Äôt know what he doesn‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs scary. And you‚Äôre always going to be compared to Marvel. It‚Äôs unfair. By the time they were being judged it was working. It‚Äôs the exact opposite at Warner. It‚Äôs rough all around. Who the fuck would want that job?‚Äù

Will Warner Bros. undergo yet another sale?

THR reports that no negotiations can happen until April 2024 but by that time some industry observers speculate that Brian Robbins Chairman and CEO of Comcast may have his eyes on Warner Bros. Discovery and may want to combine it with NBCUniversal. An executive with knowledge of both companies gave the following statement to THR:

‚ÄúObviously Peacock sucks. There are some good synergies. I‚Äôm sure [Roberts] is licking his chops because the [WBD] stock is so low. And I think that‚Äôs Zaslav‚Äôs endgame. Get the place sold.‚Äù

THR also reports that many insiders within the industry are already preparing for the possibility of a merger with NBCUniversal which would be comparable to Disney‚Äôs acquisition of 21st Century Fox with one insider releasing the following statement:

‚ÄúPeople feel like it‚Äôs Comcast for sure. It‚Äôs going to be so depressing to lose another major studio [after Disney bought Fox]. And Warners was the Tiffany studio.‚Äù

David Zaslav‚Äôs tenure as the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery has only been a few months old at this point but his approach will certainly leave some massive impact onto the company that will likely be looked back and analyzed upon for years to come. If Zaslav intends to get the company sold don‚Äôt be surprised if Comcast plans to merge it with NBCUniversal. After all like the insider mentioned above who actually enjoys using Peacock beyond rewatching The Office for the 17th time?

Digitization and AI are ground-breaking when applied to waste management as part of the recycling process and there is no doubt that they will need to play a key role in the achievement of a truly circular economy. They enable tracking and measurement of material recycling ensuring quality is maintained and allowing commercial and technical decisions that support plant optimum efficiency. Additionally the data and insights that artificial intelligence provides such as real-time compositional analysis and monitoring of AI-sorted materials through client dashboards aid MRF managers in better understanding their processes and making business and strategic decisions on waste sorting.

What processes are best suited for smart solutions?

Quality assurance throughout the journey of the waste stream and quality control are two processes well-suited to automation. It is possible for an MRF to save millions of euros by automating the manual QC process. Knowing the full details of the composition of the materials entering and leaving a facility ultimately provides the plant manager with the opportunity to boost profitability and ensure correct levels of purity are maintained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pYW1pYmVhY2hmbC5nb3YvZXZlbnRzL2hvdXNlaG9sZC1oYXphcmRvdXMtd2FzdGUtYW5kLXBhcGVyLXNocmVkLWEtdGhvbi0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Household Hazardous Waste and Paper Shred-a-thon,"Need to safely dispose of your household hazardous chemicals and waste?

Here's how one Austin organization repurposes it,"Austin's State of the Food System reports that 1.24 million pounds of food go to waste every day.

AUSTIN Texas ‚Äî The City of Austin recently released its State of the Food System report. In the report it highlights current challenges in the local food system and areas of opportunity.

One of the big things this report looks into is food waste. Every day 1.24 million pounds of food go straight to the trash in Austin.

""That's a major source of greenhouse gas emissions"" said Edwin Marty City of Austin food policy manager.

When this food ends up in landfills it generates methane the most potent greenhouse gas.

""Decomposing food in landfills accounts for about 2% of our community‚Äôs total greenhouse gas emissions"" the report stated.

One of the main reasons so much food ends up in landfills is because grocery stores and restaurants throw it away when it doesn't sell or it's close to its ""best by"" date.

""It'll be like a bag of oranges where you get that one moldy orange in the whole bag and the rest of the oranges are fine"" said Linda Barden Keep Austin Fed executive director. ""Well the grocery store pulls that from the shelves because nobody will pick up that one bag.""

Keep Austin Fed is an organization hoping to give a new life to these still-good foods. Barden said they have partnerships with different restaurants and grocery stores. They pick up all the food still good that would otherwise go to the trash on a weekly basis.

""One of the restaurants we work with they cut off those tips at the end of the tenderloin"" she added. ""And those are like the ugly bits of the steak. But it's still delicious. And so they take all those tips put them in a bag and freeze them for us.""

Keep Austin Fed then sorts through the donated food and gives it to people in need.

Last year alone they were able to collect over 800000 pounds of food.

For food that can't be recovered composting is a great option. In fact the City of Austin promotes composting by offering compost collection to all residential curbside customers.

The program collects food scraps yard trimmings food-soiled paper and natural fibers and converts them into nutrient-rich compost. For more information on composting click here.

Baffinland has posted on social media several times when it's noted a cruise ship going more than nine knots which is the mining company's own speed limit for its contracted vessels. On Sept. 13 the company posted about a cruise ship sailing at 13.8 knots ‚Äî speeds it called ""troubling.""

""Baffinland documents and reports all marine violations our ships included. The reason for our posts is not to shame or pass blame but to raise awareness about the need for standardized regulations for all ships in northern waterways"" said Peter Akman Baffinland's head of stakeholder relations.

""Baffinland ships voluntarily adhere to restrictions such as a maximum speed of nine knots and staying within an established shipping route in order to minimize any potential impact on marine mammals and the environment as a whole.""

In early August Baffinland reported its shipping monitors had tracked a Norwegian passenger ship travelling at speeds of 11 knots and entering what the Twitter post said included several Inuit ecological ""no go zones"" and narwhal calving grounds.

Nansen Polar Expeditions replied to Baffinland's post attributing the ship's speed and location to poor weather and saying they had been in touch with the community of Pond Inlet.

Baffinland‚Äôs Shipping Monitors have tracked a Norwegian passenger ship travelling at speeds of 11 kn & entering several Inuit ecological ‚Äòno go zones‚Äô & narwhal calving grounds. Our contracted vessels are restricted to 9 kn & narrow shipping lanes <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NansenPolarExpeditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NansenPolarExpeditions</a> <a href=""https://t.co/coZlalejE6"">pic.twitter.com/coZlalejE6</a> ‚Äî@BaffinlandIron

Located at the eastern entry of the Northwest Passage Pond Inlet has seen about 20 cruise ships this summer.

Baffinland whose port for the Mary River iron mine lies in Milne Inlet about 100 kilometres away from the community of Pond Inlet now receives alerts when any vessel in that area travels over nine knots.

Full-time Inuit shipping monitors based in Pond Inlet track and view vessels and provide daily updates Akman said.

Shipboard monitors on MV Botnica record data on marine mammal locations and behaviour other vessels ice conditions and seabird observations he said.

Baffinland works with community members hunters and trappers organizations and hamlets to ensure that all concerns related to shipping activities are considered Akman said.

Hunters in Pond Inlet have said shipping activity from Baffinland's Mary River Mine has a negative impact on narwhal numbers in the area.

While Baffinland has acknowledged the drop in narwhal numbers the company has argued there's no clear proof its shipping activities are to blame as other environmental factors such as changing sea ice conditions or new predator and prey dynamics could be at play.

In an online document about its marine wildlife monitoring Baffinland calls its current speed limit ""a strong and conservative mitigation measure.""

""To our knowledge this continues to be the lowest nautical speed limit in Canada"" said Lou Kamermans Baffinland's senior director of sustainable development in a June letter to the Nunavut Impact Review Board.

Meanwhile Baffinland awaits a recommendation from the Nunavut Impact Review Board next week on its move to keep Mary River ore production at six million tonnes.

No speed limits for cruise ships in Canadian Arctic waters

Transport Canada does not regulate specific speed restrictions in Canadian Arctic waters said Sau Sau Liu senior communications advisor with Transport Canada.

That's although there is a ""voluntary slowdown"" in marine protected areas particularly around the Anguniaqvia Niqiqyuam and the Tarium Niryutait in the western Arctic Liu said.

The Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators said its members are obligated to ""always comply with local and federal speed regulations and other legally required environmental protection measures.""

But the association does not have any additional regulations of its own regarding speed for cruise ships said Anne √òien the association's communications manager.

Pond Inlet lies in the heart of the Tallurutiup Imanga national marine conservation area.

As such Kristin Westdal science director at the conservation organization Oceans North supports the call for speed reductions by ships travelling in and around Tallurutiup Imanga.

Westdal said all operators should slow down in an area that is a ""sensitive and important narwhal habitat.""

The Qikiqtani Inuit Association has not yet responded to a request for comment about the call for cruise ships to slow down.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 20-year-old was the second-youngest winner on TOUR since World War II.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmFtZS9wYXRyaWNrLWJvd2VzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NTMwNDQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patrick Bowes Obituary (1958 - 2022) - Matthews NC - Charlotte Observer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/charlotte/name/patrick-bowes-obituary?id=36530441 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGFybG90dGUvbmFtZS9wYXRyaWNrLWJvd2VzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NTMwNDQx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZwYXNzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwtYWR2aXNvci9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLXByZXNpZGVudHMtY3VwLWdvbGYtY291cnNlLXByZXZpZXctcXVhaWwtaG9sbG93LWNsdWItaG9sZS1ieS1ob2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A hole-by-hole guide to Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte North Carolina,"The Quail Hollow Club has become a since familiar sight to golf fans as it continues to host big events from the PGA TOUR's Wells Fargo Championship to the 2017 PGA Championship 2022 Presidents Cup and the upcoming 2025 PGA Championship.

For the most part Quail Hollow is very much in the mold of typical modern championship layouts: large in scale broad-shouldered and long with narrow fairways plenty of water greens that accommodate a good variety of hole locations and pearly white bunkers. The course has a core routing with periodic reminders of its location in one of Charlotte's wealthiest neighborhoods in the form of mansion-sized homes along the perimeter.

George Cobb laid out Quail Hollow's original course in 1961. By the end of the decade it was hosting the PGA Tour's Kemper Open which would return to Charlotte until 1979. The 1980s saw changes to four holes by Arnold Palmer. Starting in 1997 though Tom Fazio has been Quail Hollow's architect of record undertaking first a major course rebuild in 1997 followed by further tweaks in 2003 and 2016. All along though the course has been reliably well-liked by the world's best golfers: there aren't a lot of tricks or quirks and the best drivers of the ball tend to flourish (witness Rory McIlroy's three Wells Fargo titles).

Quail Hollow's ""The Green Mile"" finish from holes 15th through 18th holes sets up lots of drama. The watery par-3 17th is demanding while the menacingly tight uphill 18th features a tiny but terrifying stream dancing along the entire left side of the hole from green back to tee.

Quail Hollow Club Par 71 7529 yards

Hole No. 1 - Par 4 495 yards

The opening hole at Quail Hollow which Tom Fazio fashioned out of the original course's first two holes ahead of the 2017 PGA Championship swings downhill and to the right. Chris Condon/PGA TOUR

Swinging downhill and to the right this hole requires players to smash a power-fade down the hill. The last of three fairway bunkers at 330 yards off the back tee will be very much in play under most circumstances. Avoiding the sand sets up a downhill approach to a long well-bunkered green. A fitting start to an exacting golf course.

Hole No. 2 - Par 4 452 yards

Reversing direction on the first and heading back uphill this par 4 will be a welcome sight to drawers of the golf ball. Players will do well to cheat slightly left on their approach shots as everything slopes down to the right off this green to a low fairway area and the hole's lone bunker.

Hole No. 3 - Par 4 483 yards

Playing to the northwest corner of the property and running straightaway along the left side of Quail Hollow's short game practice area this hole has one of the course's narrowest fairways with a bunker pinching it to just 25 yards across around the 310-yard mark from the tee. Three more bunkers guard the green which has a false front and a distinct tier through the middle.

Hole No. 4 - Par 3 167 yards

There's more room than appears to be available on this green beyond the three fronting bunkers though a falloff at the back-right edge can carry a ball into the rough. A front-right hole location in a slight funnel between the first to bunkers - and above a false front - could create some early drama.

Hole No. 5 - Par 4 449 yards

Bunkers line the landing area here with two swallowing up right misses of between 270 and 325 yards while one more on the left starts at 310 potentially serving as a target for those who may want to hit 3 wood. False edges at both the front of the green and the middle-right make hole locations close over the greenside bunker doubly tricky.

Hole No. 6 - Par 3 249 yards

Despite its gaudy scorecard yardage the fact that this hole plays about 25 feet downhill means players will likely be hitting some kind of iron. The green narrows toward the back but a gathering slope at the back-right could be used to funnel a tee shot close. Going too far in that direction could mean a tough up-and-down out of one of the hole's two greenside bunkers.

Hole No. 7 - Par 5 546 yards

After a meat-and-potatoes opening half-dozen holes the fun begins in earnest. The first of Quail Hollow's three par fives is also its shortest and should provide a jolt of excitement to any matches that are struggling to get going. Water - a dammed creek that creates a wider waterway along the fairway and green - lines the entire right side of the hole and while no one would mistake this hole for the 13th at Augusta National (though both the course's architects George Cobb and Tom Fazio have worked on the Masters host course) the green has a dramatic slope down to the front-right portion that will make hole locations perched over the water exciting to attack. There will be eagles and some attempts at glory will fail spectacularly with splashdowns.

Hole No. 8 - Par 4 346 yards

With a green broken into distinct sections those who do whale away at the green from the tee will need to miss in the correct spot in order to avoid an impossible up-and-down.

Hole No. 9 - Par 4 505 yards

The ninth hole played as the 18th for the 2022 Presidents Cup. Chris Condon/PGA TOUR

There is a noticeable rise on the left-middle portion of the green that can contain and redirect shots toward rear and rear-right hole locations.

Hole No. 10 - Par 5 592 yards

At no. 10 the fairway drifts slightly toward the left-side fairway bunker that sits 310 yards off the back tee. Avoiding it means a potential eagle putt after another strong long shot to the green bunkered on each side and sloughing off shots short and right.

Hole No. 11 - Par 4 462 yards

Two fairway bunkers cover the left side of the landing area between 250 and 325 yards off the tee waiting to catch an over-hooked drive. The entire field will need to confront them one way or another. The next order of business is to clear the false front and avoid two more bunkers menacing the left side of the green.

Hole No. 12 - Par 4 456 yards

The 12th hole is a medium-length par 4 that will connect them with the most exciting portion of the course including the ""Green Mile."" The slender unbunkered fairway drifts downhill about 20 feet to a two-tiered green.

Hole No. 13 - Par 3 208 yards

Playing over an attractive brook this one-shotter will invite players' eyes left to look ahead a few holes but there's still a solid mid-iron to hit to a green that wants to shrug marginal shots down and to the right.

Hole No. 14 - Par 4 344 yards

The 14th hole at Quail Hollow is a strong par 4. Chris Condon/PGA TOUR

The 14th is potentially the most exciting hole on the course. The 50-yard-long green perched over a lake can create very awkward short second shots for players who get out of position after a wayward drive; disaster will likely strike players who either get greedy off the tee or try to hit a heroic recovery. Don't be surprised to see a player who lays up off the tee triumph over one who tries to bite off more than he can chew.

Hole No. 15 - Par 5 577 yards

For the fourth time in six holes eagle is potentially on the table. The slightly downhill right-to-left sweep of the landing area will have bombers salivating and a good drive will leave as little as a mid-iron up the hill (possibly off a hanging lie) to a green with relatively modest internal movement. The best ball-strikers will separate themselves here.

Hole No. 16 - Par 4 506 yards

It's 320 yards to clear the lone fairway bunker on the right. The day's best driver swing by the longest players could pay big dividends as the landing area leans downhill from that point making this imposing hole much more gettable. But most will have to play left leaving one of the longest approach shots of the day to a green wedged between a bunker and the lake.

Hole No. 17 - Par 3 190 yards

The par-3 17th at Quail Hollow is a scary water-logged downhill par 3. Ben Jared/US PGA TOUR

In reality the green on this par 3 is plenty large. But the shot plays downhill a bunker pinches the front-right and water wraps around the front left and back portions of the putting surface making it look as small as it possibly could. A fearless iron shot to a tucked pin here could help win a prestigious Tour event.

Hole No. 18 - Par 4 494 yards

Danger lurks all over the 18th hole at Quail Hollow. Chris Condon/PGA TOUR

The carnage on this brutal test is usually caused by the hole's uphill climb the right-hand fairway bunker and the stream that harangues the entire left side of the hole. The stream lurks on both the tee and approach shot causing anxiety for any player in contention.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zZWF0dGxlL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC80MC11bmRlci00MC1hbnRvbmlvLW1hc29uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40 Under 40: Antonio Mason PNC - Puget Sound Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/09/18/40-under-40-antonio-mason.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9zZWF0dGxlL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS8xOC80MC11bmRlci00MC1hbnRvbmlvLW1hc29uLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The writer-director made waves March when he released X his A24-produced love letter to 1970s slasher flicks. Now he‚Äôs back with Pearl. The new film which is a prequel set 60 years before the events of X reunites him with star Mia Goth who reprises her role from the first film and plays Pearl‚Äòs titular killer. Together the two films have cemented Goth and West as one of the most exciting director-actor pairs working in Hollywood right now.

Despite their obvious similarities Pearl is also strikingly different from X. Unlike West‚Äôs previous directorial effort Pearl boasts a vibrant colorful look that makes it feel as West recently remarked during a conversation with Digital Trends like a ‚Äúlive-action Disney movie from the 1940s ‚Äô50s or ‚Äô60s.‚Äù The film‚Äôs playful Technicolor aesthetic when combined with its tale of madness and murder helps cement Pearl as the second great horror movie that West has released this year.

Below West opens up about how a global lockdown gave him the idea to make his surprise X prequel reveals what it was like writing the script for Pearl with Goth and names the beloved Michael Mann thriller that he thinks has the best needle drop in cinema history.

(Note: This interview contains minor spoilers for Pearl and has been edited for length and clarity purposes.)

Digital Trends: You‚Äôve mentioned that you wrote Pearl while making X but what was that process actually like? How quickly did you write the film‚Äôs script?

Ti West: The bulk of it was about two weeks. I say that very specifically because we went to New Zealand to make X because it was peak COVID and New Zealand was a safe place to make a film. So after we‚Äôd gotten our visas sorted been granted our essential workers permits and had a crew assembled we were going to go and build all these locations for X. To me it seemed weird to then just tear all that down and go home when we had no sense of whether we‚Äôd ever make a movie again.

We were so fortunate to be there that I had the idea that we should make two movies and just stay in New Zealand. I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to convince A24 of that but I thought ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt make a sequel to X because I don‚Äôt want to just have more people show up at a farm and get killed. That doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù So the question became ‚ÄúWell how do we use all the same sets?‚Äù

I thought ‚ÄúWell we could go backward and focus on a younger Pearl.‚Äù At the same time I was already talking to Mia a lot about Pearl‚Äôs backstory because we catch up with Pearl very late in her life in X and that became the idea behind this other movie I wanted to make. I pitched it to A24 and they were intrigued but they weren‚Äôt quite ready to just make two movies. But then we had to do a mandatory quarantine period to get into New Zealand so we all had to sit in a hotel for two weeks. I went there ahead of Mia so I started writing it right away.

Eventually I said to her ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it together.‚Äù After that we‚Äôd FaceTime and for those two weeks we just cranked out what essentially became the gist of Pearl. We sent that to A24 when we left quarantine. They became more intrigued and about a month later they said ‚ÄúOK we‚Äôll do it‚Äù which is incredible because they were greenlighting a prequel to a movie we hadn‚Äôt even shot yet. But because they did it at that time we were able to make X informed by what Pearl was going to be. It was really a unique situation.

Mia has a co-writing credit on Pearl. What was it like writing with her?

There would be no Pearl without Mia. To me it just felt like she had to be part of it from its conception. That was the only way that made sense to me and it was really cool. I had not written with an actor before but she already knew the character pretty well and we had already been coming up with her backstory together so we would FaceTime and I would write stuff or I would give her things to write about.

She would then send stuff to me and I would put her scenes into more of a script format because she hadn‚Äôt really done that before. We would just bounce stuff back and forth or I would say ‚ÄúHey what kind of scene do you want to do in a movie?‚Äù She‚Äôd go ‚ÄúI like this‚Äù and we would say ‚ÄúOK well how can we work that into it?‚Äù We came up with the film‚Äôs scenes that way.

Pearl feels like a riff on a kind of movie that hasn‚Äôt been given the horror treatment very often. What sources were you pulling from when you were conceptualizing it?

For me the main drive of the film was that Pearl is full of wonder and hope and ambition. To me she felt somewhat childishly na√Øve and that made Pearl feel like a Disney movie in my mind like a kind of live-action Disney movie from the 1940s ‚Äô50s or ‚Äô60s. The contrast between that and Pearl‚Äôs psychological journey felt in a demented way fresh. It felt like a way for me to take something that was relatively retro and kind of modernize it in a way that I hadn‚Äôt seen done before.

The film‚Äôs set design is really striking. Everything is just covered in bright pastel colors. In your mind was that just a reflection of Pearl‚Äôs own optimism and sense of wonder?

In a way but once you start committing to the aesthetic you have to commit you know what I mean? You couldn‚Äôt half-ass it or else it wouldn‚Äôt look like anything. It was weird though because we were coming off X which was a very different aesthetic. So when we started working on Pearl and we started redesigning the sets I definitely thought ‚ÄúOh ‚Ä¶ I hope this works [laughs]. There are some big swings here.‚Äù But you know if you‚Äôre gonna get wet you might as well go swimming and we just went for it.

Pearl is also a character study whereas X is an ensemble film. It feels like that greatly affected the way you structured the two films. Did the differences between the two just come to you naturally?

I don‚Äôt do a lot of thinking like that about my scripts. I usually just have a sense of a story or a sense of the characters and then I just start writing. I don‚Äôt really outline. I just get characters talking to one another and get scenes rolling and then they turn out the way they do.

I always know the basics of where each movie is headed but with Pearl it wasn‚Äôt like I took a different approach necessarily than I did with X. It was just about asking ‚ÄúOK what‚Äôs Pearl‚Äôs story?‚Äù Mia and I just took it from there. That said from an editing standpoint Pearl‚Äôs certainly a more straightforward beast because it‚Äôs never bouncing around to as many points of view as X.

The violence in Pearl feels very different than it did in X which leaned into its ‚Äô70s-inspired slasher movie version of gore. Was that a conscious decision on your part?

It was just a different story altogether. With this film it was always about serving Pearl‚Äôs psychology and emotions. It‚Äôs a more traditional movie than X is and it‚Äôs probably a more well-structured film all around because it‚Äôs about a person going through something and less about a group of people going to a place and shit happening. In that way it tells a more traditional story but every choice in it was pretty much made just to serve Pearl‚Äôs emotions.

Pearl also culminates with what is essentially one very long monologue which I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a horror movie do before. How did you and Mia land on that as the film‚Äôs climax?

I always had the idea that the climax of the movie which is very showy aesthetically needed to be a close-up of Mia. The climax had to be about Pearl‚Äôs psychology and her emotions. That‚Äôs just what the climax had to be. It wasn‚Äôt about something blowing up or people getting killed. It was about how Pearl is feeling and all the roads led to that.

I don‚Äôt know why it became a monologue but I think one day we just thought ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôll just say how she‚Äôs feeling.‚Äù From there the dominoes slowly started to fall and we ended up with the monologue that‚Äôs in the movie and Mia kills it. It‚Äôs all a credit to her.

The shot you pull off after Pearl‚Äôs monologue is one of my favorite horror movie moments that I‚Äôve seen in a long time.

I appreciate that. There were some high-stakes behind that shot. I had seen that shot in my head from the very beginning of making the movie and it was this really deceptively complicated thing to do. It‚Äôs really a credit to Mia and [castmate] Emma [Jenkins-Purro] and how they timed everything out. It was very complicated to do and I had no backup plan [laughs]. I was like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna have to do this all day and I don‚Äôt know what to do if we fail.‚Äù But it‚Äôs a credit to everyone involved that we actually did it.

The film also ends on a really interesting note. You don‚Äôt ever flash-forward to X or show Pearl again as an old woman. Was it always the plan to end Pearl where you do?

It was always going to end how it ends.

Really?

Yeah and the ending is a big credit to Mia‚Äôs talent. I had an idea originally that Pearl was going to open with a freeze frame involving an alligator which it does and I thought that we‚Äôd have the end credits be Pearl giving a big smile that we‚Äôd freeze frame. But then I had this weird idea about Pearl trying to hold an organic freeze frame for as long as she could. I sprung it on Mia right before we shot the scene and she was like ‚ÄúOK I‚Äôll try it.‚Äù

We only did it once and I just knew that we got it because what you see is what happened. I didn‚Äôt know what was gonna happen before we shot it. I just told her ‚ÄúHold it for as long as you can until your face gives out‚Äù and I was just sitting there watching it happen. I saw what everybody sees when they see the movie and I thought ‚ÄúThis is the perfect encapsulation of how this story ends and what‚Äôs still brewing for the future.‚Äù

Pearl | Official Trailer HD | A24

I have just two more questions for you. The first is: What‚Äôs your favorite movie you‚Äôve seen this year?

You know I have seen so little this year. I would love to see The Fabelmans which just premiered at TIFF. What have I seen this year [laughs]? I‚Äôve seen Top Gun: Maverick like everybody else which was great. But I‚Äôm trying to think what else I‚Äôve seen that was good. A lot. I have one more week and then I can sleep for a minute and hopefully get caught up on a whole year‚Äôs worth of movies.

Last question: Both X and Pearl feature some of this year‚Äôs best musical moments so what‚Äôs one of your favorite movie needle drops?

I like the Send Me An Angel montage in Rad [laughs] which is a BMX movie I saw when I was a kid. That was a very memorable one for me but [Quentin] Tarantino probably does it as well as anybody. I feel like every movie he makes always has at least one really incredible needle drop. But I‚Äôm trying to think of what I‚Äôve seen lately that has a really good one ‚Ä¶

Oh the best one is in Manhunter! The Strong As I Am needle drop in Manhunter when Tom Noonan thinks he‚Äôs watching Joan Allen flirt with somebody else but she actually just has an eyelash in her eye. The way he‚Äôs gripping the dashboard while that song plays is so great.

Pearl is now playing in theaters nationwide.

I scampered through Legend of Legaia Wild Arms 2 Legend of Dragoon Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete but wait ‚Ä¶ where was my copy of Final Fantasy Tactics? Absolute horror washed over me as I realized the greatest jewel of my childhood legacy was misplaced or potentially gone for good like Gollum mourning the loss of his precious ring. But hey at least the stylistically similar Arcadian Atlas is set to release next year meaning the Final Fantasy FOMO is less potent than it would be otherwise.

Arcadian Atlas Official Trailer (Gamescom 2021)

If this is the first you‚Äôre hearing of it Arcadian Atlas is a tactical RPG by Austin Texas-based developer Twin Otter Studios that commits to its obvious Final Fantasy Tactics roots. When I demoed the game at PAX West it immediately brought me back to my youth with a tribute to Final Fantasy Tactics‚Äô 16-bit visual style rich turn-based tactical combat and a party management system so seemingly robust that I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on it when it releases.

Up to 30 hours of tactical goodness

Arcadian Atlas features a familiar 16-bit-inspired visual style and an intuitive tactical combat system wherein your party can move around the map to gain specific advantages bending the flow of battle in your favor. Cleverly positioning your troops around the map can completely change how they match up against your opponents and since you can only move so many tiles per turn strategy is a majorly important element in Arcadian Atlas. Fans of the genre will already know what they‚Äôre in for but for what it‚Äôs worth each character gets to move and then use an action every turn making it important to choose your steps wisely.

Filling up around 30 hours Arcadian Atlas‚Äò story-centric campaign seems cute rather than serious and it‚Äôs yet to be seen if it‚Äôll climb the philosophical heights of its forebear. In the introductory sequence leading up to the first of the two battles showcased in my demo I watched a raccoon get alchemically shape-shifted into a spellcasting raccoon humanoid named Poncho. I appreciated the playfulness of this moment versus say Final Fantasy‚Äôs Ramza giving a Shakespearian monologue about death and freedom. I was offered the chance to execute a character during a story sequence though it‚Äôs hard to tell how important Arcadian Atlas‚Äô binary choices will ultimately be ‚Äî at least not without a closer look.

Warfare with class

Arcadian Atlas‚Äô isometric maps make pretty interesting use of verticality. One battle situated me (rather my party of up to five troops handpicked from a much larger roster) against a group of bandits occupying a wizard‚Äôs laboratory surrounded by some mountainous cliffs. I immediately sent my archer to the top of the cliffs and poured arrows down on the bandits below drawing their ire away from the rest of my party including the unexpectedly useful Poncho. I took issue with how easy it was for enemy ranged attackers to target my archer from the ground though I certainly gave my melee opponents a run for their money. Adding a little salt to the wound however I wasn‚Äôt even sure what my archer‚Äôs other abilities did ‚Ä¶ and this inadvertently set them up for failure when I mistakenly used an attack that would take two turns to fully wind up.

Arcadian Atlas features a robust class system with 12 classes ‚Äî including the warrior-like Cavaliers mage-like Warmancers Apothecaries who can throw potions like grenades or healing flasks Field Medics that do exactly what their name suggests and so forth. Each class is supposedly pretty customizable down the line though I didn‚Äôt get to test out any deeper character customization during my playthrough. It‚Äôs also possible for characters in your roster to permanently die which is exactly what happened to my archer by the end of the aforementioned battle.

There‚Äôs a lot of promise here for TRPG fans and possibly even JRPG fans. Of course it isn‚Äôt the only newish game in the tactical RPG genre. There‚Äôs the whole Fire Emblem series (which I‚Äôve never touched at any point in my life) and upcoming games like Lost Eidolons may scratch that same Final Fantasy Tactics itch when it releases next month. The key selling point for Arcadian Atlas however may just be its adherence to the familiar.

Talabi stated this in Abeokuta on Thursday at the second edition of the Secretaries to State Governments Forum saying the South-West states should adopt a uniform structure of digitalisation to encourage interconnectivity among them to avoid duplication of efforts.

He stated that the last meeting was an eye-opener on the need for collaboration cooperation and knowledge sharing among the states especially on cabinet affairs urging his colleagues to use the occasion not only to map out but implement those strategies to enable the region to forge ahead.

One of the resource persons at the event who is from the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies Prof Tunji Olaopa while speaking on the topic ‚ÄòThe Nigeria State Public Policy Implementation and the Challenge of Implementation‚Äô identified lack of national ideological framework for understanding development as a factor engendering impactful developmental initiatives by government at all levels.

Olaopa noted that to tackle the trend of uncompleted projects by states in the South-West the government should have the political will and leadership sophistication to harness the best of policy intelligence and expertise channel funds and resources based on technical-rationale parameters.

He tasked the South-West states on the deployment of required smart structures and methods as well as ensuring the recruitment of personnel to achieve an intelligent mixture that would facilitate efficient service delivery in the public sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RoZXBlbmluc3VsYXFhdGFyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzE4LzA5LzIwMjIvcWlpYi1sYXVuY2hlcy13ZXN0ZXJuLXVuaW9ucy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLW1vbmV5LXRyYW5zZmVyLXNlcnZpY2VzLXRvLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,QIIB launches Western Union's International Money Transfer Services to Bank Accounts,"The Peninsula

After nearly four days of protesting at various Weyerhaeuser sites a large rally was held at the Santiam Sawmill in Lebanon Oregon Saturday afternoon.

After a final offer was submitted earlier this week the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers submitted a counter-proposal Friday afternoon. They have yet to receive a response from Weyerhaeuser.

According to those at the rally Weyerhaeuser's record profits over the last five years made the proposed contract grossly unfair especially since the contract offer they were given contained cuts to pay and benefits.

""The company has record profits with record profits three of the last five years"" said Tom Theede one of the rally's organizers. ""We're not asking the company for anything [more] than what we deserve. A fair piece of the pie that's all we're asking the company to do.""

One of the union representatives claims that the outside counsel that Weyerhaeuser brought in was responsible for the process being as slow as it has been.

""They're dragging their feet"" said Brandon Bryant the President Directing Business Representative at IAMAW. ""This is the first time we've bargained with Weyerhaeuser where they've brought in an outside counsel to run their negotiation and that has done nothing but delay delay delay.""

Weyerhaeuser released a statement Tuesday in response to the ongoing strike.

""We have been formally engaged in collective bargaining with IAM since May and we have made several offers related to wages and benefits"" says Denise Merle senior vice president and chief administration officer for Weyerhaeuser. ""After we presented our final offer IAM workers at multiple sites went on strike late last night. While we are very disappointed in their decision to walk out we are committed to supporting our employees and negotiating in good faith with union representatives. We are prepared to continue discussions to produce a contract that is beneficial for employees and sustainable for the company across business cycles.""

Bryant added today that the groups have another meeting scheduled for Thursday September 22nd.

The Women‚Äôs Leadership Center will focus on developing sustaining and advancing diverse women leaders in a new purpose-built facility that connects to the storied cultural and natural landscape of the Williams Bay named after Capt. Israel Williams a mariner who settled in the area in 1837.

The Women‚Äôs Leadership Center at Williams Bay is founded and led by Ann M. Drake a Chicago business leader and president of Lincoln Road Enterprises LLC (Lincoln-Road.com) a transformative organization invested in the advancement of women‚Äôs leadership now and in the future.

‚ÄúWe are building a special place for women leaders to come together and learn innovate challenge old models and create new possibilities‚Äù said Drake a graduate of the University of Iowa with an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ‚ÄúI want the center to be a place where conversations happen that change the world.‚Äù

The center is expected to complete in late 2024 and will be located on a nine-acre parcel of woodland on the shores of Geneva Lake about 85 miles from downtown Chicago.

The center‚Äôs location adjoins the campuses of George Williams College of Aurora University and Yerkes Observatory.

Drake acquired the land with the aim of creating a unique destination designed to foster conversation and collaboration among women leaders at the forefront of public and private enterprise global supply chain engineering and technology infrastructure and design and space and astrophysics.

In this special setting women leaders can spark the high-impact ideas and connections that lead to global solutions for complex problems. In addition to the unique setting what sets the center in Williams Bay apart is its focus on women.

‚ÄúI realized I wanted to throw my whole-hearted support behind helping women succeed in areas I think are crucial to our future ‚Äî and making that future better for everyone‚Äù Drake said.

Inspired by her own experience as a trailblazing executive in a traditionally male industry ‚Äî supply chain management ‚Äî the center is a cornerstone of decades of effort by Drake to advance women‚Äôs leadership.

Before starting Lincoln Road Enterprises Drake was chairman and chief executive officer of Des Plaines Ill.-based DSC Logistics now CJ Logistics American a highly innovative and dynamic leader in supply chain and logistics management business partner to some of the world‚Äôs leading companies and recognized industry-wide for advancing supply chain thinking and practices. Under Drake‚Äôs guidance DSC helped transform the business of supply chain management from a commodity service into a critical and creative business strategy based on collaborative partnerships.

Architect selected

To lead the design effort for the Women‚Äôs Leadership Center Drake selected Studio Gang the award-winning architecture and urban design practice led by MacArthur Fellow Jeanne Gang.

Regularly named one of Fast Company‚Äôs ‚ÄúMost Innovative Architecture Companies‚Äù Studio Gang is headquartered in Chicago with offices in New York San Francisco and Paris.

Known for an approach that draws insight from ecological systems Studio Gang‚Äôs work builds stronger relationships between people and nature.

‚ÄúAs a place where women of diverse backgrounds and expertise will come together the Women‚Äôs Leadership Center builds on the rich history of Williams Bay as a place for knowledge sharing and interdisciplinary exchange‚Äù said Gang founding principal and partner of Studio Gang091422-lg-anndrakemug. ‚ÄúWe are excited to explore ways to realize Ann‚Äôs ambitions through architecture that fosters creativity and collaboration and embraces the natural beauty and ecology of Geneva Lake.‚Äù

In Gang Drake said she found a creative partner who immediately understood her vision for the center and who shares her respect for the site plus is aligned with her mission of supporting women in leadership.

‚ÄúJeanne‚Äôs sensibility for sustainable design that‚Äôs both beautiful and inspiring is extraordinary‚Äù Drake said. ‚ÄúHer team is developing concepts that mesh perfectly with the history and feel of this special piece of land.‚Äù

The center will facilitate meetings in different formats ranging from intimate gatherings of a few participants to larger convenings of 100 or more guests. It will also bring together participants in person and virtually for events that will be able to range from a few hours to several days.

Outside the built environment rambling pathways and lake access features will encourage Women‚Äôs Leadership Center visitors to explore the grounds and enjoy the natural setting.

Historic site

In overlooking Geneva Lake the Women‚Äôs Leadership Center will sit on a glacial reservoir formed 10000 years ago.

As population in the area grew in the 19th century ‚Äî particularly after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 ‚Äî the Geneva Lake region became a hub not only of vacation homes for prosperous city dwellers but also of numerous church-owned and other not-for-profit camps dotting the lakeshore.

The world-famous Yerkes Observatory adjoining the center‚Äôs site was built over a century ago to house the world‚Äôs largest refracting telescope which made it a destination for leading astronomers and scientists of the time. Thanks to discoveries made there early in the 20th century Yerkes became known as ‚Äúthe birthplace of modern astrophysics.‚Äù

The Yerkes Future Foundation is now leading the effort to restore the observatory buildings preserve their history and continue as a site for education and research. In founding the Women‚Äôs Leadership Center at Williams Bay Drake sees past and future coming together ‚Äî connecting ancient glaciers to the birth of astrophysics and the solitude of old forest to vibrant dialogue ‚Äî in a way that holds promise of a better world for all.

‚ÄúThe 125-year history of research discovery and education here makes this a perfect location for what I hope will be a global platform for collaboration creativity and conversation‚Äù Drake said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stand on the same hill where countless high-impact ideas and meaningful conversations began. The center will be a place for celebrating what has been ... but it will also be a place for imagining what could be.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4bmV0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLW5ld3MvaGVyZS1hcmUtdGhlLXRvcC0xMC1iaWdnZXN0LWVtcGxveWVycy1pbi1uZC1hbmQtaW4teW91ci1jb3VudHkv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3huZXQuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RhdGUtbmV3cy9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtdG9wLTEwLWJpZ2dlc3QtZW1wbG95ZXJzLWluLW5kLWFuZC1pbi15b3VyLWNvdW50eS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the top 10 biggest employers in ND ‚Äî and in your county,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.kxnet.com/news/state-news/here-are-the-top-10-biggest-employers-in-nd-and-in-your-county/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4bmV0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLW5ld3MvaGVyZS1hcmUtdGhlLXRvcC0xMC1iaWdnZXN0LWVtcGxveWVycy1pbi1uZC1hbmQtaW4teW91ci1jb3VudHkv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3huZXQuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RhdGUtbmV3cy9oZXJlLWFyZS10aGUtdG9wLTEwLWJpZ2dlc3QtZW1wbG95ZXJzLWluLW5kLWFuZC1pbi15b3VyLWNvdW50eS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc2FuZ2VsZXNibGFkZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9ncmluZHItZ29lcy1wdWJsaWMtd2l0aC1uZXctZ2F5LWNlby1tYWpvcml0eS1sZ2J0cS1ib2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grindr goes public with new gay CEO & majority LGBTQ+ board,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/09/17/grindr-goes-public-with-new-gay-ceo-majority-lgbtq-board/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc2FuZ2VsZXNibGFkZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xNy9ncmluZHItZ29lcy1wdWJsaWMtd2l0aC1uZXctZ2F5LWNlby1tYWpvcml0eS1sZ2J0cS1ib2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbm5pcy5jb20vYmFzZWxpbmUvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtcGxhbi10ZW5uaXMtcG9pbnQtbG9va3MtdG8tZ3Jvdy10aGUtZ2FtZS10aHJvdWdoLWl0cy1leHBhbmRpbmctYnVzaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Development Plan,"The 2022 US Open set several firsts.

I recently came across the QOD from June 11 2013 which discussed hauntings at some of the casino/hotels. As we approach the Halloween season can you tell me if there have been any recent sightings at these hotels and have there been any new sightings in places not previously listed? I know the Apache Hotel at Binion's has been using this as a selling point to get people to stay there.

A:

That QoD from nearly 10 years ago described sightings at primarily Luxor but also Bally's Bellagio Circus Circus Flamingo Planet Hollywood Plaza and Whiskey Pete's. You can read them here.

This was a challenging update (in more ways than one); PR departments aren't normally too enthusiastic to promote ghosts on their properties. But we did unearth so to speak a few new stories.

Here are a couple courtesy of the Haunted Vegas Tour & Ghost Hunt.

The tour visits Fox Ridge Park in Henderson where the ghost of a young boy is sometimes seen riding the swing set. Tourists who have visited it recently have taken photos of the swing set that when developed showed either a shadow on the swing or orbs in its immediate vicinity.

Another venue popular with the paranormal is Bally‚Äôs Las Vegas presently being converted to a Horseshoe. It's most famous as being the second of three MGM Grand hotels the one that was the tragic site of the 1980 fire that took more than 80 lives. A veteran Bally‚Äôs/MGM dealer recently shared with the tour that she'd been dealing blackjack when a nearby table erupted as though somebody had hit a big win. She looked up and recognized ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù a dealer who'd died in the fire still wearing the same uniform. Shaken she looked down at her cards for a moment and ‚Äî when she looked up again ‚Äî the table was empty.

If you want to do some DIY ghost-hunting you can rub elbows with spirits at the Mob Museum. Staffers there believe the former courthouse is haunted perhaps because it's now filled with the bric-a-brac of murder and mayhem.

At MGM Grand according to Vegas.com ‚ÄúThe most chilling ghostly encounter is an elderly woman who is said to occupy a bank of slot machines on the casino floor. She calmly plays two games at once as her dress engulfs her in flames. If approached she disappears.‚Äù

We also heard that the Westgate is ""filled with the spiritual presence of Elvis Presley"" its most famous headliner when it opened as the International. If true Elvis might not have left the building after all.

Finally one venue that could be expected to host apparitions or otherworldly sightings has been noticeably lacking in reports of such. The Ghostbar on the 55th floor of the Palms is from all indications mercifully free of its spectral namesakes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzE4L2J1c2luZXNzL2RyZWFtLWxpdmVzLWZpZWxkcy1ob3Blcy1yZXZpdmUtdGhvcm91Z2hicmVkLWhvcnNlLXJhY2luZy1oYXJkd2ljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A dream lives on. Fields hopes to revive thoroughbred horse racing in Hardwick.,"The self-described horse enthusiast poured millions into Suffolk Downs ‚Äî New England‚Äôs last thoroughbred horse track ‚Äî only to watch its future evaporate when state gaming regulators in 2014 awarded the sole Greater Boston casino license to rival Wynn Resorts. As racing ended at Suffolk Downs in 2019 Fields and his Suffolk Downs partners set their sights on the other side of the state in Great Barrington but ran into local resistance. Then Fields teamed up with Kingsbury health clubs founder Armand Janjigian to advance a track proposal in Sturbridge. No dice: Town meeting voters turned that one down last year.

Developer Richard Fields likes to explain his quixotic quest for a thoroughbred racetrack in Massachusetts with sailing terms not equestrian ones: You need to keep tacking to the left and then to the right to catch the wind.

Might Fields be finally rounding to the finish line? He sure thinks so now that he has found a community he believes is ready to embrace his dream.

He has teamed up with Robin Kalaidjian a horse breeder who is married to Janjigian to build a mile-long turf track in Hardwick a farming town in Central Massachusetts about 25 miles west of Worcester. At a joint planning board and selectmen meeting last week the group presented its vision to establish the Commonwealth Equine and Agricultural Center at the 360-acre Great Meadowbrook Farm a former dairy farm that‚Äôs still used for cultivating hay. If all goes according to plan the sounds of thundering hooves might be heard in these quiet fields off Upper Church Street as soon as next September.

It would be a tribute to Fields‚Äôs tenacity and willpower. It would also be a tribute to his efforts to make sports betting legal in Massachusetts. Fields knows full well that a horse track isn‚Äôt viable without additional revenue from gambling. For Fields this would come from sports betting at a kiosk on race days and year-round via a mobile app.

To try and make that happen Fields has emerged as one of the state‚Äôs biggest lobbying forces on Beacon Hill during the past year. His Commonwealth Racing LLC spent $180000 in Massachusetts in the first six months of 2022 according to newly released figures from Secretary of State William Galvin‚Äôs office. That tied Fields with Eversource Energy in fourth place in corporate lobbying spending behind major health care employers Mass General Brigham Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Beth Israel Lahey Health. It‚Äôs unusual to see a small outfit such as Commonwealth Racing up so high in these rankings but it underscores how important this dream is for Fields.

Commonwealth Racing first showed up as one of the state‚Äôs top lobbying spenders during the second half of 2021 after Fields hired former House Ways and Means chairman Brian Dempsey‚Äôs firm Dempsey Associates. Fields also has three other well-connected firms on retainer: Smith Costello & Crawford; Charles Stefanini Consulting and Finneran Global Strategies.

The main goal: to get sports betting passed into law. On that front in the final hours of the Legislature‚Äôs regular formal sessions this summer the House and Senate reached a deal. It was one of the last major bills to be sent to Governor Charlie Baker for his signature.

The new law requires licenses to be made available to operators of live horse races. The last such business in Massachusetts is Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville a track that features harness races with standardbreds pulling two-wheeled carts. Former track operators with simulcasting licenses ‚Äî the Suffolk Downs partnership of which Fields is still a member and Raynham Park owned by the Carney family ‚Äï also can get brick-and-mortar betting licenses as can the state‚Äôs two resort casinos MGM Springfield and Wynn‚Äôs Encore Boston Harbor.

Sports betting might bring several million dollars a year to the proposed horse track in Hardwick. Helpful yes. But not a giant windfall either.

There‚Äôs another subsidy that Fields and his allies are eyeing: the state‚Äôs racehorse development fund which is backed by a sliver of casino taxes set aside to help support the horse industry when the Legislature legalized casinos in 2011. Most of this money is to be used for race prizes. With no live racing the pot for thoroughbreds has swollen to nearly $22 million.

Fields said he‚Äôs close to reaching a purchase-and-sale-agreement with the owners of the farm in Hardwick. There are other hurdles to clear such as planning board approval and a race-meet license from the state Gaming Commission.

To win over residents Fields and his team pledged to build an ‚Äúagritourism destination‚Äù that honors the town‚Äôs farming heritage. No more than 20 race festival days would be held each year and even fewer would be held initially. On-site gambling would only take place during race meets at temporary kiosks. Eventually Fields and Kalaidjian hope to operate a thoroughbred breeding center and retirement home as well as a farm-to-table restaurant and a bed-and-breakfast inn. These businesses would create 25 to 50 permanent jobs and at least $500000 in new annual taxes for Hardwick ‚Äî an 8 percent increase to the 3000-person town‚Äôs current revenue.

Can they pull it off? Paul Umbrello executive director of the New England Horsemen‚Äôs Benevolent and Protective Association is banking on it. He jokes that he slept like a baby after the meeting with town officials last week because he saw little to no opposition this time. These races will support horse farms which in turn support hay farms which together he said help preserve the open space and rural character of many New England towns. He doesn‚Äôt have any data about how many farms the region has lost to development in recent years. But from his vantage point on the board of the Mass. Thoroughbred Breeders Association he can track these numbers: Membership is down to fewer than 50 roughly a third of what it was just three years ago.

It was Umbrello who clued Fields into the availability of Great Meadowbrook Farm. Fields said he visited last year and fell in love with the site and the town.

No one said chasing the wind would be easy. But with this property in Hardwick Fields is betting all that zigzagging will prove to be worthwhile in the end.

The Stockholm-headquartered firm used an official press release to detail that its latest high-volatility advance features a woodland theme and sees the debut of a new protagonist in Mr Beastwood. The innovator also stated that this character has been ‚Äòpackaged up in gorgeous graphics with monsters and beasts‚Äô and could well be rolled out ‚Äòacross other games in the future‚Äô.

Forerunner foundation:

Established in 2011 Quickspin disclosed that Beastwood features its new Endless Reels mechanic based on preceding technology from 2017‚Äôs Wins of Fortune video slot and features made popular by the Wild Chase: Tokyo Go game of three years ago. The firm moreover proclaimed that the title ‚Äòpromises to be an immediate cult classic‚Äô as it is ideal for those online casino players who are ‚Äòlooking for big wins and big production games‚Äô.

Exciting enhancement:

Acquired by British omni-channel gaming software and services innovator Playtech in March of 2016 Quickspin divulged that Beastwood starts with four reels and should prove especially popular with players in European markets such as Sweden and the United Kingdom. However the pioneer revealed that this excitement soon increases as new reels are added via improved wins with double multipliers boosting any rewards earned from the fifth reel and every third reel afterward.

Variance variety:

Quickspin asserted that Beastwood additionally comes complete with a trio of selectable return to player ratios in 87% 94% and 96% so as to allow iGaming operators to post ‚Äòhealthy margins in any market‚Äô. It explained that all of this is joined by a ten-attempt free spins feature for those who manage to amass four scatter icons alongside substituting Golden X Wild symbols and a bonus buy attraction.

Inspired investigation:

Clint Andersson from Quickspin used the press release to cheekily declare that the theme behind Beastwood came as a result of ‚Äòextensive research‚Äô that showed ‚Äòmonsters usually live in the woods‚Äô. The innovator furthermore pronounced that this helped the firm to ‚Äòcome up with the name of the game as monsters plus the woods equals Beastwood‚Äô to simultaneously create ‚Äòa spectacular name for the protagonist of our new intellectual property‚Äô.

Read a statement from Andersson‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWe set out to create a new mechanic for Quickspin so we wanted a new character to shoulder this. Since the game maths focus on locking symbols in long chains of ways we came up with the idea of a protagonist using a big harpoon with a gold chain to trap the monster symbols on the reels which worked out beautifully well with the game mechanic.‚Äù",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9saWZlLWlzLWJlYXV0aWZ1bC0yMDIyLWRheS0yLTEyMzUxNDA4ODYv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlsbGJvYXJkLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9tdXNpYy1uZXdzL2xpZmUtaXMtYmVhdXRpZnVsLTIwMjItZGF5LTItMTIzNTE0MDg4Ni9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Life Is Beautiful: Gorillaz Lorde & More Best Moments From Day 2,"Day two of Life Is Beautiful the three-day music art comedy and food festival that enraptures 18 blocks of downtown Las Vegas produced electrifying performances from Gorillaz Lorde Coi Leray Bob Moses and Orange County comedy bros Chad and JT.

Saturday‚Äôs (Sept. 17) theme of the day-to-night gathering of 170000 attendees seemed to be ultimate fan interaction as many took their magic from the stage to the crowd.

The day kicked off with Chad Kroeger and JT Parr from the Netflix hit Chad & JT Go Deep spreading their stoke inside the Kicker Comedy Club. Life Is Beautiful‚Äôs comedy platform has flourished since its introduction in 2016 welcoming the likes of Michelle Wolf Bob the Drag Queen Sam Jay and Nico Santos. Occupying the first performance slot of the day Chad and JT packed an impressive audience into the well air-conditioned theater a pleasant break from the 90-degree temperatures outside. With a moral to every story Chad and JT eulogized their recently deceased friend Froader prophesizing that he died from lack of stoke in his life. Their message in this tale was ‚Äústoke or croak‚Äù encouraging the audience to tap into the natural stoke life force that exists in Las Vegas. A low-fi PowerPoint presentation suggested to take advantage of Vegas‚Äô many neural nutrients including hedonism bottle service pool parties gambling and party drugs to avoid ending up like Froader and croaking from lack of stoking. After passing Froader‚Äôs urn around the crowd they promised they would take him out into the festival for an after-life stoke sesh. Later video showed them with the urn at the Fremont stage dancing with Froader‚Äôs remains while enjoying a DJ set.

First up on the Downtown stage was Alexander 23 who delivered an outstanding performance in one of the toughest slots of the day. Their eye-catching graphic introduced them as the Beatles with the small print reading: just kidding it‚Äôs Alexander 23. The light pop sound was the perfect way to transition in the crowd undoubtedly weary from the previous night‚Äôs festivities which had crowds exiting after 1 a.m. Alexander 23 made a big sound that far surpassed what‚Äôs expected of a trio. Giving his seasoning since breaking onto the scene in 2019 he could be the new king of sob rock.

Having made a big impact on 2022‚Äôs festival circuit Bob Moses got the coveted sunset time slot on the Downtown stage. Electrifying the growing crowd ‚ÄúTearing Me Up‚Äù sounded especially melodic as the warm breeze set in welcoming the desert night. If ever there was a golden hour band ‚Äî it‚Äôs Bob Moses.

Later in the evening Lorde was pretty in pink and showing off her incredible abs in a strappy spandex bralet top and pants. She reminisced about how nervous she was playing the festival back in 2017. Her stairway-to-the sun-themed set which has traveled the festival scene with her this year is a visual stunner. Kicking off with ‚ÄúThe Path‚Äú and ‚ÄúHomemade Dynamite‚Äù her growth as an artist shone brightly. Encouraging the crowd to ‚Äúdance for our 15-year-old selves tonight‚Äù she bounced into ‚ÄúRibs.‚Äù

About her evolution she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 25 now I‚Äôm blonde now and I‚Äôm wearing a hot pink outfit. We all change we all go through phases and I love to celebrate all those phases I think they‚Äôre all magical‚Äù noting that when she played five years ago she was suffering from major stage nerves.

She danced between ethereal and emotional literally and musically. ‚ÄúRoyals‚Äù drew a thunderous response from the crowd and she finished with ‚ÄúSolar Power‚Äú ascending back up to her muse. ‚ÄúThis song was written in a wet bikini after a long day at the beach‚Äù she said giving the crowd the ultimate scene-setting reference.

Also returning from the 2017 lineup Damon Albarn and Gorillaz released an energy on the crowd that has been unmatched so far during the weekend. Raising his arms like a deity over his disciples Albarn packed what felt like three shows into one. From ‚ÄúCracker Island‚Äù to ‚ÄúMLS‚Äù joined up with fellow festival performer JPEGMafia to ‚ÄúOn Melancholy Hill‚Äù it was hit after hit. Gorillaz are always several steps above everyone else.

Albarn masterfully jumped between instruments and then parted the crowd like the seas and went for a stroll among the people.

All four virtual Gorillaz members were present their visuals timed perfectly to the music as well as guns police badges golden Xanax bars and the like.

Albarn loves to travel with a crowd and Life Is Beautiful was no exception. ‚ÄúD√©sol√©‚Äù brought Fatoumata Diawara to the stage and her vocals ripped up the crowd as they stood at attention. De La Soul‚Äôs Pos appeared for ‚ÄúFeel Good Inc‚Äù and it all closed up with ‚ÄúClint Eastwood.‚Äù Donning a Luffy straw summer hat he plucked from an audience member Albarn blew his large horn to signify a job well done. ‚ÄúI only blow this horn when s‚Äî‚Äôs good. And s‚Äî‚Äôs good tonight‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou are f‚Äîing lovely. Don‚Äôt ever forget what just happened.‚Äù

Over at the Bacardi stage Alessia Cara ‚Äî joined by Blue Man Group‚Äî reminisced about her 2015 Life Is Beautiful moment remarking that it was the first festival she ever played. Then Gryffin and Kygo kept Bacardi packed until closing. Kygo brought out Gryffin during his set and they performed their new song ‚ÄúWoke Up In Love.‚Äù Gryffin killed it on the electric guitar. Kygo known for his popular covers took a spin on Tina Turner White Stripes and Jefferson Airplane.‚Äù

While both Gryffin and Kygo have residencies at Wynn Las Vegas the festival gave their fans a chance to see them outside of the club and to touch the under-21 crowd.

On the Fremont stage Marc Rebillet closed the night joined by Blue Man Group.

BACARD√ç Rum welcomed headlining artist and famed Puerto Rican singer and rapper Farruko to the stage. Fans flocked to CASA BACARD√ç to see Farruko perform his greatest hits like ‚ÄúPepas‚Äù and ‚ÄúRelaci√≥n.‚Äù

A fan-favorite moment of the day was the interactive McDonald‚Äôs ‚ÄòGolden Access‚Äô experience with an appearance from Coi Leray. Leray chilled out in the McDonald‚Äôs ‚ÄòGolden Access‚Äô VIP Suite surrounded by French fries and McFlurries ‚Äî not a bad way to enjoy a music festival. Leray told Billboard that she hopes to one day have her own meal at the Golden Arches as many of her contemporaries have recently done. She also shared that a second album is in progress and will drop in the coming months. A studio drop-in still had her giddy: ‚ÄúTwo weeks ago I was in the studio with Missy Elliott. And she came to the session with me for four hours. She‚Äôs such an icon. She‚Äôs a legend. She gave me so many pointers. And I look up to her in so many ways not only [in] music but fashion.‚Äù Later in the evening Leray bubbled up the Fremont stage with a set to appeal to her TikTok crew. The rapper‚Äôs best take was ‚ÄúPush Start‚Äù her song with French Montana and her new song ‚ÄúFly S‚Äî‚Äù closing with vital sensation ‚ÄúTwinnem.‚Äù

Day two proved once again that performers thrive under the night sky in Las Vegas upping the energy to match the electric cityscape.

These are the 5 cheapest states to charge up at home,"Are you in the market for a new car? Have you considered an EV?

Energy Innovation a ‚Äúnonpartisan energy and climate policy firm delivering research and analysis‚Äù published a May 2022 study that found that it is cheaper to buy and own a new electric vehicle than it is a comparable gas model over the vehicle‚Äôs lifetime. This makes sense as EVs require little or no gas less maintenance and feature greater average longevity than internal combustion engines.

The cost of owning an electric vehicle

The issue is that most people are concerned about the up-front cost of buying an EV. With prices ranging from $20000 to $80000 starting MSRPs with no markups sticker shock is almost inevitable. The majority of car purchasers don‚Äôt pay for a car out the door though. Financing will occur over two to six years during which time you will be saving money when you don‚Äôt have to purchase gas pay for oil changes and more. How much you can pocket will vary on gasoline prices where you live. The cost to charge an electric car is also going to vary a good deal from state to state as are EV incentives insurance rates sales tax and other expenses.

Which states are best for electric vehicle owners?

Energy Innovation conducted its study across auto classes and types in order to elicit a fair comparison and contrast of ownership costs between EVs and comparable gasoline models. The broad sampling across the marketplace included the 2022 Hyundai Kona vs. the Kona EV the 2022 Hyundai Kona Limited vs. the Limited EV 2022 Ford F-150 XL vs. the electric Lightning Pro the 2022 Kia Niro EX Premium vs. the electric EX premium the 2022 Volvo XC40 Inscription vs. the Recharge Plus and the 2022 Nissan Versa S Xtronic CVT vs. the all-electric Leaf.

The results were not surprising: estimates suggested that the greatest savings will occur in states where driving distances are typically longer and/or commutes are more congested and gas prices tend to outpace average national rates:

California

Colorado

Florida

New Jersey

New York

The states with the most incentives to buy an electric auto unsurprisingly aligned with the states with the most potential savings with a few potential outliers. New Jersey tends to lead the pack. There is a $5000 rebate for anyone who buys or leases an EV and the government waives its almost 7% sales tax on electric car purchases. In California qualifying vehicles (specifically not Rivian or Tesla) earn a $2000 rebate. New York state proffers the same discount for EVs. Colorado offers a $2500 state tax credit that will reduce to $2000 in 2023. Leases qualify for $1500 rebate. There is also an Xcel Energy EV incentive with $5500 in upfront rebates available for new EVs and $3000 for used models.

Outside of these opportunities Connecticut Massachusetts Delaware and a host of other states encourage EV purchases with various incentives. One of the best options is in Oregon where buyers not only qualify for up to $2500 in rebates for the purchase or lease of a qualifying new EV but low- to moderate-income residents can save an additional $5000 on cars that align to requirements. Savvy readers might also note that Oregon does not have a state sales tax ‚Äî a hefty savings when you‚Äôre spending tens of thousands of dollars on a new car.

As to the model that Energy Innovation found that would save the most money across the board charts show that the electric versions of the Kona SEL and the F-150 are cheaper to own in every state in the union with an average 8.5% and 12.3% savings across the board.

But perhaps most importantly they rely on you for healthcare‚Äîand that includes regular vet visits. ""One year in a dog's life can be equivalent to five to seven years of a human's life"" says Heather Berst DVM veterinarian and medical lead with Zoetis. ""So a lot can change in that year."" But if your dog seems otherwise healthy it can be easy to think that a checkup isn't necessary. According to veterinarians though you should never skip your dog's annual appointment. Read on to learn the most important reasons why this once-a-year vet visit is so important. Don't have one in the books? Schedule it ASAP to ensure your pup lives its happiest healthiest and longest life.

READ THIS NEXT: The 7 Best Dogs for Beginners Vets Say.

1 Your dog needs to stay up-to-date on vaccines.

Vaccines are equally as important for dogs as they are for humans. ""Dogs need to attend their annual vet visit because annual vaccines protect against harmful and potentially fatal diseases which all dogs are at risk for"" says Berst. ""Some diseases such as leptospirosis and rabies can even be transmitted to people."" And with many folks traveling and socializing with their dogs more than ever Berst notes it's especially important to vaccinate your dog against diseases like bordetella or kennel cough and canine influenza. ""Your veterinarian will be able to talk to you about which vaccines make the most sense to protect your dog and keep them healthy"" Berst adds.

2 Your dog needs a stool screening.

While veterinarians vary in how often they recommend specific screenings a stool screening is common at many annual appointments. ""It looks for any parasites abnormal bacteria or cells including blood cells in the fecal sample"" says Sarah Wooten DVM veterinary expert at Pumpkin Pet Insurance. ""This is important because dogs can often carry occult meaning hidden infestations with intestinal parasites including hookworms roundworms coccidia and giardia."" Because some of those parasites are infectious to people you'll want to ensure your dog is worm-free on a regular basis. ""In addition if there are any problems with the intestines then a fecal screening can pick up problems early before they become bigger problems"" says Wooten.

3 Your dog needs its heart checked.

An annual listen with the trusty stethoscope can help your pup stay in top health. ""Your veterinarian will listen to your dog's heart and can hear things like heart murmurs or irregular heartbeats"" says Berst. ""These can be fairly common as dogs age and getting them on medication can help keep them healthy longer."" See it's all about preventative care.

4 Your dog needs a urine check.

This is a test that may not occur at every annual wellness screening but should happen regularly. For older dogs it's suggested each year. ""This test will screen for infection and the possibility of bladder stones"" says Jamie Whittenburg DVM lead veterinarian at Senior Tail Waggers. ""It also will test for glucose in the urine which can signal that the dog has diabetes mellitus and the urinalysis will give an indication of the dog's kidney function.""ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

5 Your dog needs a blood test.

Many vets will do blood work annually on dogs over the age of six. ""These tests will screen the red and white blood cells looking for anemia infections blood cancers and other illnesses"" says Whittenburg. ""Additionally organ function tests will evaluate the functioning of the dog's thyroid liver kidneys and pancreas as well as blood sugar proteins cholesterol and electrolytes.""

6 Your dog can be assessed for discomfort.

In particular for osteoarthritis the early signs of which ""can be subtle but can still cause your dog pain"" says Berst. ""Your veterinarian can examine your dog for signs of it and talk to you about what to look for at home."" There are medications and other methods of managing this pain for dogs so you'll want to ensure you're aware of the issue. That way you can make your pup as comfortable as possible.

7 Your dog needs its teeth assessed.

Since there's no such thing as a doggie dentist this task falls under your veterinarian's domain. ""Dogs can live longer and feel better with good dental health"" says Berst. ""At the exam your veterinarian will check for gingivitis plaque and tarter."" They may recommend a dental cleaning if they believe it will benefit your pup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbml0b3IuY28udWcvdWdhbmRhL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9mYXJtaW5nL2FsbC15b3UtbWlzc2VkLWF0LWZhcm0tY2xpbmljLS0zOTUxOTky0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All you missed at Farm Clinic | Monitor,"The hunger for agricultural knowledge was evident at the 29th edition of the Seeds of Gold Farm Clinic held at the National Livestock Resources Research Institute (NaLIRRI) at Nakyesasa in Namulonge last week on Saturday.

Farmers started to arrive at the venue as early as 8am. Some came on motorbikes others rode in taxis while a good number arrived in personal vehicles. The farmers ‚Äì young and old ‚Äì came from as far as Mbarara Bushenyi Luweero Wakiso and Kampala districts among others with the weather characterised by light showers providing a perfect environment for learning.

Farm Clinic goers learn about management of calf pens.

To offer the invaluable agricultural lessons were experts from NaLIRRI Zoetis NSSF Bank of Uganda and East Africa Seeds.

The training

John Musisi from Gayaza was among the attendees. His aim was to learn how to be a successful dairy farmer. ‚ÄúI have been growing bananas and I wanted to begin rearing dairy cows. I was to start last year but I faced logistical challenge‚Äù he said.

Amon Musinguzi a farmer with three cows from Busega wanted to learn how to improve milk production.

‚ÄúI have been having challenges on silage-making. From my two lactating cows I just get five litres‚Äù she said.

Dr Moses Mwesigwa the programme leader in dairy research at the institute told the farmers that to start dairy farming one must ensure that they have adequate feeds know the right breed as well as have proper housing units.

‚ÄúOn feeds you must have a budget for the whole year. One cow will require at least four tonnes for a whole year. If hay it needs five tonnes 10-15 tonnes of silage and two acres of pasture. A drier place requires four acres‚Äù he said.

Dr Mwesigwa also said that cows require balanced diet that contains dry matter and protein such as lucerne to increase milk production.

Good maize for use to make silage should be at milk stage which means it has higher protein content.

He isolated sorghum and maize as the best fodder for making silage. NaLIRRI has released a number of seed varieties for pasture and fodder for various ecological zones. For instance there is silver desmodium for medium and highlands and green leaf is for drier lowlands.

Felix Muhumuza a dairy farmer wondered why his cow did not show any signs of pregnancy yet it had been served last August.

‚ÄúThis problem might be caused by overfeeding which sometimes causes the walls of ovaries to have layers of fat. But get a vet to check the animals‚Äù advised Allen Molly a dairy expert.

Understanding farmers‚Äô psychology

A question arose about some cows‚Äô tendency to retain their placenta after giving birth. The expert said possible reasons could be its genetic make-up heat stress or the calf is too big. She advised farmers to look for bulls that have a history of siring small to medium calves.

Dairy experts warned farmers against ‚Äòbribing‚Äô a cow before milking it by giving it dairy meal. They emphasised the idea should be rewarding cows for giving the owner milk and not vice versa.
